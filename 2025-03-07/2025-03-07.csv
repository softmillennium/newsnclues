US President Donald Trump said Friday that he finds it ""easier"" to deal with Russia than with Ukraine in efforts to end the war in the pro-Western country -- and that he trusts Vladimir Putin.

""I believe him,"" he said in a televised press conference at the White House.

""I'm finding it more difficult frankly to deal with Ukraine and they don't have the cards,"" he said. ""It may be easier dealing with Russia.""

Trump has pushed Ukraine hard, as it struggles to fend off Russian invasion after three years of war, and has ordered a pause in US military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv in order to apply more pressure.

Despite threatening new sanctions on Russia earlier Friday, Trump said he understood why Putin's forces had inflicted a massive bombing campaign across Ukraine overnight.

""I actually think he's doing what anybody in that position would be doing that right now,"" Trump said.

""I've always had a good relationship with Putin. And you know, he wants to end the war,"" he said.

""I think he's going to be more generous than he has to be, and that's pretty good. That means a lot of good things.""

He said Zelensky -- who has been pressing for Western security guarantees before he agrees to a ceasefire with Russia -- risks losing all US involvement.

""I don't know that they want to settle. If they don't want to settle, we're out of there because we want them to settle. I'm doing it to stop death,"" Trump said.

PARIS (AP) — The disposal of what Paris police called an “excessively dangerous” unexploded World War II bomb caused hours of transportation chaos Friday on rail and road networks in the French capital, including the suspension of high-speed train links with London and Brussels.

Having moved the bomb into a hole, disposal experts managed to unscrew and then destroy its fuse, “like you see in the movies,” said Christophe Pezron, who heads the Paris police laboratory that includes bomb disposal services. He said that the half-ton British-made bomb could have caused major damage had it exploded after workers inadvertently dug it up with an earthmover. 

But the police operation that made the bomb safe before it was then taken away triggered major disruption for hundreds of thousands of rail travelers and motorists. 

The bomb was dug up near train tracks north of Paris, forcing a shutdown of the rail network serving Gare du Nord, France’s busiest station. A portion of the A1 highway — a major road artery into northern Paris — and sections of the capital’s always-busy beltway were also closed while police disposal officers worked.

“We’re delighted and relieved that all this has come to an end,” Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot was able to finally declare Friday afternoon — 12 hours after the bomb-disposal police were first called — as roads reopened and rail services were progressively being restored.

The minister said that almost 500 trains had been canceled, impacting around 600,000 people at Gare du Nord that serves not only Paris’ northern suburbs and northern France, but also international destinations in the U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.




“All of the northern part of our country was paralyzed,” Tabarot said.

Eurostar, the operator of high-speed trains through the Channel Tunnel that joins England with the European continent, said that normal traffic would resume Saturday between Paris and Brussels and Paris and London, after Friday’s full day of cancellations. Hundreds of commuter, regional and high-speed train services between Paris and its suburbs and towns and cities in northern France were also canceled.

Gabrielle Cotton, a tourist from the U.S. state of Missouri, was traveling by train from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Paris, but got no further than Brussels.

“I heard the girl next to me — her parents called her and said that there was a World War II bomb found in the train station,” she said. “They told us we had to get off in Brussels.” 

Retired Parisian Michel Garrot also found himself stranded with his wife in the Belgian capital.

“There’s no solution. We’re going to call the hotel and stay one more day. And change our train ticket,” he said.

At Eurostar’s hub in London, St. Pancras International station, passengers scrambled for alternatives. Fridays are invariably busy with thousands of weekend travelers. Paris-bound passengers were advised to try taking trains to Lille in northern France, or fly.

Bride-to-be Charlotte Liddell had a bachelorette party — her own — to get to in Paris and wanted to join friends already in the French capital.

“It’s the hen do without the hen!” she said. “We’re very upset, but it’s so out of our control.”

Eurostar said that it “sincerely apologizes for the disruption and understands the inconvenience this may cause.”

Workers laboring overnight on a bridge-replacement project spotted the rust-eaten, dirt-covered bomb before dawn Friday, after it was found by an earth-moving machine at a depth of about two meters (six feet), between train tracks to the north of Gare du Nord, national rail operator SNCF said.

Bomb disposal services arrived within the hour and set up a 200-meter security perimeter, later extended to 500 meters. Pezron, the police lab director, said that the bomb could have exploded had it been struck accidentally with workers’ tools or shaken too vigorously.

Morning rush-hour travelers arriving at Gare du Nord to catch trains were greeted by bright-red signs warning of disruptions, lines of passengers seeking information and ticket exchanges, and barriers blocking access to the Eurostar terminal.

The Gare du Nord habitually hosts 700,000 travelers per day, making it the busiest rail hub in both France and Europe, the SNCF says. 

Bombs left over from the battles fought in France and its skies in both world wars are regularly unearthed, even more than a century later, although it’s rare that they cause such widespread disruption in people-packed Paris.

“It’s the fourth one we’ve found in this area since 2019,” Pezron said.

In World War II, Allied forces’ bombing raids flattened towns and cities in the Normandy region northwest of Paris, but didn’t wreak destruction on the same scale on the French capital. Still, factories, train lines and other targets in and around Paris were bombed repeatedly, killing more than 3,600 people and wounding thousands more, according to city archives.

The Interior Ministry says that since World War II’s end in 1945, disposal teams have defused 700,000 air-dropped bombs and made safe nearly 50 million mines, shells and other explosive devices.

Days after spat with Zelensky, Trump says he's considering ""large-scale"" sanctions and tariffs against Russia, until a ceasefire and peace agreement is reached with Ukraine.

This turn takes place after a wave of strikes at night on Ukraine.

He writes: ""Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.

""To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!""

Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another in order to stop them from breaking international laws or act aggressively.

The United States, United Kingdom and Europe, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan have imposed more than 21,000 sanctions on Russia since its invaded Ukraine three years ago.

In January, after assuming office, Trump had warned of tariffs and more sanctions if Putin did not end the war.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Washington: Peace talks between the US and Ukraine fell through on Friday after its two leaders were locked in an unprecedented clash at the Oval Office on Friday.

Minutes after the acrimonious exchange, US President Donald Trump accused his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky of disrespecting the US and indicated he had called off the talks.

“I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Minutes earlier, Zelensky and Trump clashed repeatedly, with the Ukrainian urging Trump to be cautious with Russia. The two leaders met in the Oval Office prior to an event at which they were expected to sign a deal for US participation in Ukraine’s mineral industry. But Zelensky openly challenged Trump over his softer approach toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Zelensky pushed back on Trump’s claims that Ukrainian cities have been reduced to rubble by three years of war. Trump stressed that Putin wants to make a deal.

“You are gambling with World War Three,” Trump told Zelensky at one point, urging him to be more thankful.

Vice President JD Vance interjected that it was disrespectful of him to come to the Oval Office to litigate his position, a point Trump agreed with.

“People are dying... you’re running low on soldiers,” Trump told Zelensky as their meeting degenerated into a shouting match. Trump told Zelensky he either needed to make a deal or the United States was out.

Zelensky urged Trump to make “no compromises with a killer,” referring to Russia’s leader. Zelensky, who gained billions of dollars’ worth of US weaponry and moral support from the Biden administration for its fight against Russia, is facing a sharply different attitude from Trump. Trump wants to quickly wind down the three-year war, improve ties with Russia and recoup money spent to support Ukraine.

Trump had welcomed Zelensky on his arrival at the White House before they headed for talks, lunch and then a joint press conference where they were to sign the agreement.

“I hope I’m going to be remembered as a peacemaker,” Trump said.

Trump told Zelensky that his soldiers have been unbelievably brave and that the United States wants to see an end to the fighting and the money put to “different kinds of use like rebuilding.”

Trump has adopted a much less committed stance toward European security, a change in tone that has sent shockwaves across Europe and stoked fears in Kyiv and among its allies that it could be forced into a peace deal that favours Russia.

The agreement negotiated in recent days would open Ukraine’s vast mineral wealth to the United States but does not include explicit American security guarantees for Ukraine, a disappointment for Kyiv. Trump says the presence of Americans in business would serve as a form of guarantee.

How much the deal would be worth to the United States is not spelled out. Trump has said he expects to gain hundreds of billions of dollars. Zelensky has said he would not sign an agreement that would put his country in debt for generations. The previous day, Trump met UK PM Keir Starmer, who on Friday decided Britain will host Ukrainian President Zelensky and over a dozen European leaders in London on Sunday to discuss security guarantees for Kyiv in a potential ceasefire with Russia.

The letter appeared to have been addressed to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. (File)

US President Donald Trump said Friday that he has written to Iran, pressing for talks on preventing the development of nuclear weapons and warning it faces possible military action if not.

Iran's foreign minister told AFP on Friday that the country would not negotiate so long as the United States applies ""maximum pressure,"" but he was not responding directly to Trump's letter.

Tehran's mission to the United Nations told AFP that ""we have not received such a letter so far."" It was unclear by what means Trump's missive was transmitted to Tehran.

Trump's outreach marks a departure at least in tone from the hardline stance that marked his first term and could cause a rift with close ally Israel, which last year carried out bombing strikes inside Iran.

Trump said he wrote a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei telling him that a negotiated solution ""will be a lot better for Iran.""

""I've written them a letter, saying I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily it's going to be a terrible thing for them,"" Trump told Fox Business in a clip broadcast Friday.

""You can't let them have a nuclear weapon.""

A landmark 2015 deal negotiated under former president Barack Obama -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.

It fell apart after Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2018 in his first presidential term and reimposed sweeping sanctions.

Tehran adhered to the deal until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments. 

Trump, who returned to the White House in January, said he was reinstating his ""maximum pressure"" policy of sanctions against Iran but that he was doing so only reluctantly. 

He has since sidelined officials from his first term associated with his Iran policy, as Trump accuses Washington's foreign policy establishment of encouraging war.

Trump's brash billionaire confidant Elon Musk was reported to have met Iran's ambassador to the United Nations shortly after the election to deliver a message that Trump wants calm and diplomacy.

Iran warns against US threats

Iran has been cautious about a return to diplomacy since the collapse of the JCPOA.

""We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AFP on Friday.

Speaking on the sidelines of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Jeddah, Araghchi also warned that Iran's nuclear program ""cannot be destroyed through military operations.""

""This is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed,"" he said.

Araghchi was a key negotiator of the JCPOA, brokered by a then reformist government. 

But Khamenei, 85, is the ultimate decision-maker in Iran's clerical system and has pointed to the JCPOA as proof that the United States is not trustworthy.

Trump's outreach comes as Iran faces challenges not seen since the 1979 Islamic revolution. 

Israel devastated Iranian air defenses and has also pounded two militant movements allied with Iran's clerical state: Hamas, which carried out the unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and also Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Iran's main regional ally, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, fell in December to Sunni Islamist-led fighters.

Iran has consistently denied claims that it is pursuing nuclear weapons.

Last month, United Nations atomic agency chief Rafael Grossi said Iran was enriching uranium at 60 percent -- ""almost weapon level"" -- and that the 2015 deal was an ""empty shell"" that was ""no longer fit for purpose.""

Russia launched a ""massive"" drone and missile attack on Ukrainian energy facilities Friday, as President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed calls for a mutual halt to aerial attacks on critical infrastructure.

The call from Zelensky to halt aerial bombardments on energy facilities builds on growing rhetoric from Kyiv, Washington and Moscow on halting the war, now in its fourth year.

The Ukrainian leader said the first steps to establishing real peace should be stopping both Russian and Ukrainian aerial and naval attacks.

""Ukraine is ready to go the way of peace, and it is Ukraine that wants peace from the very first second of this war. The task is to force Russia to stop the war,"" he wrote in a post on social media.

The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched at least 58 missiles and nearly 200 drones, damaging energy facilities across the country from Kharkiv in the east to Ternopil in the west.

Firefighters were battling a blaze on streets lined with debris in the Kharkiv region, images released by the emergency services showed.

The Kremlin responded to earlier calls by Zelensky for a halt to aerial attacks by ruling out any temporary ceasefire in Ukraine.

Zelensky's allies abroad have voiced support for his truce proposal and on Friday Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who recently hosted the Ukrainian leader, also gave it his backing.

Air and sea truce

""We support the idea of establishing a ceasefire as soon as possible and stopping attacks in the air and at sea as a confidence-building measure between the parties,"" Erdogan told an online meeting.

The Russian defence ministry confirmed on Friday it had carried out ""precision"" strikes on energy facilities, claiming they support the Ukrainian military.

Russia is ""targeting facilities linked to Ukraine's military-industrial complex,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The Ukrainian air force said it had deployed French Mirage fighter jets -- delivered to Ukraine last month -- for the first time to repel the aerial onslaught.

The fighter jets along with air defence units shot down 34 of the missiles and 100 drones.

DTEK, the largest private energy supplier in Ukraine, said its facilities in the Black Sea region of Odesa were targeted for a fourth night in a row.

And it said that gas facilities in the central Poltava region had ""ceased operations"" after being struck in the overnight attack.

State gas company Naftogaz also said its production facilities were damaged, without giving details.

Authorities in at least five Ukrainian regions said Russia had targeted energy facilities.

The latest Russian air assault came after EU leaders, shaken by the prospect of US disengagement, agreed to boost the European bloc's defences.

US, Ukrainian officials to meet

And Washington said talks with Kyiv were back on track to secure a ceasefire with Moscow -- after a public falling out between President Donald Trump and Zelensky.

US and Ukrainian officials were expected to meet Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, a senior Kyiv official said, with Zelensky voicing hope for a ""meaningful meeting"".

Zelensky himself will travel to Saudi Arabia on Monday for talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

US envoy Steve Witkoff said he would speak to Ukrainian negotiators about an ""initial ceasefire"" with Russia and a ""framework"" for a longer agreement.

Ukraine's energy minister German Galushchenko said Russia was trying to ""hurt ordinary Ukrainians by shelling energy and gas production facilities"".

Eight people were wounded in a strike on Friday on Kharkiv, including a woman pulled from the rubble alive, city officials said.

Late Thursday, the Ukrainian emergency service also said ""critical infrastructure"" was damaged in an attack on the Odesa region in the south, with no injuries reported.

Missiles from Russia also struck a ""critical industrial facility"" overnight in the Ternopil region, governor Vyacheslav Negoda said.

President Donald Trump's administration said Friday it was cutting $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University over claims the institution stood by ""in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"" following anti-Israel protests.

Four government agencies announced in a statement ""the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.""

Trump said earlier this week that he would cut funding for schools that allow ""illegal protests,"" his latest threat to turn off the flow of federal money to the country's education system.

US campuses including Columbia's were rocked last year by student protests against Israel's war in Gaza following the October 7, 2023 attacks, which ignited accusations of anti-Semitism.

Friday's statement, issued by the US General Services Administration, said the cuts were the ""first round of action"" -- and that additional cancelations are expected to follow.

""Since October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses -- only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,"" said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.

""Universities must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding,"" she said.

""For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.""

The university did not respond to a request for comment.

As tensions between China and the United States ramp up - particularly after the US doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20 per cent - China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday called on New Delhi and Beijing to work together and ""take the lead in opposing hegemonism and power politics"".

Speaking after a National People's Congress meet, Mr Wang said ""making the dragon and elephant dance is the only right choice"". He also said, ""Supporting, instead of wearing each other down, and strengthening cooperation, instead of guarding (against) each other, is in our fundamental interests.""

He also declared that if Asia's two largest economies were to combine, the ""democratisation of international relations and development and strengthening of 'Global South' will have a brighter future"".

India has not yet responded to this statement.

However, on Thursday Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said the Indian government is working with China to plot ""a more predictable and positive course"" for the relationship, measures for which will include resumption of pilgrimages to sites under China's control, direct flights, and exchange of journalists.



Today, in a response to a question about evolving ties with Delhi, Mr Wang also pointed to ""positive strides"" over the past year, referring to military disengagement in Ladakh's Depsang and Demchok.

Following that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping meeting in Russia's Kazan in October last year. On the border dispute, he stressed, ""We should never allow bilateral relations to be defined by the boundary question, or (allow) specific differences to affect overall bilateral ties.""

The statements comes as a tariff war brews between the United States and China, a battle that is a redux of events from Donald Trump's first term as US President.

Mr Trump on Tuesday signed an order to hike - from 10 to 20 per cent - tariffs on Chinese imports into his country. The increase, the White House said, was retaliation for Beijing failing to control export of fentanyl, a deadly manufactured narcotic linked to an opioid crisis in the US.

China's response was swift and furious; 24 hours later the Chinese embassy in the US said, ""If war is what the US wants... be it tariff, trade, or any other type, we're ready to fight till the end.""

Beijing has, in turn, imposed levies of up to 15 per cent on a range of American agricultural products, including soybeans, pork, and wheat, starting early next week.

China has also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization, alleging the ""unilateral tax... seriously violates WTO rules and undermines the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation"". China also slammed the fentanyl claim, calling it a ""flimsy excuse to raise tariffs"".

Tariffs have become a headline-grabbing weapon in the second Trump administration, with the new President seen to be wielding it (or the threat of) to bully other nations into getting what he wants.

Mr Trump has also levied tariffs against India, a country he has repeatedly classified as a ""high tariff nation"" and a ""big abuser"". He has vowed reciprocal tariffs on India and China.

On the India tariffs question, Mr Trump criticised high taxes charged by New Delhi in a joint address to the US Congress, calling them ""very unfair"" and warning of similar treatment.

Mr Trump announced his India tariffs, which now include a 25 per cent charge on steel and aluminum imports, in a social media post on February 13, hours before he was to meet Mr Modi.

Those tariffs sparked a meltdown in the Indian stock market; the Sensex fell by over 1,000 points.

Under Mr Trump the US has also imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico - the US' two largest trading partners - citing issues like illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Canada's Justin Trudeau accused Mr Trump of targeting friendly nations and allies while ""appeasing"" Russia over the Ukraine war.

Mr Trump introduced similar tariffs during his first term (2017-2021) but then made concessions.

The US did see a bump in manufacturing employment - which is what Mr Trump has said will happen this time also - as a result of the cuts, but things changed after the steel and aluminum tariffs in 2018.

In 2019, the first full year after those tariffs took effect, the US lost manufacturing jobs and the broader factory sector entered a slump with industrial production falling.

US President Donald Trump has said that he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, regarding a potential nuclear deal.

In an interview aired on Friday by Fox Business News, President Donald Trump said he had reached out to Iran’s leadership to negotiate a nuclear deal.

“I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing,’"" Trump said. 

The White House later confirmed Trump’s remarks, saying that he had sent a letter to Iranian officials proposing talks. The full interview is set to air on Sunday.

“I would rather negotiate a deal. I’m not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,"" Trump added. 

“But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something’s going to happen one way or the other,” he said.

“I hope you’re going to negotiate because it’s going to be a lot better for Iran and I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something because you can’t let them have a nuclear weapon,” the US President said. 

Iran has long insisted that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. However, as tensions with the US persist over sanctions and a fragile ceasefire holds in Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, Iranian officials have increasingly hinted at the possibility of pursuing nuclear weapons.

Trump's statement was reported by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, citing the broadcast. However, there was no immediate reaction from the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who, at 85, holds the final say on all state matters.

The Trump administration has consistently emphasised the importance of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons since his return to the White House. 

However, a recent report from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog indicated that Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.

European leaders on Thursday agreed to support Ukraine and increase its defence spending after US President Donald Trump suspended military aid to the war-torn country.

The European Commission plans to borrow up to $160 billion to ramp up investments in armed forces. The proposal was approved by EU countries that rely heavily on the US and NATO for defence. They urged their ministers to review these proposals on an urgent basis.

The European Union's defence summit in Brussels came amid growing fears that Vladimir Putin, knowing that Trump has withdrawn support from Ukraine, may next target an EU country. Besides, Trump's decision vis-a-vis Ukraine has made the EU believe it can no longer rely on the US to come to its rescue.

""Today we have shown that the European Union is rising to the challenge, building the Europe of defence and standing with Ukraine shoulder to shoulder,"" European Council president António Costa said.

The EU also said the countries were working to strengthen their own defences.

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, presenting to leaders an ambitious €800bn (£670bn) plan to increase European defence spending, said it was “a watershed moment for Europe” and also for Ukraine.

Some of this money could be used to extend military assistance to Ukraine, The Guardian reported. “The best security guarantees are the Ukrainians themselves,” Mr Costa said. EU diplomats, however, privately acknowledged that Europe can't fill the gap left by US military aid, The Guardian report added.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, ""Europe must take up this challenge, this arms race. And it must win it."" He added that Europe as a whole was truly capable of winning any ""military, financial, economic confrontation with Russia—we are simply stronger.""

After the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said that regardless of what happens in Ukraine, Europe must develop its own self-defence capabilities.

US military aid accounted for 30 per cent of Ukraine's weapons and ammunition needs. Ukraine had been receiving long-range rocket and missile systems, tanks, armoured vehicles, howitzers, artillery ammunition, and Patriot air defence batteries from the US.

The pause is not limited to military equipment. The US also announced that it has paused intelligence support as well as weapons shipments to Ukraine. Earlier, the US had also stopped humanitarian aid to the country.

The decision to suspend military and humanitarian aid comes as Trump attempts to force Ukraine into making a peace deal with Russia without making any commitments to ensure the security of the eastern European country.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"
https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,"Pope Sends Breathless Message, Vatican Says Condition ""Stable"" But ""Complex""",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pope-francis-health-news-update-vatican-7873298,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 18:29:57 GMT","

Pope Francis's condition remained stable but complex on Friday as he battles pneumonia in hospital, the Vatican said, a day after releasing an audio message in which the 88-year-old sounded weak and breathless.

The message broadcast to pilgrims in St Peter's Square on Thursday evening was the first time the world had heard the pope's voice since he was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14.

The Argentine pontiff has suffered several respiratory crises since his admission, most recently on Monday.

Amid increasingly lurid online speculation, fuelled by the absence of any photos of the pope, the Holy See on Thursday released a short audio message recorded that day by Francis.

""I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square. I accompany you from here,"" the pope said, sounding weak and taking laboured breaths.

""May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.""

The Argentine spoke in his native Spanish, drawing speculation he could not muster the strength to speak in Italian, which is used for official Vatican business. 

But a Vatican source insisted Francis wanted to speak in a language that would have a wider audience.

The Vatican press office said Friday the pope's status was ""stable"", but he was still in a ""complex clinical condition"" so ""the prognosis remains guarded"".

The pope did a bit of work and some physiotherapy, but mostly rested and prayed, including spending around 20 minutes in the little chapel which is part of the hospital's papal suite, it said.

He continues to switch between an oxygen mask at night and a cannula -- a plastic tube tucking into the nostrils -- delivering high-flow oxygen during the day.

'Good sign'

When the message was broadcast in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica, where prayers have been held every evening for the pope, applause broke out among the hundreds of pilgrims gathered there.

""We were very happy that he could speak,"" said John Maloney, a 76-year-old English pilgrim visiting Rome for the 2025 Jubilee holy year celebrations.

""It's a good sign that he's actually able to speak,"" he told AFP, adding: ""He's got a long way to go so he's in the hands of God.""

But for Claudia Bianchi, a 50-year-old Italian from Rome, ""it struck me to hear him so tired"".

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said it was Francis himself who wanted the message broadcast.

The pope's message was on the front page of many  Italian newspapers, which reported it was an attempt by the Vatican to battle disinformation about the pontiff's deterioration or even death.

They noted the weakness of his voice, with the Corriere della Sera daily describing it as ""pained"".

Change in communication

In a bid for greater transparency, the Vatican has been publishing an update on how the pope slept every morning, followed by a more detailed medical bulletin each evening.

It said Thursday that ""in view of the stability of the clinical picture"", there would be no medical bulletin on Friday evening, with the next due on Saturday.

Nonetheless, ""the doctors are still maintaining a reserved prognosis"", it said, meaning they will not say how they expect his condition to evolve.

On Friday morning, the Vatican provided the usual brief update, saying Francis ""passed a calm night and woke up shortly after 8:00am (0700 GMT)"".

During previous hospitalisations, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer.

But he has missed the last three, and no announcement has yet been made about whether he will make an appearance this weekend.

The pope has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from colon surgery in 2021 to a hernia operation in 2023, but this is the longest and most serious hospitalisation of his papacy.

On February 22, he suffered a ""prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis"" and on February 28 had ""an isolated crisis of bronchospasm"" -- a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs.

On Monday March 3, Francis ""experienced two episodes of acute respiratory failure, caused by a significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm"", the Vatican said.

Francis's health has regularly led to speculation, particularly among his critics, as to whether he could resign like his predecessor, Benedict XVI.

Three weeks to the day after being admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital, Pope Francis is still struggling to shake off the double pneumonia that has battered his already fragile health.

The 88-year-old pontiff has not been seen in public since entering hospital, and the Vatican has given no indication of when he might come out, or when he could resume anything like his usually demanding work schedule.

The road to recovery is likely to be long and fraught with danger, said medical experts who are not involved in his care and were speaking in general terms about his condition.

""I've seen patients who have spent months in hospital in this sort of situation. Of course he can recover, but the chances for a negative outcome are high,"" said Professor Christoph Lange, Secretary General of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.

""The best advice would be to let him rest, let him take whatever time he needs to get well again,"" he told Reuters.

Underscoring his diminished condition, the pope released a brief audio message on Thursday night giving thanks to all those praying for him. His voice was broken, breathless and hard to understand.

The Vatican has released daily updates from the pope's medical team, breaking previous Church taboos by providing a detailed, real-time assessment of the pontiff's health.

In what was seen as a positive development, his doctors said on Thursday that given his clinical stability, they would provide their next bulletin on Saturday, skipping Friday.

However, they continued to caution that his overall prognosis remained guarded, as they have each day since February 22, meaning he is not yet out of danger.

Loredana Sarmati, professor of infectious diseases at Rome's Tor Vergata University, said it would be possible to start talking about recovery only once the guarded prognosis was lifted.

""Pneumonia of this magnitude is challenging even for a young person. Here we are talking about an elderly man and above all a man who already in previous months had respiratory problems,"" she said. ""Pneumonia can take weeks and weeks to heal.""

The current illness is the most serious of several respiratory ailments the pope has had in recent years. He had part of a lung removed as a young man after suffering pleurisy.

The Vatican has said the pope has suffered four attacks of breathlessness since February 22. The last was on March 3, caused by a significant accumulation of mucus in his lungs, suggesting he did not have the muscle strength to expel the secretions.

Doctors observing the situation drew comfort from the fact he has not had a repeat episode since Monday. Likewise, they said it was reassuring he has not had any reported fever since February 14 and that, according to the Vatican, his blood tests have remained stable.

However, the fact that his overall condition was stationary after three weeks of intensive treatment, including antibiotics, was not reassuring, said a senior physician who recently retired from Gemelli and declined to give his name because of his ties to the hospital that is caring for the pope.

The physician, who has not seen Francis' medical record, said doctors would normally hope to see an improvement after so many days and added that each breathing crisis would have put a huge strain on the pope's heart. The Vatican has repeatedly said parameters measuring his circulatory system remain stable.

Francis has been receiving almost constant supplemental oxygen for the past two weeks, either through a breathing mask or a small hose under his nose.

If his condition did deteriorate, the next step could involve sedating him and placing an oxygen tube into his throat.

However, this would be a last resort for such an elderly man, medical experts said. It would also need the pope's authorisation, raising questions about what level of treatment he would be prepared to accept.

It is not known if Francis has given any instructions about his future care. In a message to the World Medical Association in 2017 he addressed end-of-life issues, saying it was morally legitimate to withdraw ""overzealous treatment"".

The Catholic Church teaches that it is obligatory to give patients life-saving care, but it also allows for a patient or their carers to reject ""burdensome"" or ""disproportionate"" procedures to keep a terminally ill person alive.

As a step towards his rehabilitation, the Vatican has said the pope has been getting respiratory therapy to improve his lung function since at least February 26. He is also receiving physical therapy to try to overcome the effects of his longest hospital stay since he became pope 12 years ago.

""It is a race against time for the loss of muscle structure,"" said Lange.

While the Vatican says Francis has spent long spells in an armchair, it is not clear if he can walk or stand unaided.

If and when he is able to return to the Vatican, doctors cautioned he might never regain his former strength.

""He can be healed, but it is possible that some damage will remain in the lungs, so maybe there won't be a 100% recovery,"" said Carlo Vancheri, professor of respiratory diseases at the University of Catania in Sicily.

Juan Valdez has signed a strategic partnership with Colombian conglomerate Grupo Trinity to accelerate outlet growth in Spain. 
 

The joint venture partners, both based in Bogotá, Colombia, will collectively invest €40m ($43m) to open 140 new stores by 2032. Expansion will include both company-operated and franchised stores.  


Juan Valdez currently operates six outlets in Spanish capital, Madrid. 


The agreement will also see Grupo Trinity distribute Juan Valdez branded packaged coffee to horeca clients, as part of a wider strategy to drive brand awareness in Spain and lay the groundwork for further retail expansion across Europe. 


“This expansion is the result of a strategic commitment shared by two Colombian companies that seek to take the Juan Valdez brand to its full potential, promoting shared values such as Colombian identity, integrity, service and diversity. This alliance is essential to strengthen our connection with European consumers and allows us to take a big step in the brand’s internationalisation strategy,” said Camila Escobar, President, Juan Valdez. 


“As Colombians, we are proud to lead the expansion in Spain of the brand that best represents Colombia in the world,” added Omar González Pardo, President, Grupo Trinity. 


Created by Colombia’s National Federation of Coffee Growers, the first Juan Valdez coffee shop opened at El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá in December 2002. The coffee chain, which takes its namesake from a fictional character designed to represent the archetypal Colombian coffee farmer, currently operates over 373 stores in Colombia alongside a further 260 across 18 international markets.  


Juan Valdez’s only other European market is Turkey, where it has opened 26 outlets since debuting in April 2022. 


Founded in 2005, Grupo Trinity operates across Colombia, Spain, Costa Rica and Canada within the hospitality, retail, manufacturing and commodity trading industries. The business group’s hospitality portfolio includes Colombian restaurant chain Ideal, Verano and The Pinta restaurant brands as well as the Home Burgers fast-food chain in Spain.  


In January 2024, Grupo Trinity acquired 1,000-store Spanish health and beauty retail chain Clarel for €42m ($45.2m) – a move it said makes it the largest Colombian investor in the country. ","{'href': 'https://www.worldcoffeeportal.com', 'title': 'World Coffee Portal'}"

The glimpses of a teared-up Justin Trudeau marks one of his final moments as the Prime Minister of Canada before his Liberal Party chooses a new successor to ride through the wave of tariffs levied by the Trump administration in the US.

The outgoing premier - who has been in power for nearly a decade - broke down in front of the camera on Thursday while delivering his farewell speech. In a rousing speech, he said he put ""Canadians first"" every single day as the prime minister and won't let them down in the future as well.

""On a personal level, I have made sure that every single day in this office, I put Canadians first, that I have people's backs. That's why I am here to tell you all that we got you. Even in the very last days of this government, we will not let Canadians down today and long into the future,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau had announced his resignation in January amid growing internal dissent and declining popularity ratings. He remains the interim prime minister until his successor takes over.

The Liberal Party is expected to name its next leader on Sunday, who would carry the party into the elections due by October - and more importantly, engage with the US under President Donald Trump.

Trudeau also warned of Trump's tariff threat in his speech and called for unity among Canadians to overcome the tough times ahead. The two leaders had sparred earlier with Trump suggesting that Canada becomes the 51st state of the US, and calling Trudeau a ""Governor"".

His speech came after Trump paused new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports to give reprieve to consumers and companies after the increased taxes rattled equities markets. The US and Canada have each announced 25% tariffs on each other's imports in a precursor to a tariff war - which is now on hold till April 2.

Trudeau denounced Trump's aggressive politics and said Canadians and Mexicans must prosper for ""America First"" to become a reality. Both sides must win, he said, suggesting that's how international trade and bilateral ties work, thought not in real estate deals.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The 16-year-old daughter of stranded Starliner astronaut Barry ""Butch"" Wilmore has spoken up about her father's extended stay on the International Space Station (ISS) and blamed ""negligence"" and ""a lot of politics"" for the prolonged mission. Mr Wilmore has been stuck in space since June 2024 along with Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams. Their mission, which was initially expected to last ten days, was extended due to technical issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. They are now scheduled to return to Earth on March 19 - over nine months later than planned.  

Amid this, Mr Wilmore's daughter Daryn has expressed how she feels about her father's extended stay on the ISS. In a TikTok video, the 16-year-old shared how she longs to hug her father again and bemoaned all the family moments he has missed during the orbital mishap. 

""He's missed out on a lot. It's less the fact that he's up there sometimes; it's more the fact of why. There's a lot of politics, there's a lot of things that I'm not at liberty say in that I don't know fully about. But there's been issues, there's been negligence,"" she said in a video posted on February 6, as per the New York Post. 

However, despite her frustration, Ms Wilmore said she's not depressed over his space station dilemma. She said that her family gets to speak to her father almost daily and said he's keeping busy. 

""Recently we found out he will most likely be coming back in mid-March, which is so exciting, and I miss him so much, and I can only wait to hug his neck and see my sister graduate high school and see the show I'm in right now,"" the teen said.

""But, fingers crossed, things could always change and especially with this whole thing. We've had so many changes. ""He's just been bummed, but he's fine. My dad has always been resilient,"" she added.

President Donald Trump cast doubt on Thursday on his willingness to defend Washington's NATO allies, saying he would not do so if they are not paying enough for their own defense.

""It's common sense, right,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. ""If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them.""

Trump said he has been of this view for years and shared it with NATO allies during his 2017-2021 presidential term. Those efforts prompted more spending from other members of the 75-year-old transatlantic alliance, he said, but ""even now, it's not enough.""

He added: ""They should be paying more.""

A mutual assistance clause lies at the heart of the NATO alliance, which was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of countering the risk of a Soviet attack on allied territory.

Trump's remarks could trigger alarm bells in capitals from Europe to Asia, where leaders were already worried about a withdrawal of US security support after Trump clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and showed greater willingness to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Earlier on Thursday, concerned European leaders backed plans to spend more on defense and pledged to continue to stand by Ukraine.

""I know some may have concerns about NATO's future,"" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said earlier on Thursday. ""So let me be clear, the Transatlantic relationship and the Transatlantic partnership remains the bedrock of our Alliance. President Trump has made clear the commitment of the US and his commitment personally to NATO, and it has also made clear the expectation that we in Europe must do more in terms of defense spending.""

In the Oval Office, Trump said NATO members were friends of his but questioned whether France or a ""couple of others"" would protect the United States in a moment of crisis.

""You think they're going to come and protect us? They're supposed to,"" Trump said. ""I'm not so sure.""

Trump said he viewed NATO as ""potentially good"" if what he saw as the spending issue could be fixed. ""They're screwing us on trade,"" he said of the security alliance.

Trump had affirmed the United States' commitments to the mutual defense of NATO as recently as last week during a press conference alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

At a meeting of European leaders in Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron responded to Trump's comments by saying France and other European countries had joined US troops in fighting in Afghanistan after 9/11.

""Not only the French, but the Europeans were there when we were called for Afghanistan. And by the way, they weren't politely warned when (the US left Afghanistan),"" Macron said. ""We are loyal and faithful allies.""

A NATO spokesperson referred to Rutte's earlier comments.

Trump also mused on the US treaty alliance with Japan, which he affirmed in a joint statement with Tokyo last month as poised ""to grow stronger than ever.""

The collective defense arrangement dates back to agreements made after the conclusion of hostilities in World War Two.

""We have a great relationship with Japan, but we have an interesting deal with Japan that we have to protect them, but they don't have to protect us. You know that? That's the way the deal reads,"" Trump said on Thursday.

""And by the way, they make a fortune with us economically... Who makes these deals?""

The remarks echoed comments Trump made during a 2019 visit to the country.

Japan's embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Nicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, called Trump's remarks ""technically inaccurate.""

While Japan's post-World War Two constitution long restricted its military activities, reforms have meant it could exercise collective self-defense and help protect the United States under certain circumstances, Szechenyi said.

Such circumstances included if an armed attack against a foreign state that is in a close relationship with Japan threatened Japan's survival, he said.

A recent study has revealed concerning data regarding the decline of butterfly populations in the United States. Between 2000 and 2020, total butterfly abundance decreased by 22% across 554 recorded species, with data drawn from over 76,000 surveys and 35 monitoring programs.

The research, which gathered 12.6 million butterfly records, paints a grim picture of the widespread decline of these vital insects. While butterflies are one of the most surveyed insect groups, previous studies have either been geographically limited or relied on data from a single monitoring program.

Of the species recorded, declines were far more common than increases, with 13 times as many species experiencing declines in their populations. This decline was seen across the entire contiguous United States, indicating that the issue is not isolated but widespread. Experts stress that the consequences of losing butterfly populations could be dire, as they play critical roles in ecosystems, including pollination and food chains.

""Butterflies have been declining the last 20 years,"" study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University told The New York Post. ""And we don't see any sign that that's going to end."" 

David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is ""catastrophic and saddening"" when compounded over time.

""In just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!"" Wagner said in an email.

""The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.""

Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal told NYPost that he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.

""The loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,"" Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email.

""They are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.""

Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that ""calms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.""

What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

That's all for our coverage of the war in Ukraine for today.

If you're just checking in, here is a quick recap of the key developments over the last 24 hours.

Ukraine has to ""get on the ball and get the job done"", Donald Trump says as he answers questions on the war.

Russia is ""bombing the hell out of Ukraine... I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine,"" he adds.

Russia has ""all the cards"", he says, and says it ""may be easier"" to deal with Moscow, despite their position.

Asked if he believes Vladimir Putin when he says he wants peace, Trump says ""yeah...  I believe him"".

Donald Trump is delivering unexpected remarks in the Oval Office.

You can watch it live in the stream above.

Earlier this afternoon we held a Q&A with about Donald Trump, and many questions focused on the Ukraine war.

Correspondents David Blevins and James Matthews were answering questions from readers about the US administration.

Will the Ukraine war spread to other countries in Europe? Why is it so important for Trump to do a minerals deal before he can start peace negotiations?  Why isn't Europe striking a minerals deal with Kyiv?

If you'd like to see the answers to these questions and more, take a read here...

These pictures show damaged buildings and smouldering fires in the aftermath of Russian missile strikes in the frontline town of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.

Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, has proposed enshrining defence spending of at least 4% of GDP in the country's constitution.

Poland currently spends a higher proportion of GDP on
defence than any other NATO member, including the United States.


It reached 4.1% of GDP last year,  according to NATO estimates, and could rise to 4.7% this year.


Donald Tusk, the prime minister, said in parliament that
spending 5% on defence seems a ""necessity"" and Poles have a ""lot of effort"" ahead of them. 

As we reported in our post at 2pm, he has announced a plan to offer military training to every adult male.

Donald Trump has threatened further sanctions against Russia.

That is based on the ""fact"" that Moscow is ""pounding"" Ukraine on the battlefield at present, he has written on Truth Social.

He is threatening banking sanctions and tariffs until a ""ceasefire"" and a final peace settlement are reached.

The US president wrote: ""To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!""

He did not provide any details on how extra sanctions might be imposed.

In January, Washington intensified the measures it is taking against Vladimir Putin's regime by targeting Russia's oil production and exports.

These pictures show firefighters battling a blaze after a Russian air attack in Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region.

Russian forces are steadily advancing on the region and have been slowly capturing village after village over the last few months.

The Polish government is drawing up plans to offer military training to every adult male.

Donald Tusk, the country's prime minister, told the lower house of parliament the idea is to create a reserve force ""adequate to possible threats"".

Poland is on NATO's eastern flank and shares a border with Ukraine.

Concerns have become heightened after President Trump stopped providing Kyiv with military support and intelligence.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy needs to acknowledge security guarantees for Ukraine will be provided by Europe, the US treasury secretary has said.

Scott Bessent told CNBC the situation regarding any peace deal over Russia's war in Ukraine is fluid.

Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will ""step up"" to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, but said it would ""need the US to be working with us"".

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has formed an unexpected bond with disgraced fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried while he’s been behind bars. In a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host asked him about his time in prison, specifically inquiring if he had made any friends and whether he had been spending time with Diddy.

During the interview with Sam, Carlson asked, “Have you made friends there? Are you hanging with Diddy? I think he's in there with you.” Grinning, Sam replied, “He is.. he's been kind. I've made some friends, it's a weird environment. It's a combination of a few other high-profile cases and a lot of alleged ex-gangsters.” He continued, “I've only seen one piece of him, which is Diddy in prison. He's been kind to people in the unit, he's been kind to me. It's kind of a soul-crushing place for the world in general and what we see are just the people that are around us on the inside rather than who we are on the outside.”

Carlson then asked Sam about what the other inmates think about being in prison with two famous personalities. Sam shared, “Some of them I think are thinking well this is sort of an opportunity to meet people they wouldn't otherwise get to meet. It makes sense from their perspective, but boy is that not how I think about prison.”

Sam also shared that he never expected to find such good chess competitors inside prison. He revealed, “They're good at chess... former armed robbers who don't speak English, and probably didn't graduate middle school, a surprising number of them are fairly good at chess. I'm not saying they're grandmasters, but I lose games to them all the time,” as reported by Daily Mail.

In the latest episode of DailyMail.com's podcast The Trial of Diddy, federal prison consultant Sam Mangel revealed that the Metropolitan Detention Center has been on lockdown since last week following a violent melee involving more than 40 individuals. Although high-profile inmates like Combs, Mangione, and Bankman-Fried were not located in the area where the incident took place, the entire Brooklyn facility has been placed on ""modified operation"" for at least the next month as a precaution.

Mangel told the Daily Mail, “He's locked down now, at least 23 out of 24 hours. I'm sure they allow him out at least three times a week for a shower, maybe to make a phone call, but that's about it. So he's being fed in his cell, it's a six by nine cell with a little slat for a window.”

He continued, “If he wants to exercise in his cell, he can read in his cell. There are no TV's and that's where he is and will be for the next month other than legal visits. I know my client as well as other clients. I work closely with another consultant that is actually a Mangione's consultant. They're clamoring for legal visits because it's the only time that they can get out of their cells to see people, interact with people in a more open environment.”

The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed to DailyMail.com that several inmates were involved in a fight at the Brooklyn facility on February 22. BOP spokesperson Donald Murphy shared on the outlet’s podcast, “Responding employees isolated and contained the incident and at no time was the public in danger.”

Minsitry Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India has conveyed its ""deep concern"" to the UK.

Speaking out strongly against the breach of Foreign Minister S Jaishankar's security in London, the Ministry of External Affairs has said that it reflects the ""indifference in the UK"" to the intimidation and threats by Khalistani extremist forces. 

Responding to a question during a press briefing on Friday, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India has conveyed its ""deep concern"" to the authorities in the UK about the breach of security arrangements by ""UK-based separatist and extremist elements"" during Mr Jaishankar's visit. 

""There is a larger context to the incident and it is important to understand that. It brings out the licence accorded to such forces as well as the indifference to their intimidation, threats and other actions aimed at impeding our legitimate diplomatic activities in the UK,"" he said. 

Reiterating India's stand that it expects action, Mr Jaiswal added, ""While we have noted the statement by the UK Foreign Office on the matter, our view of its sincerity will depend on the actions taken against the culprits on this and previous occasions.""

A pro-Khalistani protester had attempted to break barricades while others shouted anti-India slogans when Mr Jaishankar was leaving Chatham House, home to the Royal Institute of International Affairs, after an interactive session on Wednesday, 

Making its displeasure known, the Ministry of External Affairs had issued a statement on Thursday as well, in which it said that it expects the host government to live up to its diplomatic obligations in such cases and slammed the ""misuse of democratic freedoms"" by Khalistani elements.

""We condemn the provocative activities of this small group of separatists and extremists. We deplore the misuse of democratic freedoms by such elements. We expect the host government in such cases to fully live up to their diplomatic obligations,"" Mr Jaiswal had said. 

Condemning the incident, the British foreign ministry had also said that attempts to disrupt public events were unacceptable.

In another breach in March 2023, Khalistani extremists had taken down the Tricolour at the Indian High Commission in London during a protest. 

India had demanded an explanation for the ""absence of security"" at the high commission and said the UK government's ""indifference"" to Indian diplomats and personnel was unacceptable. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Ukraine's energy and gas infrastructure came ""under massive missile and drone shelling"" by Russia on Friday, a Ukrainian minister said.

""The energy and gas infrastructure in various regions of Ukraine is under massive missile and drone shelling again,"" Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a post on Facebook.

""Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by shelling energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without power and heating, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,"" he added.

The latest air assault in the three-year conflict comes after EU leaders, shaken by the prospect of US disengagement, agreed to boost the European bloc's defences at a crisis summit Thursday.

Separately, Washington has said talks with Kyiv were back on track to secure a ceasefire with Moscow.

Four people were wounded in a strike on a ""civilian infrastructure"" in Kharkiv, including a woman pulled from the rubble alive and receiving medical treatment, the city's mayor, Igor Terekhov, said in a post on Telegram Friday.

""A fire broke out at the scene of the impact. A nearby apartment building was also damaged,"" Terekhov said, adding that its residents were being evacuated.

Kharkiv Governor Oleg Synegubov also said on Telegram that a Russian strike hit a private company in Kharkiv, and left cars on fire.

""A 65-year-old woman and a 61-year-old man were hospitalised,"" Synegubov added.

Late Thursday, the Ukrainian emergency service also said ""critical infrastructure"" was damaged in an attack on the Odesa region, with no injuries reported.

 MOSCOW, - The DJ cranks up the volume as he takes a swig of black coffee, the young crowd bobbing their heads to the electronic beat merging with the whirr of a milk frother. 

 It's nine o'clock on a Sunday morning, but in this coffeehouse in central Moscow, the party is just getting started. 

 So-called ""coffee raves"" - an early-morning take on late-night club raves, dominated not by alcohol and drugs but by cappuccinos and macchiatos - are cropping up all across Russia after taking global capitals like Amsterdam, London and New York by storm. 

 Many enjoy the chance to socialise with friends in a party-like atmosphere - without the brutal hangovers that result from traditional drug-dominated nightclub culture. 

 ""I think it's a very cool thing for the community,"" says Marina, a music editor. 

 The event's co-organiser, Alexander Zhiganov, says he wants the parties to feel as fun as big nights out. 

 ""I want to give people an idea that you can listen to great music, gather without alcohol, without drugs, and so on - in a more familiar atmosphere with coffee, delicious food and friends,"" Zhiganov says. 

 Although the crowd on Sunday skewed younger, people of all ages were in attendance, coffee mugs in hand. Some even brought their young children along. 

 ""I think we need to have events like this every day,"" says Alexandra Kovalski, a restaurant manager, who describes herself as ""not a night party animal at all."" 

 ""I'll be happy to dance in the morning, drink delicious coffee and go somewhere else in a great mood.""

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news,How job cuts at NOAA could impact weather forecasting,https://abcnews.go.com/US/job-cuts-noaa-impact-weather-forecasting/story?id=119511461,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:32:24 GMT","

More than 580 staffers have already been dismissed, with more possible.

Firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will have reverberating impacts on how meteorologists across the country forecast the weather, according to experts.

Last week, many NOAA employees took to social media to announce that they had been terminated after weeks of uncertainty as the Trump administration continues to make cuts at federal agencies. But the widespread firings of meteorologists who make safety determinations based on upcoming weather and climate conditions could be detrimental to the government's ability to protect Americans in times of disaster, experts told ABC News.

NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS), which is a part of NOAA, are responsible for both routine and extreme weather forecasting nationwide – tracking hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, tsunamis and other potentially life-threatening events. The union representing staffers at NOAA and the NWS told ABC News in an emailed statement that 586 probationary employees were terminated from NOAA on Feb. 27, with 108 of those cuts coming from the NWS.

The National Weather Service was already short-staffed ahead of the cuts, with more than 600 vacancies at the start of 2025, National Weather Service Employees Organization General Counsel Richard Hirn said in the statement. In addition, 500 employees, including 172 NWS employees, accepted a deferred resignation and began their administrative leave the next day.

""Which means that hundreds of operational personnel who usually staff the 122 NWS forecast offices, 13 River Forecast Centers, and two tsunami warning centers will disappear overnight,"" Hirn told ABC News.

It's unclear whether there will be sufficient staffing left at any number of regional forecast offices to continue 24/7 operations, Hirn said, adding that ""there are only a dozen or so forecasters assigned to each office when fully staffed.""

The NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory announced on Feb. 27 that the office's communication services would ""be taking an indefinite hiatus"" due to a reduction in staff.

In addition, the loss of satellite operators at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Maryland, and the Wallops Island Command and Data Acquisition Station in Wallops Island, Virginia, could impact the ability of the NWS to track and maintain the weather data used to forecast and provide severe weather warnings, Hirn said.

Many essential functions, such as satellite information, weather and its effect on airplane engine health, come from these offices, said Craig McLean, former NOAA director of research, during a news conference last Friday.

""Leaving NOAA understaffed will inevitably lead to additional chaos and confusion beyond what we've had over the last several weeks and is going to be a negative impact on people's lives,"" McClean said.

The cuts will lead to significant consequences for weather forecasting accuracy, sea navigation, the fishing industry and air safety, Democrats and former NOAA leadership officials said in a news conference the Friday after last week's dismissals. Officials also expect an early termination of leases on a portion of the 620 facilities run by NOAA across the country.

""All of NOAA's mission responsibilities have been impacted – every office in NOAA,"" Rick Spinrad, former NOAA administrator, said during the news conference. ""Every office in NOAA was hit by these indiscriminate, misguided, ill-informed terminations.""

The terminations come as the U.S. heads into tornado season, with hurricane season not too far behind, Spinrad said. Seasonal outlooks will be impacted in addition to the immediate weather forecasting products, Spinrad added.

""Musk and his fake officials, the DOGE tech bros, have been rummaging through our most sensitive data without authority in violation of the law for weeks now,"" House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said in a statement. ""And this has come with sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants. Park rangers, firefighters, scientists – all of these people, whose purpose is to serve everyday Americans, have had the rug pulled out from under them. And we will all be worse off for it.""

Among the fired scientists were a researcher at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey; a NWS meteorologist in Anchorage, Alaska; a physical scientist with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction; and the meteorologist in charge at the NWS Louisville office, according to posts to social media.

Hirn said the union was aware of up to an additional 800 probationary NOAA employees could soon be terminated following the initial dismissals. Those additional cuts do not yet appear to have happened.

In a statement to ABC News, NOAA and the NWS declined to comment on or confirm the staffing cuts, saying that the agency does not comment on personnel matters, but NOAA National Press Officer for Weather Susan Buchanan emphasized the agency's ongoing commitment to meteorology.

""NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,"" Buchanan said. ""We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.""

On Monday, demonstrators gathered outside of NOAA headquarters in Washington, D.C. to protest the employee dismissals.

""NOAA workers across the country are really kind of tense and waiting to hear what may happen,"" Sarah Cooley, former head of NOAA’s ocean acidification program, told ABC News during the protest.

Tom Di Liberto, an ousted public affairs specialist and climate scientist with NOAA, told ABC News that his job before he was dismissed was to help communicate to the public exactly what NOAA does.

""If you ever wondered what the weather was like outside, if you've ever been to the ocean, you're interacting with NOAA,"" Di Liberto said. ""If you ever looked at temperature on your phone, that's probably NOAA data coming to you. Every aspect of everything we do outside is related to what NOAA does, which is why this is such a dangerous thing. You're playing games with potentially lifesaving information to go out to people, or making that harder to get out the people.""

BEIJING — China's top foreign policy official, Wang Yi, cast Beijing as a force for good and blasted the U.S. for being ""two-faced"" at a news conference during China's annual session of parliament on Friday.

Last month, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports to the U.S., and on Tuesday added another 10%, arguing that China needs to do more to stop the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the U.S.

China has accused Trump of using fentanyl as a pretext to threaten the country economically and Beijing has retaliated with counter-tariffs and other measures.

Wang addressed the escalating trade war with the U.S. and promoted China as an ""anchor"" on the global stage as America retreats from international involvement. Here's what he had to say on five key issues.

Wang, who is a member of the elite Politburo and the country's foreign minister, had very little positive to say about China-U.S. relations, and instead offered criticisms of America's policies and exhortations to mend its ways.

Wang said the combination of tariffs on Chinese goods and President Trump's expressions of willingness to have good relations with Beijing were incongruous.

""No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing a good relationship with it on the other. Such a two-faced approach not only undermines the stability of bilateral relations but also fails to build mutual trust,"" he said.

On fentanyl, Wang said the problem is fundamentally the responsibility of the U.S.

""In the spirit of humanitarianism, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S., and the U.S. should not repay goodwill with resentment or impose unjustified tariffs. This is not the behavior of a responsible major power,"" he said.

Wang said science and technology ""should not be tools for building iron curtains"" — a reference to a range of U.S. policies, including bans on the sale to China of the most advanced microchips.

""Wherever there is a blockade, there will be breakthroughs; wherever there is suppression, there will be innovation,"" Wang said. ""High walls cannot block innovative thinking; decoupling and severed links will only isolate those who impose them.""

More broadly, Wang took aim at the United States' confrontational approach to China.

""The U.S. should review what has been gained from years of tariff and trade wars. Has the trade deficit been reduced or increased? Has the competitiveness of manufacturing risen or declined? Has inflation improved or worsened? Have the lives of the people improved or deteriorated? Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations are mutual and reciprocal. Cooperation will lead to mutual benefit and win-win results, but if one side insists on pressure, China will take resolute countermeasures,"" he said.

Wang was asked directly if Trump's retreat from multilateral forums, freezing of foreign aid and strained relations with allies presented a strategic opening for China on the global stage. He demurred.

""Imagine if every country prioritized itself above all else and placed blind faith in power and status — this world would regress to the law of the jungle, where smaller and weaker nations would bear the brunt of instability, and the international order and rules-based system would face severe disruption,"" Wang said.

He said major powers have a responsibility to fulfill their international obligations and act with accountability. ""Pursuing self-interest at the expense of others, or wielding power to intimidate, is unacceptable,"" Wang said.

China's stability will help ""anchor an uncertain world.""

President Trump's tilt toward Russia has raised questions about him doing a possible ""reverse Nixon"", i.e. cozying up to Moscow to isolate Beijing, flipping President Nixon's script from the early 1970s when America engaged in detente with China to pressure the Soviet Union, its primary Cold War rival.

But Wang said ""the historical logic"" of China's good relations with Russia was steadfast.

""I want to emphasize that regardless of changes in the international landscape, the historical logic of the China-Russia friendship remains unchanged, and the internal driving forces behind our relationship remain strong,"" Wang said.

""Both sides have deeply reflected on historical experiences and have committed to long-term good-neighborly relations, comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation. This approach best serves the fundamental interests of both peoples and aligns with the broader trends of global development and progress. China and Russia have established a unique model of engagement — one that is non-aligned, non-confrontational, and not directed at any third party,"" he said.

Wang said a ""mature, resilient, and stable"" relationship ""will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be swayed by external influences. It is a constant in an uncertain world, not a variable in geopolitical competition.""

China has tried to position itself as a potential mediator able to help bring the war in Ukraine to an end, but since Trump's foreign policy shift toward Russia, Beijing has been left largely on the sidelines.

""China welcomes and supports all efforts aimed at achieving peace. However, it is also important to recognize that this crisis has deep and complex historical roots — it was not created overnight, and it cannot be resolved overnight,"" Wang said.

He said China is willing to work with the international community ""in line with the wishes of the relevant parties, to play a constructive role in achieving a lasting resolution.""

""The world must move toward a new security vision based on common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security. Only by doing so can we achieve lasting peace and stability — not just in Eurasia, but across the entire world,"" he said.

Wang was unequivocal when asked about Trump's plan to boot Palestinians from Gaza and turn the territory over to the U.S. to develop.

""Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,"" Wang said.

""Any attempt to forcibly change Gaza's status will not bring peace but will only trigger further turmoil… The will of the people must not be violated, and justice cannot be ignored. If great powers truly care about the people of Gaza, they should push for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, increase humanitarian aid, uphold the principle of 'Palestinians governing Palestinians,' and contribute to Gaza's reconstruction,"" he said.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news,‘Cool head’: How Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum got Trump to halt some tariffs,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/6/cool-head-how-mexicos-claudia-sheinbaum-is-handling-trump-and-tariffs,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 08:44:33 GMT","

Unlike Canada’s Trudeau, Sheinbaum has been more diplomatic while insisting on protecting Mexico’s interests. Here’s why.

As United States President Donald Trump’s sweeping 25-percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada were about to kick in on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hit back.

Even before the tariffs actually came into effect, Trudeau put out a statement, calling the tariffs “unjustified” and imposing immediate retaliatory tariffs. Then, a few hours later, on Tuesday morning, he addressed a news conference where he referred to Trump as “Donald”, called the tariffs a “very dumb thing to do”, and accused the US president of trying to cripple the Canadian economy to annex the country.

In contrast, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s first comments only came in a news conference on Tuesday. She promised to defend Mexican interests. But while announcing tit-for-tat tariffs on US imports, she said these would only come into effect on Sunday, giving it time to strike a deal with the US.

That deal came over a phone call with Trump on Thursday, during which, according to Sheinbaum’s account, the US president initially refused to budge on the tariffs. But the Mexican president persisted – and, by the end, Trump had relented.

He announced a waiver until April 2 from the tariffs on all Mexican imports covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) and used warm words for Sheinbaum. “I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum,” he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. “Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.”

Later, he extended that reprieve to Canada, too – but continued to target Trudeau, whom he has repeatedly mocked and made unsubstantiated claims against.

So why is Mexico’s president approaching Trump’s tariffs so differently from how Canada and Trudeau are handling them? What did she say to Trump on Thursday? How is Mexico responding to Sheinbaum’s strategy? How did we get here? And what’s at stake?

Even before he was sworn into office for a second time in January, Trump announced he would impose 25-percent tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, citing concerns over border security and drug trafficking, particularly the flow of fentanyl into the US.

The US is the second-largest goods trader in the world after China, and Trump’s tariffs have rattled global markets.

These tariffs were initially scheduled to take effect on February 4, but negotiations between Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico resulted in the US postponing their imposition for a month.



In those negotiations, Trudeau and Sheinbaum agreed to boost border security to prevent drug trafficking and the entry of migrants into the US.

Trudeau appointed a “fentanyl czar” to tackle that issue. Sheinbaum deployed 10,000 additional soldiers to the US-Mexico border to help curb irregular immigration. Within Mexico, her law enforcement agencies busted fentanyl gangs, raided labs and made arrests. Last week, Mexico sent 29 drug cartel leaders to the US for prosecution.

Still, on Tuesday, Trump enacted the 25-percent tariffs, affecting a wide array of goods, before partly – and temporarily – rolling them back on Thursday. Additional tariffs were also imposed on China.

The US’s top three trading partners – Mexico, Canada and China – account for more than 35 percent of the goods that the world’s largest economy imports or exports.

Canada responded promptly and assertively to the US tariffs with retaliatory protectionist measures of its own that it had first announced on February 1.

Starting on Tuesday, Canada imposed 25-percent tariffs on $21bn worth of US goods with the threat of tariffs on another estimated $87bn if the dispute lasts.

Trudeau warned that Canada “will not back down from a fight” and tariffs would remain in place until the US tariffs are withdrawn.

Products including meats, grains, certain alcohol, clothes, footwear, motorcycles and cosmetics are just some of the US goods that will be subject to immediate tariffs, according to Canada’s Department of Finance.

Some Canadian provinces have taken steps of their own, ordering the removal of all US liquor from stores, for instance.

Trudeau, in comments on Tuesday, also seemed to back Canadians who are choosing to boycott American goods and boo the US national anthem at sporting events.

Trudeau had a call with Trump on Wednesday, but while the US president said it ended on a “somewhat ‘friendly'” note, he subsequently accused Canada of allowing fentanyl to enter the US – even though experts said only a minuscule amount of the opioid comes into the US across its northern border.

Ultimately, relief in the form of tariff exemptions on Canadian imports into the US that are covered by the USMCA only came after Trump’s call with Sheinbaum the following day.

While Trump and Trudeau have exchanged heated personal remarks in recent weeks, Sheinbaum has taken a more measured approach.

In her comments on Tuesday, Sheinbaum expressed the intention to implement “tariff and non-tariff measures” to safeguard Mexico’s interests but refrained from immediate action, suggesting she intends to exhaust all diplomatic channels first.

“What I can tell you is that this is a very definitive moment for Mexico … There is not going to be submission. Mexico is a great country, and Mexicans are brave and resistant,” she said.

If the tariffs continued, Mexico would “reach out to Canada and other nations”, Sheinbaum said. She added that Mexico may look for other trading partners besides the US and could shift trade alliances “if necessary”.

Recounting her conversation with Trump at a news conference later on Thursday, Sheinbaum said Trump initially insisted that the tariffs enforced on Tuesday would stay.

But Sheinbaum sent Trump a chart that demonstrated how seizures of fentanyl by agents along the US-Mexico border had fallen dramatically since she sent her 10,000 soldier-strong force there.

She told him their collaboration was yielding results in strengthening security along the border, and the tariffs would hurt that partnership, Sheinbaum told reporters.

The pitch worked.

On Truth Social, Trump announced that tariffs on Mexican imports covered by the USMCA would be waived until April 2, when he intends to implement reciprocal tariffs on all countries. He spoke of his respect for Sheinbaum. “Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!” he said.

The Mexican president reciprocated the gesture, with a message of her own. “Many thanks to President Donald Trump. We had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results, within the framework of respect for our sovereignties,” she wrote on X.

At a briefing with reporters in early February, Sheinbaum offered insights into her mindset, saying that amid threats from Trump, Mexico needed to keep a “cool head”.

This cautious strategy reflects Mexico’s heavy reliance on the US as a market: More than 75 percent of Mexico’s exports go to its northern neighbour, so any dramatic disruption in that equation could bleed the country’s economy. Last year, the US imported $505.8bn in goods from Mexico and exported $334bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $171.8bn.

To be sure, Canada also needs the US for its exports: More than 70 percent of Canadian exports go to the US.

But the context of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico and Canada is quite different, Vina Nadjibulla, vice president of research and strategy at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera.

While Trump in the past has mooted the idea of bombing Mexico’s drug cartels, many of which his administration has designated as “terrorist” organisations, he has been much more direct in seeking Canada’s territory.

Trump has frequently said his northern neighbour should become the 51st US state.

And while Trump has said he respects Sheinbaum, he has repeatedly referred to Trudeau, including after their call on Wednesday, as governor rather than prime minister.

“In Canada’s case, Trudeau noted that Trump’s actions are aimed at crippling the Canadian economy to pave the way for an eventual annexation, which goes beyond a mere trade war,” Nadjibulla said, referring to Trump’s repeated threats to absorb Canada.

“It’s an existential fight for Canada’s sovereignty, so there’s a strong incentive to push back immediately and forcefully,” she said.

Commenting on the new tariffs, Trudeau on Tuesday said Trump was planning to cause the “total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us”.

“Retaliation here isn’t just about tit-for-tat tariffs. It’s about defending the country’s independence,” Nadjibulla said.

Sheinbaum also has something that Trudeau does not: Time.

Canada is fast approaching national elections, and Trudeau’s Liberal Party is playing catch-up. After trailing the opposition Conservative Party by double digits for more than a year, the country’s governing party has started to rapidly close the gap as Trudeau pushes back against Trump’s moves and the US president’s steps stoke a wave of patriotism among Canadians.

Sheinbaum, on the other hand, took office only in October and is wildly popular. In two polls in February, her approval rating was 80 percent and 85 percent.

It’s too early to say.

But on Wednesday, the Trump administration exempted auto manufacturers from the 25-percent tariffs for a month. While the sector’s supply chains are spread across North America, Mexico is the biggest beneficiary of the reprieve. Cars, trucks, other vehicles and auto parts constitute 27 percent of its exports to the US. For Canada, that figure stands at 13 percent.



Then, on Thursday, she won a reprieve on tariffs for all Mexican exports covered by the USMCA.

And Sheinbaum enjoys more than just popular support in Mexico. Her approach to Trump and his tariffs appears to have the trust of Mexican investors, too.

The IPC, the main index of the country’s stock exchange, is up 6 percent from the start of the year. By contrast, the S&P/TSX, the benchmark Canadian stock exchange index, is almost where it was at the start of the year.

Even with the temporary reprieve on Thursday, many goods exported by Mexico and Canada to the US – including Canadian oil, for instance – are not covered by the USMCA and so are subject to Trump’s tariffs. Canadian oil faces a 10 percent tariff. And on April 2, Trump plans to introduce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs on countries around the world.

With such tariffs, and the retaliatory steps taken by other countries, businesses exporting goods and services as well as consumers will pay higher prices. A potential recession in some or all three North American countries is a possibility.

 



 

But even if Trump decides to de-escalate, Nadjibulla said, “the damage to trust is already substantial.”

“We’ve seen him threaten new tariffs in April and continue to shift targets. That level of unpredictability erodes confidence among allies and trading partners,” she said.

The tariffs could also affect negotiations on renewing the USMCA, a free-trade pact that came into effect in 2020, was negotiated by Trump’s team during his first term and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994. A review of the USMCA is due in 2026, but the tariffs could see talks take place sooner.

“How do you negotiate a stable agreement when one party is consistently changing the rules or imposing new tariffs without warning?” Nadjibulla asked.

“Even if some tariffs get lifted or eased, the bigger issue is that Canada and others now view the US as a less reliable trade partner,” she added.

HGTV named Lambertville, New Jersey, one of America's ""most charming towns.""

A New Jersey town made a nationwide list of 50 of the most “charming small towns” in America.

Lambertville, New Jersey, also known as the “Antiques Capital of New Jersey,” made the list due to its many galleries and antique shops that line the small town of 4,000 residents, according to the list from HGTV.

Founded in 1705, Lambertville is situated along the Delaware River in central New Jersey.

The town is home to many townhouses and Victorian homes, as well as a restored 19th-century train depot called Lambertville Station that now serves as a restaurant and inn.

HGTV noted that Lambertville has many “Zagat-rated restaurants and award-winning hotels and B&Bs,” making the town ideal for a weekend getaway.

Visitors looking for history can visit the James Wilson Marshall House, which is open seasonally to visitors.

For those interested in a little retail therapy, Lambertville offers shops on Bridge, Main and Union streets, as well as The People’s Store Antiques and Design Center for serious antique hunters.

Artist’s Gallery is also a draw for art collectors looking to find some lovely artwork.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news,Trump layoffs have hollowed out key weather monitoring staff amid storm season,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-layoffs-nws,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 11:01:00 GMT","

The National Weather Service has lost about 10% of its staff, hitting offices prone to severe weather hardest

As deadly severe storms swept the US this week, recent Donald Trump administration staffing cuts have left key parts of weather monitoring and disaster preparedness systems severely understaffed, the Guardian has learned.

March typically signals the start of a four-month tornado season across the eastern two-thirds of the US. Last year’s tornado season was one of the most prolific on record, and this year’s tornado season is getting off to an early active start.

A multi-day tornado outbreak tore across several southern states, with significant damage reported near Ada, Oklahoma, including part of an elementary school. Dangerous storms then spread eastward into the Carolinas and the mid-Atlantic. Strong winds in Mississippi killed and injured multiple people in separate incidents.

The period of unsettled weather raised concerns internally among National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologists that the newly downsized agency could be stretched thin.

Late last week, the Trump administration directed the NWS’s parent organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), to terminate approximately 800 probationary employees. In addition, more than 100 deferred resignations and early retirements took effect on Friday, mostly in senior roles.

The downsizing comes as part of a radical reshaping of the US federal government, led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is seeking to slash tens of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars in spending.

The NWS, which is staffed around the clock, has lost about 10% of its workforce in recent days. But current and former Noaa scientists and officials that the Guardian consulted say the NWS cuts fell haphazardly, leaving some forecast offices in a much worse staffing position than others.

Some of the hardest-hit offices were the most prone to severe weather, according to an analysis of publicly available staffing information reviewed by the Guardian. The NWS offices in Miami, Boston, Houston, Cheyenne in Wyoming and Rapid City in South Dakota have all lost more than 30% of their staffing as compared with last fall.

“At some point these cuts are going to make Noaa break,” said Tom Di Liberto, a former Noaa public affairs specialist, who lost his job last week. “I am just so mad because our ability to help other people is going to go down … This is going to hurt people.”

In addition to this week’s tornado threat, weather warnings for high winds, dust storms, wildfires and a major blizzard stretched across much of the central US this week as a tumultuous spring storm system swept the country. Over the next several days, a series of coastal storms are also expected to bring steady rains to parts of the west coast, including scorched areas across southern California where out-of-season wildfires recently destroyed thousands of homes.

Accurate and timely weather forecasts provided by the NWS not only power virtually all weather apps and television weather forecasts, they also underlie much of the US economy and help it to function efficiently.

The Trump administration’s cuts to the NWS are “likely to cause irreparable harm and have far-reaching consequences for public safety, economic well-being, and the United States’ global leadership”, according to a statement by the American Meteorological Society (AMS), a scientific organization.

The AMS statement called continued federal investment in weather forecasting “an internationally recognized and highly respected means of multiplying value and benefits to the American people”.

When asked to confirm the staffing cuts and their likely impact on routine weather forecasting operations, Noaa refused to directly comment.

“Per longstanding practice, we are not discussing internal personnel and management matters. Noaa remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,” said Noaa spokesperson Susan Buchanan. “We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission.”

The NWS has 122 offices nationwide where teams of meteorologists work three rotating shifts throughout the day. NWS staff said that, typically, two or three meteorologists are in the office during overnight hours or periods of quiet weather, but those numbers routinely double during severe weather episodes.

Safety concerns are growing as NWS offices gradually update their public-facing staffing pages after last week’s cuts and the exact nature of the staffing shortages becomes more clear.

About one-third of the approximately 40 offices whose post-layoff staffing rosters the Guardian examined throughout tornado alley and in population-dense areas of the east coast now have critical staffing shortages – insufficient to even minimally staff all three shifts while factoring in weekly time off. Those critically understaffed offices include Miami, Boston, Houston, Omaha, Wichita, Kansas City, Sioux Falls in South Dakota and Cheyenne in Wyoming.

One senior meteorologist who manages a NWS office in tornado alley said the cuts have made him feel “stressed” and has reduced the morale of his staff.

“The day to day (hour to hour) uncertainty of what’s going to happen next or what’s going to show up in your inbox is mentally exhausting,” said the meteorologist, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Focus is still on our mission and we will do whatever it takes to deliver services to fulfill that mission.”

Some high-impact offices, such as the one in New Orleans, did not appear to lose any staff. Other offices, such as those in Wichita and Omaha, remain at critical shortages that predate Trump’s second term in office.

During times of acute severe weather, NWS offices can request that another office fulfill part or all of their duties. This happens most typically when weather service staff are forced to seek physical shelter when the storms they are forecasting affect their home office, but can also happen during periods of communication outages.

Most likely, critically understaffed offices will require their forecasters to work overtime and cancel planned leave, worsening morale and taxing meteorologists’ mental and physical health.

Some tasks, such as training and public outreach – including storm spotter training and school field trips – have already been cancelled. Weather radar systems near San Francisco and San Diego that went down shortly after last week’s staff cuts were announced took days to be repaired. At one point during this week’s severe storms, 11 weather radars were down nationwide – nearly 10% of the country’s fleet.

“These people, they’re human beings, they’re not magicians,” said Di Liberto. “The burnout is going to be intense.”

Other essential parts of federal disaster management, such as Fema and the agencies that manage public lands, have also been hamstrung by staff cuts and strict spending limits.

Researchers have recently uncovered evidence that our warming atmosphere is contributing to an eastward shift in the region where tornadoes are most likely to form, in addition to boosting the odds of extreme early season activity.

Water temperatures over the Gulf of Mexico spent much of February at record warm levels, contributing additional moisture and fuel for this week’s severe weather outbreak. The level of warmth over southern states this week is more typical of late April, around the peak of the annual tornado season.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The federal government is unveiling new support measures to mitigate the impact of the U.S. trade war on Canadian workers as fears of layoffs and economic impact grow.

The announcement came moments after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he plans to put new tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber within the coming days.

Labour Minister Steve MacKinnon announced new “temporary work-sharing measures” that will go into effect Friday, calling the trade war that Trump launched this week a moment of “maximum peril.”

A sweeping 25 per cent tariff on all Canadian goods went into effect Tuesday, before Trump announced a partial, temporary reprieve for some goods that fall under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).

Canada’s counter-tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods also went into effect Tuesday, with provinces issuing their own suites of measures, and will remain in place until all of Trump’s tariffs are lifted.

“In this moment of maximum peril, the likes we have never seen from a friend and ally, no less, the federal government must stand tall and stand by fellow Canadians and stand by we will,” MacKinnon said during a press conference in Ottawa.

Under the “mitigation” plan announced Friday, Ottawa is expanding the existing work-sharing program to let employers cut hours while keeping workers in their jobs with income support.

This will allow employers to keep workers on their payrolls without having to resort to cutting jobs, he said.

MacKinnon said the federal government will broaden the program to include workers in for-profit and charitable sectors as well as those working in cyclical or seasonal jobs.

“We are moving ahead with these changes, despite yesterday’s pause, because businesses and workers need assurances right now,” he said, adding that measures will remain in place for as long as needed.

The work-sharing program is funded through the Employment Insurance benefits that workers and employers pay into.

The program is aimed at avoiding layoffs “when there is a temporary decrease in the normal level of business activity that is beyond the control of the employer,” according to Employment and Social Development Canada. 

Under the working-sharing agreement, all employees who participate in it must agree to cutting their normal working hours – a minimum 10 per cent reduction.

Employees must also share the available work equally while their employer recovers.

These agreements can last anywhere from six weeks to up to 26 weeks, and if needed, extended to a total of 38 weeks.

Under the changes announced Friday, MacKinnon said the maximum length of agreements will be increased to up to 76 weeks.

The work-sharing program was also used to support businesses impacted by the wildfires in Jasper last year as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ottawa also announced a suite of other supports for Canadian businesses and workers.

These include $5 billion in funding over two years for Export Development Canada to help Canadian exporters reach new markets and help companies navigate the economic challenges posed by the U.S. tariffs, according to a news release by the finance department.

Businesses directly impacted by the tariffs will also be able to get “favourably priced loans” to the tune of $500 million through the Business Development Bank of Canada.

In addition, the agriculture and food industry will get $1 billion in new financing through Farm Credit Canada.

“These steps underscore our government’s resolve to ensure that our businesses continue to be resilient,” said International Trade Minister Mary Ng.

She added that the federal government’s top priority is to get the “unjustified tariffs” removed.

            A day after offering Canada a one-month reprieve on punishing, virtually across-the-board 25% tariffs, President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs as soon as Friday on Canadian lumber and dairy products. It’s yet another twist in a serpentine trade policy that seems to shift on an hourly basis.
    


            “Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said in an Oval Office address Friday, citing Canada’s roughly 250% tariff on US dairy exports to the country. Trump said America would match those tariffs dollar-for-dollar.
    


            “We may do it as early as today, or we’ll wait until Monday or Tuesday,” Trump said. “We’re going to charge the same thing. It’s not fair. It never has been fair, and they’ve treated our farmers badly.”
    


            Trump’s announcement gave investors, businesses and consumers another strong dose of whiplash. Just one day earlier, on Thursday, Trump announced a one-month pause on all tariffs on Canada and Mexico on products that comply with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade treaty, known as the USMCA. That had, at least temporarily, given many industries, especially autos and agriculture, a major sigh of relief.
    


            On Friday Trump said more “changes and adjustments” on tariffs should be expected in the future.
    


            “There’ll always be some modifications,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “If you have a wall in front of you, sometimes you have to go around the wall instead of through it.”
    


            Stocks, which were lower to start the day after a mixed bag of a jobs report, initially fell after Trump’s tariff threat but pared their losses. The Dow was up about 45 points, or 0.1%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down another 0.1% after falling into correction territory Thursday — a 10% decline from its most recent high.
    


            “The market is having trouble digesting the multidimensional chess that Trump and his team are playing,” said Michael Block, market strategist at Third Seven Capital. “This multidimensional chess game is not going well for the grand master. There may be a method to the madness. He might be trying to confuse world leaders. But the market is saying stop confusing us. we don’t like this.”
    


            Trump’s threat on Friday added more uncertainty into an economy that has shown cracks in its foundation and could be in danger of slipping if businesses and consumers grow nervous about the administration’s economic policy. Layoffs are mounting, hiring is slowing, consumer confidence is eroding and inflation is picking up again.
    


            Tariffs could worsen all of those factors.
    


            Canada charges exorbitant tariffs on certain dairy products, including a 241% tariff on milk, much to the consternation of America’s dairy farmers, who have complained for years that the border nation is treating them unfairly.
    


            In 2023, a trade dispute panel ruled in favor of Canada, arguing that the high import taxes did not violate the USMCA. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin lambasted the decision, arguing it was creating an undue burden on her state’s dairy industry.
    


            “Wisconsin dairy farmers work hard every day to bring world class products to market, and they deserve a level playing field with their global competitors,” Baldwin said in the wake of the November 2023 decision. “This decision flies in the face of the agreement our country made with Canada and puts our Made in Wisconsin dairy products at a disadvantage.”
    


            But Trump, who frequently complained about high dairy tariffs in his first term in office, did not negotiate more reasonable tariffs into the USMCA treaty, which he signed.
    


            Despite the grievances and the alarmingly high number, Canadian dairy is not a significant export, and a reciprocal 241% tariff on milk is unlikely to do significant economic damage to either country.
    


            Trump has been criticizing Canadian tariffs on US lumber for several weeks, claiming America should respond in kind. He has claimed America can do without Canadian lumber.
    


            An executive order Trump signed Saturday said America has an “abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs.” It’s not quite that simple, industry experts argue: They warn tariffs could end up increasing lumber and building costs — and even push up housing prices for consumers.
    


            The United States has 300 billion trees, but economists and homebuilders caution that America does not currently have the industrial capacity to meet the demand and that placing a significant tariff on Canadian lumber imports could further exacerbate the ongoing housing affordability crisis.
    


            Lumber is a critical ingredient in the US homebuilding industry, and the United states sources about 30% of the softwood lumber it uses annually from Canada. Lumber imports from Canada are already subject to countervailing and anti-dumping duties of 14.5%.

President Donald Trump discusses his latest talks with Iran, shedding light on how he prefers to negotiate a deal.

President Donald Trump on Friday revealed that he has sent a letter to Iran warning that it can either ""make a deal"" with Washington, D.C., on its nuclear program or face the U.S. ""militarily.""

""I said, I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for Iran,"" Trump told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo on ""Mornings with Maria,"" in reference to a letter he sent to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

""There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal,"" he said. ""I would prefer to make a deal, because I'm not looking to hurt Iran.""

Trump did not go into detail about what a nuclear deal with Iran would look like or how it would differ from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was agreed to by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, including China, France, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. under the Obama administration, along with Germany and the European Union. 

But Trump pulled the U.S. out of the JCPOA in 2018, effectively collapsing the agreement, and Tehran has since continuously violated the terms under the previous agreement. He again implemented a maximum pressure campaign against Tehran and just last month he signed an executive order on ""Restoring Maximum Pressure on Iran.""

""We have to do something, because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

RUSSIAN MISSILE EXPERTS VISITED IRAN AMID GROWING MILITARY TIES

The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has repeatedly warned in recent months that Iran is pushing forward in its development of near-nuclear-grade uranium and now possesses enough uranium, if further enriched, to develop five nuclear weapons. 

The Washington, D.C.-based Iranian watchdog, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, has also warned that it is not just the chemical components of the weapon that Tehran has been developing, but the technical ability to launch a nuclear warhead. 

The Iranian regime has not yet commented on the correspondence that Trump apparently sent out on Thursday. 

""I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,"" Trump argued, noting that time is running out to make a deal.

""I hope that Iran [is]…going to negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,"" Trump warned. 

Russia has reportedly offered to serve as a mediator in the U.S. talks with Iran, though Trump did not comment on whether that would happen.

FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo previews her exclusive interview with President Donald Trump and his reasoning for the most recent tariff negotiation.

In an effort to provide clarity over his latest tariff negotiations, President Donald Trump explained why he approved another one-month pause on the 25% levy on Canada and Mexico.

""I wanted to help Mexico and Canada to a certain extent. We're a big, big country, and they do a lot of their business with us, whereas in our case, it's much less significant. We do very little with Canada by comparison. And I wanted to help the American carmakers until April 2nd. April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,"" Trump told FOX Business’ Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive interview.

""But this is short-term. And I felt that for the good of the American carmakers and the USMCA… I thought it would be a fair thing to do,"" the president continued. ""And so I gave them a little bit of a break for this short period of time.""

On Thursday, Trump announced he would exempt most goods from Canada and Mexico covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from his 25% tariffs for the next month.

TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: ‘I’M NOT WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION' FROM TARIFFS

The tariffs went into effect earlier this week and are now set to be reinstated on April 2. After Trump enacted them, Canada also said it would place reciprocal, retaliatory tariffs on the U.S.

President Donald Trump sits for an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo. (FOXBusiness)

""The tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up,"" Trump expanded with Bartiromo.

""For years, the globalists, the big globalists, have been ripping off the United States. They've been taking money away from the United States. And all we're doing is getting some of it back, and we're going to treat our country fairly,"" he added.

'The Big Money Show' co-hosts deliberate on President Trump's tariff strategy, and what it means for the economy and American consumers.

As part of his Day One initiatives, Trump said tariffs would be placed on America’s trade neighbors after declaring fentanyl deaths a national emergency. 

He said the drug makes its way from China to the U.S. via Mexican and Canadian imports.

Company receiving $7.5 million in loan proceeds from Oaktree in advance of the recapitalization; will receive additional capital at the closing of the recapitalization transaction; and announces delisting from the NYSE


NORTHBROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pinstripes Holdings, Inc. (“Pinstripes” or the “Company”) (OTC: PNST), a best-in-class experiential dining and entertainment brand combining bistro, bowling, bocce and private event space, today announced that it has entered into a binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”), an affiliate of the holders of the majority of its outstanding debt. Under the terms of the LOI, Oaktree is providing additional funding on similar loan terms to their prior commitments, and upon closing of the recapitalization transactions contemplated by the LOI will become the majority equity holder of the Company and will elect the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), with current stockholders retaining an equity interest and additionally being issued warrants providing for potential upside participation. The Company’s entry into the LOI follows extensive negotiations with Oaktree as the Company sought to maximize value for all of its stakeholders. Once completed, the recapitalization will reduce Pinstripes’ cash interest obligations, provide additional liquidity for operations and financial flexibility, and better position the Company for long-term success and new store development. Notably, the issuance of warrants to existing stockholders as contemplated by the LOI may enable such stockholders to potentially benefit from growth in the Company’s value should the business successfully implement its plan. The LOI has been approved by the Company’s Board upon the recommendation of a special committee of the Board consisting solely of independent, disinterested directors (the “Special Committee”).





""We are pleased to announce these transactions, which strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our financial flexibility for the benefit of the Company and its key stakeholders – investors, customers, vendors, and team members,"" said Dale Schwartz, Founder/CEO of Pinstripes. ""The last year has proven challenging, and I am grateful for the dedication and hard work of our Pinstripes Team Members. Collectively, this announcement represents an important step in the revitalization of Pinstripes’ existing business, and demonstrates the confidence that investors have in our long-term success. We are appreciative of the support we have received from our lenders – Oaktree, Silverview and Granite Creek – and look forward to taking the further steps to improve Pinstripes' business and create substantial value for all our stakeholders.”



Oaktree, a leading alternative investment firm with $202 billion in assets under management, has committed to provide an incremental investment to strengthen Pinstripes’ balance sheet and support its leadership team’s strategic vision.



The closing of the recapitalization transaction contemplated by the LOI is subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive documentation and the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions to closing. Further details of the LOI and the recapitalization transaction are set forth in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).



Additionally, on March 5, 2025, the NYSE notified the Company and publicly disclosed that it has determined to commence proceedings to delist the Company’s class A common stock, as a result of the Company’s non-compliance with Rule 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that requires listed companies to maintain an average global market capitalization of at least $15 million over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. Trading of the class A common stock on the NYSE was suspended after market close on March 5, 2025. The NYSE will apply to the SEC to delist the class A common stock upon completion of all applicable procedures. The Company has informed the NYSE that it will not appeal the delisting determination and accordingly, the Company’s class A common stock will be delisted from the NYSE. The Company's class A common stock is now trading on the OTC Pink Market operated by the OTC Market Group Inc., and the Company has not yet made any determination with respect to suspending its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.



Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP is serving as legal advisor and Piper Sandler & Co is serving as investment banker and financial advisor to Pinstripes, and Ropes & Gray LLP is serving as legal advisor to the Pinstripes Special Committee. White & Case LLP is serving as legal advisor to Oaktree.

It's time to start thinking about planning that summer vacation so Amie Mitchell with the Better Business Bureau joined News On 6 to talk about how not to fall victim to scams when you head out.

Research thoroughly before booking:

Check companies on BBB.org, read reviews, and verify the legitimacy of vacation deals that seem too good to be true.

Be wary of “free” vacation offers:

These offers often come with hidden costs, such as mandatory sales meetings, taxes, or transportation fees. Always read the fine print carefully.

Protect your personal information:

Use secure Wi-Fi at hotels instead of free public networks and avoid sharing sensitive details with unsolicited vacation offer representatives.

Mitchell stressed that careful research and vigilance are essential for staying safe from vacation scams this summer.

Global sports and entertainment agency 54 has been shortlisted for Agency of the Year at the FEVO Sport Industry Awards alongside some of UK sport’s leading entities. 

The recognition follows a landmark year in which 54 expanded its service provision, achieved record revenues in excess of $200m, extended into new international territories with new offices in Spain, Vietnam and significant growth in Saudi Arabia, and surpassed 200 members of an ever-growing team.

The agency also pursued an ambitious growth strategy, acquiring or investing into five portfolio brands, significantly broadening its offering and impact across sport. 2024 was also the year in which 54 performed a full organisational rebrand (from Performance54), setting the foundations for an exciting future.

The FEVO Sport Industry Awards celebrate the best in UK sport, with Agency of the Year in its prestigious Premium category. Consideration criteria included the agency’s ability to stand out from competitors, drive industry innovation, demonstrate business growth, retain key clients, and secure new partnerships.

Adding to the momentum, 54 has once again been named in the Financial Times’ FT1000 list of Europe’s fastest-growing companies, ranking 153rd overall – the highest placement of any sports-focused agency. This marks the second time 54 has made the list, having also ranked in the top 200 in 2021.

Jed Moore, 54’s Group CEO, said: “It’s an honour to be included alongside some of the industry’s top agencies shortlisted for Sport Industry Awards’ Agency of the Year, as well as in the FT1000, and it’s a testament to the incredible work of our team in what has been another seismic year for us.

“These developments recognise our firm belief that sport needs transformative allies. There’s a real pioneering spirit at 54 – not just in supporting stakeholders across the industry, but in leveraging sport as a driver of economic and social development, and we’re thankful to all of our partners for the opportunity to demonstrate this.”

There was further success for 54’s partners at the FEVO Sport Industry Awards, with England Golf nominated in the Sports Organisation of the Year and Wellness at Work categories, while Rick Shiels made the shortlist for The Rick Shiels Golf Show in the Sports Podcast Award category.

The winners will be announced on May 15 at an awards ceremony at Evolution London. The full set of shortlists can be found here. Find more on 54, visit weare54.com.

Pitch Wharf, the new flagship venue from indoor golf brand Pitch, has officially opened in the heart of London's financial district.

Tesla (TSLA) stock fell as much as 4% on Friday, bringing its losses from a record close to nearly 50% as it continues to see its post-election rally fade.

This drop in shares of the EV carmaker prompted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives — one of the electric vehicle maker’s biggest bulls on Wall Street — to issue a forceful defense of the stock, doubling down on his bullish views during what he calls a ""gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves).""

In a note to clients published late Thursday, Ives wrote ""the time has come"" to defend the stock, with Ives adding Tesla to the firm's ""Best Ideas List"" and reiterating his Outperform rating and $550 price target on the name.

Ives's call came after Tesla stock fell 5.7% Thursday, a move that followed others on the Street saying CEO Elon Musk’s controversial association with the Trump administration was clouding sentiment on the stock.

Tesla stock closed at a record of over $479 on Dec. 17 and hit an intraday high of roughly $488 the following day. Shares were closer to $260 in midday trade on Friday and set to close at their lowest level since Nov. 5.

""There have been a number of times in the Tesla story over the past decade that negative sentiment and Street worries have overshadowed the narrative of this unique disruptive global tech story,"" Ives wrote.

""From the white knuckle production moments in 2017/2018 to financing worries to the Musk/Twitter soap opera in 2022 ... and now here again Tesla bulls find themselves with their back against the wall facing global negative sentiment around Musk/DOGE and the Trump Administration.

""This is a gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves) after this massive sell-off in Tesla shares with fears mounting.""

Ives holds the highest price target for Tesla among the 48 Wall Street analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. On average, Wall Street analysts have a $346 per share price target on the stock over the next 12 months. Shares closed Thursday's trading sessions at $263.

Tesla stock in February recorded its biggest decline to date.

Shares have given up nearly all of their gains that followed the election of Donald Trump. Musk became one of Trump's key surrogates on the campaign trail in the final months of the 2024 election.

In Ives's view, Musk's foray into politics puts less than 5% of Tesla's global sales at risk despite what Ives calls ""the global draconian narrative for Musk.""

""Importantly,"" Ives added, ""we expect Musk will better balance his time between DOGE and Tesla/SpaceX over the course of 2025 and some of these distraction issues will fade. We continue to believe the best thing that ever happened to Musk and Tesla was Trump in the White House as this will create a deregulatory environment with a federal autonomous roadmap central to the Tesla golden strategic vision.""

Ives also reaffirmed his view that Tesla’s autonomous driving efforts outweigh near-term demand concerns for its EVs and said that they, along with the company's push into robotics, could put the company north of $2 trillion in value.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin discusses how DOGE exposed the wasteful spending on a vacant migrant shelter on ‘The Bottom Line.’

EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says it is ending collective bargaining for Transportation Security Officers with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). 

In a release obtained exclusively by FOX Business, DHS said the TSA has more people doing ""full-time union work"" rather than performing screening functions at 86% of U.S. airports. 

This means that out of 432 federalized airports, 374 airports have fewer than 200 TSA Officers to perform screening functions. These officers are paid by the government but work ""full-time on union matters"" and do not retain certification to perform screening functions, DHS said. 

MASSIVE POWER OUTAGE AT BWI AIRPORT IMPACTS THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS WITH EXTENSIVE DELAYS

The department cited a recent TSA employee survey which found that more than 60% of ""poor performers"" are allowed to stay employed and ""not surprisingly, continue to not perform.""   

DHS said these circumstances have impeded TSA’s chief responsibility ""to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.""  

DHS argued that eliminating collective bargaining will make airports more efficient by removing ""bureaucratic hurdles that will enhance productivity, and lower passengers' wait times in security lines.""

DHS said Transportation Security Officers will now be promoted based on their performance, not longevity or union membership. 

""Thanks to [DHS] Secretary Noem’s action, Transportation Security Officers will no longer lose their hard-earned dollars to a union that does not represent them. The Trump Administration is committed to returning to merit-based hiring and firing policies,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. 

BOEING ELIMINATES CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER ‘LEGACY’ ROLE AS PART OF LEADERSHIP SHIFT

""This action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized [workforce] across the nation’s transportation networks—meaning shorter airport security wait times. TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.""  

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents TSOs, has pushed back on DHS' claims, saying TSOs who volunteer as union representatives account for less than half a percent of all work hours performed at TSA, with fewer union representatives nationwide at TSA than the number of total screeners at 86% of individual federal airports. 

""47,000 Transportation Security Officers show up at over 400 airports across the country every single day to make sure our skies are safe for air travel. Many of them are veterans who went from serving their country in the armed forces to wearing a second uniform protecting the homeland and ensuring another terrorist attack like Sept. 11 never happens again,"" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement, characterizing Friday's announcement as an ""unprovoked attack"" by DHS Secretary Noem and the Trump administration.

""They gave as a justification a completely fabricated claim about union officials – making clear this action has nothing to do with efficiency, safety, or homeland security. This is merely a pretext for attacking the rights of regular working Americans across the country because they happen to belong to a union,"" Kelley said. ""Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion. Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.""

				Sponsorship & Events 

Women’s Golf Day is launching a series of Elevated Events which have been specially curated by WGD founder Elisa Gaudet and her team. 

The WGD Signature Series tees off with a community activation on March 8, International Women’s Day, at The Park West Palm Beach in Florida, USA, where a group of 60 women will participate in a golf and social event inspired by the IWD 2025 message of ‘Accelerate Action’.

Additional Elevated Events in the Signature Series are planned to run in conjunction with other significant events, including PGA Tour tournaments, or around key dates in the year. The format of the events will mirror the WGD format, with a combination of golf for all abilities and a social activity. Speakers and panelists will be sourced by the WGD team who will also execute delivery of the events.

“We have delivered similar events for some of our corporate partners, including RBC at the Canadian Open,” explains Gaudet. “Bringing women together is a powerful way of creating connection and allows friendships, business and golf to evolve in parallel.  

“We want to provide more opportunities for women to access golf, so it makes sense to support the brands and organizations who also recognise this by amplifying their involvement with larger golf tournaments and adding an elevated experience for women. Rather than an afterthought, these events are a celebration of our sport that make women feel welcome.”

Golf facilities looking to host a Women’s Golf Day event between May 27- June 3 can register now at www.womensgolfday.com/register

Pitch Wharf, the new flagship venue from indoor golf brand Pitch, has officially opened in the heart of London's financial district.

The event, the second of its type for Golf Accountancy Matters, bought together many of the 50-plus golf clubs that the company work with to discuss best practices in golf club accounting and bookkeeping, and to listen to the four guest speakers invited to talk at the conference.

Banyan Group, a leading independent global, multi-branded hospitality group, has announced the renewal of its partnership with the PGA of GB&I.

BERLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Huangshan Tourism Development Co., Ltd., the operator of Huangshan, a renowned UNESCO World Natural and Cultural Heritage site, made its appearance at the ITB Berlin, which opened on March 4, attracting widespread attention.





“This is our sixth consecutive participation in ITB Berlin, demonstrating our commitment to promoting Huangshan to the international market, attracting more global visitors, and continuously enhancing the internationalization of Huangshan tourism.” Zhang Dehui, chairman of Huangshan Tourism Development (HSTD), said, “At the same time, we aim to strengthen diversified cooperation with our international peers.”



“We are delighted to have exhibitors like Huangshan Tourism, which is very important to the success of our exhibition. Huangshan is not only a famous tourist destination in China but also highly attractive to visitors from around the world,” Nikolaos Swoch, director ITB China, said.



The theme of HSTD for this year's exhibition is “The world of Huangshan is for the world.”



“In recent years, we have accelerated our international development efforts. On one hand, we have fully leveraged Huangshan's rich natural and cultural tourism resources to attract an increasing number of international visitors.” Zhang added, “On the other hand, we have strengthened cooperation with international tourism enterprises, achieving significant results and exploring more opportunities for global integration.”



On behalf of TUI, the world’s largest multinational leisure, travel and tourism company, Dr. Guido Brettschneider, signed a cooperation agreement with HSTD at the ITB.



“We are very pleased to have reached a cooperation agreement with Huangshan during the exhibition. Huangshan boasts stunning tourism resources and is highly attractive to international visitors,” said Dr. Guido.



According to HSTD, as the first publicly listed company in China's tourism industry, it has developed over the years into a diversified business covering the operation of Huangshan Scenic Area, multiple other natural and cultural attractions, as well as travel agency services, catering, and smart tourism.



Notably, the company has independently developed the Huangshan AI Travel Assistant and fully integrated it with the DeepSeek, one of the most advanced AI large language model worldwide, making it the first scenic area in China to apply the AI application in the cultural and tourism sector.



“I have seen Huangshan in videos and pictures. It's absolutely amazing! I am really looking forward to traveling there,” William Allen, director at National Geographic said.

Attendees to the recent Workshop & Golf Business Conference, arranged by Golf Accountancy Matters and hosted at Kingswood Golf & Country Club in Surrey, have proclaimed it a great success.

The event, the second of its type for Golf Accountancy Matters, bought together many of the 50-plus golf clubs that the company work with to discuss best practices in golf club accounting and bookkeeping, and to listen to the four guest speakers invited to talk at the conference.

In the first section, much of the emphasis was on how golf clubs and Golf Accountancy Matters can streamline their processes to reduce workload, increase accuracy and save money in the preparation of the golf club’s accounts. Golf Accountancy Matters adopt modern technologies to greatly assist in this regard, with an end-to-end solution that integrates the accounting software package, Xero, with Intelligent Golf. In addition, Datamolino provides for paperless billing and ApprovalMax for invoice payment authorisation – further adding to the timesaving in accounts preparation.

In the second section, delegates, largely comprising golf club managers, bookkeepers, accountants and treasurers, heard from Ben Hoskin of Regency Purchasing about the modern technologies being used to help supplier management in the food, beverage and hospitality areas.

Sam Hodson, Principle at Hillier Hopkins LLP, spoke next about some of the new accounting guidelines imminently coming into force, as well as valuable information about VAT partial exemption and golf club incorporation – two areas that private-member clubs need to understand in their relationship with taxation as non-profit organisations.

Mike Ramsey and Julian Curtis, from Centennial Investment Management, gave a joint presentation on their recent experience of an attempted bank fraud. It was both fascinating and terrifying in equal measure and opened everyone’s eyes to the high level of sophistication now being adopted by fraudsters. Fortunately, Mike and Julian’s experience of banking helped them recover the temporarily lost funds, but not without considerable stress and sleeplessness.

Finally, as the keynote speaker, Ben Sharpe, Managing Director & President of Callaway Golf, EMEA Division, took to the stage to give an insightful talk on his views of increasing participation in the game. Ben spoke about how we, as an industry, need to move from initiatives to grow the game, to embedding it within our mindset. 

Ben spoke of how technology can lead the way and facilitate growth. During his 45-minute presentation, he recalled his own career experiences as an industry leader of the gamification of the golf range through Topgolf and later, Toptracer, and how these new technologies revolutionised even the concept of playing golf and participation.

Paul Mould, Director at Golf Accountancy Matters, commented, “the event went really well, and it was great to see so many of our clients under one roof. It was an invaluable opportunity to not only talk about some of the latest initiatives and technologies we’re adopting, but also to share best practices in golf club bookkeeping and accounts.”

“A big thank you to our guest speakers, who each gave very different, but equally interesting and insightful, information on their areas of expertise. And of course, thank you must also go out to all attendees. They made the event by their enthusiasm and engagement.”

Plans are already in motion of Golf Accountancy Matters 3rd Annual Workshop & Golf Business Conference later in the year. For more details, visit www.golfaccountancymatters.co.uk.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,New EP+Co President Kat Shafer embraces role shaping agency’s future,https://upstatebusinessjournal.com/business-news/new-epco-president-kat-shafer-embraces-role-shaping-agencys-future/,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 14:11:30 GMT","

EP+Co President Kat Shafer is surprised anyone knows she not only helped launch Clemson University’s first varsity rowing team — eventually earning a full scholarship in the sport — but also was Clemson’s first-ever All-ACC women’s rower.

It all seems so long ago for someone whose career took her from Clemson, where she graduated in 2002, to Greenville for a brief stint doing marketing work for a financial services firm, then on to EP+Co as a junior account executive, a move that eventually took her to the agency’s New York City office.

“I started at the bottom and just worked my way up. It only took 20 years,” she says, laughing.

In that time, Shafer remained on the account-management track. After earning an executive MBA from Clemson in 2006, she rose in 2016 to managing director before joining the C-Suite as chief client officer in 2020, a post she held until September 2024. That’s when her mentor, EP+Co founder and former president Allen Bosworth, chose her as his successor.

But while it is now firmly ensconced in Shafer’s past, rowing remains deeply rooted in her heart, molding the ethic that, as EP+Co president, shapes an entire ethos.

“Rowing for Clemson taught me that the best kind of leader is the one who lives by example,” she says. “Even now, I want to stay on the pitch, be in the room, and always be available. It comes down to fully committing to something and consistently working toward the objective.”

Shafer, whose roots extend from Greenville, through Clemson and into northeast Georgia, says the 16 years she spent in EP+Co’s New York office were both fascinating and challenging. And when she returned to Greenville, she enjoyed seeing how the place had grown, and changed.

“I’ve been gone 16 years — eight in Manhattan and eight in New Jersey — and life has changed a lot, as has Greenville,” she says. “It’s a great place to raise a family.”

EP+Co, the agency of record for a host of heavy-hitting brands such as Planet Oat, John Deere and Michelin, boasts about 130 employees between its Greenville and New York offices with another 30 in remote roles, Shafer says.

And as tectonic forces continue working on advertising business models great and small, she says EP+Co has found a sweet spot between traditional agency-of-record work and the rising demand for a more transactional, project-based approach demanded by a growing number of clients.

“In our industry, we’ve obviously seen a lot of internal hiring in marketing departments, but that still leads to project work, because those internal teams still outsource aspects of that work,” she says. “It’s more ‘madness’ than ‘Mad Men.’”

Shafer says about 40% of EP+Co’s work is on the project side, with the traditional agency-of-record space taking the other 60%.

“It’s a good, sustainable model for us,” she says.

Today’s marketers, Shafer says, want multiple experts working on different parts of the business, and given EP+Co’s remarkable retention rates (the average executive tenure is 14 years, while employee retention is six years), the agency is built to deliver on every client need.

Shafer says a top priority for her is positioning the agency name — and work — for continued success.

“By the end of 2025, I hope our name is more recognized nationally as we continue delivering for clients in unexpected ways, particularly in the evolving landscape now shaped by (artificial intelligence.)”

As she continues growing into the role of president, Shafer embraces the challenges still found in the everyday work.

“It’s never dull, never boring, and I’ve loved being part of our continuous evolution and transformation,” she says. “And I think of the people here as extensions of my family.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Walgreens: Boots owner bought by private equity firm in $10bn deal,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq0p27z69o,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:59:39 GMT","

The US owner of the Boots pharmacy chain is being taken over by a private equity firm in a $10bn (£7.8bn) deal.

The price being paid for Walgreens Boots Alliance is a fraction of what the company was worth a decade ago, reflecting its struggles with growing debt and shoppers going online for cheaper products. 

There have been reports that the Boots chain could be sold off separately by its new owner, US private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

Walgreens chief executive Tim Wentworth said the firm was navigating the ""challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape"".

""While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,"" he added.

George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, told the BBC's Today programme that Boots had been ""in and out of different ownership for some time"" and that ""its business model has struggled"".

""People are buying more of those personal healthcare brands online than they are in the shop.""

Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Savvy Marketing, said there would be ""a lot of interested parties"" if the Boots business was put up for sale.

She said the company had turned itself around after going through a difficult period and it was an ""unbelievably trusted brand"" with ""a unique place in the UK psyche"".

There are now 1,900 Boots stores left in the UK after the pharmacy chain began closing shops in June 2023 as part of a shake up.

Ms Shuttleworth said reports of a Boots sale would be difficult for staff.

""Any uncertainty over your ownership is going to make you quite concerned if you work for Boots.""

Boots has been contacted for comment.

Sycamore Partners is paying $11.45 per share for Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is more than its shares are currently worth on the US stock market.

Walgreens shares rose by nearly 6% in extended trading in New York. But the company's stock market value has fallen by around 80% over the past five years.

The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

The Illinois-based Walgreens took a 45% stake in Boots in 2012.

It bought the remainder of the firm two years later in a deal that valued Boots at around £9bn.

Walgreens is also made up of its namesake US retail business, specialty pharmacy group Shields Health Solutions and healthcare provider VillageMD.

In recent years, the company has faced mounting challenges as customers turned to cheaper rivals.

In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale but later dropped these plans, saying potential buyers had been unable to raise enough funds.

In October, it announced plans to shut 1,200 Walgreens stores in the US over the next three years under a cost-cutting programme.

The US government accused the university of ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"".

Prosecutors want new text messages to be used as evidence in the trial of Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four college students.

Two unvaccinated people were killed in a rapidly spreading outbreak that has sickened more than 220.

FTSE 100 drops and is on track for its worst week in a year, as Germany’s Dax index slides



European stock markets have slumped after Donald Trump’s second reversal on tariffs caused deep uncertainty among investors, while the euro was on track for its biggest weekly rise since the financial crisis.

Germany’s Dax index dropped by 1.6%, as weak factory data added to the signs of difficult economic conditions. France’s Cac 40 fell by 1.2%, while London’s FTSE 100 dropped by 0.5% on Friday morning, after the US benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8% on Thursday night to its lowest level since early November.

The FTSE 100 was on track for its worst week of the year, while the Stoxx 600 index, which tracks big companies across the UK and EU, has dropped by about 1% this week.

Investors around the world have been trying to work out the Trump administration’s economic policies, after a chaotic cycle of tariff imposition followed by temporary reverses. Trump paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Thursday for the second time, meaning they will not be imposed until April.

The prospect of a trade war with the US’s two closest trading partners, and with China, the country’s third biggest, has led to warnings of a big economic hit to the global economy, as well as inflationary pressure in the US.

Trump has blamed “globalists” for the market sell-offs that have greeted his trade war against the US’s closest economic partners.

Asked on Thursday if his tariffs were scaring investors, Trump said: “Well, a lot of them are globalist countries and companies that won’t be doing as well. Because we’re taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago.”

Questions over Trump’s commitment to aiding the US’s traditional military allies have also prompted European countries – most notably Germany – to say they will borrow more to raise defence spending.

That has strengthened the euro, as investors anticipate higher interest rates in response to looser fiscal policy, as well as weaker US economic growth if Trump pursues his trade war. The euro on Thursday rose 0.5% to hit a four-month high of $1.086 against the US dollar, putting the single currency on course for its best week in 16 years during the turmoil of the global financial crisis.

The defence spending promises have also meant that the Dax is up by 2% this week, despite Friday’s share price decline.

Strategists led by Sebastian Raedler at Bank of America, a US investment bank, said investors were feeling “overwhelmed by the rapid succession of high-profile macro news”.

However, they said that “on balance, the macro news flow points to weaker global growth ahead”. US tariffs would slow the Chinese economy, while Germany’s spending increases were not likely to spur growth in the short term.

The prospect of lower growth has hit tech stocks. On Thursday, the Nasdaq index fell into a correction, more than 10% below its record high.

Oil prices were on course for the biggest weekly drop since October amid fears of slower growth, which could weigh on demand. However, prices rallied on Friday by 1.6%.

Bitcoin prices dropped 2.7% on Friday, although the biggest cryptocurrency has gained 11% in the last seven days after Trump said the US would create a strategic crypto reserve.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The agreement will see Smith continue to lead 'First Take,' while freeing him up to pursue other options outside of sports.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


ESPN‘s superstar commentator Stephen A. Smith has inked a new long-term deal with the sports media giant.


	The deal, which could top nine figures per The Athletic, will see Smith continue to lead First Take, his flagship weekday show. He will also appear on other ESPN programming.




	However it also allows Smith to pursue other deals for programming that touches politics, culture, or other topics.


	“I’m happy and honored to remain a member of the Disney/ESPN family for, at least, the next five years,” Smith said. “There’s only bigger and bigger things ahead. It starts with continuing to put in that work. See y’all soon.”

	“Stephen A. works incredibly hard to elevate the sports conversation day-in and day-out and we are grateful he will remain at ESPN,” added Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman. “He is a difference maker, and fans are captivated by his deep sports knowledge, strong opinions and unmistakable flair.”


	When The Hollywood Reporter spoke to Smith last year about hus contract discussions with ESPN, Smith suggested that he was thinking bigger and broader about what he could be doing for the company, which is navigating the shift from linear TV to digital.


	“When we talk about adapting, ESPN is adapting from the standpoint of looking at the media landscape, the advent of podcasting and podcasters, the digital stratosphere, YouTube becoming the new television platform in a lot of people’s eyes and adapting to the inordinate amount of competition that’s coming from other places and saying, ‘okay, how can we maintain relevancy and ultimately continue to stand afloat above the crowd?’” Smith said. “That’s the challenge that ESPN has, and I view myself as a pivotal component to ensuring that that remains the state of affairs when it comes to ESPN and Walt Disney.”

Pitch Wharf, the new flagship venue from indoor golf brand Pitch, has officially opened in the heart of London’s financial district.

With a prime riverside location on Churchill Place, Pitch Wharf is laid out across two levels with floor-to-ceiling windows offering spectacular views of the Canary Wharf skyline.

The venue boasts 11 golf simulator bays with Trackman technology, ideal for both teaching and playing, while everyone can relax and socialise in the stylish bars, enjoy live DJ sets, or challenge friends to a game of shuffleboard. 

Pitch Wharf also includes a TRENDYGOLF Concept Store stocking apparel and footwear from luxury brands including Adidas, Malbon Golf, Manors, Ralph Lauren RLX, Hugo Boss and J.Lindeberg.

Pitch Wharf provides an extensive Asian-inspired food offering called JIYŪ, complemented by two stylish bars and an enticing cocktail menu.

The opening of Pitch’s third venue in the city was celebrated with a star-studded party on February 27 as media, influencers and celebrity guests came together to enjoy the 15,000 square feet space for the first time.



Just like its sister locations, the venue can also host a wide range of events, with full exclusive-hire options available and numerous sections able to be booked out for private use. In addition, Pitch Wharf’s fantastic location makes it the perfect place for a business catch up, meeting or to work – while membership can be purchased, the venue is open to anyone looking for a spot to grab a coffee.

Elliot Godfrey, co-founder and CEO of Pitch, said: “With a vibrant atmosphere and so many busy professionals living and working in the area, Canary Wharf is the perfect place to open what we consider to be the new flagship venue. We are pushing the boundaries with this new venue, as we strive to disrupt and deliver new dynamic spaces in cities across the UK and around the world.”

Fellow co-founder and CEO Chris Ingham, added: “The Canary Wharf project has been a labour of love for us and to receive such positive feedback from the launch evening was special.  To be bestowed with a location like this one is testament to the success of our other venues and our outstanding team; we’re very excited for what the future holds both in London and globally.”

After opening its first two venues in London, Pitch opened its first overseas location in Dublin last year and will continue to expand with venues in Manchester and Birmingham in 2025. The brand has announced plans to grow further internationally, with Melbourne among the locations touted to open a Pitch venue in the future.

The event, the second of its type for Golf Accountancy Matters, bought together many of the 50-plus golf clubs that the company work with to discuss best practices in golf club accounting and bookkeeping, and to listen to the four guest speakers invited to talk at the conference.

Banyan Group, a leading independent global, multi-branded hospitality group, has announced the renewal of its partnership with the PGA of GB&I.

			9.30am 7th March 2025	 -
				Greenkeeping & Agronomy 

Over the last two years, Lincoln-based Greenstripe Groundcare has seen remarkable growth, largely thanks to the addition of the Iseki TG6507 compact tractor.

Owner James Pask attributes the company’s increased productivity, efficiency, and premium client base directly to the versatility and performance of this high-specification machine.

By incorporating the TG6507 into daily operations, Greenstripe Groundcare has expanded its services, allowing them to take on more high-end contracts, including golf and football clubs and cricket grounds.

The ability to attach high-quality implements and transport them without using a trailer has significantly improved productivity and the quality of work, ensuring that Greenstripe can easily meet the professional aesthetic demands of sports pitches and fine turf maintenance.

“The Iseki TG6507 has been absolutely instrumental in growing the business over the last two years,” says James. “It’s enabled a very significant uplift in productivity, in efficiency of operation, and the reach of the customer that I was trying to bring into the business as well.

“With the quality implements that you can put on to the tractor, the kind of aesthetic that we’re looking for golf and football clubs and cricket fields is much easier to attain, and that’s what has helped us grow”

One of the standout features of the TG6507 is its IQ gearbox, which was a key requirement for James when selecting the tractor. The IQ gearbox allows for smooth, responsive shifting on the go, eliminating the need to set speed with pedals or rely on cruise control. James praises the three-range system, which ensures the right gear ratio is always available.

“This version does have the IQ gearbox, which was a specific want and need of mine over the hydrostatic box,” he explains. “For operating in fields like where I am today, I felt it would be much more convenient, and you’d get much more consistent performance.

“It has actually been an absolute joy to use. I have never been wanting for another ratio to turn around or to push on when I’m going down a straight, so it is a really good transmission.”

Another key factor in Greenstripe’s growth has been the TG6507’s versatility. The C4+ front loader has significantly expanded the range of tasks the business can undertake. From cleaning compost heaps to moving logs and loading trailers using the well-designed joystick controls, it has proven indispensable.

Whilst the productivity and quality produced by using the TG6507 have been standouts for James, his positive Iseki experience began when he first enquired about the tractor with his local Iseki dealer, Chandlers.

“I’ve had absolutely brilliant sales advice and service from Chandlers,” James notes. “When I was looking into buying the machine, I had various questions, which were very well addressed.

“When I took delivery of the machine, the handover was with the Chandlers sales rep and a senior Iseki representative as well, who made the time to come and do several hours walking around the machine to show me how to get the best out of it, and it really was a high-quality experience.”

On his experience overall, James concludes: “I absolutely would recommend the TG6 range, whichever part of the range is suitable for your needs. It has been a phenomenal tool to have.

“It’s manoeuvrability, fuel efficiency, what you can do with the soft controls in the cab when you want to fine-tune what you’re doing with your implement on the back, the versatility of the C4+ front loader, and it is just so reliable as well.

“It hasn’t let me down ever. So, I would say to anybody thinking, actually I need to upscale, should I look at something like this, absolutely go for it.”

The interiors and exterior of The Drifter Hotel on Tulane Avenue were ""restored to the 1950s appearance,"" the Louisiana Landmark Society said in 2018. ""Fortunately, this honored restoration converted this proto-typical example (of a mid-century motor motel) into the boutique 20-room Drifter Hotel,"" the citation said.

A new boutique hotel has opened in the 1950s-era motor lodge that until last year housed The Drifter Hotel, the hipster-friendly motel, bar and performance venue known for its clothing-optional pool.

The Drifter, which opened in 2017, was sold last year by the group that also operated the New Orleans boutique hotels Columns and Hotel Saint Vincent. 

Offering affordable passes for its adults-only heated pool, it became known as the site of lively parties and concerts along a decreasingly seedy stretch of Tulane Avenue in Mid-City. In 2019, it scored a spot on Architectural Digest's list of the ""chicest"" hotels in the nation.

In addition to sometimes topless sunbathers, the Drifter’s pool also hosted aquatic theatrical performances produced by Aqua Mob New Orleans.

A view of the pool area at The Drifter Hotel in Mid-City. The 20-room boutique hotel opened in 2017 in a renovated 1950s-era motel property on Tulane Avenue. 

Now known the Maidstone New Orleans, the latest version of the hotel that first opened in 1956 as the Crescent Motel officially opened Feb. 18 following a transformation by its new owners, ISMD.

The revamped mid-century space includes 18 rooms, two fewer than in its prior incarnation. All have been “extensively renovated” by a New York-based design agency and now feature custom tapestries made by a Oaxacan textile artist, according to a news release.

The poolside bar has been rebranded as the Maidstone Lounge, with the outdoor area now featuring a saltwater pool, a sunken fire pit and a menu of craft cocktails and small bites provided in partnership with local food vendors.

The 3522 Tulane Ave. property was purchased last year by an investment group that includes a celebrity attorney, a cannabis company CEO and a real estate investor awaiting trial for allegedly bribing a chief advisor for New York Mayor Eric Adams.

Mark Geragos, the Los Angeles-based lawyer who has represented Hunter Biden, Sean “Diddy” Combs and Michael Jackson, has partnered with Irwin Simon, who leads the publicly traded cannabis, beer and hemp food producer Tilray Brands, and Mayank Dwivedi, who faces charges of conspiracy and bribery stemming from allegations that he and a fellow hotelier paid kickbacks for building permits. Dwivedi, who is represented by Geragos's daughter in the case, pleaded not guilty last year.

Dwivedi has previously invested in New York hotel projects with Simon and Geragos, including the Maidstone Hotel in East Hampton with Simon and, with Geragos, the Capri Hotel in Southhampton.

The new owners aim to turn the hotel into “more of a four-star guest experience,” real estate broker Elizabeth Novit said last year.

Calls to the listed phone line for the Maidstone New Orleans, which is under separate management from its East Hampton operation, went unanswered, and hotel representatives did not respond Thursday to an email requesting further details.

The new ownership, which has announced plans for further expansion in New Orleans, has significantly hiked prices in its quest for swankiness.

Rooms at the Maidstone New Orleans are available starting at $295, before taxes and fees, according to its website.

The price for pool passes has also been increased, with drop-in passes now offered for $25 and annual memberships now $600, a representative told Axios New Orleans.

Both the room and pool rates are now about twice as high as they were under the hotel’s previous ownership.

Sale of Walgreens Boots Alliance to Sycamore Partners will mean further uncertainty for pharmacy chain staff

The US owner of Boots is to be taken private in a $10bn (£7.8bn) deal that will mean further uncertainty for thousands of workers at the UK-based pharmacy chain.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates more than 1,800 Boots stores in the UK, has been sold to the US private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The chain has been struggling as customers turn to online shopping for cheaper products.

Walgreens’ market value has collapsed by 90% since 2015 and is valued at $9.3bn. It has debt and lease obligations of $30bn.

Sycamore Partners has struck an $11.45-a-share deal for Walgreens Boots Alliance, giving it an equity value of about $10bn.

Sycamore is expected to retain the US retail business and sell or spin off the rest, including the UK chemist chain Boots, which traces its roots to John Boot’s first Nottingham store in 1849.

Boots has more than 50,000 employees, including at its headquarters in Nottingham, who face further uncertainty after more than three years of speculation over its future ownership.

In a letter to staff, seen by the Guardian, Ornella Barra, the head of Walgreens’ international business including Boots, said the deal was a significant development for the division, adding: “It’s important to note that nothing is changing today.”

In 2022, Walgreens put Boots up for sale with a suggested price tag of up to £10bn but later dropped the plans as potential buyers, including Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, the US private equity investor Apollo Global Management and Asda’s owners TDR Capital, struggled to raise funds. A plan to float the business at a valuation of about £7bn was dropped last year.

Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said Sycamore was likely to seek a swift sale of Boots to a private equity buyer in the first instance as it “will care more about making money now rather than later”.

Mould said “considerable headwinds” for UK retailers, including rising costs and low consumer confidence as household bills continued to rise amid global political and economic difficulties, may make Boots a tough sell. Fears are also growing for hundreds of WH Smith stores as its listed owner tries to sell its estate of more than 500 shops on the high street to focus on its more successful travel arm.

However, in recent years, Boots has improved its pricing, closed hundreds of ageing stores and improved its beauty ranges to benefit from a shift among young people towards spending on cosmetics and beauty products rather than fashion. It could also benefit from the Labour government’s shift towards primary healthcare in which pharmacies are expected to play a bigger role.

Patrick O’Brien at the retail analysts GlobalData said a successful sale of Boots would depend on whether Sycamore was prepared to accept a lower figure than the “ludicrous valuation” previously sought by Walgreens.

He said: “Boots has improved dramatically since then but the valuations that were talked about when they were trying to sell a while ago were ridiculous in terms of multiples of revenues or profits.”

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said: “The Boots business looks eminently floatable, but we will probably have to wait until this time next year to see it attempt an IPO as its new owner, Sycamore, won’t complete the takeover of Walgreens until [the last three months of] this year.”

Walgreens first took a stake in Boots in 2012 and completed a buyout two years later. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Boots said it was cutting 4,000 jobs, about 7% of its workforce, and shut almost 50 of its opticians branches.

Two years ago, the chain announced the closure of 300 shops, which it completed at the end of last year, as it “evolved” its store estate.

The deal will bring an end to Walgreens’ 98-year run as a listed company, although the second-largest pharmacy chain in the US still has 35 days to seek or entertain rival bids.

As part of the deal with Sycamore, the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina, the Walgreens executive chair and the largest shareholder, will keep a minority shareholding in the business. Barra told staff Pessina would remain a significant owner alongside Sycamore.

Pessina forged the transatlantic pharmacy company by merging the US-based Walgreens with Alliance Boots of Europe in 2014, having paid £4.3bn to take a 45% stake in the business in 2012.

The Pharmacists’ Defence Association (PDA) said news of the buyout “may be particularly worrying to pharmacists and other employees who have so recently seen what happened in the UK community pharmacy sector in the case of LloydsPharmacy [where the entire chain was broken up and sold off to independents].”

Walgreens’ market value peaked at $100bn soon after the completion of the merger but it has declined over the past decade as e-commerce has hit its high street trading operation.

Tim Wentworth, the chief executive of Walgreens, said the company was navigating the “challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

				Exhibitions & Conferences 

Following an outstanding 2024 event, GroundsFest 2025 is set to be even bigger, with significant growth in exhibitor numbers, stand space, and industry influence. 

The event’s rapid expansion highlights its position as the largest event for the grounds management and landscaping industries, offering exhibitors and visitors more brands, more networking, and more hands-on experiences than ever before.

The 2025 renewal, which takes place from September 9-10 at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire, is already shaping up to be the event’s most diverse yet, with leading industry names and exciting newcomers joining the GroundsFest community. Some of the new first-time exhibitors include, DEWALT, Bosch Outdoor Garden, AMAZONE Ltd, Martin Lishman, BLOCK BLITZ, Först, Wessex International and Trilo – to name just a few. 

The addition of these exhibitors — along with the overwhelming rebooking rate from returning companies — is a clear indicator of GroundsFest’s growing influence and industry-wide trust.

GroundsFest Sales Director Charles Neale said: “The speed at which GroundsFest is growing is simply phenomenal. The fact that 91% of last year’s exhibitors have already rebooked speaks volumes about the success of the event and the business opportunities it provides. 

“The increasing demand for space, the addition of 52 new exhibitors, and the support from the industry show that GroundsFest is exactly what the sector needed — an engaging, interactive, and accessible event that truly delivers for exhibitors and visitors alike.”

The federal government is launching a more than $6-billion aid package for businesses impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and relaxing some employment insurance (EI) rules to help workers.

Steven MacKinnon, Mary Ng and Rechie Valdez — the ministers of labour, international trade and small business — made the announcement Friday afternoon.

""We have tried and tested tools to get our people through the toughest of crises and we will not hesitate to use them,"" MacKinnon said.

As part of the supports for businesses, the government is providing $5 billion over two years for exporters to help them find new markets beyond the U.S. and a $500-million loan program through the Business Development Bank of Canada for businesses directly impacted by the tariffs.

Ottawa is also boosting the financing program for the agricultural sector — known as Farm Credit Canada — to the tune of $1 billion.

Ottawa announces billions to support businesses, relaxes some EI rules

The government is also temporarily relaxing rules around a program that allows employees to receive partial EI benefits while working reduced hours. The government says the temporary measures will increase access to the program and lengthen the time that those benefits are typically available.

In a partial climbdown on Thursday, Trump said he is pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2, offering a reprieve from across-the-board 25 per cent tariffs.

Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Canada would delay its second round of retaliatory tariffs, worth $125 billion, until April 2. That's when Trump's batch of ""reciprocal"" tariffs is due to be imposed on countries around the world. Canada has currently levied $30 billion worth of U.S. imports.

MacKinnon asked about calls for more EI changes amid U.S. tariffs 

Asked by reporters if further measures would be taken to support businesses and workers, MacKinnon said it would depend on how the situation unfolds.

""The ball seems to bounce every day. We have every intention of customizing a response to tariffs or no tariffs as the case may be. Our first duty is to make sure that these tariffs don't get imposed on Canada,"" he said.

MacKinnon noted has Trump employed ""chaotic messaging"" when trying to justify his tariffs.

""First this trade war was about securing the border and ending drug smuggling. Then it was about migration and the flow of people going south and then, puzzlingly, it was about American banks or the auto sector,"" he said.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump threatened to hit Canada's dairy and lumber industries with additional tariffs.

""Canada has been ripping us off for years,"" the president said.

Canada doesn't export any dairy products through its supply-management system.

Lumber, on the other hand, has been a consistent sticking point in Canada-U.S. relations for years.

The U.S. already imposes anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, but Trump is threatening to top those with additional tariffs.

Widespread U.S. tariffs would have a devastating effect on the Canadian economy, with experts saying it would lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses and wreak havoc in key sectors such as Ontario's auto industry.

American tariffs on all steel and aluminum are still due to come into effect next week. Canada is the leading exporter of both metals to the U.S.

Adventure Leisure, the group responsible for Mulligans, BUNKERS, Total Ninja and Ninja Warrior UK, is set to open its 14th Mulligans venue this summer.

Mulligans Guildford will feature two 9-hole crazy golf courses and a whole host of games and activities, taking over a two-floor, 17,000 square foot site in the Surrey town’s North Street.

Guests will be able to take on electro darts, American pool and electro-shuffleboard. The venue will also house some sports-related arcade games featuring classic games including air hockey, skeeball and basketball.

Mulligans Guildford will also boast a family-friendly sports bar area, featuring 100-inch TV screens with some booth seating, making sure sports fans don’t miss a minute of the action.

Whether guests fancy a snack or a full feast, the Mulligans team will be on hand to serve a variety of hot food including pizzas, sharing plates, nachos and more. Meanwhile, the bar will be fully stocked with a selection of great coffee, as well as soft and alcoholic drinks. The cherry on top of the F&B experience will be a dedicated ice cream and milkshake bar.

Mulligans Guildford is taking over the former sites of TGI Friday’s, Slice and Cinderella’s Nightclub and is being brought to life by internationally renowned designer Zachary Pulman, who also designed venues for global brands Swingers and Top Golf. The new venue will create over 30 jobs for local people, with recruitment for select roles already underway.

Stephen Brown, Adventure Leisure’s Chief Operating Officer, said, “We can’t wait to open our latest Mulligan’s venue in Guildford, we’ve had our eyes on it as a new site for quite some time. We have some really special plans for the golf courses in particular and it’s fantastic to be working with Zachary Pulman to bring everything to life.

“We’re in a really exciting period of growth for Adventure Leisure, following our new venue in Hemel Hempstead last year and with Mulligans Guildford opening soon. Through our expansion, we’re proud to be able to support the local communities we enter, including creating over 30 news jobs in Guildford.”

The Adventure Leisure group currently has 13 Mulligans sites across the UK which include venues in Basildon, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Bristol, Cheltenham, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Norwich, Sidcup, Stevenage, Tonbridge, and Worcester, with the most recent venue opening in Hemel Hempstead in 2024.

Adventure Leisure Limited is a subsidiary of Burhill Group Limited (BGL), which also operates 10 golf clubs and the BUNKERS! and Ninja Warrior UK brands.

Pitch Wharf, the new flagship venue from indoor golf brand Pitch, has officially opened in the heart of London's financial district.

The event, the second of its type for Golf Accountancy Matters, bought together many of the 50-plus golf clubs that the company work with to discuss best practices in golf club accounting and bookkeeping, and to listen to the four guest speakers invited to talk at the conference.

Banyan Group, a leading independent global, multi-branded hospitality group, has announced the renewal of its partnership with the PGA of GB&I.

Neuroscience research has only recently begun to prioritize the inclusion of both male and female lab animals in studies. Could we see that shift reverse?

Actions taken by the Trump administration have spurred changes at America's major science agencies — and if worst comes to worst, these shifts may jeopardize our understanding of how the brain works and how to treat neurological conditions, experts told Live Science.

For years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has upheld a policy that requires scientists who work with vertebrate animals to consider ""sex as a biological variable."" To earn grants, researchers must explain how their study designs account for sex, such that any differences between the sexes will be made apparent. Researchers must provide strong scientific justification to include only one sex in a study.

But recently, The Transmitter reported that the NIH seems to have archived this policy. The NIH has yet to issue an official statement on the matter, but the move followed executive orders issued by the Trump administration that called for overturning ""gender ideology"" and ""radical"" diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

In apparently archiving its ""sex as a biological variable"" policy, the NIH could be signaling a shift away from requiring both males and females in research. And such a shift could be particularly dire for basic neuroscience research.

Emerging animal research is revealing fundamental differences between male and female brains. These differences manifest in how sex hormones influence brains at the basic level of memory formation and neuronal firing, for example, and evidence suggests these differences may be relevant not just to lab animals, but also to humans. Failing to include both sexes in lab research could lead us to miss fundamental forces that shape the human brain and how drugs affect it.

""If the fundamental mechanisms by which molecules sculpt neurophysiology differ between the sexes, then we need to know that as early as possible in the process,"" said Catherine Woolley, a professor of neurobiology at the Northwestern University Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

Are male and female brains wired differently? The question has beguiled humanity for centuries, but scientists have only recently begun to find answers.

That's partly because, to uncover differences between males and females, you must study both sexes, including in research with lab animals. But scientists haven't done that until relatively recently.

Animal studies enable experiments that would be impossible with humans. Researchers can't slice living people's heads open, pluck out their neurons or implant electrodes with wild abandon.

Human subjects also come with baggage — namely, men and women are raised differently and have different life experiences. These cultural factors shape the brain alongside biological factors, like hormones and chromosomes, making it difficult to separate nature from nurture.

Historically, however, scientists simply ignored the variable of sex by excluding females altogether. This bias was particularly pronounced in neuroscience — one 2009 review found that studies with exclusively male lab animals outnumbered those with females 5.5-to-1.

There was a concern that the reproductive cycle of female lab animals would ""mess up the data, make it too variable,"" said Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago. That idea has been thoroughly debunked, but for a time, the prevailing viewpoint was, ""let's just study males and keep it simple,"" Eliot told Live Science.

Only in recent years has that attitude begun to shift.

Including female lab animals has led to findings that unseated long-held assumptions about how the brain works.

For instance, Woolley uses lab rats to study how the sex hormone estrogen drives synaptic plasticity, the brain's ability to dynamically strengthen or weaken connections between neurons over time. This process enables the ability to learn and form memories, and it also underlies the brain changes behind psychiatric conditions like addiction.

Woolley has shown that plasticity works differently in males and females.

Connections between two neurons grow stronger via a process called long-term potentiation, which unfolds in two phases: an early phase, which lasts a few hours, and a late phase, which lasts longer. A key enzyme — protein kinase A (PKA) — was thought to participate in only the later, long-lasting phase.

It dawned on me that perhaps the results that we were getting differed from the published literature because we were using female animals.

""We've shown that that's true only in males,"" Woolley said. For females, PKA is crucial for the early phase of long-term potentiation, she and her colleagues revealed.

In another study, the team uncovered a sex-specific difference in the hippocampus, a brain region key for learning and memory. They showed that, exclusively in female rats, a specific type of estrogen makes neurons more likely to trigger a signal, thanks to a ""previously unknown"" mechanism. This particular estrogen is made in the brains of both males and females, and it doesn't follow the same cycle as estrogen made by the female reproductive system.

In that research, the team was ""doing an experiment that has been done before … and our results were different,"" Woolley told Live Science. ""It dawned on me that perhaps the results that we were getting differed from the published literature because we were using female animals."" Previous work had included only males.

Many drugs act at the connection points between neurons, so it's important to understand how those connections are formed and maintained, Woolley said. Therefore, findings from these animal studies could help inform future treatments and diagnostics for people, she added.

There are some key differences between rodents and people, including that the human menstrual cycle is about seven times longer than the comparable cycle in rodents. But many studies have probed the similarities and differences in how estrogens act on the rodent brain and the nonhuman primate brain.

Based on these data, Woolley suspects many observations in the rat brain will translate to humans, even if they're not exactly the same.

Beyond Woolley's lab, scientists have also uncovered nuances in how male and female mice store fearful memories.

When the researchers blocked signals from part of the amygdala — a key emotion-processing center involved in fear conditioning — it stopped fear memories from being ""saved"" in male mice, but not in females.

Then, they studied people with a genetic mutation in that same signaling pathway. Males with the mutation had trouble remembering that a cue on a screen would come with a mild electric shock, but the same mutation had no effect on females' memories.

That hints that males and females store fearful memories differently, and that could have implications for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the authors speculated. For instance, using a drug to block those amygdala signals after a traumatic event could help prevent PTSD in males but likely not in females.

Another study revealed cell-level differences in the nucleus accumbens, the core of the brain's reward system. More excitatory, or ""activating,"" signaling occurs in the nucleus accumbens of female mice and rats, compared with males.

And several methods of damping that excitement in males do not work in females, the team found. That finding could be relevant for better understanding depression and addiction, since signaling in the reward system underlies both conditions, the study authors suggested.

A better understanding of these sex differences could lead to improved psychiatric and neurological treatments tailored to each sex, scientists argue. But the future of this research is uncertain given the changes that seem to be unfolding at America's premier science institutions.

The fate of the NIH's ""sex as a biological variable"" policy is currently unknown. But if including both sexes in research is no longer prioritized, it could set back the whole field of biomedicine, Woolley emphasized.

""It is very important to understand that the Sex as a Biological Variable policy is not about sex differences research,"" Woolley told Live Science. ""This policy is about all biomedical research and ensuring that the results of taxpayer-funded biomedical research are relevant to everyone: both men and women, both boys and girls.""

Brain scans, postmortem dissections, artificial intelligence and lab mice reveal differences in the brain that are linked to sex. Do we know what they mean? 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


You're holding two wrinkly human brains, each dripping in formaldehyde. Look at one and then the other. Can you tell which brain is female and which is male?

You can't.

Humanity has been hunting for sex-based differences in the brain since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, and it has largely been an exercise in futility. That's partly because human brains do not come in two distinct forms, said Dr. Armin Raznahan, chief of the National Institute of Mental Health's Section on Developmental Neurogenomics.

""I'm not aware of any measure you can make of the human brain where the male and female distributions don't overlap,"" Raznahan told Live Science.

But the question of how male and female brains differ may still matter, because brain diseases and psychiatric disorders manifest differently between the sexes. Disentangling how much of that difference is rooted in biology versus the environment could lead to better treatments, experts argue.



There are many different disorders of the brain — psychiatric and neurologic diseases — that occur with different prevalence and are expressed in different ways between sexes, said Dr. Yvonne Lui, a clinician-scientist and vice chair of research in NYU Langone's Department of Radiology. ""Trying to understand baseline differences can help us better understand how diseases manifest.""

Now, thanks in part to artificial intelligence (AI), scientists are starting to reliably distinguish male and female brains using subtle differences in their cellular structures and in neural circuits that play a role in a wide range of cognitive tasks, from visual perception to movement to emotional regulation. Other studies point to sex-based differences in human brain structure that may be present from birth, and still other, lab-based research in animals points to sex-based differences in how brain cells fire at a molecular level.

What's still completely unclear is to what extent these differences matter. Do they change how people's brains function or how susceptible they are to disease? Should they dictate which treatments doctors offer to each patient? Even as scientists pinpoint subtle brain differences between females and males, their research inevitably runs up against tricky questions of how sex, gender and culture interplay to sculpt human cognition.

Right now, it's impossible to answer these big questions. But ongoing and future research — focused on lab animals, human chromosomes and brain development, and subjects followed from youth through adulthood — could start to reveal how these sex-based differences concretely affect cognition, and ultimately, the development of diseases of the brain.

Historically, scientists used purported brain differences to make sweeping statements about how men and women think and behave and to justify sexist beliefs that women were innately less intelligent and less capable than men.

While that early research has been discredited, modern studies still find cognitive differences between men and women — at least on average. For example, men reportedly perform better on tests of spatial ability, while women are better at interpreting the facial expressions of others. But men and women are raised and treated very differently in society, so what's at the root of these differences? Is it nature or nurture, or both?

""It's actually incredibly difficult in humans to … causally distinguish how much of a sex difference is societally or environmentally driven,"" Raznahan said. ""We have all of these assumptions and biases that sort of slip into our heads through the back door without us realizing.""

Given the dubious history of studying sex differences in the brain, and the logistical difficulty of doing it the right way, one might wonder why scientists bother. For many, it's because neurological diseases and psychiatric conditions seem to play out differently in males and females, and both biological and environmental factors could explain why that is.

Data suggest women experience higher rates of depression and migraine than men do, while men have higher rates of schizophrenia and autism. About twice the number of men develop Parkinson's disease than women do, but women with the condition tend to have faster-progressing disease. All these data come from studies that don't necessarily distinguish sex from gender — ""sex"" describes biology, while ""gender"" reflects self-identity, as well as societal roles and pressures. Lumping the two concepts together muddies our understanding of why a given difference exists.

For instance, pubescent girls are more likely to experience depression than boys are, which may be related to how their maturing brains handle stress or the possibility that they encounter more stressful events than boys do at that age. Conversely, do boys' brains make them resilient against depression, or are they actually going underdiagnosed due to social stigma? The answers to these questions point to different solutions.



Thanks to brain-scanning techniques like MRI, scientists have found subtle sex differences in the size, shape and thickness of various brain structures, as well as differences in networks that link different parts of the brain.

But these differences are small to negligible when you account for the average size difference between males and females, argues Lise Eliot, a professor of neuroscience at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science and author of ""Pink Brain, Blue Brain"" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009).

Eliot and colleagues recently looked at about 30 years of studies, finding that, on average, male brains are 6% larger than female brains at birth and grow to be 11% larger by adulthood. This makes sense because average brain size scales along with average body size, and male bodies tend to be larger. But when you take this overall size difference into account, subtler structural differences between male and female brains shrink to the point of negligibility, the researchers concluded.

""There are maybe species-wide sex differences in the brain, but so far, they haven't been proven,"" Eliot told Live Science. ""And so if they exist, they must be pretty small.""

Nonetheless, some scientists have reported differences that they say don't scale with body size. Some examples came from a research group who'd crunched MRI data from over 40,000 adult brains scanned for the UK Biobank, a repository of medical data from 500,000 adults in the United Kingdom.



In that study, males had a larger thalamus, a relay station for sensory information. They also had a larger putamen, which helps control movement and forms part of a feedback loop that tells you whether a movement was well executed. Females, on average, had a larger left-side nucleus accumbens, part of the brain's reward center, and a bigger hippocampus, the storage site for short-term memories of facts and events that also helps transfer the information to long-term memory.

But neither this nor other studies have revealed a specific feature that reliably distinguishes a given male brain from a female brain, since the size ranges seen in each sex largely overlap, Raznahan and colleagues noted in a letter responding to that study.

For the few size differences that do exist, it's currently impossible to say whether they explain any differences in cognition linked to sex, or alternatively, whether they actually make males' and females' cognition more similar, the letter authors noted. Perhaps male and female brains operate slightly differently to reach the same output — to ""counterbalance"" differences in hormones or genetics that may affect brain function, they wrote.

""When we're just talking about describing a difference in a measurement, that's not saying anything about whether it's got any functional relevance at all,"" Raznahan emphasized.

While large-scale structural features might not distinguish male and female brains, AI is helping to uncover other, subtler features that may differentiate the two. Some of these differences appear on the level of the brain's microstructure, meaning its individual cells and components of those cells.

For instance, a study published in May 2024 used different AI models to analyze brain scans from 1,030 young adults ages 22 to 37 years old. The research primarily focused on white matter, the bundles of insulated wiring that run between neurons. ""I believe ours is the first study to detect brain microstructural differences between sexes,"" said Lui, who co-authored the study.

The AI models analyzed differences in both local landmarks in the brain — such as the corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two halves — and the highways that connect distant cells. It also looked at differences in how the white matter was bundled together, as well as in how dense and well insulated those bundles were.

The algorithms accurately predicted the sex of the subject tied to a given scan 92% to 98% of the time. That remaining gap in accuracy likely comes down to the ""huge amount of variance in humans,"" Lui said.

No single part of the brain could be used to make predictions; one model relied on 15 distinct regions of white matter. All models showed some consistencies, though, with the largest white matter structure that crosses the midline, the corpus callosum, standing out as key.



Lui and colleagues' study was not designed to address how an individual's upbringing or environment shapes the brain. Nor did it aim to disentangle biological differences in the brain from those rooted in gender.

Sex describes biological differences in anatomy, physiology, hormones and chromosomes. Sex traits are categorized as male or female, although some people's traits don't fit neatly in either category. Gender, on the other hand, is cultural. It encompasses how people identify and express themselves, as well as how they are treated and expected to behave by others. Genders include man and woman, as well as others, including those that fall under the umbrella term nonbinary or are unique to specific cultures, like the māhū of Hawai'i.

Historically, studies have conflated sex and gender. To tease these factors apart and see how each manifests in the brain, it would be helpful to follow people over time as their brains are developing — and new research is beginning to do just that.

For example, a 2024 study looked at average brain volume in over 500 newborns: Males' brains were 6% larger overall, even after accounting for differences in birth weight, and females had larger gray-to-white matter ratios. (Gray matter, the cell bodies of neurons, is primarily found in the outer layer of the brain, called the cortex.) That average difference in gray matter is also seen in adults, which makes sense given that larger brains need more white matter to relay signals between far-apart cells.

Statistically, these big-picture brain differences were more significant than differences seen in smaller structures. Females had larger corpus callosa, as well as more gray matter around the hippocampus and in a key emotion-processing hub called the left anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). Males had more gray matter in parts of the temporal lobe involved in sensory processing, as well as in the subthalamic nucleus, key for movement control. But sex could only explain a fraction of the variance seen in these structures.



Some of these brain differences are ""present from the earliest stage of postnatal life"" and persist into adulthood, the authors noted. This applies mostly to the global differences, but also potentially to some of the smaller ones. For example, some studies — but not all — show that the left ACG is also larger in adult females, not only in babies.

Durable differences present from birth are likely sex-based. But differences that emerge or disappear in later life, like those in the hippocampus, may be influenced by the environment, or else reflect sex differences in development, including hormonal shifts in puberty.

Studies like this can help tease apart the influence of sex and gender on the brain. At present, there's a ""massive gap"" in our understanding of how these factors shape the brain independently and in tandem, said Elvisha Dhamala, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York.

Dhamala and colleagues recently aimed to fill in that gap using data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, an enormous U.S.-based study of brain development and child health. They incorporated functional MRI (fMRI) scans from nearly 4,800 children; fMRI tracks blood flow in the brain to give an indirect measure of brain activity. Each child joined the study at age 9 or 10 and will be followed for 10 years, which will enable follow-up studies.

The fMRI scans highlighted linked brain areas, or networks that lit up as the children did different tasks, including memory tests that required them to recall several images. The children and their parents also answered questions about the kids' feelings about their genders and how they typically play and express themselves. ""It's not anything clinical,"" Dhamala noted. ""It's just an aspect of behavior that represents your gender.""

These answers were used to generate ""scores"" for each child that the AI algorithm could use as data points.



The algorithm ultimately revealed two largely distinct brain networks tied to sex and gender. The brain differences most strongly tied to sex were found in networks responsible for processing visual stimuli and physical sensations, controlling movement, making decisions and regulating emotions. Differences tied to gender were more widely dispersed, involving connections within and between many areas in the cortex.

After pinpointing these networks, the researchers trained their AI algorithms to ""predict"" a child's sex or gender based on brain activity. They accurately determined most children's sexes, similar to the results of Lui's study. Gender proved trickier: With the children's questionnaire answers, the AI couldn't predict where they landed on a continuum of gender, whereas with the parents' answers, its predictive power exceeded chance but was still ""much lower"" than the predictions for sex, Dhamala said.

Nonetheless, the study highlighted an understudied idea: that gender sculpts the brain in ways that are distinct from sex, she said.

Interestingly, some tentative lines can be drawn between Lui's and Dhamala's AI-powered studies. They can't be directly compared, as the two studies used different types of analyses and focused on different features of the brain. But many of the physical white matter tracts flagged in the former study correspond with functional networks highlighted in the latter, Dhamala told Live Science.

As an example, the cingulum — a white-matter tract that encircles the corpus callosum — seemed key for making predictions in Lui's study. It also links together various networks flagged in Dhamala's study, including circuits involved in emotional processing. That hints that sex differences exist in both the physical anatomy of these networks and in their activation patterns, Dhamala said.

Scientists have made some progress at teasing out sex differences in the brain, but to truly understand these distinctions, researchers will need to do more animal studies to allow for more experimental control, according to a 2020 paper co-authored by Raznahan.

Various studies in lab rats have already revealed differences in how males and females form connections between neurons, and how each sex processes fearful memories, for example.

In humans, scientists can collect more brain data right at the time of birth, to pinpoint baseline differences that might exist before a child encounters any cultural influences, and then track the child over time, Raznahan and colleagues added.

Another option is to study human genes that are unique to either the X or Y chromosome. By looking at people with extra or missing sex chromosomes, for example, scientists have started to unravel how these genes either inflate or shrink brain structures, contributing to sex differences in size. Chromosomes may also raise or lower the risk of disorders — for instance, carrying an extra Y raises the likelihood that a person has autism, whereas an extra X does not. That may help to explain why males, who usually carry one X and one Y, have higher autism rates than females, who typically have two Xs.

Right now, the fate of such research is uncertain in the U.S.

Prompted by executive orders from the new presidential administration, the National Science Foundation has been combing through active research projects to see if they include words that might violate said orders, such as ""woman,"" ""female"" and ""gender,"" and the National Institutes of Health appeared to archive a long-standing policy requiring both male and female lab animals in studies.

—Men have a daily hormone cycle — and it's synced to their brains shrinking from morning to night

—Pregnancy shrinks parts of the brain, leaving 'permanent etchings' postpartum

—Babies' brain activity changes dramatically before and after birth, groundbreaking study finds

""There's just a lot of uncertainty,"" Dhamala told Live Science. If the worst case scenario comes to pass, ""removing that gender component, or making it harder to study sex differences, is going to push us backward rather than forward.""

But if the field survives, future work could incorporate gender the way the ABCD study did, using questionnaires to generate composite scores, Dhamala said. As a start, scientists could at least ask study participants what gender they identify as, she added. Other experts agree.

By adopting these strategies, scientists could dramatically advance this research field that dates back to Aristotle. Their efforts could lend new talking points to the endless debate of nature versus nature. They could uncover meaningful sex differences that pave the way to better treatments for depression, Alzheimer's and more. Or they could highlight the ways members of the ""opposite sex"" are actually more alike than they are different.

Artificial intelligence algorithms are being built into almost all aspects of health care. They’re integrated into breast cancer screenings, clinical note-taking, health insurance management and even phone and computer apps to create virtual nurses and transcribe doctor-patient conversations. Companies say that these tools will make medicine more efficient and reduce the burden on doctors and other health care workers. But some experts question whether the tools work as well as companies claim they do.

AI tools such as large language models, or LLMs, which are trained on vast troves of text data to generate humanlike text, are only as good as their training and testing. But the publicly available assessments of LLM capabilities in the medical domain are based on evaluations that use medical student exams, such as the MCAT. In fact, a review of studies evaluating health care AI models, specifically LLMs, found that only 5 percent used real patient data. Moreover, most studies evaluated LLMs by asking questions about medical knowledge. Very few assessed LLMs’ abilities to write prescriptions, summarize conversations or have conversations with patients — tasks LLMs would do in the real world.

The current benchmarks are distracting, computer scientist Deborah Raji and colleagues argue in the February New England Journal of Medicine AI. The tests can’t measure actual clinical ability; they don’t adequately account for the complexities of real-world cases that require nuanced decision-making. They also aren’t flexible in what they measure and can’t evaluate different types of clinical tasks. And because the tests are based on physicians’ knowledge, they don’t properly represent information from nurses or other medical staff.

“A lot of expectations and optimism people have for these systems were anchored to these medical exam test benchmarks,” says Raji, who studies AI auditing and evaluation at the University of California, Berkeley. “That optimism is now translating into deployments, with people trying to integrate these systems into the real world and throw them out there on real patients.” She and her colleagues argue that we need to develop evaluations of how LLMs perform when responding to complex and diverse clinical tasks.

Science News spoke with Raji about the current state of health care AI testing, concerns with it and solutions to create better evaluations. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

SN: Why do current benchmark tests fall short?

Raji: These benchmarks are not indicative of the types of applications people are aspiring to, so the whole field should not obsess about them in the way they do and to the degree they do.

This is not a new problem or specific to health care. This is something that exists throughout machine learning, where we put together these benchmarks and we want it to represent general intelligence or general competence at this particular domain that we care about. But we just have to be really careful about the claims we make around these datasets.

The further the representation of these systems is from the situations in which they are actually deployed, the more difficult it is for us to understand the failure modes these systems hold. These systems are far from perfect. Sometimes they fail on particular populations, and sometimes, because they misrepresent the tasks, they don’t capture the complexity of the task in a way that reveals certain failures in deployment. This sort of benchmark bias issue, where we make the choice to deploy these systems based on information that doesn’t represent the deployment situation, leads to a lot of hubris.

SN: How do you create better evaluations for health care AI models?

Raji: One strategy is interviewing domain experts in terms of what the actual practical workflow is and collecting naturalistic datasets of pilot interactions with the model to see the types or range of different queries that people put in and the different outputs. There’s also this idea that [coauthor] Roxana Daneshjou has been doing in some of her work with “red teaming,” with actively gathering a group of people to adversarialy prompt the model. Those are all different approaches to getting at a more realistic set of prompts closer to how people actually interact with the systems.

Another thing we are trying is getting information from actual hospitals as usage data — like how they are actually deploying it and workflows from them about how they are actually integrating the system — and anonymized patient information or anonymized inputs to these models that could then inform future benchmarking and evaluation practices.

Sponsor Message

There are approaches that exist from other disciplines [like psychology] about how to ground your evaluations in observations of reality to be able to assess something. The same applies here — how much of our current evaluation ecosystem is grounded in the reality of what people are observing and what people are either appreciating or struggling with in terms of the actual deployment of these systems.

SN: How specialized should model benchmark testing be?

Raji: The benchmark that is geared towards question answering and knowledge recall is very different from a benchmark to validate the model on summarizing doctors’ notes or doing questioning and answering on uploaded data. That kind of nuance in terms of the task design is something that I’m trying to get to. Not that every single person should have their own personalized benchmark, but that common task that we do share needs to be way more grounded than multiple-choice tests. Because even for real doctors, those multiple-choice questions are not indicative of their actual performance.

SN: What policies or frameworks need to be in place to create such evaluations?

Raji: This is mostly a call for researchers to invest in thinking through and constructing not just benchmarks but also evaluations, at large, that are more grounded in the reality of what our expectations are for these systems once they get deployed. Right now, evaluation is very much an afterthought. We just think that there’s a lot more attention that could be paid towards the methodology of evaluation, the methodology of benchmark design and the methodology of just assessment in this space. 

Second, we can ask for more transparency at the institutional level such as through AI inventories in hospitals, wherein hospitals should share the full list of different AI products that they make use of as part of their clinical practice. That’s the kind of practice at the institutional level, at the hospital level, that would really help us understand what people are currently using AI systems for. If [hospitals and other institutions] published information about the workflows that they sort of integrate these AI systems into, that can also help us think of better evaluations. That kind of thing at the hospital level will be super helpful.

At the vendor level too, sharing information about what their current evaluation practice is — what their current benchmarks rely on — helps us figure out the gap between what they are currently doing and something that could be more realistic or more grounded.

SN: What is your advice for people working with these models?

Raji: We should, as a field, be more thoughtful about the evaluations that we focus on or that we [overly base our performance on.]

It’s really easy to pick the lowest hanging fruit — medical exams are just the most available medical tests out there. And even if they are completely unrepresentative of what people are hoping to do with these models at deployment, it’s like an easy dataset to compile and put together and upload and download and run.

But I would challenge the field to be a lot more thoughtful and to pay more attention to really constructing valid representations of what we hope the models do and our expectations for these models once they are deployed.

	Cooperation both within and between species is essential for the longstanding tradition

Generations of fishers in southern Brazil take their net-casting cues from dolphins, which herd fish toward shore. By working together, both species benefit by catching more fish.

Many hands make light work. Or, in the case of cooperative interspecies foraging in southern Brazil, flippers and hands catch more fish together.

Dolphins and humans have hunted mullet together in Laguna, Brazil, for generations, increasing the catch for both species. Drone-based video shows that the dolphins coordinate with each other during these hunts, researchers report February 12 in Current Zoology. The analysis also reveals which of the dolphins’ tactics are most likely to result in a successful catch for both mammal species.

The tandem hunting practiced by Lahille’s bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus gephyreus) and local fishermen often yields more bounty for all. In the murky estuaries in southern Brazil, the dolphins herd schools of mullet toward the shallows where humans wait for just the right moment to cast their nets, signaled by a dolphin’s tail slap against the water or sudden dive. The dolphins can then pull a few fish from the net to eat or more easily prey on the mullet trapped against the outside of the nets.

“This is a rare interaction between two top predators combining their complementary skills,” says Mauricio Cantor, a behavioral ecologist at Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute in Newport.

Previous research from a 40-year-long monitoring program centered around this joint dolphin-human foraging has shown how the humans cooperate with each other to maximize their fish catch. But scientists weren’t sure if the dolphins also cooperated with each other or instead competed for the mullet.

Cantor and his colleagues used drones to film dolphins’ foraging behavior near Laguna over 18 days in 2018 during the peak of mullet migration season. Of the 45 recorded human-dolphin foraging interactions, nine were successful (meaning people caught fish). Researchers tracked three elements of the dolphins’ movements as seen from the surface: the distance between individuals when they surfaced, the alignment of their swimming trajectories and the synchronization of their dives.

Dolphins and people had a higher chance of joint success when dolphins approached humans along several trajectories as they herded fish and when they synchronized dives, the researchers found. 

These behaviors reveal a complex level of coordination that allows the dolphins to “adapt to and capitalize on human activities,” says Bruno Díaz López, a biologist at the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute in Pontevedra, Spain, who was not affiliated with the research.

Understanding the tactics that ensure fruitful foraging outcomes is important for prolonging this unique hunting partnership, Cantor says. “This serves as one lasting example that our interactions with nature don’t have to be one-sided. They can be mutual, too.”

Ecologists on Cantor’s team are now working with computer scientists to build an AI model that can more efficiently extract patterns in the dolphins’ surface behavior from drone videos. Cantor and his colleagues are also analyzing four years of physiological data that track the humans’ fine-scale decision-making.

Cantor hopes to one day gather the same type of physiological data on the cetacean hunters. “This will be a bit tricky,” Cantor admits, as he’ll have to “wait for someone to develop a kind of Fitbit for dolphins”.

	For each 1-degree-Celsius increase in sea temp, green sea turtles lay eggs over 6 days earlier

Green sea turtles are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warming temperatures, a new study shows.

Green sea turtles are adjusting their nesting habits in response to rising global temperatures. Individual females are laying their eggs earlier in the season to cope with warmer conditions, researchers report in the February Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Scientists have long known that the sex of most turtle species is determined by incubation temperature — higher temperatures give life to females, and lower ones produce males. As climate change drives up temperatures, more females and fewer males are being born, potentially weakening populations. Extreme heat can also be lethal for the eggs.

To understand how turtles are adapting, conservation ecologist Annette Broderick and colleagues analyzed three decades of nesting data from around 600 tagged green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on the beaches of Northern Cyprus. The data included the number of successful hatchlings in each nest and temperatures during incubation. The team found that individual females nested earlier as temperatures rose, laying eggs just over six days earlier, on average, for each 1-degree-Celsius increase.

This is “the first time anyone looked at individual turtles and looked at how they’re changing,” rather than studying nesting behavior at a population level, says Broderick, of the University of Exeter in England.

While previous research has shown the nesting activity of whole turtle populations moving earlier, the new study confirms that individual turtles are actively adjusting their behavior in response to climate change. “This may seem like a foregone conclusion. It really isn’t,” says study coauthor Mollie Rickwood, a marine biologist at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. That’s because population-wide shifts in nesting behavior could be happening for multiple reasons.

“For example,” Broderick says, “each female may be consistent in the time she nests each year, but new recruits to the population may lay earlier than older nesters, therefore making the average earlier.” By looking at individual animals, the researchers showed that all females are adjusting their timing.

Along with temperatures, breeding experience and number of clutches laid in a year equally influenced the timing of nesting. Other studies suggest that the earlier egg-laying seen now in some turtle species seems to be enough to offset the effects of warming temperatures on the eggs.

“This gives them a much better outlook in the face of climate change,” Rickwood says.

Scientists Date Remains of an Ancient Child That Resembles Both Humans and Neanderthals

NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have dated the skeleton of an ancient child that caused a stir when it was first discovered because it carries features from both humans and Neanderthals.

The child's remains were discovered 27 years ago in a rock shelter called Lagar Velho in central Portugal. The nearly complete skeleton was stained red, and scientists think it may have been wrapped in a painted animal skin before burial.

When the humanlike child was discovered, scientists noted that some of their attributes — including body proportions and jawbone — looked Neanderthal. The researchers suggested that the child was descended from populations in which humans and Neanderthals mated and mixed. That was a radical notion at the time, but advances in genetics have since proven those populations existed — and people today still carry Neanderthal DNA. 

But trying to figure out when exactly the child lived has been difficult. Small roots had grown through the bones and contamination — from plants or other sources — made it impossible for scientists to use traditional carbon dating to measure the child's age. They instead dated the charcoal and animal bones around the skeleton to between 27,700 and 29,700 years ago.

Techniques have improved, and researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances that they were able to date the skeleton by measuring part of a protein that's found primarily in human bones. 

Examining part of a crushed arm, they revealed that the earlier estimate was in the ballpark: the skeleton was from between 27,700 and 28,600 years ago.

“Being able to successfully date the child felt like giving them back a tiny piece of their story, which is a huge privilege,” said Bethan Linscott, a study author now at the University of Miami, in an email.

She noted the initial discovery was more than a skeleton — it was also the grave of a young child. When dating the bones, she couldn’t help but wonder who loved the child, what made them laugh and what their world looked like in the short four years they walked the planet.

Paul Pettitt, an archaeologist at Durham University in England who was not involved with the new research said in an email that the study is an example of how dating methods are becoming more effective and helping scientists better understand the past.

The study of where humans came from is important “for the same reason we keep the portraits of our parents and grandparents,” said study author João Zilhão from the University of Lisbon.

“It's a way of remembering,” he said.

A woman from Dunfermline has spoken of her shock after an Apple voice-to-text service mistakenly inserted a reference to sex - and an apparent insult - into a message left by a garage.

Louise Littlejohn, 66, received a voicemail message on Wednesday from a Lookers Land Rover garage in Motherwell inviting her to an event.

An artificial intelligence (AI) powered service offered by Apple turned it into a text message which - to her surprise - asked if she been ""able to have sex"" before calling her a ""piece of ****"".

Mrs Littlejohn told BBC News: ""Initially I was shocked - astonished - but then I thought that is so funny. The text was obviously quite inappropriate.

""The garage is trying to sell cars, and instead of that they are leaving insulting messages without even being aware of it. It is not their fault at all.""

Apple and the garage both declined to comment.

An expert has told the BBC the AI system may have struggled in part because of the caller's Scottish accent, but far more likely factors were the background noise at the garage and the fact he was reading off a script.

Mrs Littlejohn said she initially thought the call was a scam, but then recognised that the associated number was from the Motherwell area. 

She had bought a car from the same garage a few years ago.

The BBC has listened to the audio left by the garage worker and confirmed it was a conventional business call.

The transcription is so jumbled it's hard to decipher where it went wrong, but the reference to ""sex"" may have in fact been when the caller mentioned the ""sixth"" of March.

The BBC has removed the name of the garage employee:

""Hi Mrs Littlejohn, it is ____ here from Lookers Land Rover in Lanarkshire. I hope you are well. Just a wee call to see if you have received your invite to our new car INAUDIBLE event that we do have on between the sixth and tenth of March.

""Just a wee call to see if it is something you were looking to come along to, and to see if we can confirm an appointment slot that would be suitable for yourself. If it is something you would be interested in, feel free to give me a call on ____, ask for myself ____ INAUDIBLE. Thank you.""

On Apple's website, it details how their voicemail transcription is limited to voicemails in English received on an iPhone with iOS 10 operating system or later, and the transcription ""depends on the quality of the recording"". 

Peter Bell, a professor of speech technology at the University of Edinburgh, listened to the message left for Mrs Littlejohn.

He suggested it was at the ""challenging end for speech-to-text engines to deal with"".

He believes there are a number of factors which could have resulted in rogue transcription:

""All of those factors contribute to the system doing badly, "" he added. ""The bigger question is why it outputs that kind of content.

""If you are producing a speech-to-text system that is being used by the public, you would think you would have safeguards for that kind of thing.""

Many people in Scotland will remember a sketch from the BBC comedy show Burnistoun, when two Scottish men get trapped after the voice-activated lift can't understand their accents.

It has hundreds of millions of views online, and tapped into a feeling some Scots have about voice technology.

In 2016, Scots were asked to work with voice recognition technology in a bid to help mobile phones decipher the accent better.

For Prof Bell, the Scottish accent may have had an impact here along with all other factors, but - with ideal audio conditions - problems that technology will have with the Scottish accent are ""a thing of the past"".

However, this not the first time that Apple's speech tools have recently hit the headlines for the wrong reasons.

A few weeks ago, the tech giant said it was working to fix its speech-to-text tool after some social media users found that when they spoke the word ""racist"" into their iPhones it typed it out as ""Trump"".

Apple also suspended its AI summaries of news headlines after it displayed false notifications on stories.

The Financial Express



Despite progress in workplace diversity, women in tech sector continue to face significant pay disparities and career advancement challenges, according to the ANSR-Talent500 Women in Tech Report 2025. The report reveals that 52% of women in technology report experiencing pay gaps, with a notable increase in the number of women citing unfair compensation compared to the previous year.

The findings are based on a survey of 3,000 women employed in IT, global capability centres (GCCs), and emerging tech sectors. The study assesses workplace experiences, diversity efforts, and career growth opportunities. While there has been a marked shift in gender representation, challenges such as the glass ceiling, pay inequity, and limited mentorship continue to hinder progress.

Approximately 80% of respondents were from key tech hubs such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and the National Capital Region (NCR). The workforce distribution among the surveyed women included 41% in IT/ITES, 19% in GCCs, 8% in startups, and 17% in product companies. In terms of experience, nearly 48% had less than five years in the industry, 29% had six to ten years, and 11% had over 15 years.

However, tech companies have improved gender representation, with women now making up nearly 42% of their workforce — an increase from single-digit figures in previous years. Around 60% of women acknowledge that diversity initiatives are gaining momentum; however, 40% believe these efforts remain largely symbolic or ineffective.

The report highlights that 70% of women still perceive career growth opportunities as limited due to persistent structural barriers. Pay gaps remain a critical concern, with an estimated 15-20% salary difference between men and women in the same roles within tech companies and GCCs. While some companies have taken steps to bridge the gender pay gap, disparities persist due to occupational segregation, unconscious bias in performance evaluations, and inequitable promotion decisions.

Women in the tech industry have clear expectations from employers, prioritising flexibility, equitable pay, and personalised benefits. The survey indicates that 76.9% of respondents value workplace flexibility, 74.1% seek career growth opportunities, 58% emphasise the importance of female leadership, and 51.1% consider strong employer branding a deciding factor in job selection.

Have you ever skipped a highly-rated movie just because of the language issue- not available in either Hindi or English? For this kind of movie, Amazon Prime Video is working on a solution by testing AI-assisted dubbing, which will make it easier for viewers to enjoy foreign films and shows without relying solely on subtitles.

Prime Video comes with a vast library of international films and TV series, but many of them are never dubbed into other languages due to the high costs and effort involved.

Traditional dubbing use to happen with the professional voice actors to record new dialogue, a process that is both time-consuming and expensive. As a result, several great movies and shows remain inaccessible to a global audience.

To address this, Amazon is leveraging AI technology to create dubbed versions of select titles. This approach reduces dubbing costs and speeds up the process, ensuring that more content becomes available to viewers worldwide.

The AI dubbing system isn’t fully automated—it combines AI technology with human expertise. Here’s how it works:

Initially, Prime Video is rolling out AI-assisted dubbing for 12 titles, including:

The AI dubs will be available in English and Latin American Spanish, with more languages expected in the future.

Amazon has been actively working to make its platform more inclusive. The company already provides subtitles, closed captions, and audio descriptions for better accessibility. AI dubbing is the next step in ensuring that users can enjoy a seamless language-friendly streaming experience.

In the future, viewers may see a wider selection of movies and shows dubbed in multiple languages using AI, making foreign content more accessible than ever before.

Financial technology company DeFi Technologies (CBOE:DEFI) has increased its stake in Neuronomics AG to 52.5 per cent.

This acquisition follows DeFi Technologies’ earlier investment, where the company acquired a 10 per cent stake in Neuronomics. The acquisition aligns with DeFi Technologies’ strategy to expand its presence in artificial intelligence, asset management, and trading sectors while diversifying its revenue streams. This strategic move complements DeFi Technologies’ existing initiatives, including the DeFi Alpha arbitrage trading desk, which will benefit from Neuronomics’ technological expertise and market insights.

Founded in Switzerland, Neuronomics AG has established itself as a leader in asset management by developing advanced quantitative trading strategies based on artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. The firm holds an asset management license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), enabling it to manage and administer financial assets on behalf of clients. Neuronomics’ research-driven approach focuses on two key areas: AI and Computational Neuroscience in Finance.

Neuronomics has pioneered the application of advanced AI models in financial settings, delivering AI strategies that outperform market indices across all key metrics. The firm’s proprietary AI models combine multiple algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce model overfitting. Their approach translates AI model outputs into portfolio allocations, optimizing asset distribution to maximize returns while managing risk. Neuronomics is also at the forefront of customizing large language models for predicting asset price developments based on real-time market news. This capability positions Neuronomics to identify emerging investment narratives well ahead of competitors, offering a distinct edge in the market.

Neuronomics also explores how human cognitive biases and emotional responses shape financial behavior, uncovering market inefficiencies that traditional strategies often overlook. Through computational neuroscience, Neuronomics models the neuronal processes of traders, identifying predictable market behaviors that result from overreactions or emotional trading. This approach has been successful in the cryptocurrency market for the company, which is highly influenced by emotional decision-making. Since launching their neurofinance-based crypto strategy in July 2020, Neuronomics has consistently delivered high risk-adjusted returns with minimal correlation to traditional markets.

Neuronomics leverages cutting-edge AI technology to offer high risk-adjusted returns in the cryptocurrency market. Their latest AI-powered quantitative strategy, set to launch with DeFi Technologies, has demonstrated exceptional performance, with forward-testing analysis showing annual returns of 80 per cent and significantly reduced drawdowns and volatility compared to passive market exposure. The AI-driven model removes human bias, enhances consistency, and dynamically adapts to evolving market conditions, ensuring sustained performance even in volatile markets.

These strategies are built on a diversified, long-only crypto portfolio, rebalanced based on advanced AI models that identify market inefficiencies such as momentum and reversal opportunities. The AI-driven approach has consistently outperformed benchmarks like the CCi30 index, achieving a Sharpe Ratio greater than 1, underscoring its superior risk-adjusted returns. Their Neurofin strategy underscores this resilience by generating positive net returns amid a market downturn exceeding 20 per cent over the past month. Neuronomics’ expertise in AI-driven strategies will significantly enhance DeFi Technologies’ capabilities, especially as a complement to DeFi Alpha, its specialized arbitrage trading desk, which focuses on identifying and capitalizing on low-risk opportunities within the cryptocurrency market.

In connection with the acquisition, DeFi Technologies issued 186,304 common shares of the company, plus additional cash considerations, to the selling shareholders of Neuronomics. 152,433 of the payment shares are subject to a lock-up schedule, with 50 per cent released in three months and the remainder released in six months. No finder fees were paid in connection with the acquisition. Closing of the acquisition is subject to the acceptance of Cboe Canada Exchange.

Neuronomics AG is a Swiss asset management firm specializing in AI-powered quantitative trading strategies. By integrating artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, and quantitative finance, Neuronomics delivers cutting-edge solutions that drive superior risk-adjusted performance in financial markets.

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE 2 is in development as the successor to 2023's Galaxy Buds FE, according to a report. The purported true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds are expected to replace the original Buds FE as the South Korean technology conglomerate's most affordable offering. The development of the product is said to have reached a “fairly advanced stage”. Although details remain scarce, the Galaxy Buds FE 2 are speculated to build upon the features of its predecessor.

According to a report by Dutch publication GalaxyClub, the purported Galaxy Buds FE 2 may come with the model number SM-R410. Notably, the Galaxy Buds FE has SM-R400N listed as the model number. Although the report does not shed light on the specifications of the purported TWS earbuds, they are speculated to be launched before the end of summer.

Their development is said to have reached a “fairly advanced stage”, with the company also reportedly developing its firmware. The report speculates Galaxy Buds FE 2 could be launched alongside the Galaxy Z Flip FE.

The original Galaxy Buds FE were launched in October 2023 as the company's most affordable TWS earbuds, priced at Rs. 9,999. They are offered in two colourways — Graphite and White. Nearly two years after their debut, Samsung could finally introduce their successor.

Samsung Galaxy Buds FE TWS sport a design similar to the Galaxy Buds Plus model with the wing tips. However, this time around, they come equipped with active noise cancellation (ANC). They offer support for touch controls along with a feature which allows it to switch between devices automatically.

The wireless headset has an IPX2 rating for splash resistance, which means it should survive light splashes of water. The company claims you get up to six hours of battery life with these earphones when ANC is enabled and a total of 21 hours without ANC, including the charging case.

YouTube has taken strict action against content violations, and reportedly removing around 9.5 million videos from its platform which were published between October and December 2024. Among the affected countries, India witnessed the highest number of removals, with close to 3 million videos taken down.

The video-sharing platform, which is known for its strict content policies has banned hate speech, harassment, violence and misinformation. To maintain a safer space for viewers, YouTube relies on AI-powered detection systems and human moderators to identify and remove harmful content before it reaches a large audience.

The biggest reason behind these takedowns was child safety violations. More than 5 million videos were removed for endangering children. Other common reasons for video removal included:

 

It’s not just the individual videos that were targeted, but YouTube further removed 4.8 million channels from the platform, which were primarily for spamming and scamming the platform users. 

When a channel is deleted from the platform, all its videos disappear as well. In total, this led to over 54 million videos being erased from the platform.

Furthermore, YouTube took down a staggering 1.2 billion comments for violating its rules. Most of these were flagged as spam, but some were removed for containing harassment, hate speech, or threats.

YouTube continues to refine its content moderation system, ensuring that inappropriate content doesn’t spread. With India topping the list of removals, it raises concerns about compliance with the platform’s guidelines.

The company is urging content creators to follow the rules and avoid posting content that could lead to removals. For those uploading videos, it’s a clear reminder—play by the rules, or risk losing your content!Read Also

WhatsApp, the most popular instant messaging app, continues to improve user experience with new features. The platform is frequently updating itself to enhance privacy, security, and customization. Now, the company has started rolling out 5 new features that will make messaging more convenient for the users.

WhatsApp first tests its new features with beta users before making them available to everyone. Over the last couple of months, several new tools have been in the testing phase, and now their stable version is being released worldwide. These features will personalize chats, improve notifications, and enhance video playback. Let’s take a closer look at what’s new!

WhatsApp users can now personalize their chat experience with colourful themes. Previously, users had limited options to customize their chat backgrounds, but now WhatsApp has introduced 20 vibrant chat themes and 30 new wallpapers. This feature allows users to set theirfavouritee colors for conversations, giving the app a fresh and personalized look.

Many users find the unread message notification dot annoying, especially when dealing with multiple messages. To fix this, WhatsApp has introduced a clear chat notification feature. Now, users can control how notifications appear and eliminate unnecessary message alerts. This feature can be accessed in the notification settings section.

WhatsApp introduced chat filters last year, making it easier to organize messages. Now, a new unread chat counter has been added to this feature. This means users can see the exact number of unread messages directly in the chat filter, ensuring no important message is missed.

A long-awaited feature is finally here! WhatsApp now allows users to change the video playback speed. Earlier, this was only possible for voice notes, but now users can watch videos at 1.5x or 2x speed. This is especially useful for quickly viewing long videos shared on the platform.Read Also

Gboard, the default keyboard app that comes pre-installed on almost all Android devices is getting a visual change that might be making many uncomfortable.

As it turns out, the latest version of Gboard for Android beta has introduced circle and pill-shaped keys for select users. Instead of the rectangular keys most of us are familiar with, the new shapes seem to be frustrating many as it has messed up with their muscle memory.

And while there is no functional change as to how these keys work and that the new keys look more modern than they ever did, some are having a hard time using the “”Long press for symbols option, which appears directly above a letter. The new keys seem to be rolling out for users who are on Gboard beta build version 15.1, and currently there seems to be no way to revert to the old key style. However, users can try turning off key borders for a cleaner look.

To do so, open Gboard settings, navigate to Themes, select a theme and on the pop-up that appears, turn off the toggle named ‘Key borders’. Alternatively, you can also opt out of Gboard beta from the Google Play Store, uninstall and then reinstall the stable version to get back the rectangle keys.

At the moment, it is still unclear if Google will bring the design change to the stable version of the app, so we will have to wait a while to know more.

President Donald Trump's decision to establish official government cryptocurrency reserves in the US has drawn criticism from industry watchers.

He has signed an executive order creating what he calls a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will consist of other forms of digital currency.

The funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.

White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks likened them to a ""a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency"", drawing comparison to the Kentucky military base that stores a significant portion of US gold assets.

However, some crypto enthusiasts have criticised the government for not being bolder, while others have raised question marks about the lack of transparency over the process.

Sacks has ordered a full accounting of the federal government's existing crypto reserves, which he estimated at 200,000 Bitcoin alone. That's worth $17.5bn (£13.6bn) at today's prices.

Speaking at the White House on Friday, Sacks said that it was a ""real shame that we did not maximise value for the American taxpayer."" 

""What we want to do is make sure that with the remaining Bitcoin that we have,"" he added. 

Nonetheless, Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, called Thursday's announcement ""a pig in lipstick"" in response to Sacks' post on X.

""No active buying means this is just a fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government,"" he said.

Trump's executive order says that the Treasury and Commerce secretary will come up with strategies for acquiring more government Bitcoin, provided these are ""budget neutral and do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers"".

Sacks said that while they're ""authorised to develop those strategies"", they are only ""allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt."" 

Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, agrees with the idea of a Bitcoin reserve but says the inclusion of other coins sets a ""horrible precedent"" and ""makes no sense.""

""Without a clear framework, we risk arbitrary asset selections, which would distort the markets and drive a loss of public trust,"" he suggested.

Other analysts though have been more positive.

""This approach makes much more sense than buying the assets,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.

""It would surely be bizarre for the US to sell dollars to buy crypto, when the dollar is the globe's reserve currency and therefore a source of enormous influence.""

Further details are expected when the president is due to host the first crypto summit at the White House on Friday.

It is unclear whether the planned reserve could face legal hurdles, or if it might require an act of Congress.

The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited in the reserve, said Sacks, and will instead keep it as an asset. While the reserve will exclusively contain Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies will go into a separate stockpile. 

It was unclear how the new stockpile would benefit Americans, but Sacks said it ""will not cost taxpayers a dime"". 

He also warned that individual investors should think carefully before investing in a ""volatile"" product like cryptocurrencies. 

His implication that the US government would not buy Bitcoin led prices of the world's largest cryptocurrency to fall by more than 5%.

Some countries maintain strategic reserves of national assets to diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risk.

The US also keeps a petroleum reserve. Canada has a maple syrup reserve.

Earlier this week, Trump revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he said he would like included in the strategic reserve.

The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano - swiftly jumped after that announcement.

Mr Yanowitz said the US government needed to be wary of being seen to pick winners.

""Ensuring transparency through independent audits and public reporting is crucial for fostering innovation instead of favouritism,"" he said.

Additionally, Sacks said that each government department - including the intelligence agencies - will have to audit and ""self-report"" their own cryptocurrency holdings. No exceptions have so far been made. 

""We'll take in that report, and then the Secretary of the Treasury will be setting up accounts within the charging department, one for Bitcoin and one for all other digital assets,"" he said. 

Trump aggressively courted the crypto community during his presidential campaign. Former US President Joe Biden led a crackdown on crypto, citing concerns about fraud.

With additional reporting from Bernd Debusmann Jr at the White House 

The US government accused the university of ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"".

The president has reversed US policy and says he trusts Putin and finds dealing with Ukraine difficult. 

Prosecutors want new text messages to be used as evidence in the trial of Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four college students.

Two unvaccinated people were killed in a rapidly spreading outbreak that has sickened more than 220.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday establishing a government reserve of bitcoin, a key marker in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards possible mainstream acceptance.

Trump is scheduled to speak at 3 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.

Under Trump’s new order, the U.S. government will retain the estimated 200,000 bitcoin it’s already seized in criminal and civil proceedings, according to Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks.

“The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,'” Sacks said on social media.

The executive order calls for a “full accounting” of the government’s bitcoin holdings, which Sacks said have never been fully audited. He added that the U.S. government has previously sold off about 195,000 bitcoin over the last decade for $366 million. He said those bitcoins would be worth about $17 billion if the government hadn’t sold them.

Sacks said the order allows for the Treasury and Commerce Departments “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.”

Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin ” seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies and leaned into his unofficial role as the ” crypto president ” in ways that can both help the crypto industry and enrich himself and his family. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, who felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last year’s election.

Establishing a bitcoin reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made on the campaign trail last year. Trump is also pushing Congress to pass industry-friendly legislation, and under his administration the Securities and Exchange Commission has started dropping enforcement actions it had taken against some major crypto companies. On Friday, Trump is set to host many key industry leaders at a White House “Crypto Summit.”

Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by an anonymous person or persons, bitcoin has blossomed from an experiment by libertarian cryptography enthusiasts into an asset with a market cap of about $1.7 trillion. While it hasn’t taken off as a way to pay for everyday things, bitcoin has found popularity as a store of value that’s not controlled by banks, governments or other powerful entities.

Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, a built-in scarcity that supporters say makes it a great hedge against inflation. Critics have long said bitcoin lacks any inherent value, but it’s so far defied naysayers with remarkable price increases. Some supporters of a strategic bitcoin reserve said it could one day help pay off the U.S. national debt.

Crypto prices soared after Trump’s victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted “YOU’RE WELCOME!!!” on social media.

But prices have since cooled off. Trump’s executive order did not equate to an immediate price spike for bitcoin, which was trading around $86,000 shortly after his announcement.

The executive order also creates a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” where the government will hold seized cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. On Sunday, Trump sent crypto prices on a short-lived surge after a surprise announcement that he wanted the government to hold lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and cardano.

A popular internet personality live-posted her own violent home invasion as a group of armed men stormed her home and demanded access to her cryptocurrency accounts. 

Video game streamer and adult content creator Kaitlyn Siragusa, who goes by the online name Amouranth, was asleep in her Houston home when three men shot through a patio window on Sunday evening, authorities told FOX 26. 

""I’m being too robbed at gunpoint,"" Siragusa posted on her X account. ""I believe I shot one of them. They wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed.""

The suspects kicked in Siragusa’s bedroom door and ordered her to hand over her cryptocurrency accounts, according to FOX 26 Houston. Siragusa wrote on X that the men – who were carrying handguns, duct tape and masks – were unable to access her online funds. 

She said the men demanded access to her cryptocurrency account and pistol-whipped her multiple times.

""The pummeling felt like it would never end, and I protected my head by putting my arms up like I learned how to do in boxing,"" Siragusa posted to X. ""Blood was streaming down my head and my hands [were] beat brown."" 

Siragusa told police that she was able to lead the suspects to an area of the property where she knew her husband was with a weapon.

Siragusa’s husband fired his weapon and struck one of the suspects, according to authorities.

Surveillance footage posted to Siragusa’s X account shows the three men fleeing the home as one man yells ""I got shot."" 

In a series of X posts after the incident, Siragusa told her followers the injured man left a ""trail of blood"" down the driveway and was being tested by forensic investigators. 

Siragusa later defended her choice to post online instead of calling the police as the men stormed her home. ""Was at gunpoint they gave me phone and said log in with gun to my head and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence,"" she wrote.

President Donald Trump said Friday that he continues to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace and that he is “finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.” His comments, to reporters in the Oval Office, came after Russia carried out a major missile attack against Ukraine while U.S. intelligence-sharing that normally helps Ukraine repel Russian forces was paused. Trump, who threatened to impose sanctions on Russia in response to the attack, said he had sent Russia a “very strong statement — can’t do that.” But he softened his tone during his Oval Office appearance. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to address a White House cryptocurrency summit, elevating an industry he promised to aid during his campaign.

Less than a month after placing the entire staff of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights on administrative leave, the Environmental Protection Agency has reinstated dozens of employees in offices across the country.

President Donald Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

The event will put on display just how much Trump, once a skeptic of cryptocurrency, has aligned himself with the industry since winning the November election with the support of some of its biggest players.

The companies include Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood, whose CEOs will attend Friday’s White House cryptocurrency summit.

Elon Musk and his allies in the U.S. DOGE Service have justified their efforts to dismantle federal agencies by invoking a frequent refrain: They’re merely targeting fraud, waste and abuse.

Chiefs from Coinbase, Ripple and Robinhood to strategize with president on how to make US ‘crypto capital of world’

Cryptocurrency industry elite are set to meet with Donald Trump at the White House on Friday to discuss how the government will enact Trump’s vision of making the country the “crypto capital of the world”. The day before, the president signed an executive order creating a strategic reserve of cryptocurrency for the United States.

Trump will host players including Michael Saylor, co-founder and the executive chair of MicroStrategy, and Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the president’s own crypto business, World Liberty Financial, according to the executives’ social media posts.

Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood Markets, will also attend, according to a spokesperson for Robinhood. Witkoff and Saylor did not respond to requests for comment. Attenders expect the event to focus on Trump’s plans to build the strategic reserve, which the president said will contain bitcoin and four other coins. Trump directed the secretaries of treasury and commerce to develop “budget-neutral strategies” for acquiring additional bitcoin that have no “incremental costs” on taxpayers.

“For the first time, industry leaders feel they’re walking into a collaborative discussion,” said Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Digital Assets, a crypto investment adviser, who said he did not receive an invitation.

Participants said they were focused on any further details on the strategic reserve, a government stockpile of crypto assets.

The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the White House “crypto czar”, billionaire David Sacks, said in a post on social media platform X.

“This [strategic reserve] is going to be the biggest point of contention for many of us,” said JP Richardson, co-founder and CEO of Exodus, a bitcoin wallet developer. Although he owns the four other coins that Trump has suggested including in the reserve, he does not think they have a place in a strategic reserve.

“Crypto has made big strides, but it’s still a relatively nascent industry,” Richardson said. The other coins are smaller and function in a very different way, one he said may create more risk. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, posted on X on Sunday that a bitcoin-only reserve was “probably … the best option”. Both Richardson and Armstrong will attend the summit.

In a post on X, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, who also confirmed his attendance at the summit, hailed Trump’s recognition that “we live in a multichain world” stretching beyond bitcoin. XRP, the coin tied to Ripple, is one of the four other cryptocurrencies Trump has suggested may be added to a crypto reserve. Attendees said they were optimistic about working with an administration that views crypto as a mainstream asset class and expressed hope for a straightforward regulatory process.

“What everyone really needs to have at this point is clarity on what the level of scrutiny and intensity of regulation will be, who the key regulators will be,” said Yesha Yadav, the associate dean and a professor of law at Vanderbilt University. That could speed up the process of approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission of a flurry of new listings of exchange-traded funds.

Trump’s family has launched cryptocurrency meme coins and he also holds a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform, which has sparked some conflict-of-interest concerns. His aides have said Trump has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.

Industry leaders are meeting with President Donald Trump for the first-ever White House cryptocurrency summit Friday, a day after he signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile.

The idea for the U.S. digital asset stockpile is part of Trump's plans to ""make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday.

Trump said four cryptocurrencies — Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano — along with Bitcoin and other valuable cryptocurrencies will be part of the U.S. strategic reserve. The five he named quickly rose in value following his announcement.

""The reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,"" said White House crypto czar and billionaire David Sacks in an X post Thursday.

The U.S. will not sell the bitcoin deposited into the reserve and the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop strategies for acquiring more of the cryptocurrency so long as they do not raise costs for American taxpayers, the White House said.

The first established cryptocurrency, bitcoin, may be the best-known of the digital currencies. It's been the subject of debate in boardrooms, courtrooms, and in Congress. Yet, it remains a mystery to many Americans who have been hearing about the coin for the last decade.

Bitcoin is a digital currency and virtual payment system designed to exist outside the control of an central entity. Holders can send and receive the digital tokens to anyone anywhere in the world.

For many, its major draw is that is it is not governed or issued by central banks or authorities. While traditional fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are issued by governments that can produce them as needed, bitcoin has a limited supply and is produced by computers.

It runs on a network of computers in which all transactions are recorded, verified, and updated by technology known as blockchain, which is akin to an online public ledger meant to prevent fraud. Blockchain and bitcoin were created in 2009 by a person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

The cryptocurrency is known for its price volatility, but some have gotten rich investing in the coin at the right time.

As of Friday afternoon, a bitcoin is worth about $87,000. Ownership of fractional shares of the currency is common, according to NerdWallet.

There are several ways to buy bitcoin including through a crypto exchange, on trading apps, or through an online broker. You can also buy bitcoin funds, the way you would purchase a mutual fund, or buy the coin directly on financial platforms like Cash App or PayPal.

President Donald Trump’s March 6, 2025 executive order establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Crypto Asset Stockpile is a historic moment for this original cryptocurrency first launched in January 2009, and for the digital assets industry, more broadly. The move signals a major shift in policy, with the U.S. government recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset alongside traditional reserves like gold.

Vocal crypto-critic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has demanded immediate financial disclosures from Crypto Czar David Sacks (who  reportedly liquidated his holdings just days ago), questioning potential conflicts of interest amid Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement. Citing concerns over insider trading and regulatory rollbacks, Warren pressed for details on Sacks’ crypto divestments and who knew of Trump’s plans before his public announcement. The inclusion of Solana in the crypto stockpile has raised eyebrows, particularly since Trump launched his “Official Trump” meme coin on Solana’s blockchain prior to his inauguration.

This has fueled speculation that some aspects of the reserve and stockpile may be politically motivated rather than purely strategic.

While some in the crypto industry welcomed the announcement, Bitcoin’s price dropped more than 5% upon news that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile would not include government purchases, only a formalization of existing policy to hold confiscated assets. Despite its bold rhetoric, the order largely reaffirms current asset management practices rather than introducing substantive new policies. However, it does place Bitcoin alongside other strategic reserves and fulfills Trump’s campaign pledge to prioritize the asset in digital asset policy.

In a March 7, 2025, X/Twitter post, early Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem reflected on the momentous shift in policy. “Not in our wildest dreams,” explained Shrem, “could we ever have imagined that one day the President of the United States would establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.”

The order’s vague framework has sparked concerns, particularly as Trump’s March 7, 2025, Crypto Summit is set to feature a narrow circle of industry elites, with little representation from diverse perspectives or consumer advocates. The revelation that the reserve would only consist of seized Bitcoin (rather than positioning the U.S. as an active buyer) sent the market into a freefall, failing to meet some expectations and deepening uncertainty and the tribal divide over the government’s long-term role in Bitcoin’s future.

Strategic reserves are government-controlled stockpiles of critical assets, typically created to mitigate national security or economic stability risks. The most well-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds crude oil to protect against supply disruptions. Governments, including the United States, also hold reserves of gold and foreign currencies to stabilize national economies.

By establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the U.S. is effectively placing Bitcoin in the same category as these traditional reserves, thus further legitimizing a nascent and volatile emerging asset class plagued by fear, uncertainty and doubt. The White House’s framing of Bitcoin as a national asset suggests that policymakers now view it as an emerging ‘store of value’ rather than merely a speculative investment. “In economics,” explains AccountingInsights.org, “the concept of a store of value is vital for understanding how assets retain their worth over time.” Assets that act as stores of value, “provide individuals and businesses confidence in preserving purchasing power against inflation or market fluctuations.” For this reason, Bitcoin is considered a “hedge” against inflation.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, however, is not without controversy. Unlike oil, which is essential for energy security, or gold, which has served as a recognized store of value for millennia, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. At least for now. But volatility is not the absence of value; it is often a sign of an emerging asset class finding its place in the financial system. While critics argue that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic worth due to its digital nature and absence of industrial applications, intrinsic value is always in the eye of the beholder and shaped by the needs of the economic era in which an asset exists.

Today, Bitcoin’s value is derived from market demand, provable scarcity, and its decentralized security model, characteristics that have made it increasingly attractive as a hedge against currency debasement and financial instability. What is dismissed as speculation today may, as the world economy evolves, become an essential pillar of financial resilience tomorrow, a shift already evident in institutional adoption trends and now, through the U.S. government’s own recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

When news of the imminent signing of this EO ahead of the March 7, 2025, Crypto Summit) first broke, Bitcoin’s price surged past $90,000 as traders speculated that the U.S. government would begin actively acquiring Bitcoin, especially with only 1.5 million of the total 21 million supply still available. However, once it became clear that the reserve would rely solely on confiscated Bitcoin rather than new government purchases, the market quickly reversed course. Adding to the uncertainty, an executive order is not law and, therefore, can be overturned by any future president, leaving the long-term fate of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in question absent congressional action.

Investors who had positioned themselves for a major institutional Bitcoin buying spree began offloading their holdings, triggering a sell-off that sent Bitcoin’s price tumbling below $82,000 in a matter of hours. The market reaction highlighted a broader issue: many traders had assumed that the reserve would function similarly to a central bank accumulating gold. Instead, the reliance on seized Bitcoin introduced uncertainty, reinforcing concerns that the reserve would be politically motivated rather than strategically structured.

Some investors also viewed the plan as antithetical to Bitcoin’s core ethos of decentralization and voluntary participation. The idea that the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings would come exclusively from confiscations rather than open-market purchases raised ethical concerns about whether the reserve represented a legitimate financial strategy or simply a means of monetizing legal seizures.

Adding to the confusion was the creation of a second entity, the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will be managed by the Treasury Department and hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA).

This distinction has led to uncertainty about the government’s long-term approach to digital assets. While the Bitcoin reserve is intended to be a long-term strategic holding, the stockpile’s purpose is less clear. Unlike the Bitcoin reserve, which explicitly prohibits selling its assets, the stockpile may function as a more flexible repository of confiscated cryptocurrencies, potentially allowing for future liquidations.

Supporters of the Bitcoin reserve argue that it elevates Bitcoin’s status and signals U.S. leadership in digital asset policy. Some believe the move will encourage other nations to formalize their own Bitcoin reserves, accelerating institutional adoption.

Sacks defended the plan, arguing that the U.S. had lost over $17 billion in potential value by prematurely selling confiscated Bitcoin over the past decade. “Had we held onto the Bitcoin we seized, we would control a much more valuable reserve today,” Sacks wrote in a social media post. “The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve corrects that mistake.”

Some Bitcoin maximalists, including Tyler Winklevoss, applauded the idea of a government-controlled Bitcoin reserve but criticized the inclusion of other cryptocurrencies in the stockpile.

As reported by the Bitoinist, Winklevoss explained “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA,but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.”

Other industry figures, however, have raised concerns about the lack of clarity on how the government will manage its Bitcoin holdings. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures noted that while a Bitcoin reserve could establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets, mixing it with other cryptocurrencies would dilute its credibility. “A Bitcoin-only reserve would ratify Bitcoin as a global asset of consequence, somewhere in the realm of gold,” Carter told CNBC. “Throwing in other digital currencies makes it look like another speculative fund.”

According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government currently holds 198,109 Bitcoin, valued at $17.5 billion at today’s market prices. These holdings have accumulated over time through major enforcement actions, including the Silk Road seizures and the Bitfinex hack investigation. This makes the U.S. one of the largest institutional Bitcoin holders, controlling nearly 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. However, the long-term implications of this ownership remain unclear.

Trump’s Bitcoin reserve initiative has drawn both praise and skepticism, reflecting broader tensions in the crypto industry over government involvement in digital assets.

The political context is inescapable. After years of regulatory hostility under the Biden administration, Trump’s policy represents a dramatic shift toward institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. Yet, the lack of a clear strategy for managing the reserve, combined with concerns about potential political motivations, has left many unanswered questions. If the government mismanages the initiative—through opaque policymaking, insider deals, or future market interventions, it could undermine Bitcoin’s status as a neutral, censorship-resistant asset.

The coming weeks will determine whether the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a bold step toward financial modernization or a risky political experiment. For now, uncertainty looms over the digital asset market, and the debate over Bitcoin’s role in U.S. economic policy is far from settled.

The first-of-its-kind reserve will be anchored by a stash of Bitcoin the government already owns, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.

By David Yaffe-Bellany

David Yaffe-Bellany reports on the cryptocurrency industry.

President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to create a national stockpile of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, an audacious idea that has been widely criticized as a scheme to enrich crypto investors.

The basis of the stockpile will be a stash of Bitcoin, estimated to be worth as much as $17 billion, that the United States has seized in legal cases over the years.

The order also calls for federal agencies to develop strategies to buy more Bitcoin, the most popular digital currency, as long as those purchases do not generate extra costs for taxpayers.

“This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the ‘crypto capital of the world,’” said David Sacks, the White House’s crypto and A.I. policy czar, in a post on social media. He said the United States would not sell any Bitcoin in the reserve, which he likened to “a digital Fort Knox.”

Since Mr. Trump took office in January, his administration has moved rapidly to elevate the crypto industry, a volatile sector that had battled with federal regulators for years. The Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped lawsuits against two of the biggest U.S. crypto companies and halted investigations into several others. And on Friday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to host crypto executives at the White House for a first-of-its-kind “crypto summit.”

Mr. Trump has a personal stake in the success of the crypto industry, creating conflicts of interests that have raised alarms with government ethics experts. Last year he started a business, World Liberty Financial, that offers a cryptocurrency called WLFI. Just days before his inauguration, he also began selling a so-called memecoin — a type of cryptocurrency tied to an online joke or a celebrity figure.

President Donald Trump on Thursday night authorized the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve and a separate US stockpile of other digital assets, fulfilling a campaign promise he made to an industry that is gathering at the White House Friday for a ""crypto summit.""

The bitcoin reserve will be seeded with bitcoin (BTC-USD) already owned by the federal government that was taken as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks said in a post on the social media platform X.

""This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,"" Sacks said. Before signing the executive order in the Oval Office, Trump asked Sacks if he believed in the reserve and then said, ""We made the promise"" — referring to the pledge of a bitcoin reserve he made on the 2024 campaign trail.

Sacks said on X that the US government owns an estimated 200,000 bitcoins after selling off about half of what it acquired through criminal seizures, although he said there has never been a complete audit.

Had the government not sold that sum for roughly $360 million over the last decade, according to White House officials, its bitcoin holdings would potentially be worth $17 billion.

Sacks said the US will not sell any bitcoin once it is in the reserve and that it will be kept as a store of value.

The reserve, he added, “is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’”

Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday said she sent a letter she sent to Sacks raising concerns about the reserve and any conflicts of interest ""as the administration pushes policies that could directly benefit the president, administration insiders, and wealthy investors.""

Sacks said last Sunday in a social media post on X, ""I sold all my cryptocurrency (including BTC, ETH, and SOL) prior to the start of the administration."" On Monday he said he sold a $74,000 position in a Bitwise ETF and does not have ""large indirect holdings.""

He added that he would provide an ""update at the end of the ethics process."" The Financial Times reported that his venture capital firm retains stakes in a small number of crypto startups and that he was in the process of a government ethics review.

His boss, the president, is a participant in the cryptocurrency industry. Just before his inauguration, Trump's team launched an official meme coin for the 47th president (TRUMP) and one for first lady Melania Trump (MELANIA) on the solana blockchain.

Trump and his sons are also backers of another crypto project called World Liberty Financial, and his namesake Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) said it will allocate up to $250 million of cash tied up in a venture called Truth.Fi into cryptocurrencies and other investments.

One unknown question about the reserve announced Thursday by Sacks and Trump is whether it will be used to buy more bitcoin beyond the assets already held by the US government.

Sacks said Thursday night that the secretaries of Treasury and Commerce have the authorization “to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Friday that seized crypto assets would go into the reserve first and ""then we'll see what the way forward is for more acquisitions for the reserve. And we're starting with bitcoin, but it's an overall crypto reserve.""

Sen. Cynthia Lummis has separately discussed a US government crypto-buying program that would call for the Federal Reserve to purchase more bitcoin using 1970s-era certificates for gold reserves. It would need congressional approval.

White House officials are not opposed to a separate effort by Congress to ensure a bitcoin reserve becomes permanent law. An executive order like the one signed by Trump can be reversed by future presidents.

""The goal of a strategic reserve is to buy or convert current assets into bitcoin and then hold them ... that way, we can remove the short-term volatility from the equation and look at this as a long-term strategic asset,"" she told Yahoo Finance in an interview last Friday.

Lummis said there is more work to do to help people understand “the reason why we should have it” and that it can interact with the world reserve currency status of the US dollar.

""We think they are very complementary,"" Lummis told Yahoo Finance.

When the president last weekend discussed his plans for a reserve on social media, he said it would include bitcoin as well as other digital assets: ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), solana (SOL), and cardano (ADA).

Sacks said Thursday that the president had also authorized a ""US digital asset stockpile consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings"" — without naming the assets.

But Sacks made it clear the government would not acquire additional assets for that stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

The new announcement at the end of this week comes after a period of extreme volatility for digital assets. The price of bitcoin has whipsawed following its worst correction since a 2022 meltdown.

It fell sharply from above $90,000 in the hour after Thursday's presidential action before regaining much of that ground. Bitcoin is down 1% since the order was announced. It's still down 18% from its all-time high above $109,000 on the day of Trump's inauguration in January.

The crypto world is hoping a White House crypto summit today will take it one step closer to getting even more of what it wants from a GOP-led Washington, providing some stability to a market trying to regain the upward momentum it had in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election victory.

The SEC has dropped several high-profile cases against prominent cryptocurrency companies since Trump took office and created a presidential working group on digital assets that is studying the possibility of moving legislation through Congress that could provide more clarity about regulatory oversight of digital assets.

The White House said in a statement that Trump is expected to host and deliver remarks at the crypto summit before prominent CEOs, founders, and investors from the industry.

Coinbase Global (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy’s (MSTR) Michael Saylor, Chainlink Labs CEO Sergey Nazarov, and Exodus CEO JP Richardson are expected to attend.

Coinbase is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the changes in Washington, D.C. Last week, the SEC dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase that had been filed and pursued aggressively by the Biden administration.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said she had a “productive meeting” with Columbia University’s interim President Katrina Armstrong today after the Trump administration announced it would cancel approximately $400 million in federal grants to the university.

The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism described the cancelation in a statement as “due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” 

“Look forward to working together to protect all students on their campus,” McMahon wrote on X. “The Trump Administration will not allow the continued harassment and threats of violence against students.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R- responded to criticism of the aggressive job cuts by DOGE across the federal government on Fox News this afternoon, saying the cuts are ""going to be corrected."" 

Marie Harf pressed Johnson on the cuts during an interview on Fox News' ""Outnumbered,"" calling the job cuts ""irresponsible."" 

""How can you and Elon Musk makes millions of dollars every day from the American government, and you're firing these people?"" Harf said. 

Johnson said the cuts were ""going to be corrected,"" but argued Musk's intentions are ""pure."" 

""There are going to be some mishaps and mistakes along the way, but we will do course correction immediately, and that's what you'll see,"" Johnson said.

Groups representing USAID contractors who sued the government said in new court filings this afternoon that the Trump administration owes them $670 million by Monday at 6 p.m. ET.

The plaintiffs said their members have 1,200 invoices that are outstanding for work performed before Feb. 13, totaling about $420 million. At a hearing in the case yesterday, the plaintiffs said their members are owed $250 million in government funds from letter-of-credit drawdown requests. This means the government needs to pay the plaintiffs $670 million by 6 p.m. Monday, which was ordered by a federal court yesterday.

The groups had sued the Trump administration after it froze foreign assistance and shut down USAID. The judge in the case ordered the government to pay the contractors, a ruling backed by the Supreme Court this week.

The Trump administration announced today that it would cancel about $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University “due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.”

The move comes just days after the administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified Columbia that it was going to conduct a “comprehensive review” of the university’s federal grants and contracts.

The task force includes staff from the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services and Education and the U.S. General Services Administration. 

In a statement explaining the cancellation of certain federal grants today, Education Secretary Linda McMahon implied that Columbia had not complied with federal anti-discrimination laws.

Delivering remarks from the White House, Trump discussed today the possibility of a new nuclear deal between the United States and Iran, telling reporters that “there’ll be some interesting days ahead, that’s all I can tell you.”

“We’re down to final strokes with Iran,” Trump said. “We can’t let them have a nuclear weapon.”

“We have a situation with Iran that something’s going to happen very soon, very very soon, you’ll be talking about that pretty soon, I guess, and hopefully we can have a peace deal,” he added.

Trump said in Fox Business News interview that he sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in which he urged for negotiating a nuclear agreement and threatened military action otherwise.

“I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness, I’m just saying I'd rather see a peace deal than the other, but the other will solve the problem,” Trump said at the White House.

Trump said this afternoon that he still believes Putin wants peace in Ukraine despite the Kremlin’s launch of an aerial assault on the country overnight, which came days after the U.S. suspended all military aid to Ukraine and halted intelligence sharing with Kyiv. 

“I’m finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during remarks initially about the economy. ""They don’t have the cards.""

The president added that ""it may be easier dealing with Russia"" on a final agreement to end the war, which he called ""surprising, because they have all the problems.""

National security adviser Mike Waltz added that Trump has been “crystal clear” that all fighting needs to stop, and said the administration has had ""good engagement” with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy. 

Referring to the contentious Oval Office meeting Trump held with Zelenskyy last Friday that ended without the co-signing of a critical minerals deal, Waltz said, “We think we are going to get things back on track.”

Asked by a reporter if he believes Putin is taking advantage of the U.S. pause on military aid to Ukraine, Trump said he thinks Putin is “doing what anyone else would do.”

“I think he’s hitting them harder. He wants to get it ended. I think Ukraine wants to get it ended, but I don’t know,” Trump said. 

Earlier today, Trump threatened to sanction Russia for continuing to bombard Ukraine as a way to pressure it to agree to a ceasefire.

Trump warned that he may implement tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber as early as today, in what amounts to the latest broadside by his administration in the brewing trade war between the United States and Canada. 

Trump has whipsawed on tariffs in recent days, imposing sweeping levies on Tuesday before paring back some of them, including goods from Mexico and Canada covered under the countries’ USMCA trade agreement. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau slammed the new tariffs as “very dumb” earlier this week.

Trump, however, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office today, said there is more to come on tariffs, and possibly soon, over policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris will decide whether she will run for governor of California by the end of the summer, according to a source familiar with her planning. 

There has been speculation about whether she would run since the day after she lost the 2024 presidential election. 

Harris has not ruled out a 2028 presidential run. Despite what could be a competitive Democratic primary, she is ""keeping all options open,"" the source said.

This weekend, Harris is participating in a fireside chat about artificial intelligence in Las Vegas, Nevada, an early primary state.

Trump has granted a short-term reprieve on tariffs imposed on certain Canadian and Mexican goods. NBC News’ Brian Cheung reports on the latest tariffs move by the Trump administration.

After weeks of distancing the U.S. from Ukraine, Trump today threatened to impose expanded “large-scale” sanctions and tariffs on Russia until it reaches a peace agreement with Ukraine.

“Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

His threat comes a week after the intense Oval Office clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy which scuttled hopes for a much-anticipated rare-earth minerals deal. The meeting added to growing concerns that U.S. policy toward Russia was softening and set off a scramble in Europe about who would fill the void if the U.S. pulled its support of Ukraine.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., today denied a motion filed by a coalition of labor unions for a preliminary injunction to block DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s payment information systems, which holds sensitive data on programs such as Social Security and Medicaid. 

Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the plaintiffs' motion failed to demonstrate how DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department data would cause them irreparable harm, which is a standard for granting injunctions. 

“If Plaintiffs could show that Defendants imminently planned to make their private information public or to share that information with individuals outside the federal government with no obligation to maintain its confidentiality, the Court would not hesitate to find a likelihood of irreparable harm,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote in the opinion. 

But the plaintiffs did not show DOGE has such plans, the judge said. The plaintiffs include the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees and the Service Employees International Union. 

Last month, a U.S. district judge in New York temporarily blocked DOGE’s access to Treasury Department data in a case filed by 19 state attorneys general. The states argued that allowing DOGE access to the systems violated federal law. 

Trump said Cabinet secretaries will be in charge of layoffs at their agencies, writing that he wants them to use a “scalpel,” not a “hatchet.” Trump praised Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency for its cuts to federal spending, but also said he wants to “keep good people” in the federal workforce.

Senior Trump administration figures are planning to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Saudi Arabia next week, officials on both sides said yesterday, as Ukraine scrambles to repair its tattered relationship with Washington, its largest benefactor.

It’s the latest diplomatic turn for the Gulf theocracy. Saudi Arabia, which watchdogs accuse of widespread human rights abuses, has instituted some reforms in recent years.

Trump said later yesterday that his first foreign visit would be to the kingdom and that, in return, the nation’s monarchy had offered to invest $1 trillion in American companies.

Next week’s meeting is set to be between Zelenskyy, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz, Witkoff told reporters Thursday. He added that the venue will either be the capital, Riyadh, or the Red Sea city of Jeddah.

Trump threatened this morning to impose expanded U.S. sanctions on Russian entities before a peace agreement with Ukraine. 

""Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. 

His threat comes a week after an intense clash between him, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office resulted in the U.S. and Ukraine not signing a minerals deal. It also comes after Trump has been soft on Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, and has taken steps to halt U.S. assistance to Ukraine, including both aid and weapons as well as the sharing of intelligence. 

Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent seemed to preview additional sanctions on Russia in remarks before the Economic Club of New York.

He said that the Trump administration has kept enhanced sanctions on Russia in place and is prepared to go ""all in,"" he said, ""should it provide leverage in peace negotiations.""

""Per President Trump’s guidance, sanctions will be used explicitly and aggressively for immediate maximum impact,"" he said.

Now that Trump has announced plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, crypto industry leaders can focus on pushing for favorable legislation when they meet with the president today.

Trump's first Crypto Summit is a big nod to an industry that played a major role in his election victory. No executive was more central to that effort than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

Once a Silicon Valley entrepreneur focused on bringing digital assets to the wider world, Armstrong has spent the last year transforming himself into crypto’s ambassador in Washington, D.C., funneling millions into elections, building alliances, and ensuring the digital currencies market has a seat at the table.

“From our point of view, the next step in the United States that’s the most urgent is getting legislation passed,” he told CNBC.

CBS News' parent company, Paramount, filed motions yesterday to dismiss a lawsuit from Trump that claims the network deceptively edited a ""60 Minutes"" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. 

The company's filing argues for dismissal of the suit, calling it an ""attempt to punish"" CBS for their editorial judgments, a move that should be ""barred by the First Amendment."" 

The filing also argues that since Trump's suit claimed the interview's editing caused harm to his electoral prospects, that claim is now moot because he won the election. 

“They not only ask for $20 billion in damages but also seek an order directing how a news organization may exercise its editorial judgment in the future,” the court documents says. “The First Amendment stands resolutely against these demands.”

The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas in October, argues that CBS aired two different responses from Harris when she was asked about the Israel-Hamas war. The answer that aired on the ""60 Minutes"" program Oct. 6 did not include a comment from the vice president on how the Biden administration was dealing with the way Israel was conducting the war, the suit alleged

Trump signed an executive order yesterday that suspends the security clearances of employees of law firm Perkins Coie and launches a review of diversity practices there and at other large law firms. 

The order refers to how Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and, at the time, hired research firm Fusion GPS to put together research about possible connections between Trump and Russia. That research became known as the Steele dossier as it was compiled by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Its claims were largely unverified. 

Trump suggested in his executive order that that situation was an example of ""dishonest and dangerous activity"" at Perkins Coie.

The order directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review DEI practices at large or influential law firms. 

A spokesperson for Perkins Coie said the executive order is “patently unlawful, and we intend to challenge it.”

Trump had already signed an executive order suspending the security clearances of lawyers at Covington & Burling, who were representing former special counsel Jack Smith. 

Influential lawyer Marc Elias is an alumnus of Perkins Coie. He played a key role in fighting Trump-backed lawsuits challenging presidential election results in 2020 and has represented or worked for a slew of Democrats and Democratic campaigns.

The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today — missing expectations for 170,000 new roles but up from a revised 125,000 figure for January.

The unemployment rate climbed slightly to 4.1% from 4.0% the month before.

Federal government employment declined by 10,000 in February — a sign that cuts ordered by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency effort may have started to turn up in official data.

Policy uncertainty and blistering job cuts in Washington threaten to shake the U.S. economy off its moorings, traders and analysts say, with fresh employment data set to provide the latest picture of the effects so far.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — When Andrew and Tristan Tate touched down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last week, the two social media figures — who had been charged with human trafficking in Romania — found some support in right-wing circles for their return home. 

But one of their most prominent critics has been a conservative: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who immediately said the brothers were not welcome in the state. State Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is the governor’s former chief of staff and close political adviser, said the state would open a criminal investigation into the men, although he did not outline specific allegations.

Andrew Tate announced yesterday that he was leaving Florida — saying he’d be back “in a few years” — which likely ends any potential investigation. (His brother also posted a picture from a plane.) But the political impact on DeSantis’ future might last longer. 

DeSantis’ decision to antagonize some on the right by going hard after the Tate brothers puts him at odds with elements of the MAGA movement — including some allies of the president — who are still upset with him for challenging Trump in the 2024 election.

A federal judge is giving the Trump administration until Monday to pay several nonprofit groups and aid organizations that were affected by Trump’s order to freeze foreign assistance and shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.

In a ruling yesterday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali formalized a plan to ensure the federal government releases funds to at least nine groups, including the Global Health Council, Chemonics International and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition.

Ali previously ordered the administration to temporarily disburse foreign aid that was in place before Trump took office Jan. 20, an amount the government estimated to be up to $2 billion.

Sens. Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., and Andy Kim, D-N.J., announced today that they are introducing legislation to set a national standard for wildfire response time on federal lands.

The Wildfire Response and Preparedness Act would establish a 30-minute national standard response time for wildfires on federal land administered by the Interior or Agriculture departments. 

“Establishing an aggressive national wildfire standard response time, just like we have for structure fires, is an America First, commonsense way to protect our nation and our people,” Sheehy said in a statement. “The WRAP Act will help our brave firefighters put out wildfires while they are small and dramatically reduce catastrophic wildfire damage. This bill will save lives and prevent hundreds of billions of dollars in future property damage.”

The standard response time set by the National Fire Protection Association for structural fires is just shy of 5½ minutes. But there is no such standard for wildfires, which the senators said lets fires sometimes rage for days and increases the risk of significant damage.

The White House is set to host a cryptocurrency summit today chaired by the  White House's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks, and administered by the executive director of Trump's working group on digital assets, Bo Hines.

The White House said in a statement announcing the summit last week that ""prominent founders, CEOs, and investors from the crypto industry,"" in addition to members of the working group on digital assets, would attend.

Trump signed an executive order last night establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile using assets forfeited through civil and criminal proceedings.

Trump vowed on Truth Social this week that he ""will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.""

The U.S. froze $26 million in crypto assets, according to authorities.

The United States Secret Service said it has seized a Russian cryptocurrency exchange website, according to court documents unsealed on Friday.

The Justice Department also charged the two administrators of that website with a multimillion-dollar money laundering scheme, court documents said.

Between 2019 and 2025, Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda, 40, a Russian national, allegedly controlled and operated Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Moscow.

The two allegedly ""operated Garantex to launder the proceeds of criminal activity, including ransomware, computer hacking, narcotics transactions, and sanctions violations, and profited from the laundering. Garantex offered its services to the public first through the website Garantex.io and then through Garantex.org. Garantex also misled law enforcement, including the Russian police, about the identities of its customers,"" the documents said.

The Justice Department said that since April 2019, Garantex has processed $96 billion in crypto transactions and noted that those proceeds were allegedly used to fund illicit activities.

""The seizure of website domains associated with Garantex's operations and the freezing of over $26 million in cryptocurrency strikes a serious financial blow to cybercriminals worldwide,"" said Michael Centrella, assistant director of the Secret Service's Office of Field Operations. ""Alongside our U.S. and international law enforcement partners, this coordinated action will prevent additional funds from falling into the hands of criminals.""

Court documents said Besciokov allegedly knew there were two different accounts linked to North Korean cyber threat actors but still let them use the cryptocurrency exchange.

The company was also under sanctions from the U.S. since at least 2022.

""By in and around early 2023, BESCIOKOV and his co-conspirators had also redesigned Garantex's operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions,"" the indictment said. ""For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.""

Besciokov and Serda also allegedly took steps to conceal themselves from Russian law enforcement, according to the court records.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday hosts top cryptocurrency players at the White House, a political boost for an industry that has struggled to gain legitimacy -- and where the Republican president faces conflict of interest concerns.

The president's ""crypto czar,"" Silicon Valley investor David Sacks, has invited prominent founders, CEOs and investors along with members of a Trump working group, to craft policies aimed at accelerating crypto growth, and providing legitimacy that the industry has long sought.

On Thursday night, Trump signed an executive order establishing a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"" a move that Sacks said made good on a campaign promise to an increasingly important component of his coalition.

Summit guests include twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of crypto platform Gemini, as well as Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and Michael Saylor, the boss of major bitcoin investor MicroStrategy.

In a post on X, Sacks said the event would take place as a roundtable, and despite industry interest, the White House would have to ""keep it small.""

For believers, cryptocurrencies represent a financial revolution that reduces dependence on centralized authorities while offering individuals an alternative to traditional banking systems.

Bitcoin, the world's most traded cryptocurrency, is heralded by advocates as a substitute for gold or a hedge against currency devaluation and political instability.

Memecoins

Critics, meanwhile, maintain that these assets function primarily as speculative investments with questionable real-world utility that could leave taxpayers on the hook for cleaning up if the market crashes.

The proliferation of ""memecoins"" -- cryptocurrencies based on celebrities, internet memes, or pop culture items rather than technical utility -- presents another challenge.

Much of the crypto industry frowns upon these tokens, fearing they tarnish the sector's credibility, amid reports of quick pump-and-dump schemes that leave unwitting buyers paying for assets that end up worthless.

Trump also faces conflict of interest concerns.

U.S. crypto investors were major supporters of Trump's presidential campaign, contributing millions of dollars toward his victory in hopes of ending the Biden administration's deep skepticism toward digital currencies.

Trump also has significant financial ties to the sector, partnering with exchange platform World Liberty Financial and launching the ""Trump"" memecoin in January, as did his wife, Melania.

Once hostile to the crypto industry, Trump has already taken significant steps to clear regulatory hurdles.

Under Thursday's executive order, the bitcoin stockpile will be composed of digital currency seized in U.S. criminal proceedings.

The use of these assets ""means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,"" Sacks said in a post Thursday night on X.

Sacks has said that if previous administrations had held onto their digital holdings over the past decade, they would be worth $17 billion today.

Trump also appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Under Atkins, the SEC has dropped legal proceedings against major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken that were initiated during Biden's term.

The previous administration had implemented restrictions on banks holding cryptocurrencies -- which have since been lifted -- and allowed former SEC chairman Gary Gensler to pursue aggressive enforcement.

However, meaningful change will likely require congressional action, where crypto legislation has remained stalled despite intense lobbying efforts led by investors, including Trump ally Marc Andreessen, an influential venture capitalist.

One of the first steps after the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate stockpile of other digital assets will be an audit of how much cryptocurrency the government holds, according to White House crypto czar David Sacks.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order late Thursday creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the separate stockpile of other digital assets, to be capitalized with crypto forfeited in legal proceedings. Both the reserve and the stockpile will contain crypto forfeited as part of legal proceedings, the action said. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

Thsyu CRYPTO GROUP LIMITED


DENVER, March  07, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thsyu CRYPTO GROUP LIMITED today announced the official launch of THSYU, a new cryptocurrency exchange in France that combines military-grade security features with high-performance trading capabilities. This strategic market entry responds to growing demand for secure, efficient crypto trading platforms in the European market.



In the midst of a global cryptocurrency boom, the security and efficiency of trading platforms have become top concerns for investors. THSYU addresses these concerns by implementing cutting-edge technology and providing an unrivaled user experience specifically designed for French users.

Ironclad Security: Protection for Digital AssetsRecent years have seen crypto exchanges plagued by hacking scandals and asset thefts, shaking investor trust. THSYU counters this with military-grade encryption and a multi-layer cold storage system designed to keep hackers at bay. The platform also boasts a real-time AI monitoring system that flags and halts suspicious activity within milliseconds. A Paris-based early adopter noted, ""I finally feel safe leaving significant funds on an exchange—THSYU lets me sleep soundly."" In a crypto world starved for trust, this security pledge is a significant advancement.

Lightning-Fast Trades: Maximizing Profit OpportunitiesFor crypto traders, timing is everything. THSYU's trading engine can handle up to 1 million transactions per second—far surpassing industry norms. Whether Bitcoin is soaring or Ethereum is crashing, THSYU ensures orders execute instantly, leaving no profit window unclaimed. A French trader shared, ""I snagged a new coin's debut on THSYU—the speed was unreal."" This efficiency gives French investors an edge in the global crypto marketplace.

Tailored for France: A Localized Crypto ExperienceTHSYU isn't just another generic global platform—it's specifically focused on France. Beyond offering euro trading pairs and French-language support, the exchange is set to partner with local French banks for seamless fiat deposits and withdrawals. Even more striking, THSYU vows to comply with the EU's strictest financial regulations, aiming to set a gold standard for legitimacy. For French investors wary of regulatory gray zones, this provides added confidence.

As the global crypto market continues to evolve in 2025, France—despite its economic prowess—has shown potential for increased crypto adoption. THSYU's arrival fills a market gap with its combination of security, speed, and localization. The platform is now open for registration at www.thsyu.com.

    US President Donald Trump, who is hosting a summit on cryptocurrencies on Friday, is banking on the sector to boost his personal fortune and bypass the Federal Reserve. 

   By Arnaud Leparmentier (New York (United States) correspondent)

""I want to be the Elon Musk of the cryptocurrency world."" At 34, Chinese businessman Justin Sun, the founder of cryptocurrency platform Tron, is part of the cryptogalaxy that has become infatuated with US President Donald Trump and pledges allegiance to him, hoping to accelerate his own fortune. Like his mentor, recently converted to bitcoin, the man lives in a world of fake money and influence peddling, which may appear virtual, but where real money flows freely too.

On November 21, 2024, at Sotheby's auction house in New York, Sun purchased the work ""Comedian,"" by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan – a simple banana taped to a wall. Its price was $6.24 million (€5.8 million). ""This is not just an artwork,"" said Justin Sun. ""It represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes and the cryptocurrency community."" Above all, it's a demonstration that you can make a fortune from nothing – a banana and tape – just as you can in cryptocurrencies, digital tokens that are only worth as much as the trust placed in them by investors.

Sun decided to board the American president's train: On November 25, 2024, after his artistic coup, he announced that he had invested $30 million in cryptocurrencies promoted by the Trump family, an amount raised to $75 million in January. ""The US is becoming the blockchain hub [a technology for storing and transmitting information], and bitcoin owes it to Donald Trump! Let's go!"" said the man who has become an adviser to the family firm.

LINCOLN, Neb. (KSNB) - The Nebraska Legislature passed LB 609, also known as the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act.

The bill has a number of provisions that help protect Nebraska citizens from scams.

The bill has various requirements in order to keep money in the hands of citizens including requiring a license for operators of crypto ATMs, daily transaction limits, fraud warning notices, transaction receipts to help law enforcement, fee caps to prevent excessive charges and requires cryptocurrency operators to issue refunds for transactions identified as fraudulent. 

The bill passed the legislature with 48 votes for, none against, and one abstaining. 

According to the Nebraska AARP, Nebraskans reported 239 digital currency scam complaints in 2023, totaling approximately $14.6 million in losses. 

Actual losses are likely higher, as many victims are hesitant to report scams due to embarrassment.

Todd Stubbendieck, State Director of AARP Nebraska, said, “Today is a significant day for Nebraskans. When lawmakers unite on an issue, regardless of their political affiliations, it sends a powerful message. AARP is grateful the Nebraska Legislature acknowledged the urgent need to safeguard our communities from the rising threat of cryptocurrency kiosk scams.”

The bill will need the governor’s signature to become law.

A simmering tension in the crypto industry resurfaced after President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited order creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and an additional stockpile of other digital assets.

Even as crypto executives issued effusive social media posts praising the move, Bitcoin fell as much as 5.7%. The largest digital asset later pared losses to about 3%, trading at $87,125 as of 12 p.m. in New York. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

CEO Michael Saylor has grown Strategy’s pile to nearly half a million bitcoin and the stock is falling with most of the asset class.

It’s been quite a week for bitcoin, with President Trump’s executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin national reserve late last night, though it failed to boost the price of the coin, which has dropped to $86,000 as of 12:15 p.m. ET today. 

The details of the order specified only that the government would fund the reserve with previously seized cryptocurrencies, which seems to have hurt the overall cryptocurrency market as well as sentiment around Strategy, which is down more than 6% today.  

CEO Michael Saylor will be at today’s inaugural White House Crypto Summit and spoke on Fox Business about his ideas for how the reserve should be built, which included the US adding bitcoin slowly and strategically. 

Despite the executive order saying any bitcoin purchased will be done only through “budget-neutral strategies,” public companies around the globe are still steadily buying and stashing bitcoin.

This week, Japanese company Metaplanet added 156 bitcoin for $13.4 million. “As of 3/3/2025, we hold 2391 $BTC acquired for ~$196.3 million at ~82,100 per bitcoin,” CEO Simon Gerovich posted on X.

In Brazil, fintech company Méliuz said its board of directors has approved allocating 10% of the company’s cash reserves in bitcoin.

“The Company has made its first Bitcoin purchases, acquiring 45.72 Bitcoin for approximately $4.1 million at an average price of $90,296.11 per Bitcoin,” CEO Israel Salmen posted on X.

Meanwhile, stateside, publicly traded bitcoin platform Fold added 475 bitcoin to its reserve today — a 50% increase in the company’s bitcoin holdings, which now total 1,485 bitcoin, according to the release.","{'href': 'https://sherwood.news', 'title': 'Sherwood News'}"

As crypto executives gathered for a White House Summit Friday and officials clarified plans for a Crypto Reserve, there was one big winner: Bitcoin. In a Sunday March 2 social media message, President Trump had outlined a Reserve plan to include ETH, SOL, ADA and XRP alongside BTC. But, by Thursday night March 6, when he signed an executive order on the reserve, that plan had changed. Now, Bitcoin will get its own reserve and other coins will be relegated to a separate “stockpile.” Regulatory reporter Jesse Hamilton led our coverage from Washington D.C.



The volte-face came after vociferous industry reaction to Trump’s Sunday plan, which may have impacted decision-making. Many Bitcoiners complained BTC would be diluted alongside lesser-cap coins and that Bitcoin has unique characteristics as “digital gold” where other projects don’t. In the end, the White House seemed to agree. ADA, SOL and XRP, having been buoyed by the Sunday announcement, all plunged on the news, per reporting from CoinDesk’s Kris Sandor and Cheyenne Ligon.



There was other good news for the premier cryptocurrency. President Nayib Bukele said El Salvador would continue buying BTC even after an IMF deal that had seemed to scotch that mission, CoinDesk’s Tom Carreras reported. Texas passed a bill to create its own Bitcoin Reserve, leading about 20 other states that are considering the same, Hamilton reported. Fold added 475 BTC, becoming a top-10 public bitcoin treasury, James Van Straten wrote.



Lombard Finance said it would deploy its liquid-staking bitcoin token, LBTC, on Sui, deepening bitcoin’s moat in crypto markets. CoinDesk’s Francisco Rodrigues had that news. (Meanwhile, Sui’s native token was added to the Trump-owned World Liberty Financial Asset Reserve, boosting its price.)



Danny Nelson had the scoop of the week: News that DoubleZero Foundation, a stealthy startup building a “new internet” aiming to improve blockchain performance, had raised $28 million at a $400 million valuation (it is now looking for more investment.)

In other news, Sam Bankman-Fried spoke to Tucker Carlson from his prison cell, another stop on his media play to win a presidential pardon. Once an enthusiastic backer of Democrat electoral candidates, SBF now seems to be on the GOP side. We’ll have to see whether his outreach pays dividends in the weeks ahead.

Donald Trump’s crypto summit could see Bitcoin’s price surge to $100,000.

That’s according to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. 

He argued that if the White House’s meet-up delivers on the hope of clear regulatory signals, then that will prove a boon for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

“A successful summit could see Bitcoin reclaim $100,000 and crypto assets like ETH, XRP, and Solana soar, cementing US leadership in global crypto markets,” Lee said. 

However, he cautioned that “a lack of actionable steps might disappoint investors, underscoring the high stakes of this event.”

Lee’s comments come mere hours before the highly anticipated event and against a backdrop of markets in turmoil.

Traders have placed bullish bets that Bitcoin’s price will hit $120,000 by the end of March, and analysts like Maelstrom’s Arthur Hayes say the price could jump above $200,000 by the end of 2025.

Bitcoin sank on Friday as traders digested the details of Trump’s executive order to establish a national crypto stockpile, which fell short of expectations.

Trump’s order establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, but with no immediate purchases — only seized crypto. 

This dashed investor hopes for a multibillion-dollar buying spree and, combined with uncertainties related to Trump’s foreign policies, triggered a sell-off that sent Bitcoin tumbling.

Bitcoin dropped as low as $84,800 before it recovered to $89,000 in the hours leading up to the crypto summit.

Despite the flat price action, the shift in US policy is noteworthy. 

“We went from no spot Bitcoin ETF to strategic Bitcoin reserve in just over a year,” said ETFStore President Nate Geraci.

When Trump first proposed the reserve in Nashville last year, traders speculated that the US would embark on a multibillion-dollar buying spree, fuelling a months-long rally.

While some see the reserve as a step toward legitimising Bitcoin as a strategic asset, others criticised the government’s involvement, arguing it risks turning into a de-facto, state-run crypto hedge fund.

Beyond Bitcoin, the executive order also outlined a broader digital asset stockpile. 

The executive order didn’t name any other digital assets by name, but Trump indicated earlier this week that he’d like to include Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP in it. 

These tokens all fell sharply after the government confirmed it wouldn’t be buying them any time soon.

“So the government made all these L1 founders come to DC to kiss the ring, and the night before published the news that they’re not actually buying their bags after all,” tweeted Nic Carter, co-founder and partner at Castle Island Ventures.

Ethereum fell 4.4%, Solana lost 3.2%, Cardano slid 7.9%, and XRP dropped 1.4% as traders unwound bets on a US-backed buying spree.

However, they have mostly recovered their losses and are now trading flat, just as those closest to the projects gather in Washington, looking for answers.

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology

The US has a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Question: What's a strategic bitcoin reserve?

More important question: Why should the US have a strategic bitcoin reserve?

Spoiler: I've been trying to figure this out for a bit, and I really can't understand it.

Other people seem similarly perplexed. ""It is not clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit taxpayers,"" Reuters said Thursday.

And while I don't usually compare myself to Donald Trump, I have definitely made the same face he made Thursday, when someone is telling me something I don't fully comprehend. ""And this is something you believe in?"" he asked David Sacks, his crypto czar, before signing the executive order creating the reserve.

A post shared by America 🇺🇸 (@usa)

To be clear: I know what the reserve is supposed to be. And I know why Trump signed the order creating it.

The president, who had previously called bitcoin ""a scam,"" changed his stance on crypto last year — he now has his own cryptocurrency — and pledged at a Nashville bitcoin conference to create the reserve. His turnaround coincided with the crypto industry's embrace of his candidacy. (Though he still didn't seem like a true believer back in April: ""Have a good time with your bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you're playing with,"" he told the crowd as he left the stage.)

But I don't get the point of a strategic reserve.

The US already owns a bunch of bitcoin, mostly acquired through asset forfeiture in court proceedings. Those coins are now supposed to go into the reserve, and the government isn't supposed to ever sell them.

While some crypto and bitcoin fans thought the Trump plan was to go out and buy more bitcoin, that doesn't seem to be the case now. Though the order appears to provide some wiggle room on that front since it instructs Trump's Cabinet members to ""develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.""

If you peruse crypto fans' commentary about the news, you'll see a mixed reaction: Some are upset that there's no immediate plan for the US to buy a lot of bitcoin — which would boost bitcoin prices. Others think it's a good thing for the US to actively support bitcoin instead of, say, calling it ""a scam.""

What I haven't found — and feel free to point it out to me if you have — is an explanation of why this is good policy.

Sacks and others say this is just the equivalent of the US holding gold in Fort Knox, or owning reserves of other valuable commodities, like it does with oil. But to what end? The government's relationship with gold is an old and complicated one. It keeps extra oil around in case of emergency. I don't see a parallel for crypto.

I also thought one of the main ideas behind crypto was that it allowed people to create assets without involving the government. And this sure seems like it's government involvement. At the very least, since the US owns a bunch of bitcoin and is now promising not to sell that bitcoin, it seems like that's the government actively supporting bitcoin.

Look. I'm no crypto expert. So over the past few days, I reached out to several crypto experts — who are also people who are fans of Trump 2.0's pro-crypto stance — to explain the thinking behind the reserve, and … couldn't get them to chat with me about it. Even off the record.

That reaction certainly doesn't prove anything. But it does make me think that even some crypto people aren't 100% convinced about this one. Let's see if people feel more comfortable about this idea in a year or so.

Now that President Trump has announced plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, crypto industry leaders can focus on what else they want to hear from the new administration on Friday.

Just over six weeks into his second White House term, Trump is hosting his first Crypto Summit, a nod to an industry that played a major role in his election victory in November. No executive was more central to that effort than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

Once a Silicon Valley entrepreneur focused on onboarding the world to digital assets, Armstrong has spent the last year transforming himself into crypto's ambassador in Washington, D.C., funneling millions into elections, building alliances, and ensuring the digital currencies market has a seat at the table.

""My goal in attending this is really just, first of all, to thank President Trump for helping make the United States the crypto capital of the world,"" Armstrong told CNBC ahead of the meeting. ""I think he's lived up to that campaign promise so far, and we've seen a lot of work getting done here in a positive way.""

Joining Armstrong at Friday's summit, which is being led by White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, will be Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, and Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov, among others. They're planning to discuss digital asset regulation as well as the mechanics of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which Trump announced late Thursday by way of executive order.

Armstrong, whose company helped the crypto sector raise and direct $250 million into the 2024 election cycle, outpacing Wall Street banks and the oil industry, has been instrumental in shaping the new administration's approach to digital assets. Crypto's push to unseat opposition lawmakers and install pro-crypto candidates paid off handsomely, flipping key seats and cementing the sector as a major political force in Washington.

Several million dollars were funneled directly to Trump's campaign and inaugural fund, a sign of just how much was riding on his victory.

At Friday's summit, Armstrong says his top priority will be pushing forward new laws.

""From our point of view, the next step in the United States that's the most urgent is getting legislation passed,"" he said. He specifically pointed to stablecoin regulation and broader market structure reforms.

Momentum for regulatory clarity is already shifting in crypto's favor. The Senate this week voted, with strong bipartisan support, to overturn two Biden-era regulations that the industry opposed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, called the wins a gateway for more comprehensive legislation.

For Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, a key issue is how the U.S. can use blockchain technology to maintain its dominance in global finance.

""Really what matters for financial systems is assets,"" said Nazarov, whose company provides a blockchain-based platform for digital assets. ""Does the U.S. generate the largest collection of the best base assets that are then wrapped, rewrapped, and repackaged by others? That's how I define global leadership of a financial system in this new model.""

Nazarov said the U.S. must ensure that key financial markets – treasuries, investment funds, and real estate – are tokenized. He sees that as the defining financial shift of the next 50 years, similar to the move from paper-based markets to internet-based financial products.

Robinhood's Tenev has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates for tokenization, arguing that blockchain technology can democratize private markets and break down barriers to investment in the world's most valuable companies. In a Washington Post op-ed, he pointed out that companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe are worth hundreds of billions of dollars combined but remain inaccessible to everyday investors, with profits concentrated among a small group of insiders.

""Crypto technology can unlock new ways to trade and invest in all assets, from digital to real-world,"" he told CNBC ahead of the event. ""Tokenization will transform investing, but we need regulatory clarity to make it happen.""

Under current SEC rules, only accredited investors, people with over $1 million in net worth or $200,000 in annual income, can participate in private markets. Tenev says that reforming these outdated rules and creating a security token registration framework would level the playing field for retail investors, giving them access to high-growth opportunities that have long been reserved for venture capitalists.

Prior to Thursday's executive order, the big debate in the industry was what kind of strategic reserve Trump would propose. The announcement ends speculation over whether the reserve would include multiple cryptocurrencies. While Trump's initial post on Truth Social named five tokens — bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana's SOL token and Cardano's ADA coin — the final order limits the reserve to bitcoin.

SOL, ether and bitcoin all fell around 5% late Thursday, while ADA plunged nearly 12%.

The order marks the U.S. government's first formal recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset. The reserve will be funded exclusively through bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring taxpayers bear no financial burden.

Non-bitcoin assets will be placed in a separate Digital Asset Stockpile managed by the Treasury Department.

Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures said the decision cements bitcoin's status as a global asset, ""somewhere in the realm of gold.""

Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley, who will also be at Friday's summit, called the development ""a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage.""

""By holding bitcoin and other digital assets for the long term, the White House is taking a future-forward approach to bolstering American economic competitiveness — not just for the decade ahead, but for the next century,"" said McCauley.

For David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. and one of the key figures credited with influencing Trump's embrace of bitcoin, the priority is understanding the size of the country's bitcoin ownership.

""One is to figure out how much bitcoin America holds, and what we can do as an industry to help the government secure it,"" he said.

The Treasury Department must now conduct a full audit of the government's holdings, estimated at 200,000 bitcoin. Sacks confirmed that the government will not sell any bitcoin from the reserve, positioning it as a permanent store of value.

Bailey, who convinced Trump to keynote the biggest bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville in July, is also pushing for bitcoin-backed Treasury bonds, arguing that integrating bitcoin into the U.S. debt system could strengthen the country's balance sheet and attract more buyers.

""If we mix bitcoin reserves with U.S. bonds, we could create significant demand by giving investors exposure to bitcoin's performance,"" he said.

Armstrong told CNBC that Coinbase would ""absolutely"" step up to be a crypto custodian for the government in the context of a national reserve, adding that the company already works with various parts of the government on crypto custody and trading.

""We're always happy to continue doing that,"" Armstrong said.

Ryan Gilbert, a fintech investor, said the reserve will send a strong message to institutions that bitcoin is here to stay.

""We're also seeing that this is going to be the mirror image of a lot of corporations that have looked at their treasuries and started to invest in bitcoin,"" he said, pointing to Saylor and Strategy as early adopters. ""I think this will spark a whole new wave of confidence in the asset, both from corporations and the U.S. government.""

Saylor's company has amassed a roughly $43 billion stash of bitcoin, accounting for almost all of its market cap.

""I think this executive order is well considered and auspicious for the United States, the crypto industry, and bitcoin,"" Saylor told CNBC.

The move faces some pressure from Democrats. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, sent a letter to Sacks ahead of the meeting, raising conflict-of-interest concerns and questioning whether Sacks had advance knowledge of Trump's Truth Social post that initially floated a multi-coin strategic reserve.

Warren called on Sacks to disclose any financial holdings in bitcoin, ether, solana, and other assets included in the reserve, noting that his firm, Craft Ventures, was heavily invested in these tokens through Bitwise as of Jan. 1. She also pressed for public disclosure of his government ethics filings, which, as an unpaid special government employee, he has to file but isn't required to make public.

Sacks said this week on X that he sold ""all my cryptocurrency and my crypto-focused funds"" before joining the administration.

After the summit, many of the attendees will regroup at an off-the-record event hosted by Coinbase, along with invited members of the administration. Armstrong is gearing up to play the long game.

""The fight for crypto here is more urgent than ever,"" Armstrong said. ""If the U.S. leads on this front, I think the rest of the G20 could be pretty inspired by it, and that has a lot of domino effects downstream.""

A senior White House official told Decrypt that President Donald Trump created a strategic reserve exclusively for Bitcoin on Thursday because the president’s administration views the cryptocurrency as belonging to a league of its own. 

“Bitcoin is special in our view,” the senior White House official said. “It’s the most secure. It’s the most decentralized. It doesn’t have an issuer. So it deserves special treatment.”

In signing an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Trump also established a federal Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include various other cryptocurrencies seized by the U.S. government “in connection with criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.”

Trump stated on Sunday that such a stockpile would specifically feature XRP, Solana, and Cardano, sending market prices for those assets flying. ""I think the president just gave five examples of cryptocurrencies in his post,"" the official said. ""Those five have to be the largest by market cap, so I think people are reading into that a little bit too much. The bottom line is, I think that what we’ve announced here is consistent with what the president has always said about the space.”

It's currently unclear if the U.S. government is in possession of any assets mentioned in Trump's post, other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, that it may have gained from prior criminal proceedings. U.S. government crypto wallets identified by blockchain intelligence firm Arkham currently hold zero XRP, SOL, or ADA. 

When asked by Decrypt whether this means the crypto stockpile may not feature XRP, SOL, or ADA after all, the White House official deflected, saying the U.S. government does not yet have a full accounting of which digital assets it holds and in what amounts.

“We have to go see what the federal government actually owns,” the official said. “They've never done an audit before. I think that's the place to start.”

The official elaborated that while the nearly 200,000 Bitcoin believed to be in the U.S. government’s possession will be held indefinitely with the aim of generating “long term value,” the U.S. Treasury secretary will have the authority to sell off any altcoins in the Digital Assets Stockpile if they “decided that was the best strategy.”

The official also teased the agenda for this afternoon’s first ever White House Crypto Summit, which will put various industry leaders in dialogue with senior government officials. No tax-related issues will be discussed; the emphasis will instead be primarily on dismantling Biden-era, anti-crypto regulations.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is considering taking a first step to using cryptocurrency, according to a meeting recording and other materials reviewed by ProPublica and three officials familiar with the matter. Two officials told ProPublica they believe the initiative may be a trial run for the use of crypto across the federal government.

The discussions have sparked concern among some at the department, especially about the prospect of paying recipients of major federal grants in cryptocurrency, an uninsured digital asset associated with financial speculation, dramatic swings in value and transnational crime.

The focus of the discussions so far has been experimenting with using the underlying technology that makes crypto possible — the blockchain — to monitor HUD grants. Blockchain advocates argue that the technology is valuable on its own for such purposes. But the primary use of blockchain, according to experts, is for crypto transactions.

“It’s just introducing another unregulated security into the housing market as though 2008, 2009 didn’t happen,” one HUD staffer said, referring to the subprime mortgage crisis. “I don’t see any way this will help anything. I see a lot of ways this could hurt,” said the official, who, like others in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The HUD discussions have covered the potential use of a stablecoin, a form of crypto that is pegged to another asset to avoid wild swings in value, although such swings have happened in the past.

The blockchain idea is being pushed, a HUD official told colleagues, by Irving Dennis. Dennis, the agency’s new principal deputy chief financial officer, is a former partner at the global consulting giant EY, also commonly known by its original name, Ernst & Young. EY itself is involved in the proposal as well: An executive of the firm discussed the idea with HUD officials last month.

We’re trying something new. Was it helpful?

The crypto industry has found an ally in President Donald Trump, whose administration has tapped industry boosters to lead federal agencies, backed off investigations into crypto firms and created a “strategic Bitcoin reserve.” (Bitcoin plunged $5,000 within an hour of the news of the reserve’s opening on Thursday.) Trump himself has significant financial interests in crypto. On Friday, the White House is scheduled to host a “crypto summit” with leading figures from the industry.

The proposal at HUD indicates a new way that the administration may seek to bolster the industry: by incorporating blockchain and possibly cryptocurrency into the routine spending and accounting practices of federal agencies. It’s a move that would align with the apparent desire of Trump adviser Elon Musk to use the blockchain to monitor federal spending.

Dennis and HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett both denied the accounts of their colleagues. “The department has no plans for blockchain or stablecoin,” Lovett said. “Education is not implementation.”

Robert Judson, the EY executive involved in the conversations, confirmed that they took place. “We as a firm were having discussions with select individuals at that agency,” he said when reached by phone. Judson told ProPublica he would seek EY’s approval for a full interview, then didn’t call back.

The White House, EY and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

HUD officials held at least two meetings about the blockchain proposal last month. A list of attendees to the first meeting included staffers from the offices of the CFO and Community Planning and Development. CPD administers billions of dollars in grants that support low- and moderate-income people, including funding to develop affordable housing, run homeless shelters, support disaster recovery, relocate domestic violence survivors and build parks, sewers and community centers. It was the CFO’s office that called for the meeting, one person told ProPublica.

Also listed as a meeting attendee was Judson from EY. For years Judson has advocated for the blockchain, a digital ledger of sorts that creates an immutable record of transactions saved across multiple computers. Boosters of the technology cast it as a way to cut middlemen such as banks and credit card companies out of financial transactions and make those transactions more transparent and secure. Judson has written that the blockchain can help organizations prevent money from being siphoned off for unintended purposes. “As digital assets such as stable coins or digital currencies take hold, more powerful applications will emerge for integrated value exchange,” he wrote. Dennis, who served as HUD CFO in the first Trump administration, also wrote, in a 2021 book, that the agency should use technology such as “blockchain, robotics, and next-generation financial management systems.”

Stablecoins are backed by reserves including traditional currency, commodities and Treasury securities. That is supposed to ensure that their value — unlike that of, say, Bitcoin — doesn’t fluctuate. However, on several high-profile occasions, the value of stablecoins has done just that.

At the HUD meeting, attendees discussed a “proof of concept” project in which CPD would begin to track the funding going to a single CPD grant recipient and possibly subrecipients on the blockchain. The need for the project was “not well articulated,” one attendee later wrote in meeting notes.

Following the meeting, a HUD official wrote and circulated a memo within the agency panning the idea. “Without exaggeration, every imaginable implementation of this at HUD appears dangerous and inefficient,” the memo reads.

HUD has no difficulty tracking grant spending, the memo contended, making the new technology unnecessary. Incorporating it would be time-consuming, complicated and require extensive training. And, if the project involved paying grantees in cryptocurrency instead of dollars, it would inject volatility and unpredictability into the funding stream, even if the currency was a stablecoin.

In subsequent discussions with HUD staffers, the memo’s author described the proposal as a “beachhead” at HUD for the introduction of cryptocurrency, which the author compared to “monopoly money.”

CPD officials continued to raise concerns in a follow-up meeting, a recording of which was reviewed by ProPublica. (Judson did not attend this one.) Some attendees saw merit in the blockchain idea, suggesting it could reduce inaccurate data from grant recipients and enable real-time reporting and monitoring of their spending.

“Maybe there is something that we could learn from it,” one said, “especially if we feel like the broader federal government is moving towards some sort of stablecoin option in the future.”

One official asked why the agency was considering the project. “Because it’s sexy,” someone replied. Another said, “Irv has asked us to pursue blockchain, so that’s why we are looking at it,” referring to Dennis.

Many details were left unexplained at the meeting, including, crucially, whether the proposal would involve paying grantees in cryptocurrency. But some signaled that it would.

“You can do it with what would be attached to a stable currency. That would be up to Treasury, and I think they’re already going that way, for what it’s worth,” one official said. “It would simulate the dollar.”

Another added, “It would basically be a cryptocurrency that is linked to the U.S. dollar on a one-for-one basis.”

A finance official suggested the idea could be applied more broadly across HUD. “We are looking at this for the entire enterprise. We just wanted to start in CPD,” he said. The agency is also considering the idea for the Office of Public and Indian Housing, he said, for “tenant eligibility and stuff like that.” That office serves the millions of people who live in public and federally subsidized housing.

This is not the first time that federal officials have considered incorporating the blockchain into the work of the government. Agencies including the Treasury Department, the Department of Commerce and even HUD have been involved in a study, a prototype and a working group in recent years. But those who monitor the crypto industry were not aware of as broad an application of the technology in the federal government as what HUD officials have recently discussed.

Some crypto experts were dubious. “It’s a terrible idea,” said Corey Frayer, a former official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, where he focused on the crypto markets and financial stability. “It is absolutely wild that anyone with any sense would consider this.”

Frayer, now at the Consumer Federation of America, warned that HUD grants paid in stablecoin could fall in value. He expressed greatest concern about the notion that the proposal could expand to other parts of the agency. If that included, for example, introducing stablecoin into the $1.3 trillion in mortgage insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration, a fluctuation in the value of the stablecoin could have a major economic impact, he said.

“Imagine a world in which all of the government involvement in the housing industry, all of the funds circulating in that environment, dropped in value by 13%,” he said, citing a 2023 episode in which a stablecoin briefly fell 13 cents below the dollar. “It’s hard to imagine that wouldn’t be catastrophic.”

Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who researches financial regulation and technology, noted that some high-profile attempts to use the blockchain for purposes unrelated to cryptocurrency have failed. She expressed skepticism that the technology would fare better in the context of government grants, where bad outcomes could harm those who depend on HUD funding to survive.

“Blockchain technology has been around for 15 years. No one wants to use it. And so now we have an attempt to force the government to use it,” she said, with “the most vulnerable people” serving “as guinea pigs.”

The US pushed back against SCOTUSblog founder Tom Goldstein’s bid to end electronic monitoring of his devices, alleging the defendant remains a flight risk who failed to disclose cryptocurrency assets to the government and court.

Goldstein was arrested based on the government’s claim that he made prohibited cryptocurrency transfers in violation of his release terms for tax crimes. Magistrate Judge Timothy J. Sullivan released him after three days, but imposed new monitoring conditions, when the defendant cast doubt over his ownership of the at-issue accounts. Goldstein appealed those conditions on Feb. 27, saying they were cased on the incorrect assumption that he controlled the cryptocurrency wallets.

One cryptocurrency wallet that Goldstein denies owning or controlling, with the designation 935B, received and sent approximately $100 million in cryptocurrency between November 2022 and the present, the government said.

The monitoring conditions should stay, the US said, because Goldstein’s own account of events denying control over the wallets demonstrates his risk of flight.

“Even if Defendant does not own or control the 935B wallet, these facts show Defendant’s connection to individuals—possibly abroad—who have controlled tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency through an unhosted wallet,” the US said. His correspondence “underscores how Defendant has used, and can continue to use, unhosted cryptocurrency wallets to facilitate transfers of large sums of money with gambling and/or foreign contacts.”

The government also pushed back on Goldstein’s claim that, because the wallet engaged in $2 million in transfers during his incarceration, he couldn’t possibly control the account as alleged. 

“Defendant has shown only that he needed someone else to provide the public address for the 935B wallet and that someone other than him accessed that wallet while he was detained,” the government’s brief said. “The timing of recent transfers suggests that one or more of the transfers may have been done by or at the direction of Defendant.”

Goldstein, an appellate attorney with a long career arguing before the Supreme Court, was indicted for tax evasion and making false statements on a loan application. The Justice Department says he concealed gambling-related income and disguised personal expenditures using his law firm.

Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP represents Goldstein.

The case is United States v. Goldstein, D. Md., No. 8:25-cr-00006, opposition to appeal 3/6/25.

 Bitcoin analysts warn of limited upside after Trump’s reserve plan excludes new government purchases, with BTC struggling to hold above key resistance levels. 

Bitcoin analysts are signaling limited upside potential for the cryptocurrency following disappointment over US President Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan, which did not involve direct government purchases of Bitcoin, contrary to some expectations.

Trump’s executive order, signed on March 7, outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) through market purchases, Cointelegraph reported.

Bitcoin plunged over 6% after the announcement, falling from $90,400 to $84,979, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

Bitcoin’s price action may lack any significant upside due to this initial investor disappointment, according to Bitfinex analysts, who told Cointelegraph:

Still, other analysts see the US Bitcoin reserve plan as the first “real step” for Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system.

“The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained, told Cointelegraph.

Despite the short-term investor disappointment, Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plans may prove to be a viable middle ground to start experimenting with Bitcoin as a national reserve asset.

This “softer approach” may be more viable and meet less mainstream resistance, according to Bitfinex Analysts, who added:

Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains in a significant downtrend that resulted in a descending triangle on the four-hour chart, a bearish pattern that signals a market downtrend.

To break this ongoing downtrend, Bitcoin will need to recapture the key $93,000 mark, wrote pseudonymous crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper in a March 7 X post.

Livvy Dunne is heartbroken she won’t get a proper LSU sendoff to her decorated gymnastics career.

The popular influencer and Tigers fifth-year senior revealed Thursday night she will miss her senior night on Friday against No. 10 Georgia due to a knee injury.

“Hi friends! Unfortunately I’ve been dealing with an avulsion fracture of my patella and will not be able to compete on senior night,” Dunne wrote on her Instagram Story.

“It absolutely breaks my heart to not get the opportunity to compete in the PMAC one last time. Tiger fans, you’ve been so good to me! Thank you for the endless support and as always Geaux Tigers! – Liv.”

Dunne, a New Jersey native, helped LSU win its first gymnastics national championship last season and returned this year for her final year of eligibility.

She last competed Jan. 24 against Auburn and has been limited to four events this season. Friday will mark her sixth straight absence. 

No. 2 LSU will close out its regular season next week on the road against Auburn before competing in the SEC championships and the NCAA championships.

LSU coach Jay Clark praised his senior class ahead of the meet against the Bulldogs.

“We have a variety of seniors this year and they’ve all meant so much to the trajectory of this program in ways that go far beyond gymnastics,” Clark told the team website. “I’m grateful for all of our seniors every year because they leave an unforgettable mark on our program and on me personally.”

While Dunne has dealt with this injury, she’s still kept busy away from the gym.

Vikings fans know him for orchestrating one of the greatest thefts in sports history: the trade of Herschel Walker to Minnesota.

By Jim Souhan

Jimmy Johnson this week announced his retirement from Fox Sports, where he was an NFL analyst for 31 years.

Vikings fans know him for orchestrating one of the greatest thefts in sports history: the trade of Herschel Walker to the Vikings for seven high draft picks and a handful of players.

Johnson’s departure from the public square elicited dozens of memories.

My first professional sports beat was the 1989 Dallas Cowboys. One of my first pro sports assignments was trying to find Johnson and incoming Cowboys owner Jerry Jones the night before Jones was to announce the hiring of Johnson and the firing of legendary coach Tom Landry.

How popular was Landry? Imagine Bud Grant with two Super Bowl rings, in a more populous state, with a national fan base.

Jones became an instant villain, and the large staff of the Dallas Morning News went out looking for him. Our college football writer, the great Ivan Maisel, found the two laughing it up over drinks. The resulting photo dominated the paper’s front page the next day and solidified Jones’ reputation as a franchise destroyer.

Over the next few months, the Cowboys beat writers got to know Johnson. He was a blast. 

He went out for drinks with us (sometimes drinking Heineken over ice) and proved honest, down-to-earth and funny. His assistant coaches, most of whom came with him from Miami, were happy to have tied their careers to him. He inspired loyalty.

Johnson had won a national title at Miami and in the summer of ‘89 believed he could win immediately in the NFL by throwing the ball. He chose Troy Aikman with the first pick in the draft, then used a supplemental pick on former Cretin quarterback Steve Walsh, who had played for him at Miami.

Aikman resented that move.

At halftime of the Cowboys’ first preseason game, at New Orleans, Johnson told his assistants that he had no talent to work with. He eventually decided to tank the season while building the roster.

Which is where the idea of the Herschel trade was born.

Veteran general managers like the Vikings’ Mike Lynn viewed Johnson as a hick who couldn’t function in the NFL and would be desperate to win immediately. What they got wrong: Johnson was ruthless and shrewd and had a 10-year contract.

Johnson also correctly assessed Walker as a straight-ahead, I-formation running back who was beat up, could no longer overpower defenses and didn’t fit into a modern passing offense.

So with the Cowboys winless at the trade deadline, Johnson put Walker on the market. The Browns and Vikings were interested. Johnson and Lynn agreed to a deal: Seven high draft picks and five players, with Johnson being able at the end of the season to take either the picks or the players.

Lynn believed that Walker would get him to the Super Bowl. He also thought that Johnson would be so impressed with the quality of the players — including linebacker Jesse Solomon and cornerback Ike Holt — that he would choose the players and return the draft picks.

When the deal was consummated, Johnson called Lynn and told him that he was going to keep the picks, no matter what, and that he would send Lynn a few lower-round draft picks to keep the players he liked.

The day after the deal was announced, a colleague and I were walking through the Cowboys’ facility. Johnson pulled us into a room filled with copiers and smacked his lips — a sure sign he was agitated. Most early coverage of the trade had assumed that Johnson had traded his only quality player for five non-stars, and that Johnson wouldn’t keep the picks.

Johnson told us he was keeping the picks, and the players. We were floored.

In 1990, I moved to Minnesota to cover the Vikings, and learned that Lynn had never walked down the hall at Winter Park to ask coach Jerry Burns how Walker would fit into the offense. Turns out Walker would have been a bad addition even if the Vikings had traded nothing for him.

Here’s what many might not remember about Johnson: He coached the Cowboys for only five seasons. After going 1-15 in 1989, he won Super Bowls following the 1992 and 1993 seasons.

Then Jones, jealous of Johnson’s stardom, fired him. Barry Switzer won a Super Bowl following the 1995 season with the team Johnson had built. The Cowboys have not returned to a Super Bowl since.

Ultimately, this is a tale of hubris. Lynn thought he was smarter than Johnson. Jones thought he didn’t need Johnson. Both were wrong.

Jim Souhan is a sports columnist for the Minnesota Star Tribune. He has worked at the paper since 1990, previously covering the Twins and Vikings.

Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2025

By BILL PLOTT | For the AHSAA

 

     MONTGOMERY – When Robert A. “Drew” Ferguson, 53, died last fall, it ended half a century of a life of service to countless individuals through athletic training.
    He work may have ended but his impact in the field of certified athletic training will continue to live on thanks to his amazing legacy.
    Dr. James B. Robinson, Medical Director for the AHSAA, said, “Drew’s input and leadership throughout the years has improved the healthcare and safety to athletes across Alabama. His firm belief and conviction has made a tremendous difference.”
    Ferguson is one of 12 individuals who will be inducted into the Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame on Monday, March 10 at the Montgomery Renaissance Hotel and Convention Center. He is  being inducted as a contributor. The banquet will get under way a 6 p.m.
    Feguson grew up in Georgia, attended Clarkston (GA) High School where he graduated in 1969 and the University of Georgia in 1974. He got his start as an athletic trainer with the University of Georgia, receiving a full scholarship and working with Alabama Sports Hall of Fame coach Vince Dooley.
    He came to Birmingham in 1974 to serve as athletic trainer for the Birmingham Americans and Birmingham Vulcans of the World Football League. He remained there the rest of his life.
    Ferguson worked closely with the University of Alabama-Birmingham and Coach Gene Bartow, serving as head athletic trainer for the Blazers’ basketball team. Later, he was athletic trainer for the U.S. Olympic basketball at the U.S. Olympic Training Center.  Like Dooley, Bartow was also enshrined in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.
     Ferguson said personal health issues influenced his decision to devote his life to sports medicine. As a child he developed kidney issues that limited his ability to excel in sports. Recognizing the difficulties, his father urged him to find other avenues for sports participation. That kidney condition resulted in transplants at UAB Hospital in 1990 and 2003.
     For more than 30 years he was the Birmingham City Schools certified athletic trainer. Former Samford University head athletic trainer Wayne Kendrick recalled:  “When   Drew first came to Birmingham, there were not really any athletic trainers in the area. He was really instrumental in establishing athletic trainers at some of the high schools in the city. Whatever they needed, just about, he would find some way to get it for them so they could have accessible care for each athlete.”
     Joe Davidson, former Samford associate athletic director, said: “He was one of the most selfless people I have ever been around. He would help anyone. If you ever needed something, he would work to make sure you got what you needed. and he did that consistently throughout his life. He always had the athlete in mind. He loved the human environment of sports. Coach Bartow always used a phrase, ‘Find a way to get it done,’ and Drew embodied that in every way.”
     Chris King,  chairman of the Alabama Board of Athletic Trainers, said: “Drew instilled in me that providing athletic health care to school-aged athletes is the top priority, no matter what, and I have carried that since meeting Drew. He has been the driving force for what I do for a living and inspired me in so many ways.”
     Ferguson served as athletic trainer for many notable sports events over the years, including the 2017 U.S. Senior Games, the 2017 Maccabi Games, and the 2022 World Games.
     Ron Ingram, AHSAA director of Communications, had two personal experiences with Drew Ferguson that went far beyond the honors, awards and accolades Ferguson so richly deserved.
     “I first met Drew Ferguson in 1984 at a Carver-Parker football game in Birmingham. When a Carver player came off the field breathing hard but wanting to return to the game. Drew asked the coach (Willie Peake) not to send the player back in the game. After the game, Ferguson drove the boy to the hospital where a severed spleen was diagnosed.  ‘Any other blow to the abdomen could have killed him,’ recalled Ingram. “Coach Peake called me around midnight and said, ‘Drew Ferguson saved our boy’s life. What would we do without Drew.’”
     In 2016, at the state basketball tournament, Ingram’s 38-year-old daughter was selling programs at the state basketball tournament. She had been in a severe car accident the summer before. After numerous surgeries she was still having leg problems. Ingram found her in tears from the pain in her leg. Ferguson examined her condition and told her she needed to go the emergency room immediately. In fact, he drove her there. It was sepsis, and amputation below the knee followed.
   “Drew’s expertise, friendship and kindness saved my daughter’s life,” said Ingram.
     In 1975, Ferguson and Dr. Kurt Niemann founded the Sports Medicine Institute of Alabama, now known as Children’s of Alabama Sports Medicine. He was director of the Alabama Sports Medicine Clinic for more than 30 years.
    He became a key volunteer for the AHSAA state championships including the Super 7 football championships and the Final 56 basketball championships.  He was a member of the AHSAA Medical Advisory Board for 15 years,
     As his career and reputation in athletic training progressed, he was eventually considered to be the state’s most prominent certified athletic trainer. He played a key role in getting the Alabama Athletic Trainers Licensure Act passed in 1993 and the Alabama Concussion Law in 2011. He chaired the Public Policy Committee on the Alabama Concussion Task Force from 2020-24. He was also chair of the Alabama State Bora of Athletic Trainers.
     He was president of the Coach Safely Foundation, a nonprofit organization that seeks to limit youth sports-related injuries.
     Through the support of donations from advocates of youth sports safety, he created the Robert A. Ferguson Endowed Lecture Series. The program enables medicine professionals to share knowledge with healthcare providers and the community on sports safety participation for all ages.
     He was inducted into the Alabama Athletic Trainers’ Association Hall of Fame and the UAB Sports Hall of Fame. He has also been recognized by the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

The NFL's franchise tag deadline has come and gone, which puts the focus on free agency, which officially opens at 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Deals can be made before that though as the so-called legal tampering period begins at noon ET on March 10. But plenty of action is already underway as teams are cutting veterans, re-signing stars and shopping for potential trades.

Here's everything you need to know as teams across the league continue to make moves this offseason.

Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith

Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

The Dallas Cowboys worked out a four-year, $80 million deal with defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who reportedly would have been place on the tag if a deal couldn't be reached.

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, meanwhile, seemed like a straightforward candidate for the tag, so that he and the Vikings could buy more time in trying to work out a longer-term deal. But the $40.2 million number for QBs on the tag (see below) was reportedly too high for the Vikings, and would have limited their ability to build out the rest of the roster.

Releasing Engram will save Jacksonville $5.98 million in salary cap space, according to ESPN's Michael DiRocco.

Engram, 30, was limited to nine games last season due to hamstring and shoulder injuries. He caught 47 passes (on 64 targets) for 365 yards and one touchdown. The 2024-25 campaign was his third with the Jaguars after playing his first five NFL seasons with the Giants.

Additionally, the Jaguars released cornerback Ronald Darby on Thursday. Jacksonville now has $60 million in salary cap space, according to Spotrac.

The Commanders are bringing back leading tackler Bobby Wagner on a one-year contract, according to several reports. The deal could be worth up to $9.5 million with $8 million guaranteed, reports NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Wagner, 34, led Washington with 132 tackles last season, a performance that earned him second-team All-Pro honors and his 10th Pro Bowl selection. The Commanders had the fourth-ranked defense in the NFC, allowing an average of 327.9 yards per game.

The 2024-25 season was Wagner's first with the Commanders after 11 with the Seahawks (who drafted him in the second round in 2012) and one with the Rams. He's averaged 155 tackles during his 13-year NFL career with 2.9 sacks and eight tackles for loss.

A day after reports that the Jaguars planned to release Christian Kirk, they end up striking a deal to trade him to Houston for a reported 2026 7th-round draft pick.

The Seahawks appear to be setting a high bar for what they want in return for DK Metcalf.

The 27-year-old receiver requested a trade from the team on Wednesday and according to The Athletic, the Seahawks want a first and third-round pick in return.

— Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) March 6, 2025

Will a team actually meet that asking price? You can at least understand why the Seahawks are asking for a first-round pick. In 2022, the Chiefs traded Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins for the No. 29 pick in the draft along with a second-round pick, a fourth-round pick and two 2023 picks. The Dolphins then made Hill the highest-paid receiver in the NFL at the time with a contract extension.

A week before Hill was traded, the Raiders traded a first-round pick and a second-round pick to the Packers for Davante Adams.

Like Hill, Metcalf will get a contract extension from a team that trades for him. He's in the last year of his current deal with a cap number over $30 million. That number would very likely go down for the 2025 season with an extension.

Joey Bosa's time with the Los Angeles Chargers is officially over. The team opted to release the star pass rusher on Wednesday night. He had been with them since the team selected him with the No. 3 overall pick in 2016, when they were still located in San Diego.

Bosa had 22 total tackles and five sacks last season. The move will free up more than $25 million in cap space.

Per source, Dolphins LB Bradley Chubb has agreed to a restructured contract. After signing a 5-year $110M extension in 2022, he was owed a $19.45M base salary this year and represented a $28.6 million cap hit in 2025. Now, Miami gets some breathing room before free agency opens

Joel Bitonio is coming back. The five-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl guard is returning to Cleveland for his 12th NFL season. The Browns announced Bitonio's decision.

Bitonio was unclear at the conclusion of last season if he would return in 2025.

""I really want to decompress and feel it out and give myself a chance to rest the mind and the body and see where we're at,"" Bitonio said on Jan. 5, per the Browns. ""The burden of playing in this league is tough. As an offensive lineman, you have to be fully committed. You're playing 55 to 85 snaps every game. I think I got close to almost 1,200 snaps this year on offense. And that's a big commitment.""

Bitonio, 33, has played his entire career in Cleveland and has made the Pro Bowl after each of the past seven seasons. He'll play next season on the last year of a three-year, $48 million contract.

Could the trade of Joe Thuney lead to the Chiefs adding a marquee left tackle?

According to the Athletic, Kansas City is preparing to make a run at signing Baltimore Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley when free agency opens. The Chiefs cleared $16 million in cap space earlier Wednesday when they agreed to trade Thuney to the Chicago Bears for a fourth-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.

New story. Joe Thuney did everything the Chiefs asked of him — & more.What’s next for the Chiefs?They plan to sign Trey Smith to an extension & acquire a new left tackle, targeting Ronnie Stanley.https://t.co/1cKzfqMDbu

An All-Pro guard, Thuney played left tackle for the Chiefs in the final weeks of the regular season and throughout the playoffs as the Chiefs struggled to find suitable play on the outside. The team signed former Arizona Cardinals LT D.J. Humphries late in the season, but Humphries strained a hamstring during his first game with the team and didn't start during the postseason.

Stanley, who turns 31 on March 18 and is one of the top free agents set to hit the open market, played in all 19 of the Ravens' regular season and playoff games this year and made his second Pro Bowl. It was the first time Stanley had played a full regular season in his entire career after playing seven regular-season games combined in 2020 and 2021 after he was a first-team All-Pro selection in 2019.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Target prices for 10 offensive players with expiring contracts were covered in an article earlier in the week. The focus now turns to defense. 

Things will get started on March 10 when the exclusive negotiating rights NFL teams have had with their impending free agents ends. The agents of prospective unrestricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with teams beginning at noon ET on March 10 until 4 p.m. ET on March 12. Prospective UFAs who don't have an agent can also negotiate with front office executives of teams. Players can't sign deals with new clubs until the 2025 league year and free agency officially begin at 4 p.m. ET. A player's ability to re-sign with his current club is allowed during the period. 

As a reminder, it was my responsibility while working on the agent side to create target or asking prices for the firm's clients headed toward free agency regardless of whether I was the lead agent. Along those lines, I have set target prices with total contract value, overall guarantees, amount fully guaranteed at signing and first three years compensation (when applicable) for 10 intriguing defensive players who will be unrestricted free agents.

Players don't necessarily sign for their target prices because free agency is a fluid process where adaptations must be made to changing market conditions. Some players are disappointed in free agency's outcome because their market never develops for a variety of reasons (age, unrealistic contract demands, supply and demand at a playing position, etc.).

REMEMBER THE TARGET OR ASKING PRICES FOR THESE PLAYERS MAY BE ON THE HIGH SIDE AND AREN'T NECESSARILY WHAT THEIR ACTUAL DEALS WILL BE.

Mack reduced his 2024 compensation from $23.25 million to $19 million last March to remain with the Los Angeles Chargers. The 11-year NFL veteran ranked 12th among edge rushers in Pro Football Focus' wins above replacement metric last season. He was also named to his ninth Pro Bowl. Although Mack just turned 34, his performance doesn't warrant another salary reduction. Concerns about age will likely limit Mack to a shorter-term deal.

Williams had five sacks and a career-high 40 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, quarterback hurries and quarterback hits) according to Pro Football Focus last season in a Philadelphia Eagles interior defensive line rotation with Pro Bowler Jalen Carter and 2022 first-round pick Jordan Davis. His 47.8% defensive playtime was also a career high.

The 40 pressures were four more than Williams had in the previous two seasons combined. Williams ranked fourth among NFL interior defensive linemen in PFF's pass-rush win-rate metric (17.5%). 

There are currently 14 interior defensive linemen with contracts averaging $20 million per year or more. Getting to this territory should be Williams' objective. The latest data point is the Dallas Cowboys avoiding a $25.133 million franchise tag with Osa Odighizuwa by signing him to a four-year, $80 million contract, averaging $20 million per year. The deal contains $52 million in guarantees where $39 million is fully guaranteed at signing.

Sweat took a $6 million pay cut from the three-year, $40 million contract extension, averaging $13,333,333 per year, he signed in 2021. Scheduled to make $16 million in 2024, Sweat lowered his salary to $10 million where $9.5 million was fully guaranteed with the opportunity to earn as much as $13 million total through incentives. 

Sweat led the Eagles with eight sacks last season. He made a great closing statement with 2.5 sacks and tied his season high with seven quarterback pressures, according to PFF, in Philadelphia's 40-22 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. It's surely going to take more than the three-year, $51.1 million deal, averaging $17,033,333 per year and worth a maximum of $57.1 million thanks to incentives and salary escalators, the Eagles gave edge rusher Bryce Huff last March as a free agent to keep Sweat in Philadelphia.

The Miami Dolphins are letting Holland hit the open market rather than placing an $18.601 million franchise tag on him. The 25-year-old can play in the box as well as deep. Holland isn't a ball hawk. He didn't pick off any passes in 2024 and only has five interceptions in his four NFL seasons.

David Mulugheta, Holland's agent, has his finger on the pulse of the safety market. He did a three-year, $54 million extension, averaging $18 million per year, for Budda Baker with the Arizona Cardinals. He made Antoine Winfield Jr., who was designated as a franchise player by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the NFL's highest-paid defensive back last May with a four-year, $84.1 million contract, averaging $21.025 million per year. Mulugheta also had the top safety contract in 2024 free agency. It was Xavier McKinney's four-year, $67 million deal worth up $68 million through incentives and salary escalators with the Green Bay Packers. Mulugheta will be looking to put Holland in this salary stratosphere.

There's no better time to have a career year than in a contract year. That's exactly what Murphy did in 2024. Murphy's six interceptions tied for the NFL lead among cornerbacks. He was rewarded with his first Pro Bowl berth because of his efforts. 

The top deals for cornerbacks whose contracts expired after the 2023 season went to L'Jarius Sneed and Jaylon Johnson, who were designated as franchise players, respectively, by the Chiefs and the Chicago Bears. Sneed signed a four-year, $76.4 million contract, averaging $19.1 million per year with $55 million in guarantees, in connection with his trade from the Chiefs to the Tennessee Titans. Out of the $55 million, $44 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Johnson got $76 million over four years to average $19 million per year from the Bears with $54.4 million of guarantees, which included $43.8 million fully guaranteed at signing.

Quite frankly, those deals were a little disappointing considering the average for using a franchise tag on Sneed and Johnson twice in a row would have been a little more than $21.75 million per year. It's about $1 million per year less than the two-tag average by adjusting Sneed and Johnson's contract for the 9.32% increase in the salary cap this year.

An ill-convinced 90-day holdout ended seven weeks into the 2024 season when the New York Jets, who acquired Reddick from the Eagles for a conditional 2026 third-down pick in early April, inserted $5,341,628 of performance bonuses into his contract. Reddick's late start to the season was because of his dissatisfaction with the three-year, $45 million contract (worth up to $46.5 million through incentives and salary escalators) he received from the Eagles during 2022 free agency. 

Reddick had been one of the NFL's best pass rushers in recent years prior to his holdout. He was coming off four straight seasons with double-digit sacks, including a career-high 16 in 2022. That Reddick didn't show up in 2024. The 30-year-old had one sack in the 10 games he played after ending his holdout. Reddick's path to a big payday is NFL teams giving him a mulligan for his 2024 performance.

Greenlaw didn't make his 2024 season debut until Week 15 because of a fluke injury in Super Bowl LVIII. He tore his left Achilles while running onto the field for a San Francisco 49ers defensive series early in the second quarter. 

Greenlaw looked great in his return to action. The problem was left knee soreness sidelined Greenlaw during the third quarter of his return game. A calf injury the following week landed Greenlaw on injured reserve. Greenlaw was on the field for just 34 defensive snaps last season. 

Since teams may be reluctant to make a substantial long-term commitment because of durability concerns, Greenlaw may be better off taking a one-year deal. The Achilles wasn't the only injury that caused Greenlaw to miss a significant amount of time. He was limited to three games in 2021 because of a groin injury. Bobby Wagner, who will be 35 in June, getting $9 million for one year (worth a maximum of $9.5 million through incentives) with $8 million fully guaranteed to remain with the Washington Commanders should give Greenlaw some comfort that being 28 in 2026 won't be too old to cash in.

Reid joined the Chiefs in 2022 free agency on a three-year, $31.5 million contract with $20.485 million fully guaranteed. The Chiefs seemingly planned for Reid's departure by drafting Jaden Hicks in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Hicks' playtime increased dramatically as the season progressed. 

Budda Baker's $18 million-per-year extension is surely on Reid's radar screen. That deal could be out of reach. The four-year, $58 million contract, averaging $14.5 million, Kyle Dugger signed with the Patriots last April as a transition player could have some relevance. Dugger has $32.5 million in guarantees, of which $29.75 million was fully guaranteed at signing.

Reed was arguably the Jets' most consistent cornerback in 2024 playing opposite two-time first-team All-Pro Sauce Gardner, who had a down year by his standards. The more teams that are comfortable Reed can successfully make the transition from a No. 2 cornerback to matching up with opposing top wide receivers, the better off Reed will be financially. The five-year, $88.884 million extension, averaging $17,776,800 per year with $43,268,889 of guarantees, Deommodore Lenoir received from the 49ers in November surely caught Reed's attention.

Jones bounced around in 2024. The Los Angeles Rams surprisingly dealt him and a conditional 2026 sixth-round pick to the Titans in the preseason for a 2026 fifth-round pick. Jones was on the move again during the latter part of October. The Seattle Seahawks acquired Jones from the Titans in exchange for linebacker Jerome Baker and a 2025 fourth-round pick. 

Jones made a big impact in Seattle by shoring up a porous run defense. Prior to Jones' arrival, the Seahawks ranked 29th in the NFL with 148.4 rushing yards allowed per game. It dropped to 96.2 yards per game to rank seventh over the final 10 weeks of the season with Jones in the lineup.

Jones is recovering from offseason knee surgery that Seahawks general manager John Schneider doesn't think is a big deal. Zack Braun just got the second biggest free agent off-ball linebacker contract under the 2020 NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement. He's staying with the Eagles on a three-year deal reportedly for $51 million that averages $17 million per year with $34 million in guarantees. Baun's deal won't be eclipsed in free agency. The Buffalo Bills further defined the 2025 linebacker market with Terrel Bernard's four-year extension reportedly worth $50 million for a $12.5 million average per year with $25.2 million in guarantees.

Jones, who is 25, shouldn't sign for more than three years. A three-year deal would best position Jones for the opportunity to sign a second lucrative veteran contract, which is a rarity for off-ball linebackers, in either 2027 or 2028.

Boys Basketball

Peekskill’s Boys Basketball season came to an end this past week. On Tuesday, March. 4, Peekskill faced No.1 ranked Tappan Zee in the semifinals of sectionals at Westchester County Center.

It was a tough game for the Peekskill Red Devils. After Tappan Zee secured an early lead, the Red Devils struggled to regroup. The Dutchmen took advantage, stayed strong in defense, and dominated for most of the game. The final score was Tappan Zee 45-29 Peekskill.

“They came out fast and we really couldn’t shake it and bounce back,” said Peekskill’s Jaden Chavis. 

 “Playing a disciplined team like that – there is little room for errors and we made too many,” he added. 

In this game, Tappan Zee’s Xavier Leveille led the Dutchmen in points with 13, followed by Tommy Linehan with 12. For Peekskill, Jojo Brickhouse had nine points for the Red Devils. Chavis also contributed with six. 

Tappan Zee will play Rye (No. 3) in the Class AA championship final on Saturday, March 8, at the County Center. 

While a semifinal finish may not be ideal for some Red Devil fans, Coach Tyrone Searight’s transformation of Peekskill’s basketball program cannot be overlooked. In 2021-22, Peekskill finished with a season record of 3-17. After taking over the reins in 2022, Searight turned Peekskill back into a winning team. In his second season, Searight led the Red Devils back to the County Center for the first time in over a decade. The Peekskill boys made it all the way to the regional finals, before losing to Lourdes by one point. 

This season, a lot of eyes were on the Red Devils and they put on a show almost every time they played. After experiencing some mid-season hiccups, the Red Devils finished the latter part of the season strong. On the road to the semifinals, Peekskill beat John Jay Cross River in the first round of sectionals and Poughkeepsie in the quarter-finals. The Red Devils finished the 2024-25 season with a record of 16 wins and seven losses. 

With a few successful campaigns under his leadership, Coach Searight is a big reason that Peekskill basketball fans should be excited for what the future holds. 

In a statement to the Herald, Peekskill Athletic Director Austin Goldberg said:

“We are very proud of our team and coaches. We appreciate their dedication and hard work. Thank you to the Peekskill community for their constant support throughout the season. A very grateful thank you goes to our seniors and we wish them the best of luck moving forward. Once a Red Devil, always a Red Devil.”

College Corner 

Track & Field: SUNY Plattsburgh sophomore Isaiah Ritter (Peekskill High Class of 2023) posted a personal-best long jump of 6.83 meters last week. This jump has qualified Ritter to compete in the All-Atlantic Region Track and Field Conference Indoor Track and Field Championships this weekend at Ithaca College.

Track & Field: On Feb. 22, University of Buffalo’s Juliette Salazar (Peekskill High Class of 2023) won the women’s 800-meter run with a time of 2:18.92, at the Marc Deneault Invitational at Cornell University. Salazar is currently in the pursuit of beating her personal record of 2:15.03.

News | Mar 7, 2025 

Arlene Karika-Thompson was walking away from the baseball diamond when the sound of a metal bat rang throughout the complex. 

Thinking one of the baseball teams just recorded a hit, Karika-Thompson retrieved a lawn chair from her car and hurried back. When she settled into her chair, she noticed her 10-year-old son on the bench. Moments later, he returned to the game and was hit by a runner. Visibly shaken, her son was removed. 

Not thinking anything was out of the ordinary, she drove her son home and promptly put him to bed since it was a late-night game. The next morning, things took a turn for the worse. 

“He was rubbing his eyes and then said, ‘I can’t see,'” Karika-Thompson said. 

She rushed him to the hospital, where she learned he had a skull fracture.

She soon pieced together that her son had been hit in the head with a metal bat while warming up to go into the game as a pitcher. The force of the strike had not only knocked her son unconscious, but also resulted in a traumatic brain injury, affecting his brain function.

“My son lost everything — memory, vision, taste, smell,” Karika-Thompson said. “I had three doctors tell me I was lucky that he survived the night. It was a long journey.”

With the injury taking place in 1995, there was a lack of research and resources for treating traumatic brain injuries, commonly referred to as TBIs. Additionally, there weren’t many concussion protocols for kids playing youth sports. 

Her son eventually succumbed to his traumatic brain injury in 2019, nearly 25 years after the accident. 

Karika-Thompson, who left her career as a teacher to become a re-entry specialist at the Brain Injury Association of Colorado, wonders whether her son’s outcome would have been different if the injury took place today.

“Nobody told me what had happened, and there was no protocol,” Karika-Thompson said.

A lot has changed since Karika-Thompson’s son died.

Over the past two decades, the medical community has grasped a better understanding of brain injuries, leading to expansive research on the topic. The advancement in knowledge has led the sports industry — including major sports organizations, like the NFL and NHL — to look at head injuries through a new lens. 

The NFL started to place an emphasis on brain injuries when Mike Webster became the first player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, also called CTE, a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries. A Boston University study examined the brains of 376 deceased former NFL players. Out of the nearly 400 former athletes, 345 had CTE (92%). 

The staggering statistic led the NFL to alter kickoffs in an attempt to reduce the amount of full-speed tackles. It also now issues penalties if a player lowers their helmet while tackling, a change made in 2022 to help reduce concussions. 

The NHL has made similar changes, such as implementing “Rule 48,” which prohibits direct hits to the lateral side of the head. Like the NFL, the NHL has also bolstered its concussion protocol standards by requiring mandatory evaluations when players hit their heads and the removal of players if an athlete shows symptoms of a concussion. 

Changes are trickling down to youth sports and other recreational sports to help reduce TBI incident rates. 

Vail-Summit Physical Therapy certified brain injury specialist Melissa Volkert said experts in the field of TBIs periodically release a statement on the best practices regarding concussion protocols once they reach a consensus.

“We have modeled our return-to-sport and our return-to-play guidelines on this most recent research in 2022,” Volkert said. 

One of the biggest deviations from the previous concussion protocols are the guidelines on activity. Although most of the general public believes the best way to heal from a concussion is to sleep, limit screen time and have no physical activity, current research encourages light activity within 24-48 hours of the injury.

The evening will kick off with a reception with appetizers. Then athlete and coach Stephanie Zavilla will take the stage to share her personal experience of a traumatic brain injury. The evening will wrap up with a panel discussion on the topic with local and regional experts followed by an audience Q&A.

“We are actually encouraging early return to physical activity,” Volkert said. “… Around 24-48 hours after your injury, you can do 15-20 minutes of light aerobic exercise, which this article says is about 55% of your max heart rate.”

These changes in concussion protocols have had an overall positive effect on the mental health of brain injury patients. CommonSpirit pediatric Dr. Dana Barnett said the old guidelines often did damage to the psyche of patients, especially in younger patients. 

“With the guidelines changing, it has been nicer because I think it allows somebody to feel like they are making more progress than being more isolated than they previously used to be,” Barnett said. “They can start progressing back to learning and activities of daily living and even physical activity.”

The exercise shouldn’t be taxing to the patient. Light activity allows blood to circulate through the body and jumpstart the healing process. Volkert points out that there is a fine line between light physical activity and pushing it too much.

“We do not want people to go too hard,” Volkert said. “We are not asking people to sprint right away or jog. This is like light walking.”

The process of going through the return-to-activity protocols looks different for everyone, but there is a heavy emphasis on backing off when symptoms arise both mentally and physically. 

For example, if a student is trying to complete a school assignment on the computer, but they can only go 15 minutes before getting a headache, Barnett would recommend the patient complete the assignment in chunks.

Once a brain injury patient is able to withstand regular activities and light aerobic exercise, they can begin moderate sport-specific exercises. This might look like doing walk-through drills for a football player or skating lightly for a hockey player. 

If symptoms are not triggered by the increase in stress and activity, athletes can then move to heavy, noncontact activity, such as sprinting or regular weight-lifting routines. Once athletes make their way through that checkpoint, they will be cleared by a doctor for full-contact practice. If all continues to go well, health care workers will then clear the athlete for competition. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each step in the return-to-sport guidelines typically takes a minimum of 24 hours to complete, meaning that most concussed individuals will be sidelined for at least a week. The vast majority of athletes with head injuries are sitting on the sidelines longer than in previous years. According to an analysis published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, high school and college football players in the late ’90s and early 2000s were returning to play just three days, on average, after getting a concussion. 

Health care workers are especially worried about adolescent patients getting multiple concussions. With the brains of school-age children still actively developing well into early adulthood, a history of concussion poses the risk of long-term cognitive damage.

It is because of the development of children’s brains that more stringent return-to-activity guidelines have been introduced over the past decade.

“That’s why you end up with these crazy, strict protocols because they are kids and are not really looking out for themselves,” Middle Park Health trauma medical director and ER Dr. Michelle Lupica said. “And that’s normal.”

With so many student athletes often being driven and wanting to return to a full workload as soon as possible, Barnett tries to highlight the importance of taking it slow to her patients.

“The biggest one is probably second impact syndrome, where the brain is literally just not healed and then you go and injure it again,” Barnett said. “This can lead to severe or fatal neurologic outcomes. That is going to be the biggest one.”

Growing up in the early 2000s, it was common for Salomon-sponsored skier Drew Petersen to see some of his favorite snowsports athletes without a helmet as they flew off a cliff or performed a rail slide in the streets.

Whether out for a day on the slopes or in a video uploaded to YouTube, it is common to see athletes of all ages not sporting a helmet while attempting a jaw-dropping trick. While the stigma around wearing a helmet has changed in the past 10 years or so, Petersen attests there is still plenty of work to be done.

“It really doesn’t look that cool to not wear a helmet,” Petersen said. “Helmets look cool now. … I pretty adamantly believe and profess — and I think it’s the ground swell opinion — that wearing a helmet is cool.”

According to a 2012 study of national bicycle helmet use, 42% of children ages 5-17 always wore a helmet. Helmet use saw a decrease among lower-income households, non-White populations, Hispanic populations and children 10-14 years of age. Adult helmet use was also associated with an increase in child helmet use. 

A 2022 study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics reports that the most often cited reasons for not wearing a helmet include cost, discomfort and lack of belief that it is necessary to prevent an injury.

In terms of the effectiveness of helmets, five studies from different countries concluded that wearing a helmet decreased the risk of head, brain and severe injury by 63% to 85% for all ages of bicyclists. 

Petersen credits the helmet he was wearing for saving his life in both of his skiing accidents. Although the helmet failed to prevent a traumatic brain injury, Petersen does not think he would be alive today if he did not have a helmet strapped to his head.  

It is because of his accidents, and others he has witnessed in the snowsports industry, that Petersen is an outspoken advocate for helmet use. 

“I think when I was younger, I didn’t realize the influence or significance that I could have on what kids think is cool,” Petersen said. “Now I do, and I am going to use that for good and for trying to help others stay safe.”

Stephanie Zavilla, the director of sports performance at the Winter Park Competition Center, has seen a steady trend of adolescent athletes growing more serious about brain safety and wearing a helmet. 

“I think for the most part kids understand,” Zavilla said. “Of course there is going to be disappointment if they are going to have to be pulled from a competition or they do not get to train. By and large, when we explain the ‘why,’ athletes are pretty on board.” 

U.S. Ski and Snowboard and the USA Snowboard and Freeski Association have seen an advancement in helmet rules over the past decade. 

“They have taken it really seriously and made sure that helmets have to have certain specs,” Zavilla said. “I have been to a lot of competitions where they make sure the helmet is the one they recommended with the FIS label. We also did a whole education seminar with our coaches this year that highlighted the benefit of MIPS technology.”

Multidirectional Impact Protection System, or MIPS for short, is a design used by many companies to enhance the safety of helmets by reducing the risk of rotational impacts. While many of the helmets on the market today utilize the protection system, there are still helmets that continue to lack the technology.

With young athletes taking influence from a wide range of people, Petersen implores every community member to do their part in setting the standard of wearing a helmet.

“Culturally, we have to all realize that we are role models to those kids,” Petersen said. “It doesn’t have to be a professional skier. Like the guy who is ripping under the chair at A-Basin every day, kids look up to him as well as the cool people in the lift line. Those people should be wearing helmets, as well.”

Although there were very few concussion protocols in place when her son was playing baseball, Karika-Thompson is encouraged to see how far the science and research has advanced.

She credits these improvements to medical professionals and to the general public for gaining a more robust understanding of TBIs. 

With a better understanding of how each brain injury can have different effects, health care providers now have the expertise and knowledge to provide a proper treatment plan that is based on the individual’s history. 

According to professor and author David K. Menon at the University of Cambridge, large international collaborations have led to an improvement of understanding and care of traumatic brain injuries over the past decade. Menon recognizes that significant problems around brain injuries still remain and calls for more collaboration in order to improve patient outcomes.

Karika-Thompson also feels like health care workers now have a firm grasp of the domino effect traumatic brain injuries can have on an individual. 

“If you have an initial injury, you are three times greater to have a second injury,” Karika-Thompson said. “If you have a second injury, you are eight times greater to have a third injury. I can tell you from experience, those injuries can be as simple as bumping your head on a cupboard or getting whiplash.”

Above all, Karika-Thompson is grateful to see the drastic improvement in concussion protocols. Not only are the newest guidelines keeping people safe, but they are keeping kids like her son from being put back into a game after a significant head injury.

“It was terribly, terribly mishandled,” Karika-Thompson said. “But today, it is much better. He is why I do what I do. I want to serve people who have brain injuries and let them know they are not alone.”

Stephen A. Smith has become a fixture on ESPN’s airwaves, and that won’t be changing anytime soon.

Smith, a former newspaper beat reporter who rose to fame by pioneering the art of the sports debate show, has agreed with ESPN on a new five-year, $100 million contract, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC. 

The deal was first reported by The Athletic. 

“I’m happy and honored to remain a member of the Disney/ESPN family for, at least, the next five years,” Smith said in a statement on Friday. 

As one of the network’s most well-known and most-used on-air talents, Smith has wide-reaching influence and leeway to opine on a variety of topics including the NBA, as part of ESPN’s pregame show.

“Stephen A. works incredibly hard to elevate the sports conversation day-in and day-out and we are grateful he will remain at ESPN,” said Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN Chairman. “He is a difference maker, and fans are captivated by his deep sports knowledge, strong opinions and unmistakable flair.”

Smith will continue to appear on “First Take,” the morning debate show, but according to The Athletic, will no longer be a figurehead of the NBA pregame show next season, and will be allowed to scale back other ESPN appearances, too. 

Smith addressed his broader ambitions and discussed his new contract publicly for the first time while appearing Friday on ""First Take.""

ESPN said in a statement that Smith will appear on other programs in addition to ""First Take"" but did not go into details.

That could mean more opportunities for Smith to appear on shows not on ESPN and to discuss topics away from sports even more frequently. In recent years, Smith has regularly expanded his scope to politics on his own show, and even appeared on Fox News. He has been floated as a possible presidential candidate in 2028.

He downplayed the suggestion on NBC’s “The Tonight Show” on Wednesday.

“I’m saying, wait a minute now, I don’t want to do this,” Smith told host Jimmy Fallon. “But the fact that they’re talking about me this way, I must say, I approve this message.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom breaks with party on transgender athletes in women's sports, sparking backlash",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/california-gov-gavin-newsom-breaks-party-transgender-athletes/story?id=119559011,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 18:36:24 GMT","

The Human Rights Campaign accused Newsom of trying to ""score political points.""

In this first episode of a new podcast published Thursday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, an LGBTQ ally, broke with his party, saying that transgender athletes playing in female sports is ""deeply unfair.""

""I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,"" Newsom said on his podcast, ""This is Gavin Newsom.""

Newsom's comments came during a conversation with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who leads conservative group Turning Point USA and played a critical role in garnering youth support for President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

Newsom, sometimes viewed as a 2028 presidential hopeful, also agreed that the political ad that hurt former Vice President Kamala Harris the most in her presidential campaign was her previous support for providing taxpayer-funded gender transition-related medical care for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. Trump's campaign had played back her remarks in a widely-circulated ad.

""She didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating,"" Newsom said.

Newsom also pointed to his own work in expanding LGBTQ rights, while referencing current law in the state of California that allows transgender athletes to participate in school sports that reflect the gender they identify with.

Newsom himself was a trailblazer in expanding LGBTQ rights: in 2004, as mayor of San Francisco, he allowed same-sex marriages to proceed even though they were not yet allowed nationwide.

He referenced that moment while discussing his alignment with Kirk's views on transgender athletes in women's sports.

""I've been a leader in the LGBTQ places, as, you know, back in 2004 [I] was marrying same sex couples. And I know we have [a] difference [of] opinion on marriage equality, and so I've been at this for years and years, I take a backseat to no one,"" Newsom said, before discussing how he heard people talking about transgender athletes.

On the podcast, Newsom also called for compassion toward transgender individuals, even while discussing the sports issue: ""There's also humility and grace. You know, that, these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression, and the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well.""

LGBTQ rights groups criticized Newsom's remarks, saying that they came amid national backlash to transgender individuals and their rights.

The Human Rights Campaign, a major national LGBTQ rights advocacy and lobbying group, said in a statement shared on social media that with discussions nationwide in legislatures about restricting same-sex marriage or transgender rights, ""this is not a moment to sit politely in the face of authoritarian bullies or throw people under the bus for political posturing.""

""Singling out trans kids to score political points is never going to help someone pay their rent, keep Medicaid or get a job, but it will make it seem like Gov. Newsom believes our civil rights are up for grabs,"" the organization wrote. ""Californians - and ALL Americans - need leaders who have courage in their convictions, and who will show up for them, in the faces of people who want to see us all back in the closet.""

The organization also pointed to a 2013 law in California that allowed students to be part of sport teams matching their own gender identity. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the law in 2013 as ""ensuring transgender youth have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in schools across the state.""

Newsom briefly referenced the law in his discussion with Kirk, highlighting that it was passed before he became governor.

Two members of the California state legislature, Assemblymember Chris Ward and state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, released a statement through the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus criticizing Newsom's remarks as well, saying they were ""profoundly sickened and frustrated"" by what he said.

""Sometimes Gavin Newsom goes for the Profile in Courage, sometimes not,"" they wrote. ""We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks. All students deserve the academic and health benefits of sports activity, and until Donald Trump began obsessing about it, playing on a team consistent with one's gender has not been a problem since the standard was passed in 2013.""

Newsom's remarks came just a month after Trump signed an executive order intending on banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. The White House has said the action is meant to protect women in sports from harm and from facing opponents who they say have an unfair advantage.

LGBTQ advocacy groups have criticized the administration's action and general rhetoric as discriminatory and as having razor-sharp focus on issues of transgender rights to the exclusion of economic and other issues.

🏒 Deadline day: The NHL trade deadline is today at 3pm ET, but teams haven't waited around to make their moves, with 13 trades in the past three days alone.

⚽️ 64-team World Cup? FIFA will consider expanding the World Cup to 64 teams in 2030 to celebrate the tournament's centennial. The field is already expanding from 32 to 48 teams for 2026.

🏈 NFL moves: The Jaguars are trading WR Christian Kirk to the Texans and the Bengals have given All-Pro DE Trey Hendrickson permission to seek a trade.

🥊 Trilogy booked: After two epic bouts in 2022 and 2024, Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano will meet for a third time this July at MSG (and on Netflix) in a battle for Taylor's undisputed super lightweight championship.

🏈 Lanning extended: Oregon is giving head coach Dan Lanning a new six-year contract that will pay him nearly $11 million per season, making him the nation's fourth-highest paid college football coach.

In any given NBA season, we're lucky if we get to watch one historically great team play basketball multiple days a week. This year, we get to watch two.

By the numbers: The Thunder (+12.73) and Cavaliers (+11.53) are on pace for the best and sixth-best scoring differentials in NBA history. The top five on that list all won a championship that season.

Cleveland (52-10), which already clinched a postseason spot, is on pace for 69 wins, tied for the third-most ever. They're also in the midst of their third 12-game win streak, something only one other team has ever done (2006-07 Mavs).

Oklahoma City (51-11), which should clinch a playoff spot any day now, is on pace for 67 wins, tied for the seventh-most in league history. They've won five straight and 14 of 16 to take a commanding 10.5-game lead atop the West.

What makes them so good? It's pretty simple, really: The Cavs have an all-time great offense and the Thunder have a generationally elite defense.

Cleveland's offensive rating (122.9 points per 100 possessions) ranks second all-time behind only last year's title-winning Celtics. They're particularly lethal from behind the arc, shooting a league-best 39.3%.

OKC's defensive rating (105.9) is the NBA's best in the last five years, and by far the best this season, with a larger lead over the second-place Magic (109.4) than the Magic have over the 13th-place Lakers (112.5).

And let's not forget about their stars: While both teams boast impressive depth, OKC is led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the league's leading scorer and the favorite to win MVP. Cleveland's alpha isn't quite the same level (few are), but Donovan Mitchell is still the NBA's 15th-leading scorer and Evan Mobley is the favorite to win DPOY.

Looking ahead: The Celtics are for real, so we can't forget about the reigning champs. But given how the Cavs and Thunder have dominated the regular season, it would surprise no one if they were the last two teams standing in June. But history says that's unlikely: Only three* of the 25 NBA Finals this century featured both No. 1 seeds.

*Lakers over Pacers (2000), Celtics over Lakers (2008), Cavaliers over Warriors (2016).

Some of the biggest brains in sports are in Boston this weekend for the 19th edition of the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference (aka. Dorkapalooza*).

Analytics, then vs. now: When SSAC began, ""analytics"" was still a relatively new concept that had the potential to upend sports. All these years later, the data-driven revolution has upended sports, and this weekend's discussions will reflect that.

At the 2010 event, Mark Cuban talked about a groundbreaking metric called ""Plus/Minus,"" which is now something even casual fans understand and look for in box scores. In 2012, new Astros GM Jeff Luhnow laid out his plan to build an ""analytical database"" in Houston.

By 2013, every NBA team except the Lakers had a representative at the conference. By 2015, analytics had officially gone mainstream. ""The war is over, and the nerds have won,"" wrote The Guardian's Robert Silverman in a dispatch from Boston.

This year's agenda builds on analytics' ever-expanding applications, from soccer tactics to football scouting to franchise-building. But it also includes a panel that sounds like it might push back a bit: ""Have the Nerds Ruined Basketball?""

The present moment: The Washington Post published a series of stories this week about the current state of analytics, perhaps with SSAC in mind. The main takeaway, for me at least, is that the tone of the conversation is shifting. To be clear: analytics is here to stay (read: ""How the Red Sox built MLB's best prospect duo""). But we're starting to see the cost of this mindset, and the endless quest for efficiency is increasingly being blamed for robbing sports of their beauty.

From the Post's Dave Sheinin:

The analytics movement arguably has transformed the major sports landscape like no development since the dawn of televised games, changing the way coaches coach, players play, front offices evaluate talent and fans consume.

But what has occurred over the past half-decade in MLB and the NBA suggests that dynamic, if allowed to proceed unchecked for decades, can hasten the strategy optimization process, essentially ""solving"" games and causing a deleterious effect on a sport's aesthetic appeal.

It is a revelation that carries ominous ramifications for leagues such as the NFL and the NHL, where analytics arrived later and have taken longer to shape organizational philosophies.

Dive in:

Analytics transformed sports. Has it also made them less entertaining?

The NBA is facing an analytics-fueled crisis. MLB can relate.

From NFL to chess, an existential question: Can all games be solved?

*Flashback Friday: Remember when Bill Simmons used to write for ESPN.com? Here's his recap of the 2009 Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which he dubbed Dorkapalooza 2009. Long live, ""The Sports Guy"" and the mid-2000s era of the internet. Simpler times, man. Simpler times.

Stephen A. Smith has signed a five-year deal with ESPN worth at least $100 million, per The Athletic's Andrew Marchand.

By the numbers: Smith's previous deal paid him $12 million annually. He will now earn $20 million per year, making him the third-highest paid sports broadcaster.

The College Football Playoff Selection Committee will have a new chairman for 2025, as well as six new members.

The new boss: Baylor AD Mack Rhoades, who joined the 13-member committee last year, is replacing Michigan AD Warde Manuel as committee chair. He has led Baylor's athletic department since 2016 following previous stints at Missouri, Houston and Akron.

The new members: Committee members are given three-year terms. Five expired this spring, and a sixth member decided to step down after one year.

Mark Dantonio: The former Michigan State head coach (2007-19) led the Spartans to three Big Ten championships, the 2015 playoff and 114 wins, making him the winningest coach in program history. He was rewarded last year with induction into the College Football HOF.

Damon Evans: The former Georgia WR (1990-92) and AD (2004-10) has been Maryland's AD since 2018. He was also named to the NCAA Transformation Committee in 2021, charged with addressing Division I's biggest challenges in college sports' rapidly evolving landscape.

Ivan Maisel: The longtime sportswriter began his career in 1981 and was hired as ESPN.com's first college football writer back in 2002. The Football Writers Association of America presented him with the Bert McGrane Award in 2016, essentially their Hall of Fame.

Chris Massaro: The Colorado native has been Middle Tennessee's AD since 2005, making him the fifth-longest tenured AD in the FBS. He's also served on numerous other committees, including the NCAA Football Issues Committee and NCAA Division I Leadership Council.

Wesley Walls: The former tight end had quite a career, both in college and the pros: The All-American at Ole Miss (1985-88) and College Football Hall of Famer (2014) was also a 14-year NFL vet (1989-2003), five-time Pro Bowler and 1990 Super Bowl champion with the 49ers.

Steve Wieberg: The former USA Today reporter is actually a returning member after serving on the inaugural CFP committee. Like Maisel, he also received the FWAA's Bert McGrane Award, and he was also inducted into the United States Basketball Writers Association HOF.

Returning members: Carla Williams (Virginia AD), Hunter Yuracheck (Arkansas AD), David Sayler (Miami-Ohio AD), Randall McDaniel (NFL Hall of Famer), Chris Ault (former Nevada head coach and AD) and Mike Riley (former Oregon State head coach).

The final weekend of the men's college basketball regular season is upon us, as teams barrel towards their conference tournaments, which are already underway on the women's side.

The headliner: No. 7 Alabama visits No. 1 Auburn (Sat. 2:30pm ET, ESPN) in a battle of potential No. 1 seeds in the NCAA tournament. The Tigers are a virtual lock, while the Tide could earn one by beating their rivals tomorrow night.

Other notable games: No. 6 St. John's at No. 20 Marquette (Sat. 12pm, Fox); No. 19 Kentucky at No. 15 Missouri (Sat. 12pm, ESPN); No. 2 Duke at UNC (Sat. 6:30pm, ESPN); No. 17 Michigan at No. 8 Michigan State (12pm, CBS).

The Washington Commanders have released two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Jonathan Allen

Washington Commanders Release Defensive Tackle Jonathan Allen

Jonathan Allen was released by the Washington Commanders on Friday, ending the standout defensive tackle's time with the team that drafted him after eight seasons.

The move, which was not a surprise, comes less than two weeks since they gave Allen’s camp permission to talk to other teams around the NFL about a potential trade. There was no guaranteed money owed to the 30-year-old veteran going into the final season of his contract, which made him a candidate to be released to save the Commanders roughly $20 million against the salary cap.

Drafted in the first round out of Alabama in 2017, Allen was the second-longest-tenured player in the organization after punter Tress Way.

Allen missed half of last season after tearing a pectoral muscle but returned for Washington’s final four games, including the playoffs. The Commanders reached the NFC title game before losing to eventual Super Bowl-champion Philadelphia.

Since debuting eight years ago, Allen has appeared in 108 games for Washington, making 401 tackles and recording 42 sacks. That sack total ranks fifth in franchise history since it became an official stat in 1982.

Washington released Allen a day after agreeing to re-sign six-time All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner to a one-year contract for 2025. Kicker Zane Gonzalez is also being brought back for the league minimum $1.17 million.

Rochdale have agreed a one-year contract extension with Tobi Adebayo-Rowling until the end of next season.

Wing-back Adebayo-Rawling, 28, joined Dale last summer from Notts County and has played 33 games for them, scoring once.

Yeovil Town have signed defenders Frankie Terry and Marcel Lavernier on deals until the end of the season.

Terry, 21, arrives on loan from Colchester United and is the nephew of former England internationals John Terry and Paul Konchesky.

He made his first League Two start for the Essex club in January after spending time on loan at Braintree Town.

Lavernier, 24, joins as a free agent having left Forest Green Rovers after more than 18 months where he played 25 games.

Aldershot have signed defender Tariq Uwakwe on loan from Swindon Town until the end of the season.

The 25-year-old, who came through the youth academy at Chelsea, moved to Swindon in 2023 from Crewe Alexandra, for whom he made 48 appearances.

Yeovil Town have signed winger Ryan McLean on loan from AFC Wimbledon until the end of the season.

The 24-year-old has not played since April 2024 when he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury and AFC Wimbledon's director of football Craig Cope said the loan was to help him ""get back up to speed in a competitive setting"".

Solihull Moors have signed Dutch forward Manny Duku on a short-term deal after his spell with Hednesford Town ended last month.

The 32-year-old has scored 19 goals this season and was signed in time for Solihull's home game against Sutton United.

Solihull Moors have signed Notts County defender Robbie Cundy on loan for the rest of the season.

Cundy, who arrives on an initial one-month loan subject to EFL and FA approval, could make his debut at home to Sutton United on Tuesday night.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Fantasy Baseball: Should you draft or pass on MLB's most polarizing starting pitchers?,https://sports.yahoo.com/fantasy/article/fantasy-baseball-should-you-draft-or-pass-on-mlbs-most-polarizing-starting-pitchers-182236671.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 19:06:08 GMT","

We like to say that fantasy sports are ultimately games of opinion. And sometimes those opinions are wide-ranging.

Welcome to the polarizing player series. Today we hit the pitchers, all starters. Next week, we'll tackle the hitters.

No one disputes the talent on these guys, it's just a matter of if you want to spend your first or second round pick on a pitcher. We also have to acknowledge that Skenes is still just 22, with just 23 MLB starts under his belt. How might he handle a full season of workload? We can only project.

My Call: Because the pitching pool looks fairly deep after Skubal and Skenes, I'm going to dip into the second and third tiers, not wanting to fall behind on my offensive building. But it's not going to be fun watching these two guys dominate for other people's teams.

When he's healthy, deGrom is the best pitcher of the era. He's banked a pair of Cy Young awards, and his 2021 mini-season (15 starts, 1.08 ERA, 0.554 WHIP) belongs in a time capsule. Of course, deGrom has made just 20 starts in the past three seasons, he's had a second Tommy John surgery and he's entering his age-37 season.

My Call: Longtime friend Gene McCaffrey suggests this idea: get some of the deGrom but not all of the deGrom. That covers any possible FOMO, but also protects you if deGrom breaks again. My co-manager and I hold an inexpensive keeper option on deGrom in one league, so that probably covers my investment for this spring. The lofty ADP (51.4) feels like wishcasting. That said, there is no player I'd rather be wrong about — as a pure fan, 30 deGrom starts would be delightful, appointment television. But I'm not going to assemble my rosters on a wish, either.

He misses plenty of bats and the ERA estimators outline just how unlucky Pfaadt was last year. That said, he's also had homer problems in his brief career, and he's not even guaranteed a starting spot in the rotation to open the year.

My Call: I thought Pfaadt would be on my upside/breakout list when we entered the teeth of draft season, but as he's become somewhat trendy in the industry (and thus, more expensive in drafts), I've found myself backing off somewhat. There are other potential breakout arms who probably will cost less at the table.

He's looked almost too good to be true thus far, with a deep arsenal of pitches and one dominant spring start under his belt. And he's merely entering his age-23 season; it's scary to think that Sasaki is still on the escalator. Obviously, he's supported by the deepest roster in baseball.

My Call: The ADP keeps rising on Sasaki as his early unveiling to America has been exciting. And I've spent a few weeks talking about my growing concern that the Dodgers will employ a sensitive load-management strategy for six months, given the near-certainty that they'll be in the playoffs again. That said, I might have to force one Sasaki share onto a roster of mine, lest I be locked out of this spectacle all year.

After a dominant 2023 season, Strider had a washout 2024 — his elbow started hurting in April and soon UCL damage was discovered. Ultimately he had surgery on the elbow — UCL surgery, not Tommy John surgery — and missed the rest of the year.

My Call: The hope is that Strider will be able to pitch for Atlanta early in the 2025 season, perhaps as soon as May. Injury optimism is not my favorite game with pitchers, so I'll probably ignore Strider unless his ADP falls outside pick 200 (it won't). I don't like to draft into injuries, they're going to find you anyway.

Once upon a time Berríos was a touted prospect, but he's settled into the good-not-great file for most of his career. His ERA has been in the mid-3s for four of the last five seasons, and his career WHIP of 1.231 is acceptable but not a needle-mover.

My Call: I'm willing to give Berríos some credit for his durability — in his last six non-pandemic seasons, he's made 32 starts every year. The Blue Jays acquired defensive whiz Andrés Giménez and Toronto's park is run-neutral over the last three seasons. It's too late in the game to consider Berríos a future Cy Young winner, but his boring consistency is welcome for the middle of my pitching staffs. Not every pick has to be a hair-on-fire choice; sometimes a floor pick is the right move, especially when he's going after pick 200.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

After retiring from competition himself, snowboarder Shaun White founded The Snow League, the first professional league dedicated to snowboarding and freeskiing. This week, the league will officially kick off at Aspen Snowmass in Colorado with the first of four international events featuring some of the world's most elite snowboarders.

Just two weeks ago, the Washington Commanders granted star defensive lineman Jonathan Allen permission to seek a trade. The two-time Pro Bowler apparently didn't find the kind of interest he and Washington were hoping for, as the Commanders will be releasing Allen ahead of free agency.

Allen was set to enter the final year of a four-year, $72 million contract he signed in 2021. His $15.5 million base salary for the 2025 season was not guaranteed. ESPN reports that a handful of teams expressed interest in Allen, but felt as though he would eventually be released. This move saves Washington $16.3 million in cap space. 

 In 2024, Allen recorded two sacks through six games before suffering what was believed to be a torn pectoral in a loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Allen rehabbed vigorously, and returned for Washington's overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons in Week 17, and started in all three of the Commanders' playoff games.

Allen's 42 career sacks rank 10th all time in Washington franchise history. The No. 17 overall pick out of Alabama was elected into the Northern Virginia Football Hall of Fame in 2019, as he attended Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn, Virginia. The local legend was a leader for the Commanders over his eight seasons while the franchise underwent as many team name changes as postseason appearances. Now, he will be free to choose his next NFL team. 

Let's examine a few landing spots for Allen:

The Bengals have major needs on the defensive side of the ball -- especially when it comes to the defensive line. Not only has Cincinnati granted Trey Hendrickson permission to seek a trade, but they have also released defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins, Sam Hubbard surprisingly announced his retirement and then B.J. Hill, Joseph Ossai, Jay Tufele and Cameron Sample are free agents looking for new deals. If the Bengals are looking for difference-makers on defense that won't cost an arm and a leg, Allen should be an option.

Maybe we could list every NFC North team as a potential landing spot for Allen, but the Bears could use a bonafide starter on the defensive interior. Plus, Ryan Poles has already been aggressive this offseason in attempting to shore up the trenches by trading for offensive guards Jonah Jackson and Joe Thuney. Now, it's time to add a veteran on the defensive side of the ball. Allen and Montez Sweat played together in Washington. Maybe a reunion is in the works. 

The 49ers are expected to undergo a major facelift on the defensive side of the ball with Robert Saleh back in the saddle. Maybe Joey Bosa is on the way to play with his brother, Nick Bosa, but Allen would be a nice Javon Hargrave replacement on the interior as well. The 49ers defense ranked No. 18 in rushing yards allowed per game (124.6) last season, which was their worst mark since 2017.

The Las Vegas Raiders are once again in the market for a starting quarterback, but will they draft one in the first round, or sign a big-name veteran? New head coach Pete Carroll has made it clear that he wants to compete now. He wasn't hired for a rebuild. So, how will this affect the Raiders' strategy when it comes to the most important position in football?

The Raiders hold the No. 6 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, and they could use that selection coupled with future draft capital to move up for someone like Miami's Cam Ward, or use that first selection to draft Shedeur Sanders out of Colorado. However, this quarterback class isn't viewed as exceptional -- especially compared to last year's group. 

After missing out on Matthew Stafford, The Athletic reported that the Raiders are exploring veteran quarterback options on the free agent and trade market. Yes, that apparently includes the possibility of trading for a current starting quarterback. We know Sam Darnold, Russell Wilson Aaron Rodgers and potentially Kirk Cousins could be options for the Raiders depending on the market, but which current starting quarterbacks could The Athletic be referring to? Let's take a look at two potential options:

The Arizona Cardinals have done nothing to indicate they are looking to move Kyler Murray, but anything is possible in today's NFL. The former No. 1 overall pick threw for 3,851 yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while also rushing for 572 yards and five touchdowns in 2024. He's just the fourth quarterback to ever record three seasons of 3,500 passing yards and 500 rushing yards, and the first to record 200 passing yards per game and 30 rushing yards per game over six straight seasons.

Apart from the Cardinals' level of desire to part ways with their franchise quarterback, the other issue would be what Arizona would want in return. If you were general manager John Spytek or Tom Brady, would you give up your No. 6 overall pick for Murray? Probably not.

Let's just get the Seahawks band back together under coach Carroll. Seattle has put itself in a weird situation over the last week. The Seahawks released Tyler Lockett, Rayshawn Jenkins, George Fant, Dre'Mont Jones and Roy Robertson-Harris, plus DK Metcalf is looking for a change of scenery. Seattle also has a new offensive coordinator and a quarterback entering the final year of his deal, so Geno Smith absolutely could be available for the right price. 

Smith set career highs in completion percentage (70.4%), passing yards (4,320) and wins (10) last season, but also finished 21st among qualified quarterbacks in EPA/play (-0.04), and threw 15 interceptions, which was one off from the league high.

SHEPHERDSTOWN — It’s been a season to remember with a smile and satisfied memories for the Shepherd University men’s basketball team.

Not only did this Rams’ edition have one of the best records in the 16 years Justin Namolik has been the head coach, but they just hosted a conference tournament game at home on Monday in the Butcher Center.

The regular season closed with an important road win at Millersville University, giving Shepherd third place in the PSAC’s East Division and a first-round tournament game versus Shippensburg University. Should the Rams, who carried an 18-10 overall record into Monday’s tournament opener against the struggling Red Raiders, have won that game they then traveled to face East Stroudsburg on Wednesday in the quarterfinals. A win over the Warriors would have sent Shepherd into the semifinals tomorrow, again on the road at the home of the higher seeded team.

Shepherd’s eye-opening victory at Millersville closed the league’s regular season and finalized the Division standings. West Chester University finished atop the nine-team standings with East Stroudsburg University in second. Shepherd was third and Millersville (17-11 overall) was fourth. Lock Haven University and Shippensburg University were the other two tournament qualifiers from the East. That means Bloomsburg, Mansfield and Kutztown were the only three schools from the East not to qualify for the 12-team tournament.

In its win at Millersville, the Rams used seven players and four of them played at least 30 minutes each.

Chase Paar

Marcus Banks scored 19 points in 36 minutes, Jarod Robinson had 17 points in 36 minutes, Chase Paar totaled 16 points in 35 minutes and Brody Davis finished with five points in his 30 minutes of playing time. Carson Poffenberger, Cole Paar and Elwyne Wordlaw were the other three players used by Coach Namolik.

Shepherd held a 46-37 lead at the half — one of the Rams’ highest scoring halves of the entire season.

Namolik’s other highwater seasons were the 2013-2014 campaign, where Shepherd was 20-10, and 2016-2017, when its record was 19-11.

If the Rams did indeed defeat visiting Shippensburg, a team they defeated twice during the regular season, then Wednesday’s tournament quarterfinal gave them a chance to tie Namolik’s all-time season high in victories.

Gannon and Slippery Rock were the two top-seeded teams in the tournament from the West Division. Both those teams had first-round byes and went directly into the quarterfinals — the same as West Chester and East Stroudsburg did from the East Division.

Banks

The winner and survivor of the PSAC Tournament earns a berth in the upcoming NCAA Division II National Tournament. Any of the other conference teams with worthy records are eligible for at-large bids to that same tournament.

Last season was a good one for finding edge rushers in free agency.

Not all of the additions worked out — Bryce Huff got $51 million over three years from the Philadelphia Eagles and ended up being one of general manager Howie Roseman's rare big whiffs — but there were some difference makers in the class.

This year's class of edge defenders has contributors but it's probably light on true difference makers. Still, those players will get paid because it has become a premium position in the NFL.

Here are the top five edge rushers in free agency:

Sweat almost won Super Bowl MVP. He had 2.5 sacks against the Chiefs and was one of the best players on the field. It wasn't a fluke either. Sweat has 33 sacks over the past four seasons. He'll be 28 years old next season. He also made a Pro Bowl in 2021. He's going to get a huge contract.

If Koonce was a free agent a year ago, he'd have been an easy player to invest in. But he suffered a torn ACL in practice just before the 2024 season opener, which complicates things. Still, he'll be just 27 next season and posted eight sacks in 2023. Some team will take the chance.

Mack considered retirement before playing again and will get at least one more nice payday. He is 34 but still productive, having made his ninth Pro Bowl last season. His sack total went from 17 in 2023 to six last season, but he's still a good player who will likely land in the Hall of Fame when he's done.

From 2020-23 only two players posted double-digit sacks each season: Reddick and Myles Garrett. That might be forgotten with all the drama in 2024, which included a trade to the Jets, a holdout that lasted into the season and just one sack. Reddick will turn 31 years old in September but should still have something left to offer.

Bosa is one of the bigger names on the list, but his age (turns 30 in July) and injury history can't be ignored. A variety of injuries have limited him to 28 games and 14 sacks the past three seasons. Still, he's a valuable player if he can stay healthy.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"
https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,NFL free-agent rankings: Top 5 safeties includes Dolphins' Jevon Holland,https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/article/nfl-free-agent-rankings-top-5-safeties-includes-dolphins-jevon-holland-125951410.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 12:59:51 GMT","

Xavier McKinney got by far the most money among all free-agent safeties last offseason. His deal with the Green Bay Packers was worth a total of $67 million; no other safety switching teams got more than $27 million.

McKinney showed he was worth the investment. McKinney had eight interceptions and was named a first-team All-Pro. He showed that the right safety can help transform a defense.

There might not be a player on McKinney's level in this year's safety class, but there are a few players available on the back end who can help a defense in need. Here are the top five safeties in free agency:

The Dolphins haven't managed the salary cap very well, which is why they might lose another high-priced free agent. Holland was a good safety for the Dolphins and is just 25 years old heading into next season. He isn't coming off his best season, but still has plenty of prime years left.

In three of Moehrig's four seasons with the Raiders he played all 17 games. That durability is an asset. Moehrig is a better player in run support than in coverage, but that could have significant value to certain teams.

Reid is smart, productive and durable. He is still just 28 years old. He has been a big part of the Chiefs' defense the past few years, and he would be a good veteran influence on just about any defense.

Chinn is practically an extra linebacker in the defense. He is excellent near the line of scrimmage, having posted 100 tackles in three of his five NFL seasons. He seemed to wear out his welcome with the Panthers but his one season in Washington restored his value.

Bynum started every game each of the past three seasons, and he does everything pretty well. He had 137 tackles two seasons ago and a career best three interceptions last season. He'll be 27 next season.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Does New Jersey need to limit the number of gambling ads residents are exposed to?

The answer, according to a majority of voters in the state interviewed in a recent poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University, is yes.

Ads have become seemingly ubiquitous since a 2018 landmark U.S Supreme Court decision struck down a near-nationwide ban on sports betting. 

You might see a commercial for a Caesars sportsbook app during a New York Giants game, or an ad for FanDuel — the official sports betting partner for Major League Baseball — in the middle of a Yankees game.

""It's way out of line,"" New Jersey Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, who chairs the Assembly's Tourism and Gaming Committee, said in a 2022 interview. ""It's completely insane. You can't even turn a TV on without seeing an ad.""

Story continues below photo gallery

The new FDU poll, whose results were released Friday, found that 76% of New Jersey voters favor a limit on gambling ads. Majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independent voters all felt the same way. 

Men and women, and Black, white and Hispanic voters all also agreed that there ought to be limits, as did voters in every age group — those under 30, those 31 to 44 years old, 45 to 64 and 65 and up.

“If either party is looking for a slam dunk issue in New Jersey, this is it,"" said Dan Cassino, executive director of the FDU Poll. “Even the groups most likely to take part in gambling, like young men, seem to be fed up with all of the ads.”

Since the 2018 U.S Supreme Court decision, state residents have wagered nearly more than $58 billion in New Jersey sportsbooks, most of it bet online or via mobile apps. 

Studies have shown that sports betting, now legal in 39 states, is particularly risky, leading to higher rates of debt, lower savings and even bankruptcies, the nonprofit news organization Stateline reported in December.

Experts warn that the convenience of online betting, combined with heavy advertising, has made gambling more addictive, particularly for young men.

A separate FDU poll from last September found that 10% of men ages 18 to 30 reported gambling problems, compared with 3% of the overall adult population

In a 2023 study, the Rutgers Center for Gambling Studies found the rate of high-risk problem gambling among the New Jersey population to be 6%, three times the national average. 

Meanwhile, proposed legislation would decriminalize underage gambling in New Jersey and in its place institute civil penalties. Advocates of the bill say the fines would be used for prevention, treatment and education around problem gambling.

The same FDU poll also tested public opinion on banning cellphones in classrooms, and found that 49% favored it, with 45% opposed. 

Citing mental health concerns among students and a need to eliminate distractions, Gov. Phil Murphy announced in his January State of the State address that he wants a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms.

The poll relied on the responses of 1,476 New Jersey voters interviewed via phone between Feb. 23 and 28. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.

Another day, another big name on the NFL trade market. The Cincinnati Bengals entered the 2025 offseason aiming to secure three of their top players with long-term contracts, including pass rusher Trey Hendrickson. Now, with free agency around the corner, the club has given Hendrickson permission to seek a trade.

This isn't the first time Hendrickson has sought a fresh start, as the veteran defensive end also requested a trade ahead of the 2024 season, only to return and lead the NFL in sacks (17.5). The primary holdup between Hendrickson and the Bengals: The edge rusher is approaching the final year of his contract, and he's reportedly been seeking a pay raise since also logging 17.5 sacks in 2023. 

On CBS Sports HQ, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones cited a couple of league executives who surmised Hendrickson's trade value would be something similar to the Khalil Mack trade to the Chargers back in 2022. Back then, Mack went for a second-round pick. However, because Mack was already under contract, Hendrickson's value may be closer to a third-round pick due to him also seeking an extension. 

Where might the four-time Pro Bowler end up in 2025? Even at 30 years old, in search of an elevated salary, Hendrickson should have a formidable market thanks to his production. So here's a rundown of the most logical landing spots, keeping in mind Hendrickson is already owed more than $18 million this year:

This would take some serious salary-cap gymnastics, but the Falcons need edge-rushing help like no other, and they've seen Hendrickson do damage firsthand, previously playing against the former New Orleans Saints prospect in the NFC South. General manager Terry Fontenot was also on staff with the Saints when Hendrickson was drafted and developed into a Pro Bowler.

The Colts spent an early pick on Laiatu Latu just last offseason, and Kwity Paye has been a steady starter on the other side. Indy ranked just 25th in sacks in 2024, however, and new defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo ran the Bengals' defense when Cincinnati spent big bucks to lure Hendrickson from the Saints, then oversaw each of Hendrickson's prolific seasons in the AFC North.

After dealing Preston Smith during the 2024 season, the Packers could use a proven counterpart for Rashan Gary and the young Lukas Van Ness off the edge. They've also got plenty of money to spend, with more than $46 million in projected 2025 cap space. Filling their pass-rushing need via trade would potentially also allow them to focus on addressing cornerback in free agency.

The Bears just gave up picks -- and a big contract -- to Montez Sweat in 2023, but they could use another proven edge presence. And they've already proven willing to part with picks for immediate help this offseason. New Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen also has a history with Hendrickson, serving the same role with the Saints when the pass rusher made a name for himself in New Orleans.

The Commanders just worked the phone lines to land Deebo Samuel, but they only surrendered a fifth-round pick to bolster their wide receiver room. They could still use a bona fide pass rusher for Dan Quinn's defense, and they're also still flush with cap space, projected to enter free agency with more than $60 million at their disposal. If Washington is serious about contending, he'd be a quick fix up front.

It's getting harder to find quality tight ends in the NFL.

The position is important, as teams look for their matchup cheat codes like Trey McBride or Brock Bowers. There just aren't enough good TEs for each team to have a player like that.

The free agency class at tight end reflects how thin the position is. While there are some veterans who can provide something, there are no top-end stars available this offseason. There aren't even many starting-level players.

Here are the top five tight ends in free agency:

When the Jaguars decided to cut Engram, he immediately became the best option in a weak tight end class. He will be 31 years old next season and has had an inconsistent career, but had 114 catches in 2023. Even if Engram is flawed, he's the best of the group.

Ertz had a bit of a resurgence in 2024, with 654 yards and seven touchdowns for the Commanders. He has had a very good career, but it's asking a lot for Ertz to be an impact player as he's about to turn 35 in November. Yet, in a weak tight end class, he's probably one of the best options.

Gesicki was once thought about highly enough that he got the franchise tag from the Dolphins. After some quiet seasons he found a good home with the Bengals, where he had 665 yards. That was more than his previous two seasons combined. He's still a solid pass catcher in the right offense.

Johnson was fine in his five Saints seasons, but he never broke out. He had 1,622 yards in five seasons for New Orleans, topping out at 548. He's a starting tight end somewhere, but it's getting harder to see another level coming for him.

Conklin posted 449 yards for the Jets last season and does everything fairly well. Even though he turns 30 in July, he's probably good enough to be a starter for some team on a short-term deal.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Danny Briere made the difficult decision to trade Scott Laughton ahead of Friday's 3 p.m. ET deadline.

The Flyers dealt the alternate captain, a fourth-round pick and sixth-round pick to the Maple Leafs, according to multiple reports. In exchange, the Flyers received a first-round pick and prospect Nikita Grebenkin, per reports.

The Flyers are retaining 50 percent of Laughton's remaining salary, according to reports. He has another year left on his deal, which has a $3 million cap hit.

Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman and TSN's Darren Dreger first reported the deal. The Flyers held Laughton out of practice Friday.

""He is a very good friend of mine, we talked quite a bit this morning,"" John Tortorella said. ""His name's there. I think it has worn on him a little bit, I think there has been some struggles in his game, and I guess rightfully so with all the stuff flying around him, him and his family.

""Like I told him this morning, no matter what happens here today — if you're still with us or you're not — our relationship is always going to be our relationship. That'll never go away. And quite honestly, at the end of the day, when you're done coaching or playing, those are the most important things. That's going to be a guy that I truly respect and love, that is always going to be a part of me.""

Laughton, one of the Flyers' more versatile forwards and a player featuring plenty of intangibles, was in his 12th season with the organization. The Toronto area native had played for the Flyers his entire NHL career, starting as an 18-year-old.

""Danny is listening, he has to listen because we're in that stage, we have to improve our team,"" Tortorella said last week. ""Scotty's loved here, but you can't fall in love.""

Unlike last season, the Flyers have spent the majority of this season hovering around .500, giving Briere more reason to make changes for his rebuild. At the end of January, he moved Joel Farabee and Morgan Frost to the Flames, a trade that was about the offseason and future.

Laughton was one of the Flyers' top trade chips for various reasons. Contending clubs love players like him, guys that play multiple positions, have a playoff edge to their game and kill penalties. Over the last three seasons, the 30-year-old forward has led the NHL in shorthanded scoring with 17 points (six goals, 11 assists).

Furthermore, Laughton had a team-friendly contract. Through his 12 years with the Flyers, he had become beloved in the locker room and entrenched in the community.

""He's critical to our culture, but if there's something that makes too much sense, it's our duty to listen and to do the right thing for this organization, this team moving forward,"" Briere said in January. ""And I've been very clear with the players, I tell them all the same thing.""

Laughton had endured trade speculation for the last five seasons, going back to when he signed his five-year, $15 million contract extension on the day of the 2021 deadline. Last season, he appreciated the organization's transparent approach.

""Right from the get-go, when my name was in rumors, I got a call from Torts right away, we had a good chat about it,"" Laughton said last April at his end-of-the-season press conference. ""All of them were very upfront with me of kind of what they saw and what they were thinking. I was never in the dark, which was a really good feeling.""

With a rebuilding team on track to miss the playoffs for a fifth straight season, which would match the franchise's longest drought, the Flyers eventually made the tough call to move Laughton.

Grebenkin is a 22-year-old winger from Russia. The 2022 fifth-rounder played seven games for the Maple Leafs this season and had 21 points (nine goals, 12 assists) in 39 games for the AHL affiliate Marlies.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Bill Belichick reportedly called Marco Rubio to express his interest in the North Carolina job,https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football/article/bill-belichick-reportedly-called-marco-rubio-to-express-his-interest-in-the-north-carolina-job-150053453.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:00:53 GMT","

The man who is the current United States Secretary of State reportedly helped start the process of Bill Belichick’s move to North Carolina.

According to a detailed ESPN story of Belichick’s move to the Tar Heels, the six-time Super Bowl winner is friends with Marco Rubio and told the then-Florida senator that he would be interested in coaching at North Carolina. Rubio then reached out to North Carolina Senator Thom Thillis.

From ESPN:

""Rubio follows the sports world pretty closely, and he called me and said, 'There's a chance Belichick would come to Chapel Hill,'"" Tillis told ESPN. ""He said, 'He wants a school with a great academic reputation, and he wants to try to build a program to bring them a national championship. I said, 'Well, let me go [make some calls].'""

Tillis hung up the phone and immediately called Phil Berger, the North Carolina Senate president pro tempore, who had strong connections with power players at UNC. Berger initially laughed at the suggestion until Tillis assured him that, yes, Belichick truly wanted the job.

That became the spark that lit the fuse, and before long, the Belichick chase was a raging inferno among key stakeholders, including [UNC board chair John] Preyer. As one source put it, ""the push to land Belichick all started with the politicians.""

North Carolina hired Belichick in December to replace Mack Brown after Brown was fired in November. Brown’s future had been a source of speculation for much of the 2024 season — he even told the team he’d quit if they didn’t believe in him after a loss to James Madison — as North Carolina scuffled to an uneven season.

Brown was one of just three active coaches in college football who had won a national title and was in his second stint at North Carolina after coming out of retirement to replace Larry Fedora. Now he’s being succeeded by just the second coach to take a college football job after winning a Super Bowl.

Belichick has also made sure to quash speculation about a return to the NFL ever since he took the Carolina job. Though his buyout makes a move back to the NFL very easy after the 2025 season, he said at his introductory press conference that he didn't come to North Carolina to leave and has assembled a staff with extensive experience.

But even though Belichick has had so much success in the NFL, it's no guarantee that he'll turn North Carolina into a perennial contender as well. Though the college game may be as similar to the NFL as it's ever been, there are still key differences. And how Belichick navigates those differences will determine how successful North Carolina is going forward. We just won't get to see how it happens via ""Hard Knocks.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Lines wrapped around the corner at Dick’s House of Sport on Friday morning, as shoppers waited to get their first look at the newest anchor store at the Mall at Fairfield Commons in Beavercreek. 

Dick’s House of Sport, described as the “experiential retail” wing of Dick’s Sporting Goods, opens to shoppers this weekend. It is the first Dick’s House of Sport store in Ohio.

Danny Tipton, a Wright-Patterson Air Force Base retiree, was first in line at 10 p.m. the previous evening, adding that he’s on the hunt for some apparel. 





“I wanted to be the first one to enjoy Dick’s Sporting Goods,” he said. “I like the history of it, and I could use some thermal underwear.”

Others started joining him about 4 a.m., Tipton said, though adding that his 10-hour campout was “absolutely worth it.”



“I’ve met some good people,” he said.

The Beavercreek Dick’s House of Sport store is the 21st of its type nationwide, said Field Marketing Manager Kevin Troklus. It goes far beyond the typical Dick’s sporting goods store, with many extra features.









The over 100,000-square-foot facility includes a rock climbing wall, multiple golf bays with TrackMan simulators, and batting cages that can be used for baseball, softball, lacrosse and soccer.

The store also has a 17,000-square-foot outdoor turf field, where kids can try out cleats, shoes and equipment to determine if they fit well, or are suitable for their sport.

“We thought about what would make a store stand out from just a normal shopping experience, where an athlete could come in and try and test the product out, at no other place than House of Sport,” Troklus said.

Bellbrook resident Ben Forshee said he and his family came to the grand opening at the urging of his young daughter Pearl, who wants to play basketball.

“I think it’s awesome. All our kids are in sports. We walked around yesterday and it seems like they’ve got a much wider selection of stuff,” he said.





Opening weekend activities include giveaways for gift cards for adults, DSG soccer balls for children and entries for a cash prize.

Three high-profile current and former Ohio athletes were scheduled to be at the grand opening weekend:

* Chris Olave, NFL wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints and former Ohio State Buckeyes great, was set to sign autographs from 6-7:30 p.m. Friday;

* Cincinnati Bengals rising star running back Chase Brown will be there from noon-1:30 p.m. Saturday;

* Hall of Fame former Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench will appear from 12:30-2 p.m. Sunday.

Dick’s House of Sport currently operates stores in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Dick’s plans to have between 75 and 100 new concept locations by 2027.

Both Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns are dug in on their respective positions, with Garrett wanting a trade out of Cleveland and the organization steadfastly refusing to even discuss it. 

Amid the stalemate, Garrett requested to meet with Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, per NFL Media, but Haslam declined the request. According to Cleveland.com, Haslam told Garrett that he has to speak with general manager Andrew Berry about the situation instead.

Garrett has been adamant that he wants a trade to a team that is a potential Super Bowl contender, which the Browns are obviously not.

""While I've loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won't allow me to be complacent,"" Garrett said when he announced his trade request. ""The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl."" 

Meanwhile, Berry has been just as adamant that the team will not honor Garrett's request. ""We understand the trade costs and everything, but our stance really has not changed,"" Berry said. ""We can't imagine a situation where not having Myles in this organization is best for the Browns.""

Despite rumors that the trade request was a precursor for a contract-extension push, Garrett has also reportedly declined to discuss an extension with the Browns. He has two years left on the five-year, $125 million contract extension he signed back in 2020, and is set to draw bare-minimum base salaries of $1.26 million and $1.3 million over those two seasons. He does have some bonus money coming his way, but he'll still likely be looking for a new contract upon being traded to a new team. He should break the bank if and when that happens, as he remains arguably the best defensive player in all of football.

The 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season continues on Sunday with the 2025 Shriners Children's 500 and a return to the traditional raceway after last week's first road race of the NASCAR season. Christopher Bell has been the most dominant name in the NASCAR driver pool early in the 2025 NASCAR Cup Series season regardless of surface after wins last week and at Atlanta Motor Speedway. He is the +450 favorite to win NASCAR at Phoenix, so is he a must-add to 2025 Shriners Children's 500 NASCAR Fantasy lineups and how high should he be in the 2025 Phoenix NASCAR Fantasy rankings?

The green flag drops at 3:30 p.m. ET for the 312-lap race. Ryan Blaney (+500) follows Bell and Kyle Larson is +750 in the latest 2025 Shriners Children's 500 odds. Before locking in your NASCAR Fantasy picks for the 2025 Shriners Children's 500 at Phoenix Raceway, be sure to check out the optimal NASCAR at Phoenix Fantasy strategy and advice from SportsLine's Mike McClure. 

McClure has won over $2 million in his career as a daily Fantasy pro, and his NASCAR DFS driver pool, projections and advice can help you score a big win on Sunday on sites like FanDuel and DraftKings.

McClure's model began the 2025 season by calling Chase Elliott's win in the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray for a +300 payout. Then at Daytona, it was also high on William Byron despite +2000 odds. In 2024, it nailed Kyle Larson to win in Las Vegas for a 21-5 betting payout and predicted Denny Hamlin's wins in Bristol at 5-1 and Richmond at 17-4.

It also impressively nailed five of Larson's wins during his historic season in 2021. All told, the model has nailed a whopping 19 winners since 2021, including nine in 2023 and three in the first seven races last season. Anyone who followed its lead on betting apps and sportsbooks on those NASCAR picks could have seen huge returns. 

Now, he's turned his attention to Sunday's 2025 Shriners Children's 500. He's only sharing his picks and NASCAR Fantasy rankings here.

One of McClure's top 2025 Shriners Children's 500 Fantasy picks is Ross Chastain, even though he's a longshot at 14-1. Chastain finished 12th last week after a crash resulted in a 40th-place finish at the Daytona 500. But Phoenix Raceway brings memories of solid results for Chastain, who has three top-three finishes over his last six races there. He won the NASCAR Cup Series Championship race at Phoenix Raceway to cap off the 2023 season and finish ninth in the final standings that year.

The 32-year-old didn't have a strong 2024 campaign with just six top-five finishes over 37 starts after back-to-back years with at least 10 top-five results. But given his success in Phoenix and with five top-12 finishes over his last six 1-mile intermediate track races like Sunday's format, he's a longshot who can return value to NASCAR Fantasy lineups. See which other drivers to back here. 

Another curveball: Joey Logano, one of the top betting favorites and last year's NASCAR Cup Series champion, barely cracks the top 10 of McClure's Fantasy NASCAR rankings. Logano has finished outside the top 10 in each of his first three races this year and is coming off a 24th-place result last week. The 34-year-old placed 35th at the Daytona 500 after being involved in a late accident and received blame from NASCAR legends for being the reason for the crash. 

He was also involved in a crash at last year's Shriners Children's 500. Logano finished outside the top 10 in back-to-back spring races at Phoenix Raceway. Although it's only been three NASCAR Cup Series races, his 23.7 average finish would be his worst since his debut season in 2008. McClure expects Logano to be a popular option in NASCAR Fantasy picks off his Cup Series title, but he doesn't project a strong result on Sunday. See which other drivers to avoid here.

McClure is also targeting an undervalued driver set to return plenty of value for his NASCAR Fantasy picks. This driver is in a prime position to make a run at the checkered flag for the ultimate Shriners Children's 500 sleeper. You can see who it is, and every other pick, right here.

So what are the top NASCAR Fantasy picks for the 2025 NASCAR at Phoenix race, and which value driver is a must-roster? Visit SportsLine now to see DFS millionaire Mike McClure's complete Shriners Children's 500 Fantasy rankings, for a chance to cash in big on NASCAR Fantasy.

The uncertain future of Mikko Rantanen is the biggest question going into the final hours before the NHL trade deadline Friday, with the Carolina Hurricanes holding the keys to by far the most dominant player potentially available.

The Hurricanes could flip the 2022 Stanley Cup-winning point-a-game, top-line forward they acquired in late January to another contender or opt to keep him in the hopes of going on a long playoff run and taking a shot at a championship of their own. Carolina sent leading scorer Martin Necas, young Jack Drury and two draft picks to Colorado for Rantanen and now seem unlikely to sign him to an extension before 3 p.m. EST.

The risk is losing the 28-year-old Finn for nothing if he walks in free agency July 1. That was a fear for the Avalanche that spurred the trade to begin with, and now Rantanen could end up back in the Western Conference on a team they face in a best-of-seven series.

""We don't make deals thinking about pivot points by what the other team is going to do,"" Colorado general manager Chris MacFarland said this week. ""Obviously, he's a great player and he will continue to be wherever he is.""

Stay or go is also a question for pending free agent Boston Bruins captain Brad Marchand, Kyle Palmieri of the New York Islanders and Scott Laughton of the Philadelphia Flyers, among others. The Islanders traded center Brock Nelson to Colorado late Thursday night.

Boston also already began selling, trading big forward Trent Frederic to Edmonton this week and Justin Brazeau to Minnesota on Thursday night and may not be done.

Marchand has said he would like to remain with the team he helped win the Cup in 2011 and has played his entire career for. But the Bruins could be headed toward a type of rebuild or youth movement.

Defending champion Florida, which beat the Oilers in the final last year, also has room to add more talent with top winger Matthew Tkachuk on long-term injured reserve and possibly aiming to return for Game 1 of the first round. The Panthers already got top-four defenseman Seth Jones from Chicago and could use Tkachuk's salary exemption against the cap the way other teams have in the past to load up when injuries last through the end of the regular season.

Among the players expected to be traded before the deadline are Pittsburgh's Rickard Rakell, Chicago's Ryan Donato, Seattle's Brandon Tanev and San Jose's Luke Kunin.

Welcome to the Friday edition of the Pick Six newsletter! 

I hope everyone has a peaceful day, because this is it: This is the calm before the storm in the NFL. 

Starting next week, NFL free agency will be kicking off, and things will be getting wild. Although free agency doesn't technically start until Wednesday (March 12), the legal tampering period starts Monday (March 10) at noon ET, and that's when the nonstop craziness will likely start. 

We'll be going all-in on free agency with some bold predictions, and we'll also be taking a look at some possible landing spots for Trey Hendrickson, who has been granted permission by the Bengals to seek a trade. 

As always, here's your daily reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter. To get them signed up, all you have to do is click here. 

We've been making predictions all week about what's going to happen in free agency, but we haven't made any BOLD predictions, which is going to change right now, because that's what we're going to do today. 

Garrett Podell came up with several bold predictions for free agency, and we're going to check out three of those below. 

Garrett has a few more bold predictions, and you can check those out here. 

After playing matchmaker in the NFC on Thursday, we're moving on to the AFC. 

Tyler Sullivan went through every team in the AFC and came up with one free agent who they should sign, so let's take a look at a few of the names on his list. 

Sullivan made one free agent suggestion for all 16 AFC teams, and if you want to see his full list, all you have to do is click here.

At this point, it's starting to feel like we're getting a new trade request EVERY DAY in the NFL, and on Thursday, that request came from Trey Hendrickson, who was given permission to seek a trade by the Bengals. 

Here's what you need to know:

We've got the full story on Hendrickson's trade request here. 

The fact Hendrickson only has one year left on his contract makes him slightly more difficult to trade, because not only does a new team have to give up draft picks to land him, but they also have to give him a new contract that will likely be worth well north of $30 million per year. 

So, where might Hendrickson end up? Glad you asked. Cody Benjamin came up with a few landing spots. 

Cody came up with five total landing spots, and you can check out his full list here. 

The award for craziest day of the offseason so far definitely goes to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who turned their roster upside down Thursday. Not only did they cut four different players, but they also traded a receiver to a division rival and their starting center retired. 

Let's recap the craziness in Jacksonville: 

The Jags now have roughly $60 million in cap space, which means they're now in a spot where they could make a splash in free agency next week.  

There have been some bad free agent signings throughout NFL history. Our own Bryan DeArdo ranked the 10 worst signings ever, and we're going to take a look at the top three on his list: 

1. Washington signs Albert Haynesworth (2009). ""Washington signed the two-time All-Pro to a seven-year, $100 million contract, but quickly regretted that decision. During his first year in Washington, Haynesworth publicly questioned the coaching staff while failing to produce up to expectations. Conflicts between Haynesworth and the coaching staff continued in 2010, along with his lack of production. Haynesworth was traded to the Patriots in 2011.""

2. Falcons sign Kirk Cousins (2024). ""Prior to drafting Michael Penix Jr., the Falcons' acquisition of Cousins made sense. Atlanta was 7-10 each of the previous three seasons and appeared to be a quarterback away from making a serious run at the NFC South division title. ... But Cousins immediately struggled in Atlanta, and he never really recovered. He threw a league-high 16 interceptions and was ultimately benched in favor of Penix after 14 games. While the Falcons have already moved on to Penix, they need to figure out what to do with Cousins, who is currently slated to return to the team as an insanely overpaid backup.""

3. Giants sign Kenny Golladay (2021). ""This is one of the worst free agent acquisitions of all-time for good reason. Golladay was a Pro Bowler with the Lions in 2019, was injured most of the 2020 season, then signed a four-year, $72 million deal with the Giants in 2021. He caught just 43 passes in two seasons with the Giants, who released him last offseason.""

DeArdo ranked the 10 worst signings of all-time, and if you want to see his full list, you can do that here. 

It's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you.

LeBron James' conversation with ESPN's Stephen A. Smith at a recent Lakers-Knicks game has received considerable attention.

Smith attended the Thursday showdown at the Crypto.com Arena, and at some point, he and James engaged in a face-to-face conversation courtside. It's unclear how long the two actually chatted, but lip-readers think they uncovered what the conversation might have been about ― his son, Bronny James.

As James is chatting with Smith, he seemingly tells the ESPN personality, ""Keep my son out of this [expletive], bro."" After saying his thoughts, the exchange ends, and James walks away.

Here's the video of that moment:

Milton Williams used Super Bowl LIX as a job interview.

Williams had a great game for the Philadelphia Eagles, sacking Patrick Mahomes twice. The timing couldn't have better, with Williams set to become a free agent.

Williams is one of the handful of quality interior defensive linemen available in free agency. It's a premium position in the NFL, with teams valuing pass rush from the inside. It was huge for the Eagles in beating the Chiefs.

Here are the top five interior defensive linemen in free agency:

It says something about the Eagles' depth that Williams started only seven games last season. The former third-round draft pick is talented, but the Eagles had Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter on the inside, which limited Williams' snaps a bit. There's some question if Williams can have a similar impact without so much attention going to teammates like Carter, but he's going to get a nice payday.

Allen had a good eight-season run with the Commanders, who cut him after they couldn't work out a trade. He played in just eight games last season but has been durable and productive and just turned 30 and can still make an impact in the short term.

There's a big drop from the first two on the list to whoever is No. 3. Hill isn't a dominant force but he's a good, steady veteran who has been durable and is a valuable set-and-forget starter.

Reed is a good player who rarely comes off the field and gives a bit of a pass rush from the interior. This will be his 10th NFL season and there isn't much reason to believe he can't still be a contributor in a rotation.

Onwuzurike was a second-round draft pick in 2021 but took awhile to develop. He missed his second season with a back injury and didn't become a regular starter until last season. He started 10 games and played pretty well in the middle of the Lions' defense, and could perhaps be a late bloomer.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"
https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,NFL free-agent rankings: Top 5 LBs has some solid options even without Zack Baun,https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/article/nfl-free-agent-rankings-top-5-lbs-has-some-solid-options-even-without-zack-baun-125423126.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 12:54:23 GMT","

It's rare for a first-team NFL All-Pro player to change teams in the offseason. It hadn't happened in either of the past two offseasons.

It looked like Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Zack Baun could be one of those rare players after he turned a one-year deal into a shocking breakout that helped his team win Super Bowl LIX. But shortly before teams could bid on Baun in free agency, the Eagles re-signed on a three-year, $51 million deal. That also might show a rebound for off-the-ball linebackers in free agency, as teams started running the ball more often and effectively against defenses that hadn't put a premium on the position.

Baun was the top option among linebackers, but there are some other good options. Here are the top five inside linebackers in free agency:

Bolton is a strong all-around three-down linebacker who will be just 25 years old next season. He had a remarkable 180-tackle season in 2022 and has been a big part of the Chiefs' defensive surge the past couple of seasons.

Greenlaw tore his Achilles in the Super Bowl at the end of the 2023 season, which makes him risky. But in his first game back last season he looked like the same player as always, flying around the field and making plays. If a team is convinced he's healthy, he can be an elite asset.

Jones could be higher on the list after having a strong 10-game run for the Seahawks last season. Jones was traded twice in 2024, first from the Rams to the Titans, then the Titans to the Seahawks, and seemed to have found a home. It would be surprising if Seattle doesn't re-sign him.

There are other good short-term veteran options (Bobby Wagner, Lavonte David) but Sherwood's age (25 years old) gives him a bump. Sherwood, a fifth-round draft pick in 2021, had just seven starts before last season, when he got a shot to start full time and ran with it, picking up 158 tackles. He can be a long-term three-down option.

It's hard to imagine David playing anywhere but Tampa Bay. David has played 13 NFL seasons, all with the Buccaneers, and is a franchise legend. He had 122 tackles last season and should be good on another one-year deal.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Aside from the Philadelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions, it seems every team needs offensive line help. Many teams need multiple linemen.

Often there aren't many quality options in free agency because good linemen are scarce and teams keep tight grips on them. Recent prime examples are Trey Smith and the Kansas City Chiefs, and Alaric Jackson and the Los Angeles Rams.

Smith picked a good time to make his first Pro Bowl. He was one of the better guards in the NFL last season, a reason the Chiefs didn't let him hit the open market right before he turns 26 years old. KC put the franchise tag on its star guard, keeping him on a one-year deal that'll pay Smith $23.4 million.

Meanwhile, the Rams reached a three-year extension with Jackson valued at $57 million with $37 million guaranteed.

This free agency class offers some good options for teams in need. It will be costly to secure one of the top names on the market but there are also good options after the top tier.

Here are the top five offensive linemen in free agency:

Stanley is a fantastic talent. Yet, last season was the first time in his nine-year career that he has played every game in a season. Durability will be a part of the equation for Stanley, and usually that doesn't improve at age 31, which Stanley will be next season. Still, when he plays, he's a top left tackle.

Becton is an interesting case. He didn't work out with the Jets, who drafted him in the first round and never saw a return on investment because Becton was regularly injured. He thrived with the Eagles, playing guard and blocking for a 2,000-yard rusher in Saquon Barkley. He started his career at tackle and perhaps could move back there. No matter where he plays, he has resurrected his career.

If Fries had a healthy 2024 season he'd be higher on the list. He had developed into an excellent guard for the Colts, posting the fourth-highest Pro Football Focus grade among guards last season. A fractured tibia in Week 5 ended his season early. The injury adds to the risk factor. If he's healthy he could be a great addition.

Robinson was a midseason acquisition by the Vikings, and he competently played left tackle after Minnesota lost starter Christian Darrisaw to an injury. Robinson has started 101 games over eight seasons, mostly with the Jaguars, and he doesn't turn 30 until October. He'd be a fine addition at tackle.

Zeitler will be 35 next season, but he is still a capable starter after 13 NFL seasons. He started 16 games for the Lions last season. He'd be a reasonable addition for a team looking for a short-term fix at guard.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Changes this year to Tricare, the military’s health care program, have brought cascading disruptions to millions of service members, their families and network providers nationwide.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.

In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.

Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.“There’s no longer improvement,” Heggins said, as he began to cry. “My son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.”

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.

The DHA previously said the new contracts would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.

This situation has become untenable.

Brenda Stephens, a tricare provider

In a statement to NBC News, DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues.Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.

“This situation has become untenable,” said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.

Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.

Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.

“There are times where I’m like, what am I going to do?” he said. 

A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a “small percentage” of providers’ records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.

The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.

The company said it has been “working around the clock” to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.

“We have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,” the spokesperson said. “We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.

“All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned,” a TriWest spokesperson said in a statement.

TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA officials said it will take one to two weeks to determine if the technical fixes resolved the east region issues.

The agency said the contractors have met the contractual requirements to pay 98% of processed claims within 30 days and all claims within 90 days to date.

The DHA officials, citing the contractors, said no east region provider has left the network due to claims issues but that a few have left in the west.

Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are “always slightly slower” in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.

“This time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,” the officials said. “Additionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.”

NBC News spoke to more than half a dozen providers across the country who said they are still waiting to be reimbursed. Faced with a sudden cash flow crisis, many have had to make difficult and heartbreaking decisions.

In San Diego, Stephens took out a $75,000 loan at the beginning of February, but it only got her clinic through two payrolls. By the end of February, she had to pause services for all of her clinic’s 350 Tricare patients — some whom she said are in “desperate shape” — as well as lay off seven employees.

“It’s been nothing short of devastating. I feel a reaction in my whole body right now,” she said through tears. “We’ve been forced into an impossible situation. We can’t continue to treat them without being paid and they can’t find other providers.”

A Florida clinic that provides psychiatry and therapy services to about 300 people also recently decided it would have to stop treating Tricare patients after it racked up more than $100,000 in unpaid claims since Jan. 1, office manager Beth Matricia said.

You're talking about people who are suicidal. 

beth Matricia, office manager

“We’re going to have to charge them out of pocket because if we keep going this way, we’re going to have to close down,” said Matricia, who manages MAPS Integrated Wellness in the military community of Fernandina Beach.Matricia said she and other staff members fear the fallout will further affect the mental health of service members, who will likely not be able to afford the full cost of up to $150 per session.

“You’re talking about people who are suicidal,” she said. “If you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It’s very hard to transfer therapists. It’s really hard to open up again.”

Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“It might spiral someone down to a deep depression,” Wise said.

In Clarksville, Tennessee, Jenne Nesbitt-Decker, owner and chief financial officer of Mariposa Behavioral Health Services, a small clinic that treats children and teens who have autism, said she has had to cut the number of available appointments in half to make up for the lack of payments and the loss of one provider who quit.

If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.

There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association’s acting director of government relations.

“That exacerbates an already difficult problem,” she said. “What implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families? That’s really troubling.”

The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.

His son’s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.

While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.

“If my insurance won’t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,” he said.

Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife’s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.

“It would be incredibly difficult,” he said. “I hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.”

The struggling retail pharmacy chain entered an agreement to be purchased by private equity firm Sycamore Partners, which could end its nearly 100-year run as a public company.

The total value of the transaction could be nearly $24 billion, including debt and future payouts. 

The purchase also includes a 35-day period where Walgreens can solicit additional proposals. But given the deal’s potential size and complexity, a competing bid likely wouldn’t be successful, Leerink Partners analysts said in a Thursday note.

Rumors of the Sycamore sale, which could end Walgreens’ nearly 100-year run as a public company, have been circulating for months. 

The deal isn’t surprising, given that Walgreens’ core retail pharmacy business is in “drastic need of changes” that would be challenging to undertake on the public markets, according to a Thursday note by TD Cowen analysts Charles Rhyee and Lucas Romanski.

The company’s share price has plummeted over the past decade as Walgreens faces lower prescription reimbursements and heightened retail competition. In first quarter results released in January, Walgreens reported an operating loss of $245 million compared to a loss of $39 million in the prior-year period. 

The retailer has embarked on a turnaround plan, which included cutting costs and reducing its store footprint. In the fall, Walgreens said it would close about 1,200 stores over the next three years, after CEO Tim Wentworth warned its 8,700 U.S. locations were underperforming. 

“While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company,” Wentworth said in a statement. “Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.”

Walgreens had also walked back a planned pivot to health services. Before the Sycamore deal, the retailer said in the summer it was considering a sale of VillageMD, a primary care chain that received billions of dollars in Walgreens’ investment.

The company’s U.S. Healthcare segment reported an operating loss of $325 million in the first quarter, even as VillageMD and specialty pharmacy business Shields Health Solutions saw improved performance.

Walgreens will report second-quarter financial results on April 8.

Mangione said the letter was the first to make him ‘tear up’ as the mom, only identified as Karen, shared details of her daughter’s rare, life-threatening disease

Luigi Mangione has written a letter from his prison cell to a mother who ‘made him tear up’ as she detailed her struggles to pay for her daughter’s healthcare.

“Your letter is the first to make me tear up. I am so, so, sorry for what you and your daughter so senselessly had to endure,” Mangione wrote from his cell at the end of December. 

Mangione’s letter to “Karen” was shared with journalist and novelist Ashley Shelby, who published it on her Substack dedicated to the case. The mom, Karen, detailed how her daughter deals with a life-threatening condition. Karen told said that her daughter requires constant care and medical treatment and last year, costs mounted after she was hospitalized for 60 nights, according to the Substack.

“What she and I went through as a result of insurance calling the shots rather than the doctors is a horrible story,” Karen said. “She is improving, but hardly close to her old self.”

The mom referenced the famed mosaic of Christ in Majesty at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., and referred to it as “Warrior Jesus” in her letter. 

She vowed that she would “keep up the fight” in Mangione’s name.

Mangione has developed a following of fans since his arrest in connection to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot outside of a hotel in Midtown Manhattan on December 4. Mangione has pleaded not guilty. A specific motive for the killing has not been released, but many have speculated that is tied to Thompson’s role with the insurance company. 

The 26-year-old is awaiting trial in New York’s notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. New York, where he sent the letter from. 

“If you are able to send a photo of you/your daughter or the mosaic, it would mean a great deal to me,” Mangione wrote to mom. “I will put it up on my prison cell wall next to your letter. Your daughter is blessed to have a mother who loves her so much and fights for her so relentlessly.” 

Initially, Karen felt “very weird” about writing to Mangione, she said, but did so after being “driven by some force that didn’t make sense but couldn’t be ignored.”

The mom added that after hearing similar stories of Americans’ battles with health insurers, her anger has turned to determination to support “nurses and doctors, telling them that a change was surely coming.”

Mangione has been inundated with fan mail since he began his prison stint. 

Last month the murder suspect released his first public statement since his December arrest where he told supporters he reads every letter he receives.

“I am overwhelmed by - and grateful for - everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions, as mail has flooded MDC from across the country, and around the globe,” Mangione’s statement said. “While I can't reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive. Thank you again to everyone who took the time to write. I look forward to hearing more in the future.”

Supporters have been donating to his legal defense fund, which currently stands at $641,491. One generous donor gave $30,000 last month.

Hundreds of his fans turned up in droves to support Mangione at his pre-trial hearing inside a New York courthouse last month.

“I think what happened was inevitable given the amount of tension” between Americans and the healthcare industry, one New Yorker told The Independent outside the court.

One person who traveled three hours from Maryland just to see the reaction to the hearing remarked on this tension: “Something’s gotta give and that something was Luigi Mangione …. he’s a go-getter.”

Another protester, who flew in from Chicago to show solidarity, said: “I think major changes are needed in insurance.” Thompson’s killing “brought a spotlight and a charge to take action against wrongdoing by corporate entities milking as much as they can from normal people.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,Insurance could become unaffordable for 90% of RIers on state plans. Here's why,https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/03/07/obamacare-plans-at-risk-of-losing-thousands-of-enrollees-in-ri/81648160007/,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:06:21 GMT","

PROVIDENCE – More than 40,000 Rhode Islanders could see their premiums balloon when enhanced tax credits under Obamacare that help subsidize the cost of their insurance expire this year, according to Protect Our Healthcare RI, a group of organizations advocating for more affordable and accessible health care.

The credits – known as advanced premium tax credits – date back to 2021, when Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. The act increased the premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, making insurance more accessible and leading to record enrollment in ACA plans. In 2022 Congress extended the credits to 2025 with the Inflation Reduction Act.

In Rhode Island, they provide about $40 million worth of tax credits for Rhode Islanders who get their insurance through HealthSource RI, the state’s individual marketplace, which currently has about 46,000 enrollees. The advanced premium tax credits, however, are set to expire at end of 2025, and it is unclear whether Congress will extend them.

Advocates from Protect Our Healthcare RI have warned that the expiration of the credits could have vast consequences for many in the state. More than 90% of people enrolled in HealthSourceRI plans rely on them to afford their insurance.

Shamus Durac, co-chair of Protect Our Healthcare RI, gave a few examples of what the impact could look like:

On average, HealthSource RI estimated that monthly insurance premiums will increase by 85%.

That's for those who manage to keep their insurance. As many as 11,300 people could lose coverage entirely, according to a report from HealthSource RI.

“These are people who have very high medical needs, who are suddenly going to see significant increases in the cost of their care and may go without health insurance, and if that happens, we are going to see what we expect to see when people lose health insurance: [them] not getting care, worse health outcomes and more costs for the state in terms of hospitals paying for care,” Durac said.

Last year the coalition convened a working group to assess the impact of losing the credits and make policy recommendations. A bill – the Rhode Island Individual Marketplace Affordability Act (H7694) – based on the group’s recommendations seeks to plug the hole left by the expiring credits.

Durac explained that the bill would create a 1% assessment put on commercial insurers and other forms of insurance that would help fund ACA plans.

Sen. Pamela Lauria, the bill’s co-sponsor, said the matter was personal to her.

“I have been a primary care nurse practitioner for the last 27 years, which means before the [Affordable Care Act] was passed, and certainly before the enhanced benefits were passed. So I remember what it was to have patients that could not afford health insurance and what that meant to their health outcomes,” Lauria said at an event at the State House last week.

She added that passing the bill was not only the right thing to do but the “economically smart” thing to do, as it would not have an effect on the state budget.

“This needs to be personal for everyone,"" Lauria said. ""We cannot let these people go over this cliff.”","{'href': 'https://www.providencejournal.com', 'title': 'The Providence Journal'}"

As food and medical prices rise, a proposed Grove City grant program would help low-income residents purchase health insurance.

The Grove City CARES Health Care Grant Pilot Program would allow households earning less than $30,000 a year to apply for an annual grant to help them purchase health insurance, allowing some families to purchase coverage for the first time, according to a news release from the city.

Many residents who earn under $30,000 work part-time or low-wage jobs that do not provide health insurance. The grant program, proposed by Grove City Council member Ted Berry, aims to address this issue by creating one of the nation's first municipal health care grant programs to help residents access the care they need, according to program information provided by Berry.

""Health care is essential to all citizens. My hope is that this program, once fully designed, will set the example for all communities to look for ways to assist residents with basic health care needs,"" Berry said in a news release. ""Citizens cannot wait for the debate to continue at the national and state level as they are forced to pack emergency rooms for basic care and go without prescription drugs, dental and mental health care.""

Under the proposal, eligible individuals could get up to $400 annually and families could receive up to $600 for health insurance, according to program information.

The city would allocate $75,000 for the program, but is also accepting contributions from area employers, according to the legislation.

The legislation that would establish the program was introduced at the city council meeting on Monday. Another reading and vote are expected at the March 17 meeting.

A health care focused high school set to open in 2026 in Demopolis has hired a veteran educator for its top leadership role.

James ""Jimmy"" Martin, superintendent of Pell City schools in St. Clair County, will serve as president of the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences.

Martin's appointment was approved Feb. 28 during a meeting of the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences board of trustees.

Martin said he is anticipating the opportunity to make a difference and change lives as president at ASHS. The goal of the school is to solve Alabama's health care staffing shortage by training high school students for careers in the medical field.

“Every person who goes into education wants to make a difference for young people and in their communities,” Martin said in a news release. “The potential for this school to change lives in so many ways is what attracted me to it.”

According to the release, Martin said he views the Alabama School of Healthcare Sciences as a source of hope for youth and that the school has the real ability to make an impact by improving rural health care throughout the state.

Martin also said he welcomes the opportunity to build a school from the ground up and understands the immense work ahead before the first students are welcomed next year.

Mike Warren, president of the ASHS board of trustees, said he is confident that Martin will lead ASHS to success.

“We are delighted to find someone who not only understands the complexity of ASHS, but who is so willing to commit to its development and to attracting the students, faculty and staff who will fulfill its mission from the outset,” Warren said.

Martin has led Pell City Schools for six years. He also served as superintendent of the Harris County and Chattahoochee County school districts in Georgia for 10 years and led those districts to receiving honors for academic achievement. In 2017, he received the Georgia School Superintendents Association President’s Award.

His resume also includes stints as a school improvement specialist, a principal, a teacher and a band director.

Martin earned his bachelor’s degree in music education and a doctorate in educational leadership from Auburn University. He also earned a master of science degree in educational administration from Troy State University.

He was part of the Alabama State Department of Education Superintendents Academy through the University of Alabama from 2003-04.

The Alabama School of Healthcare Science is scheduled to welcome its first freshman class of up to 100 to 110 students in rural Demopolis in the fall of 2026. The school's $80 million campus will include a five-story dormitory, according to a December 2024 story by the Alabama Reflector.

The school will partner with Whitfield Regional Hospital, a member of the UAB Health System, in Demopolis.

The school will be one of 10 health care-focused high schools nationwide funded partially through the Bloomberg Philanthropies and affiliated with established healthcare systems.

Martin said the school will provide an experience students can't get anywhere else in Alabama.

""When you can make education relevant, students will buy in,” he said. “We will be offering something far beyond a traditional high school, and that kind of engagement and the experiences at our school will be what attract and retain students.

""The pathways and curriculum that are being developed right now are what will inspire students and their families to commit, and what will ultimately get the health care pipeline flowing into rural communities in a way that will transform the quality of life,"" Martin said.

ASHS will become the fourth in a network of tuition-free, residential specialty high schools in the Alabama public school system, the release states.

Other schools in that network are:

The MHA received media coverage the week of March 3 on the Michigan Senate passing legislation that protects the 340B program, the potential impact of tariffs on hospitals and healthcare costs, as well as a radio appearance discussing potential federal Medicaid funding cuts.

Michigan Public aired a story March 6 following the broad bi-partisan passage of Senate Bills 94 and 95 by the full chamber. Senate Bill 94 would safeguard the 340B program, ensuring cost savings and preserves access to affordable healthcare services in both urban and rural Michigan communities. Further, this legislation adds first of its kind drug manufacturer transparency requirements, making Michigan’s legislation the strongest in the nation.

Elizabeth Kutter, senior director, government and political affairs, MHA, was interviewed by Michigan Public for the story.

“You have to be an entity that proves their eligibility in the program, which by default means that you are serving patients who are extremely vulnerable,” said Kutter. “You’re serving kids. You’re serving cancer patients. You’re serving people who, if your hospital closes or if healthcare access becomes limited, suddenly you’re seeing a very serious hospital desert for patients.”

Crain’s Detroit Business also published an article March 3 looking at the impact of potential tariffs on a variety of Michigan industries, including healthcare. MHA CEO Brian Peters is quoted in the story addressing the impact to hospitals.

“Implementing tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China without exceptions for medications and medical supplies could jeopardize the availability and further increase the prices of already-expensive vital medications and health care devices Michigan hospitals need to provide appropriate patient care,” said Peters. “Tariffs will particularly exacerbate existing pharmaceutical shortages. China is responsible for providing a significant number of cardiac and oncology drugs, as well as active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to produce prescription drugs domestically. Many healthcare supplies are also produced in China and the United States does not have existing capacity to meet an increased demand for product.”

Peters also appeared on WJR 760AM March 3 to discuss the impact of potential federal Medicaid funding cuts on Michigan hospitals.

the global voice for women's health

On International Women’s Day, female FIGO leaders share their insights on how to close the gender gap in healthcare. Their perspectives highlight key challenges, strategies and actions to build a fairer health system for women worldwide. 

""Strengthening grassroots networks and using technology can bridge healthcare gaps. We must dismantle restrictive norms, amplify women’s voices in decision-making, and ensure women are active stakeholders in healthcare. 

In rural India, we have empowered frontline providers with point-of-care medical devices and teleconsultation platforms, enabling them to reach the last mile. Reproductive health, maternal care and gender-sensitive services must be universally available, free from stigma, economic barriers, and systemic bias. 

When access aligns with rights, and healthcare prioritises gender equity, we can create a future where no woman is left behind. Every girl and woman deserve dignified, barrier-free healthcare."" 

– Dr Hema Divakar, FIGO Division Director of Well Women Health Care 

""Gender equity in healthcare starts with access to family planning. FIGO member societies can lead the way in setting measurable goals to expand access, improve education and eliminate coercion in reproductive choices. By investing in equitable family planning, we empower people to make informed decisions, reduce maternal mortality and advance gender equity globally."" 

–  Dr Aparna Sridhar, Division Director-Elect of Sexual & Reproductive Health and Wellbeing  

""Women’s quality of life is often overlooked. Conditions like menstrual pain, infertility and pain during intercourse are frequently dismissed because they are not life-threatening, yet they have profound socioeconomic impacts. 

A woman’s quality of life should be as valued as quantity of life. 

– Division Director-Elect of Division of Benign Surgery – Dr Megan Wasson 

""Women’s health and wellbeing across their life course is central to our health as a global community. Equal access to free pregnancy care improves outcomes for both mother and baby and must be a priority worldwide. 

Later-life health can be improved by identifying women at risk of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes and offering simple interventions like healthy nutrition, supporting and raising awareness on the benefits of breastfeeding, and regular health checks.  

FIGO has provided some simple clinical practice tools to support women’s health: 

– Professor Fionnuala McAuliffe, FIGO Division Director-Elect of Maternal & Newborn Health 

No to Violence Against Women (VAM) is the motto to accelerate action for gender equity. Partner with men and women to say no To VAW with DHEERA: Courage to say no to VAW. 

Educate boys and girls from an early age towards a gender-neutral world. Participate, preach and propagate gender equity. Say no to VAW.

– Dr S.Shantha Kumari, FIGO Treasurer

Achieving gender equity in healthcare requires systemic change—prioritising access, education, research and investment. By elevating women’s voices, leveraging technology and addressing both reproductive and chronic health challenges, we can create a future where every woman receives the care she deserves—respectful, affordable, accessible and focused on both longevity and quality of life. 

This International Women’s Day, let’s all commit to take meaningful action for gender equity in healthcare. ","{'href': 'https://www.figo.org', 'title': 'International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics'}"

Samsung's digital health armamentarium includes smart TVs, tablets, phones, watches and rings.

Cherry Drulis, Samsung’s director of healthcare mobile B2B sat down with MobiHealthNews at the HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition to discuss the impact of Samsung's digital strategy on hospitals and health systems.  

MobiHealthNews: How are your digital technology tools helping to make healthcare providers' jobs easier and improve patient care?

Cherry Drulis: We look at workflows, leveraging our digital touchpoints along with applications to improve efficiency and eliminate the clunky workstations on wheels, eliminate PCs at point of care and leveraging our mobile devices and being able to interact with EHRs from a mobile device. 

The power of our mobile devices is really impressive, not only from the clinical perspective, but we also put the patient at the center of care, leveraging our digital technology coupled with interactive patient care platforms that truly puts the patient in the center of care allowing them to control their environment using our tablets. 

We also integrate those digital touch points to our television and digital white boards, door signage and kiosks that improve overall efficiency. 

What we talked about at HIMSS [conference] is how we are taking our smart themes that we use in the consumer side connecting to digital devices and taking that into the healthcare system, which allows us to truly connect digital devices into one central location for ease of use and maintenance. 

With that concept, we are now not only able to create what we call a smart patient room, we are able to take that same technology and create it at the hospital level.

We are leveraging sensors and digital devices to improve the overall experience from the time you pull up into our parking lot, having sensors to tell visitors and family members where to park with ease, what parking spots are open now, taking that connected journey into the hospital, allowing recognition when a patient walks into the lobby, self check-in and then navigating that patient to where they go to ease confusion and frustration. 

Also, taking that to the level of ease of use. Let's say we have a clinician that is roaming mobile and needs to set up a conference room and needs to be able to tap into the system and understand exactly what rooms are open and schedule that room on the go.

Even with a family member visiting a patient, the patient goes down to surgery and the family member is hungry. They can order food from the tablet or television and then go down and pick up their food.

MHN: What type of technologies are your hospital customers asking for? What are they telling you they need in order to make things more efficient? 

Drulis: We are showcasing a prototype on smart cart at HIMSS based on the feedback that we got from one of our large health systems, where they wanted to eliminate PCs and create a workplace for clinicians. One of the biggest requests we are getting is how do we make our clinicians more efficient at the point of care. 

MHN: What is on the horizon when it comes to the future of digital technology for healthcare?

Drulis: Where we are seeing the future of care  is really taking what we have from our consumer side, leveraging our devices in the home. We want to connect that patient journey so we can then take all the data we are collecting through our devices couple that with AI and AI platforms that allow clinicians to then have their large language models go through all of that data and turn that data into what are calling smart healthcare data so they can use that data to improve the overall well being of individuals. So, it is really taking healthcare with a consumer commodity and connecting all of those digital devices and improving the overall health of individuals.

Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame Class of 2025

By BILL PLOTT | For the AHSAA

 

     MONTGOMERY – When Robert A. “Drew” Ferguson, 53, died last fall, it ended half a century of a life of service to countless individuals through athletic training.
    He work may have ended but his impact in the field of certified athletic training will continue to live on thanks to his amazing legacy.
    Dr. James B. Robinson, Medical Director for the AHSAA, said, “Drew’s input and leadership throughout the years has improved the healthcare and safety to athletes across Alabama. His firm belief and conviction has made a tremendous difference.”
    Ferguson is one of 12 individuals who will be inducted into the Alabama High School Sports Hall of Fame on Monday, March 10 at the Montgomery Renaissance Hotel and Convention Center. He is  being inducted as a contributor. The banquet will get under way a 6 p.m.
    Feguson grew up in Georgia, attended Clarkston (GA) High School where he graduated in 1969 and the University of Georgia in 1974. He got his start as an athletic trainer with the University of Georgia, receiving a full scholarship and working with Alabama Sports Hall of Fame coach Vince Dooley.
    He came to Birmingham in 1974 to serve as athletic trainer for the Birmingham Americans and Birmingham Vulcans of the World Football League. He remained there the rest of his life.
    Ferguson worked closely with the University of Alabama-Birmingham and Coach Gene Bartow, serving as head athletic trainer for the Blazers’ basketball team. Later, he was athletic trainer for the U.S. Olympic basketball at the U.S. Olympic Training Center.  Like Dooley, Bartow was also enshrined in the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.
     Ferguson said personal health issues influenced his decision to devote his life to sports medicine. As a child he developed kidney issues that limited his ability to excel in sports. Recognizing the difficulties, his father urged him to find other avenues for sports participation. That kidney condition resulted in transplants at UAB Hospital in 1990 and 2003.
     For more than 30 years he was the Birmingham City Schools certified athletic trainer. Former Samford University head athletic trainer Wayne Kendrick recalled:  “When   Drew first came to Birmingham, there were not really any athletic trainers in the area. He was really instrumental in establishing athletic trainers at some of the high schools in the city. Whatever they needed, just about, he would find some way to get it for them so they could have accessible care for each athlete.”
     Joe Davidson, former Samford associate athletic director, said: “He was one of the most selfless people I have ever been around. He would help anyone. If you ever needed something, he would work to make sure you got what you needed. and he did that consistently throughout his life. He always had the athlete in mind. He loved the human environment of sports. Coach Bartow always used a phrase, ‘Find a way to get it done,’ and Drew embodied that in every way.”
     Chris King,  chairman of the Alabama Board of Athletic Trainers, said: “Drew instilled in me that providing athletic health care to school-aged athletes is the top priority, no matter what, and I have carried that since meeting Drew. He has been the driving force for what I do for a living and inspired me in so many ways.”
     Ferguson served as athletic trainer for many notable sports events over the years, including the 2017 U.S. Senior Games, the 2017 Maccabi Games, and the 2022 World Games.
     Ron Ingram, AHSAA director of Communications, had two personal experiences with Drew Ferguson that went far beyond the honors, awards and accolades Ferguson so richly deserved.
     “I first met Drew Ferguson in 1984 at a Carver-Parker football game in Birmingham. When a Carver player came off the field breathing hard but wanting to return to the game. Drew asked the coach (Willie Peake) not to send the player back in the game. After the game, Ferguson drove the boy to the hospital where a severed spleen was diagnosed.  ‘Any other blow to the abdomen could have killed him,’ recalled Ingram. “Coach Peake called me around midnight and said, ‘Drew Ferguson saved our boy’s life. What would we do without Drew.’”
     In 2016, at the state basketball tournament, Ingram’s 38-year-old daughter was selling programs at the state basketball tournament. She had been in a severe car accident the summer before. After numerous surgeries she was still having leg problems. Ingram found her in tears from the pain in her leg. Ferguson examined her condition and told her she needed to go the emergency room immediately. In fact, he drove her there. It was sepsis, and amputation below the knee followed.
   “Drew’s expertise, friendship and kindness saved my daughter’s life,” said Ingram.
     In 1975, Ferguson and Dr. Kurt Niemann founded the Sports Medicine Institute of Alabama, now known as Children’s of Alabama Sports Medicine. He was director of the Alabama Sports Medicine Clinic for more than 30 years.
    He became a key volunteer for the AHSAA state championships including the Super 7 football championships and the Final 56 basketball championships.  He was a member of the AHSAA Medical Advisory Board for 15 years,
     As his career and reputation in athletic training progressed, he was eventually considered to be the state’s most prominent certified athletic trainer. He played a key role in getting the Alabama Athletic Trainers Licensure Act passed in 1993 and the Alabama Concussion Law in 2011. He chaired the Public Policy Committee on the Alabama Concussion Task Force from 2020-24. He was also chair of the Alabama State Bora of Athletic Trainers.
     He was president of the Coach Safely Foundation, a nonprofit organization that seeks to limit youth sports-related injuries.
     Through the support of donations from advocates of youth sports safety, he created the Robert A. Ferguson Endowed Lecture Series. The program enables medicine professionals to share knowledge with healthcare providers and the community on sports safety participation for all ages.
     He was inducted into the Alabama Athletic Trainers’ Association Hall of Fame and the UAB Sports Hall of Fame. He has also been recognized by the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,What is Medicaid and why is it important?,https://news.llu.edu/patient-care/what-medicaid-and-why-it-important,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 17:53:46 GMT","

Medicaid is healthcare protection for many families in the region.

Medicaid plays a crucial role in providing healthcare coverage for individuals who may not otherwise be able to afford it. Funded by the federal government and managed by individual states, the program ensures access to essential health services for millions of Americans, including those in need across the Inland Empire. Chad Vercio, MD, division chief of general pediatrics at Loma Linda University Children’s Health, recently discussed the importance of Medicaid and the impact of any potential cuts to this vital program, particularly for families with children, and pregnant women.

“In our region, a significant portion of children rely on Medicaid,” Vercio explained, “which makes it a cornerstone of healthcare for families in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.”

In the Inland Empire, nearly 50% of children are enrolled in Medicaid, with many of them covered by Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP), the region’s primary Medicaid provider. For children with complex medical needs, who make up a large percentage of the patients we serve, that number jumps to nearly 80% because private insurance often does not cover the extensive, ongoing care these children require. Many families of medically complex children face significant financial burdens due to the high cost of treatments, therapies, and specialized equipment. Additionally, parents may need to reduce work hours or leave jobs entirely to become full-time caregivers, limiting their access to employer-sponsored health plans. These families rely on Medicaid for routine care, specialized treatments, and preventive services, making the program indispensable.

Vercio said cuts to Medicaid funding could have far-reaching consequences on the community and healthcare systems. “The loss of Medicaid funding would make it very difficult to provide the necessary services for children in our region, whether in clinics or within children’s hospitals,” he said. “Many children in our area—particularly those with complex medical conditions—would see a decline in their health outcomes without this crucial support.”

One of the most pressing concerns Vercio mentioned was the potential impact on pregnant women. Without Medicaid coverage, many expectant mothers may not receive the prenatal care necessary for a healthy pregnancy, which could lead to an increase in premature births and associated complications. Premature babies often face a range of health challenges due to their early arrival, further straining healthcare resources.

For children, especially those with complex or chronic health conditions, cuts to Medicaid could lead to delays or discontinuation of critical medical services. This could include access to specialists and treatments that are vital for managing long-term health problems. Without this support, many children in the Inland Empire could see their conditions worsen, resulting in long-term negative health outcomes.

As policymakers continue to make decisions about Medicaid funding, advocates like Vercio stress the stakes couldn’t be higher for the families who rely on the program. With nearly half of local children depending on Medicaid, any changes to the program would not only affect the health of individual families but could also have a broader impact on the health and well-being of the entire region.

For those who depend on Medicaid, the program is not just a safety net—it's a lifeline.

Vercio emphasized the importance of raising awareness about the potential consequences of Medicaid cuts. “It is vital for people to make their voices heard, especially to their elected representatives. These officials are there to represent their constituents, which includes families who rely on Medicaid for healthcare. We need to ensure they understand just how critical this funding is to maternal and children’s healthcare,” he said.

""Department of Veterans Affairs Motto"" by JeffOnWire, licensed under CC BY 2.0.

Another national outage this week has prompted a new focus on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' Electronic Health Records Modernization effort.

WHY IT MATTERS

The Spokane VA Medical Center said it experienced an outage of its Oracle Health EHR system on Tuesday from approximately 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time, which prompted a technical investigation, NBC affiliate KHQ News reported the following day.

Then on Thursday, CNBC reported that the VA confirmed the system outage had disrupted operations at all six VA medical centers, 26 community clinics and remote VA sites running the beleaguered EHR.

According to the original story, EHR users experienced system freezes and could not access vital applications.

Then, the VA reportedly told CNBC that the cause of the outage was a database performance problem, and once the platform was restarted, technical difficulties were resolved. The disruption of the federal EHR system's function also extended to the U.S. Department of Defense, the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

THE LARGER TREND

On December 20, when the VA announced it would begin to plan for resuming EHR deployments in mid-2026, the agency noted that it had been more than 200 days since the last system outage.

Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office said on February 21 that while the VA's EHR Modernization Program had made incremental improvements to the system, much more remained to be done. The GAO said that 1,800 requested configuration changes were still outstanding. 

Then on February 24, Dr. Neil Evans, acting program executive director for the VA's EHR Modernization Integration Office, updated the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Technology Modernization about improvement efforts during the most recent pause on system deployment.

The VA's new EHR rollout has experienced numerous delays since the first component went live at the VA Central Ohio Healthcare System in Columbus, Ohio, in August 2020.

Seema Verma, Oracle Health and Oracle Life Sciences executive vice president, joined Evans to provide lawmakers with an update. She said that during the latest reset period, the company completed more than 3,000 changes that improved system stability, added enhancements and streamlined certain functions. 

Verma also laid out plans to rapidly scale deployment of the EHR at the VA's remaining 164 healthcare facilities.

""Maintaining the current pace will take decades, which is not acceptable to anyone,"" she said.

We have reached out the VA and Oracle for statements about the new outage and will update this story if they are provided.

Nashville-based Wellvana has acquired the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) business of CVS Accountable Care, part of CVS Health, in an all-stock transaction, giving CVS Health a strategic minority investment in Wellvana. 

In addition, Fierce Healthcare reports that CVS Health is shutting down its ACO REACH business, impacting 183 employees  nationwide. With the acquisition, Wellvana says it becomes one of the largest value-based care enablement companies, supporting providers in 40 states and serving approximately 1 million Medicare patients. “Primary care is the engine that reduces cost while improving the health of our communities, and we’re on a mission to make it life-changing,” said Kyle Wailes, Wellvana President and CEO, in a statement. “Our high-touch approach that supports physicians, health systems and payers in value-based care has proven effective. The complementary expertise and scale of CVS Health’s MSSP business supercharges our impact and accelerates our drive to make patients the ultimate beneficiaries of more valuable care.”Wellvana said the acquisition strengthens its capabilities by expanding and diversifying its ACO presence, broadening its affiliated hospital and physician network, and adding colleague talent with deep value-based care experience and technology from CVS Health’s MSSP business.CVS Health stated that it remains committed to value-based care and is advancing ongoing efforts through its owned care delivery assets — Oak Street Health and MinuteClinic — and also through accountable care contracts between Aetna and providers in its network. “We made this decision to further advance MSSP by partnering with a value-based care leader with the right strategic focus and investment commitment in this space,” said Sree Chaguturu, M.D., president of healthcare delivery for CVS Health, in a statement. “We are incredibly proud of our CVS Health colleagues who have supported the MSSP business over the years and are committed to a smooth transition so they can continue their work and maintain services to clients, providers and patients.”Detailed terms of the deal were not disclosed.","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

Alluvium Asset Management, an asset management company, released its “Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund” fourth-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the quarter, The Fund was up 1.3% in EUR terms and 5.4% in AUD terms but down 5.9% in USD terms. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.

In its fourth quarter 2024 investor letter, Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund emphasized stocks such as HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in the third quarter 2024 investor letter. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) owns and operates hospitals and related healthcare entities. The one-month return of HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) was -0.09%, and its shares lost 1.11% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On March 6, 2025, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stock closed at $321.75 per share with a market capitalization of $79.904 billion.

Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

""The appointments of Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have led to mounting concerns that the incoming administration may reduce funding to medical insurers (by allowing enhanced subsidies to expire at the end of 2025). HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), the hospital and ambulatory site owner/operator, is a beneficiary of these subsidies. Whilst there was always the risk that these subsidies would not be extended, the share price fall of 26.0% suggests the market considers it a “fait accompli”. This has a long way to play out. HCA also reported third quarter results that were affected by Hurricane Helene, and acknowledged the effect will continue into the fourth quarter, with additional impact from Hurricane Milton. The share price fell 8.9% on the day and continued to drift lower through the quarter. The earnings hit (in annual EPS terms) is estimated to be less than 5%, and the company reaffirmed its 2024 guidance, albeit at the lower end of the range. It also provided a preliminary outlook for 2025 operational earnings growth to be at the upper end of its long term range (which we consider to be 15%-20%). Through all this, our valuation (which is predicated on our view of long term, through the cycle “owner’s earnings”) has not changed. So, whilst early in the quarter we continued our September selling and reduced the Fund’s position (in total from 9.7% to 8.0%), after the share price fall, we bought, by sheer coincidence, exactly the same number of shares back, but at a 19.2% lower price. The price continued to fall, and we ended the quarter with a 7.4% position.""

Understaffing at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center is spreading staff too thin and hurting patient care and worker well-being, according to 1,000 health care workers and Columbus community members who have put their names to a petition delivered to hospital leadership.

Patient care associates (PCAs)and psychiatric care technicians (PCTs) — who are often the first frontline staff that patients interact with at hospitals — allied in the petition presentation and a demonstration Wednesday to demand improvement to staffing and retention of the university hospital. The workers also provide safety checks, blood drawings, patient hygiene, ultrasounds and more.

""We're used to thinking of OSU as this fantastic state-run institution that, like, is a beacon of health care. In a lot of ways it is, and we wouldn't expect that there would be such a staffing crisis,"" said Dylan England-Caroll, a PCT within the university hospital system. ""I think we do a really good job of making things work, but we don't need to do that. If our staffing crisis wasn't there, we could be making things even better.""

The demonstration, organized by members of the IAM Healthcare Union, follows a similar outcry by the Ohio State University Nurses Organization. The nurses' union held a demonstration Feb. 27, asserting that university hospital executives have repeatedly dismissed their pleas for safer working conditions, putting staff and patient wellbeing at risk, with understaffing contributing to workplace endangerment.

A spokesperson for OSU Wexner Medical Center said that the hospital system recognizes staffing challenges throughout health care, and that it has ""taken steps"" to ""retain, recruit and support"" PCAs and PCTs.

""We are actively engaged in negotiations with the IAM Healthcare Union and look forward to productive discussions that align with our shared goals and best serve our patients,"" the spokesperson said in a release. ""We appreciate our PCA/PCTs dedication and remain committed to collaboration, continuous improvement, and open communication.""

Understaffing leads to burnout of health care workers and a high turnover of employees, according to Medix Staffing Solutions, but patients also bear the weight for things such as compromised safety, a higher likelihood of medical errors and decreased quality in care.

Kelly Williams, a senior patient care associate at OSU Wexner Medical Center's Dodd Hall, said staff ""routinely hears horror stories"" at OSU's hospitals of one PCA per dozen or so patients when there should be one PCA to, at most, six patients.

The first-year turnover rate for PCAs and PCTs at OSU is currently 52% annually, according to numbers the union obtained directly from OSU, and it's a problem health care workers allege OSU has failed to combat.

However, the university said that PCA and PCT turnover overall rates sat under 31% for the 2024 fiscal year, according to OSU. Thus far, those numbers are lower in the current fiscal year and remain under the median turnover rate for Midwest hospitals.

Understaffing at hospitals is far from a new or simply local issue.

By 2028, the United States is expected to have a shortage of around 100,000 critical health care workers, according to a study by Mercer, a global consulting firm. Employment across the health care field remains below pre-pandemic levels, a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis reported.

Baptist Health, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a faith-based, nonprofit health system comprising six hospitals with more than 1,100 beds, a cancer center, four satellite emergency departments, and more than 200 patient access points of care throughout northeast Florida and southeast Georgia.

THE CHALLENGE

""Baptist Health is more than a healthcare provider – we are a foundational part of the communities we serve, meaning we work across organizations to provide optimal care and create a healthier society,"" said Aaron Miri, senior vice president and chief digital and information officer at Baptist Health. ""In addition, Baptist recognizes the shift in patient preferences and expectations, as patients are more willing to switch providers if they don't have experiences that parallel other industries.

""To improve patient care and experience, Baptist works outside of its organization's metaphorical walls, including collaborating with neighboring health systems and various payers,"" he continued.

Baptist wanted to strengthen these collaborations further and create a digital bridge so families needing to transition to Baptist for services would have a seamless experience. They can focus on the wellbeing of their family member in treatment rather than readmission paperwork.

""Separately, as payer contracts evolved, Baptist Health wanted to ensure no patient was left behind, as some primary care physicians would now be considered out of network,"" Miri explained. ""Understanding who was impacted in a short period of time was essential to notify the affected patients, guide them to other options and prevent care interruption.

""Both examples rely on having a complete view of patient and member identities to serve the community better but are hampered by identity data in silos across multiple complex ecosystems that contain inconsistent and/or incomplete data,"" he added. ""Even if two health systems are on a common EHR platform, separate instances mean patient MRNs [medical record numbers] do not align.""

Accurate patient identity is the foundation of virtually everything Baptist does: data sharing, patient care, revenue cycle management and marketing, among other processes, he said.

""Patient data isn't just in EHRs; it's everywhere – and we needed a solution that allows us to access complete patient data at every point, both internally and when we exchange data with other healthcare entities,"" he explained.

PROPOSAL

As a large health system in one of the top four growth markets in the United States, Baptist deals with a constant flow of patient data from multiple sources and expects that to continue to expand exponentially.

""Ninety-nine percent of my team's challenges stemmed from identity, as data exists in various formats, some of it inaccurate and incomplete,"" Miri noted. ""Identity data is the lifeblood throughout our ecosystem, from clinical operations to revenue cycle management to marketing, and we must be able to reconcile patient identities to work safely and efficiently and provide the best possible patient experiences.

""When looking at our identity challenges, we were seeking a single source of truth,"" he continued. ""The vendor we chose was Verato, as they proposed delivering that single source of truth for patient, provider, member and consumer identity with the highest degree of accuracy so we could act confidently.""

Further, the system is malleable enough to adapt to Baptist's ever-evolving use cases as the health system becomes more sophisticated, adds new care settings, and delivers personalized care and experiences to improve outcomes, efficiency and retention, he added.

MEETING THE CHALLENGE

Integrating the Verato master data management system was Miri's team's responsibility, but it is used throughout the health system, from clinical to customer relationship management. The technology has helped Baptist bridge the gap between systems of record, systems of experience and systems of insight to truly know who is who at every touchpoint of the patient's journey, Miri reported.

""In addition to creating identity harmony within our systems, it helped us better serve the community,"" he noted. ""To use the example of digitizing and bridging external referrals, we needed an MDM [master data management] system that would address: obtaining and processing referrals, automated reporting, scheduling and obtaining prior authorization, billing charges reconciliation, and patient access to combined records from both hospitals.

""After studying our systems, the vendor implemented a bidirectional, digital workflow between the two health systems, allowing orders to be sent directly to Baptist, with the results returned electronically to the originating EHR system,"" he continued. ""That eliminated the need for manual patient identity verification and record resolution, allowing treatment to begin sooner.""

In addition to the various clinical workflows that have been strengthened, the new MDM system integrated with Salesforce CRM and several other vendors in medical joint ventures, he added.

""The next frontier with Verato is integrating data within our Employee Hub, including with PeopleSoft and Microsoft Entra, and adding Verato Verify + CLEAR to confirm employee identities during self-service account recovery or calls to the service desk,"" Miri said. ""As healthcare cyberattacks remain at record highs, we need to take advantage of every tool available to keep our systems secure.""

RESULTS

The MDM system has helped Baptist improve operations across the board by letting the health system know who is at every touchpoint. Staff have seen measurable improvements in such areas as closing care gaps, improving HCAPH scores and other quality measures, proactive wellness, patient outreach, and enabling more remote care.

In the use case of resolution for radiology patient referrals, for example, Baptist has experienced:

""We see about 50 cases per day with one of our referring health systems, which extrapolates to more than 18,000 cases per year where care is improved and patients and their families have a better experience,"" Miri reported.

""In the payer example, the quantitative impacts were with patients and time saved,"" he continued. ""Even one lost patient is too many and the team was able to collaborate and leverage the MDM to understand the population impacted in a number of hours, not days or weeks,"" he added.

ADVICE FOR OTHERS

Master data management has advanced greatly in the past few years, and one doesn't want to get trapped with a vendor whose product is a generation or two behind, Miri said.

""I would advise other health systems to do their homework in finding vendors with the most advanced technology that can solve multiple problems, the most flexible technology to expand to your innovative use cases, and the creativity to explore the art of the possible with you,"" he continued.

""In addition, validate that the vendor has earned the necessary security credentials, such as HITRUST,"" he concluded. ""That vendor will help you achieve your goal of understanding identity across the ecosystem of patients, providers and consumers and provide a safer environment.""

As a young boy growing up in Farmington, West Virginia, I became aware of the significant gaps in healthcare access in rural parts of the state. I watched at my family’s clinic, The Manchin Clinic, as it served its community for decades, seeing firsthand Marion, Monongalia and Preston county elderly patients, patients suffering from chronic black lung and other ailments struggle to overcome distance, financial barriers or a shortage of quality healthcare providers.

Manchin

Later in life when I became Superintendent in McDowell County, one of the poorest and most rural counties in the United States, I continued to see the devastating impact that a lack of healthcare had on the overall quality of life of these individuals. It’s this legacy that drives my passion for improving rural healthcare, and it’s why I’m so optimistic about the new initiatives at Glenville State University.

For years, our rural areas have been underserved by the medical community. Many people in small towns across West Virginia struggle to access essential services. That’s why the recent establishment of our Health Sciences programs at Glenville State University represent a beacon of hope for addressing these disparities.

By offering specialized training for students interested in healthcare careers, Glenville State University is taking a significant step toward creating a pipeline of skilled healthcare professionals who are committed to serving in rural communities.

Glenville State’s programs will not only provide students with the education they need to succeed in various healthcare fields—such as nursing, health administration, and clinical practice—but they will also foster a sense of community responsibility.

The programs are designed to address rural healthcare shortages by preparing students to meet the unique needs of patients in less populated regions. For me, this is crucial. If we are able to train students in central WV, there’s a high likelihood that they will stay and practice in this area as a way to give back to their own communities. That is the overall goal of this program.

The programs at Glenville State University are also a direct response to the growing need for a sustainable healthcare workforce. There is a well-documented shortage of healthcare professionals, especially in rural areas. Many practices across West Virginia struggle to recruit and retain healthcare providers.

Glenville State’s initiatives will help cultivate a new generation of health professionals who are ready and eager to fill these gaps. Not only do we continue to grow our programs to expand the educational opportunities for our students, we also have entered into various articulation agreements so they have a pipeline to further their education and establish relationships in the industry.

Our goal isn’t just to provide quality education — it’s also to provide a pathway to success in their chosen field while improving the quality of life of the residents in these rural communities.

Dean of Health Sciences at Glenville State University, Dr. Kevin Evans, is proud of the opportunity to serve not only West Virginia, but also rural communities throughout the Eastern United States. “Developing this essential pipeline of prepared, driven students into strong graduate level programs throughout the East Coast could change the trajectory of medicine in these rural areas” Dr. Evans said. Evans has been an integral part of this process, working with our Provost, Dr. Mari Clements, to develop a challenging program to prepare and inspire Glenville State students to continue their education as seamlessly as possible.

It is a privilege to see how the new programs at Glenville State University are already making a difference, as witnessed by the success of our relationship with Marshal University, graduating nurses with their BSN on the Glenville State campus.

I look forward to seeing the long-term impact they will have on the future of rural healthcare. By training more healthcare professionals locally, Glenville State University is helping to ensure that families in communities like mine and yours will have access to the care they deserve for generations to come.

Dr. Mark Manchin is a 40-plus year education professional and the President of Glenville State University.

Tariffs, or taxes imposed on imported goods, play a significant role in global trade. While they are often implemented to protect domestic industries, they can also lead to unintended consequences, particularly in sectors like healthcare and healthtech.

Given the United States healthcare system's reliance on imported medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and other essential supplies, tariffs can impact costs, accessibility, and innovation.

For a long time, tariffs have been used as an economic tool to control trade, encourage domestic production, and generate government revenue. Historically, tariffs typically have been used to protect local industries from foreign competition; however, they can also lead to trade disputes, retaliatory measures, and increased consumer costs.

In healthcare, tariffs often create challenges by increasing the price of imported medical goods. Since the U.S. imports a large portion of its medical supplies, including medical devices, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic equipment, and surgical instruments, higher tariffs on these goods could translate into increased costs for hospitals, healthcare providers, and ultimately, patients.

Additionally, trade restrictions can cause supply shortages, making essential medical goods harder to obtain during times of crisis, such as pandemics or natural disasters.

The U.S.’s biggest medical supply trading partners are Canada, Mexico, and China. Some of the most significant healthcare-related imports include:

According to trade data, the U.S. spent approximately $146.9 billion on medical supply imports in 2023 alone. For hospitals, imports comprise approximately 10.5% of the budget. The cost of these imports directly affects the pricing of healthcare services, as hospitals and healthcare providers depend on them to deliver patient care efficiently. The complexity of global supply chains means that even minor trade disruptions can lead to significant price fluctuations.

When tariffs are imposed on healthcare and healthtech products, the direct impact is a domino effect throughout the industry:

Now, let’s consider a potential real-world example of how tariffs may trickle down into the market.

Let’s examine how a 20% tariff on PPE imports from China would impact the final cost. Let’s assume an 80% pass-through rate (i.e., the importer pays 16%, and the manufacturer pays the remaining 4%); the manufacturer will likely find ways to maintain its profit through some combination of cost-cutting and productivity-increasing approaches.

The importer, however, is likely to extend its 16% increase in cost directly to its customers. Retailers that resell the PPE will pay 16% more. That means they’ll extend the 16% increase to consumers such that the price of masks, gloves, etc., online or in brick-and-mortar, will now be 16% higher. If there are domestically produced alternatives, those will likely sell faster until those manufacturers decide they can raise their prices to align with the new prices of imports; in other words, we’ll see pricing umbrella effects.

The impacts will be more insidious in healthcare facilities that rely on but don’t resell PPE. These facilities already operate on low margins. To compensate for their 16% increased expenses on PPE, they will have to decrease expenses elsewhere—fewer employees, reduced quality in the cafeteria, etc.— or increase prices where they can— parking hourly rate, etc. Ultimately, patients and providers will pay the 16% indirectly, and both patient and provider satisfaction will decline.

To visualize this example further, let’s do the math. If a box of single-use gloves used to cost $1.00, with the new tariffs, the cost goes up to $1.16. If a hospital uses 200 boxes per day, its spending may increase:

(200×7 x$1.16)-(200x7x$1.00)=$224 per week— let’s call it $1000/month.

And that’s just gloves. Depending on the size of the hospital and the acuity of patients it serves, these numbers could be higher. Imagine now, the difference in cost when it comes to medical devices and medications. As the expenses grow, hospitals won’t be able to absorb the tariffs. Rather, the impact will be measured in jobs… jobs will be cut to maintain operating margins. 

While tariffs are often implemented with the goal of protecting domestic industries, policymakers may consider alternative solutions to prevent negative impacts on healthcare:

Encouraging Domestic Production: Investing in domestic manufacturing for critical medical supplies could reduce dependence on imports and lessen tariff-related cost increases. (While this is ultimately the best long-term solution, it can take time to beef up production to levels where output is able to meet demand.)

Negotiating Trade Agreements: Forming agreements with key trading partners can help ensure the smooth flow of essential medical goods without excessive tariffs.

Tariff Exemptions for Critical Medical Goods: Governments can implement exemptions for healthcare-related imports to ensure accessibility and affordability. (Likely the best short-term solution during negotiations.)

Diversifying Supply Chains: Encouraging healthcare providers and suppliers to diversify their sourcing strategies can mitigate the risks of supply disruptions due to tariffs. (A key example is the mask and PPE shortage experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic. The bulk of these supplies are imported from China. Finding other sources became critical during that time.)

Tariffs on healthcare and healthtech imports can have significant repercussions, affecting everything from the price of medical supplies to patient access to care. While tariffs may aim to boost domestic production, they often result in increased costs and supply chain disruptions.

It's important that policymakers weigh these factors carefully to ensure that tariff policies do not negatively impact the healthcare sector and, ultimately, patient well-being.

Surrounded by representatives from Omnicell and members of the Greater DuBois Chamber of Commerce, Michelle Bennett, Pharm D, BCPS, system director, retail pharmacy, Penn Highlands Healthcare, and Will Chinn, president of Penn Highlands DuBois and Penn Highlands Clearfield (center), hold the scissors to cut the ribbon officially opening the new Penn Highlands Specialty Pharmacy.

DuBOIS — On Wednesday, leaders from Penn Highlands Healthcare joined members of the Greater DuBois Chamber of Commerce to cut the ribbon marking the official opening of Penn Highlands Specialty Pharmacy located at 720 S. Main St. in DuBois.

The event opened with brief remarks from Will Chinn, president of Penn Highlands DuBois and Penn Highlands Clearfield, and Michelle Bennett, Pharm D, BCPS, system director, retail pharmacy, Penn Highlands Healthcare.

Penn Highlands Specialty Pharmacy is a state-licensed pharmacy that provides medications for people with complex medical conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. A specialty pharmacy differs from a retail pharmacy in the following ways:

“By opening this specialty pharmacy, Penn Highlands Healthcare is expanding regional access to a wide variety of medications to treat complex health issues and chronic conditions,” explained Bennett. “We provide local access to these vital medications with faster turnaround times, free delivery and the ability to ship anywhere in Pennsylvania for those without a specialty pharmacy nearby.”

“Penn Highlands Healthcare is deeply committed to providing services that offer our patients a continuum of care,” said Chinn. “Our health system was founded on the principle that we would exist to improve regional access to a wide array of premier primary care and advanced healthcare services — and we are confident that the opening of this specialty pharmacy aligns with our mission.”

Penn Highlands Specialty Pharmacy is open Monday-Friday from 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. The pharmacy can be reached at 814-503-7006.

Members of the community who do not require medications for complex medical conditions should continue to have their prescriptions filled at their current pharmacy. In addition to Penn Highlands Specialty Pharmacy, Penn Highlands Healthcare offers full-service community retail pharmacies serving the communities of Brockway, Brookville, Clarion, DuBois, Kane, Punxsutawney, Reynoldsville, Ridgway, St. Marys, State College, Weedville and surrounding areas.

After yet another record year for health data breaches, updated federal security rules to protect patient information are on the table in 2025. Patients and providers have long complained that HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is ill-suited to protect patients’ sensitive health data in the digital age — and in January, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed updated regulations to protect against the growing threat of cyberattacks.

But in thousands of public comments, health systems and providers have pushed back aggressively against the suggested changes to the security rule. Increased privacy protections, in their view, would impact the financial viability of medical practices — especially small ones — and even timely patient care.

“It’s frankly a blizzard of very technical requirements, which I think would understandably be intimidating and frightening to anything but the largest health care systems,” said David Blumenthal, who was national coordinator for health information technology under the Obama administration, of the proposed HIPAA security rule. “It does raise significant issues about whether small practices and small institutions can effectively protect patient privacy in the new age we’re living in.”

MyVisits.net


Boston, Massachusetts, March  07, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In a major step toward transparency and efficiency in the healthcare and home service industry, MyVisits.net has officially launched its innovative Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) app. Founded by behavioral healthcare veteran Joseph Catan, the platform aims to modernize the way home visits are tracked, verified, and reimbursed.

  

MyVisits

Available now on Apple and Google Play stores, the MyVisits app is designed to help companies and healthcare providers accurately document in-home visits, track mileage, and ensure services are delivered as billed. With a user-friendly interface, automated verification features, and cloud-based convenience, MyVisits is poised to become an essential tool for agencies across the United States and, eventually, the world.

The figures underscore the urgency of a solution like this. An investigation in New York revealed $14.5 billion in unverified Medicaid home care services, which is less than half of the claims submitted, due to a lack of reliable tracking. Without proper visit verification, fraudulent claims and billing errors remain widespread.

Joseph Catan, who spent 15 years running a behavioral healthcare company, has seen these issues firsthand. “When we started, we were told by the practitioners that verifying that staff actually went to a client’s home as scheduled was a major challenge,” Catan recalls. “The existing system was unreliable and easy to manipulate.”

Traditional verification methods, like manual sign-ins and random phone call confirmations, only address a small percentage of visits, leaving the majority unchecked. Compounding the issue, companies are held financially responsible for fraudulent or inaccurate claims, leading to steep fines and compliance risks.

Determined to solve this long-standing problem, Catan developed MyVisits.net: a secure, automated solution that gives verifiable data in real-time, which shows that visits happen as scheduled.

This cloud-based solution utilizes geolocation with its seamless QR code scanning to ensure the authenticity of the records. It also automatically records mileage from practitioners’ departures to patients’ locations, eliminating the need for manual calculations and ensuring accurate reimbursements. Telehealth integration allows practitioners to document telehealth calls, logging start, duration, and end times for billing purposes without disclosing doctor-patient conversations. 

Unlike expensive custom-built software, MyVisits requires no additional hardware, making it accessible for smaller agencies with limited budgets. Catan emphasizes affordability as a key factor, stating, “Small and mid-sized agencies don’t have the resources to develop custom software. We designed the app to be accessible to all providers without the high costs of IT infrastructure.”

The launch of the MyVisits app aligns with the federal mandate for Electronic Visit Verification under the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, which required digital tracking for Medicaid-funded home services. Yet, many agencies have struggled to comply due to the lack of a universal, industry-wide solution. “The MyVisits app provides the scalable, standardized solution the industry has been waiting for,” says Catan.

While the initial rollout is focused on North America, Catan envisions a global expansion. With healthcare systems worldwide facing similar challenges, MyVisits.net has the potential to become the go-to verification tool for home healthcare, behavioral health, nursing, and beyond. “We want to evolve alongside our clients,” Catan states. “As regulations change and industry needs shift, we will adapt. The reason we’re in this situation is because the industry wasn’t agile enough. We’re here to change that.” 

Future updates will incorporate additional features based on user feedback to ensure continuous improvements. Telehealth capabilities, already integrated into the platform, will continue to expand as virtual care becomes more prevalent. “At the end of the day, this isn’t just for compliance; we need to be able to deliver better patient care,” Catan concludes. “When visits are accurately tracked and verified, patients receive the services they need. And that’s what matters most—one verified visit at a time.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,Goldman Sachs Says It’s Time to Pull the Trigger on Healthcare Stocks — Here Are 2 Names to Pounce on Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-says-time-pull-103556095.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:35:56 GMT","

The markets have been volatile recently as economic uncertainty and tariff threats have rattled investors. Yet, despite the concerns, Goldman Sachs’ chief US equity strategist David Kostin sees reason for long-term optimism – and makes some concrete recommendations about where investors should put their funds to cash in.

See what stocks are receiving Strong Buy ratings from top-rated analysts.

Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities with  TipRanks’ Stock Screener.

Simply put, Kostin believes that healthcare stocks are the way to go in 2025. Healthcare makes up more than 17% of the total US economy, and it has a defensive tilt – even if times go sour, healthcare remains in demand. In addition, while healthcare stocks underperformed the S&P in the last two years, the sector is outperforming so far this year.

Summing up the situation and the outlook, Kostin writes, “We maintain our year-end S&P 500 price target of 6500. The equity market’s pricing of the economic growth outlook is now in the ballpark of our economists’ baseline economic growth forecasts, and the S&P 500 P/E of 21.5x is in line with our year-end S&P 500 P/E multiple forecast…”

“Within the equity market, we continue to recommend investors own the Health Care sector, which offers investors a defensive tilt at low valuations,” Kostin went on to add. “Health Care has outperformed the S&P 500 by 7 pp YTD but the median stock still trades at an 18% P/E discount to the S&P 500, nearly the largest valuation discount in recent decades.”

The stock analysts at Goldman are following this line and pulling the trigger on two healthcare stocks in particular. We’ve used the TipRanks database to look up the broader Wall Street view on both, and find out just why they’re compelling buys; here are the details.

Vaxcyte, Inc. (PCVX)

The first Goldman choice is Vaxcyte, a biotech researcher focused on developing new vaccines designed to target difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The company is taking a novel approach to the development of anti-bacterial vaccines by using a combination of ‘advanced chemistry and modern synthetic techniques’ to create a cell-free protein synthesis platform. The goal is to rapidly design and engineer difficult-to-make proteins that can deliver strong immunological benefits – specifically, immune reactions against targeted bacterial infections.

The challenge here is overcoming the natural array of defenses that bacteria have evolved to cope with both immune responses and new drugs. Bacteria have various physical, biochemical, and immunological mechanisms, which they use to counteract natural immune system defenses or antibiotic drug agents; Vaxcyte is working to create new vaccines that act through channels that are novel to the bacterial world.

The company is using a cell-free approach to devise new modes of protein expression, and its proprietary cell-free development platform has allowed the company to design precise, site-specific conjugation agents that preserve essential immune epitopes while attacking bacterial targets. In short, the company is creating bacteria-specific vaccines that cause fewer adverse effects for the patient.

Currently, Vaxcyte has a vaccine candidate under development against four serious bacterial infections: pneumococcal disease, group A strep, periodontitis, and shigella. The latter three of those are serious bacterial diseases with large global health impacts. Group A strep causes approximately 800 million cases of illness worldwide every year; periodontitis causes serious gum and mouth disease and affects approximately 65 million adults in the US alone; and shigella infections result in some 600,000 deaths worldwide every year. Vaxcyte’s research programs on these tracks are currently at the preclinical level.

At the human trial stage, Vaxcyte has two vaccine candidates currently under study in the trial clinic. The more advanced of these candidates, VAX-31, is under study in two clinical lines, for the treatment of pneumococcal disease in adults over age 50 and in infants. The company has successfully completed a Phase 2 study on the adult track and is making preparations to initiate a Phase 3 study of VAX-31 in adults over 50 by the middle of this year. Topline safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data are expected for release during 2026.

On the infant track, Vaxcyte has initiated the second and final stage of a Phase 2 study for VAX-31, based on successful earlier studies. Topline data on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity are expected in mid-2026, to be followed nine months later by data on the booster dose.

The company’s second pneumococcal disease vaccine study focuses on VAX-24, a vaccine under investigation in infants. Vaxcyte’s VAX-24 study is at Phase 2, and the company plans to release the topline data on safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity by the end of the current quarter. Booster data will follow by the end of this year.

These clinical studies don’t come cheap, but Vaxcyte has deep pockets. The company reported having $3.1 billion in cash and other liquid assets as of December 31, 2024.

It’s the combination of the platform tech and the strong potential of VAX-31 that has caught the eye of Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani. He writes of this company, “We view PCVX’s platform technology as differentiated in bacterial infection disease prevention, with promising potential to address large TAM markets with unmet need (e.g. shigella, periodontitis, Strep A), and think VAX-31 is a highly attractive target to large pharmaceutical players with established commercial presence in PCV markets… We see Vaxcyte as being well positioned to succeed in Phase 3 studies and, if approved, become the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) of choice in a category that is expected to produce ~$8bn of annual global sales in 2024, and grow to over $10bn by 2030 – a market that has historically seen the leading vaccine take the bulk of market share.”

These comments support Shibutani’s Buy rating on the stock, while his $138 price target implies a one-year gain of 87% for the shares. (To watch Shibutani’s track record, click here)

PCVX stock has 7 recent analyst reviews on record, and they are all positive – for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is priced at $73.89, and its $149.43 average price target suggests an upside this year of 102%. (See PCVX stock forecast)

Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL)

Goldman’s next pick is Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company zeroing in on NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) – a progressive liver disease with serious consequences. NASH triggers fat buildup, inflammation, and cellular damage in the liver, potentially leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, or even cancer. Often linked to diabetes, this condition poses a growing health challenge, making Madrigal’s focus all the more critical.

We should note that Madrigal is a biotech company that has hit the jackpot – in March of last year, the company received FDA approval to market Rezdiffra, or resmetirom, as an orally dosed tablet to treat NASH. This is an important advance for both doctors and patients, as Rezdiffra is the first approved medication for NASH that does not require a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis before prescribing.

Getting an approved medication onto the market is the end goal of every research-oriented biopharmaceutical company, as it can mean the difference between long-term success and instant failure. Madrigal launched Rezdiffra in April of last year, following the FDA approval, and has seen revenues increase with each quarter since. In the last reported financial results, for 4Q24 and the full-year 2024, the company reported Rezdiffra sales of $103.3 million for the quarter and $180.1 million for the year. By the end of 2024, the company was able to report that there were more than 11,800 patients currently taking Rezdiffra by prescription.

In addition to the successful launch of its first approved drug, Madrigal was able to finish 2024 with a solid piece of good news from the clinical trial front. The company reported positive two-year data from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 3 safety trial that was designed and conducted specifically to support the regulatory approval of Rezdiffra. The data showed a statistically significant reduction in liver stiffness, an important indicator of reduced progression to the end stages of liver disease, as well as a reiteration of the drug’s acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

The new drug launch is the cornerstone of Andrea Newkirk’s write-up on Madrigal for Goldman. The biotech expert says of the company and the success of its first new drug, “Through the first nine months of launch, Rezdiffra continues tracking well against top-tier specialty drug launches, which we expect to drive upwards earnings revision throughout 2025. Importantly, now almost one year since approval, MDGL’s growing foothold in the commercial NASH market reflects success in establishing a pathway (from education to treatment to access) and positions Rezdiffra favorably in the face of an evolving competitive landscape, particularly on the back of growing evidence of Rezdiffra’s therapeutic benefit in F4 cirrhotic NASH patients, which bodes well ahead of the MAESTRO-NASH Outcomes data in 2027. Net, we see MDGL as poised for one of the most successful early launch stories this year and reiterate our Buy rating.”

Along with that Buy rating, Newkirk sets a $539 price target, pointing to a one-year gain of 55%.

Overall, this stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 15 recent analyst reviews that include 14 to Buy against 1 to Sell. The shares are priced at $347.28, and the $413.27 average price target suggests a one-year upside potential of 19%. (See MDGL stock forecast)

Evers Delivers Radio Address Highlighting Plan To Crack Down On Health Insurance Companies, Lower Out-Of-Pocket Healthcare Costs For Wisconsinites",https://drydenwire.com/news/gov-evers-delivers-radio-address-highlighting-plan-to-crack-down-on-health-insurance-companies-lower-out-of-pocket-healthcare/,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:28:05 GMT","

MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers delivered his weekly radio address highlighting plans from his 2025-27 Executive Budget to crack down on insurance companies and prescription price gouging, lower out-of-pocket healthcare costs, reduce appointment wait times, and enable Wisconsinites to get healthcare closer to home, and expand access to affordable healthcare statewide, including in rural communities.

During his 2025-27 Biennial Budget Message, Gov. Evers announced several key initiatives to:

As part of Gov. Evers’ comprehensive plan to lower costs for working families, he is also proposing to eliminate the sales tax on over-the-counter medications, which would save Wisconsinites a projected $70 million over the next two years. Additional information on Gov. Evers’s plan to address the frustrating challenges Wisconsinites face with sweeping changes to the healthcare industry in Wisconsin is available here.

Audio File of Radio Address.

Hey there, Wisconsin! Governor Tony Evers here.

A key part of my plan to lower costs for working families includes making it easier for folks to get the healthcare they need without breaking the bank.

It’s why I’m again proposing to expand BadgerCare, which would save Wisconsin taxpayers nearly $2 billion over the next two years and expand quality, affordable healthcare coverage for about 100,000 Wisconsinites.

I’m also proposing sweeping plans to lower costs for prescriptions and medication and crack down on price gouging and health insurers.

My “Less for Rx” plan will lower costs for life-saving prescription drugs and insulin, including capping insulin copays at $35 and eliminating the sales tax on over-the-counter medications to save Wisconsinites $70 million over the next two years alone.

And I hear from folks all the time who feel like they’re getting ripped off by the healthcare industry and insurers. Wisconsinites aren’t getting a fair shake when it comes to healthcare, and I want to change that.

So, first things first: I want to make Wisconsin the first state in America to start auditing insurance companies over denying healthcare claims.

If an insurance company is going to deny your healthcare claim, they should have a darn good reason for it. So, under my plan, if an insurance company is denying Wisconsinites’ claims too often, we’re going to audit them. Pretty simple.

And here’s what else my plan would do: we’d create a new office to help Wisconsinites whose health insurance claims are denied, and we’re going to create new standards to expand the healthcare services and procedures that insurance companies are required to cover.

That means more healthcare services and procedures will be covered by your insurance automatically—no delays, no hassle, no questions asked.

And we’re working to make sure Wisconsinites know what you’re getting when you buy your insurance plan, to reduce wait times, and to make sure covered care is close to home, and so much more.

Folks, healthcare should not be a privilege afforded by only the healthy and the wealthy. Wisconsinites should be able to get the healthcare they need when they need it.

So, let’s make this a priority this session. Thank you.

Robert Kennedy Jr., in an interview with Fox’s Dr. Marc Siegel, is promising not only to Make America Healthy Again but to also improve the U.S. healthcare system and pharmaceutical innovations.

Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argued the United States has one of the worst health outcomes among other peer nations despite consumers paying substantially more for care. 

""We spend two to three times what other countries pay for public health, and we have the worst outcomes and that's not acceptable,"" RFK Jr. said during an interview with Fox’s Dr. Marc Siegel. 

He touted that in four years the country will be ""even more the center of innovation around the globe"" when it comes to developing drugs and certain therapies for patients.  

AMERICANS' INSURANCE RATES ARE SOARING AND LAWSUITS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE

In its Mirror 2024 study, the Commonwealth Fund compared the performance of health systems in 10 countries, including the United States. Its findings ranked the U.S. last, trailing behind Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK, in terms of health outcomes.

It was the Commonwealth Fund’s eighth report, which aimed to highlight lessons from the experiences of these nations, with special attention to how they might inform health system improvement in the U.S. 

According to the report, the differences between the other countries were ""relatively small."" Comparatively, the U.S. was described as being in ""a class by itself in the underperformance of its healthcare sector"" given that the other nine countries ""found a way to meet their residents’ most basic health care needs, including universal coverage,"" the report read. 

The Peterson Foundation reported that wealthier countries will spend more on healthcare than countries that are less affluent. That said, the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per capita on healthcare compared to similarly large and wealthy nations and yet, its health outcomes are not any better than those in other developed countries, according to the foundation.

SOCIAL MEDIA USERS MOCK UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO’S MURDER

""The United States actually performs worse in some common health metrics like life expectancy, infant mortality, unmanaged diabetes, and safety during childbirth,"" August 2024 Peterson Foundation report read. 

The U.S. has also seen worsening measures of health outcomes since the COVID-19 pandemic too. 

According to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, life expectancy was similar in the U.S. and peer countries on average in 1980 at about 73.7 and 74.6 years, respectively. However, peer nations saw more rapid improvement in life expectancy in the following decades. The gap between the U.S. and peer nations grew even more during the pandemic. In 2022, life expectancy in the U.S. 77.5 years, while the life expectancy in comparable countries was 82.2 years on average. 

There has been growing animosity against the U.S. healthcare system as consumers lambast companies for putting profits above human lives.

The entire insurance industry in particular has faced an onslaught of public scrutiny over its denials of care even before UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thomposon was gunned down outside a New York City hotel in December in what police have called a ""pre-meditated, targeted attack.""

For instance, a Senate subcommittee accused UnitedHealthcare Group last fall of denying claims to a growing number of patients as it tried to leverage artificial intelligence to automate the process. 

The report claimed that UnitedHealthcare’s prior authorization denial rate for post-acute care jumped from 10.9% in 2020 to 22.7% in 2022. 

United refuted these claims, saying the report ""mischaracterizes the Medicare Advantage program and our clinical practices.""

TOPICS:

The department of veterans affairs announced this week that they plan on cutting 80,000 jobs, as part of the Trump Administration's DOGE initiative. 

Iowa's News Now stopped in to the Freedom Foundation in Cedar Rapids, which serves hundreds of our veterans every week with a food pantry and other resources,  to hear what they have to say about the news.

Vice President Roger Jensen says he is not worried just yet. He says he's confident the Trump Administration is doing what they can by cutting access spending, but there is one fear he has and that's the medical needs of the veterans he serves.  

""I don't believe that those cuts will involve doctors, nurses, people that are necessary, as far as the health care. If it started cutting health care, were in big trouble because they're already short on doctors. I don't think it'll go so far to affect us that bad. I really don't. I'm confident in what he's doing,"" said Jensen.

The health care executive left Mary's Center last year.

Dr. Tollie Elliott, the former CEO of Mary's Center, is the new president at the expanding District Healthcare Services LLC in D.C., he posted on LinkedIn Thursday.

Tollie joins DHCS as its prepares to expand to a second clinic at 1800 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., a building known as Anacostia Gateway. The company also operates a clinic at 1445 Howard Road SE.

DHCS, which was founded by CEO Dr. Habib Shamte in 2018 and began services in 2019, serves Medicare and Medicaid patients with an aim to provide holistic care, including human, medical, behavioral and spiritual health needs, according to its website.

Shamte said Elliott will spearhead the clinical team with the goal of improving the clinic's efficiencies. The president position is a new role at the for-profit company, which has 400 employees.

He said DHCS is going through the certificate-of-need process to merge with Medical Home Development Group Inc. It also will begin using the Epic Systems Corp.'s medical record system next month.

In September, Mary's Center announced Elliott was resigning after eights years, including nearly three as CEO, with the D.C. nonprofit community health provider. He previously held the role of chief medical officer.

Elliott sued Mary's Center in December alleging the clinic breached his contract by terminating his employment without notice, defamed him and violated a handful of D.C. laws. He is seeking damages of at least $10 million, as well back pay, front pay, other bonuses and attorneys’ fees. The clinic called the allegations meritless; the case is pending.

Rep. Diana Harshbarger

Washington, D.C. — Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger (TN-01) is reintroducing the bipartisan Rural Physician Workforce Production Act alongside Representatives Kim Schrier (D-WA) and Don Bacon (R-NE), to bring more doctors to rural areas.

One of the key indicators of where a doctor will practice is the location of their residency, but some rural hospitals cannot afford to take on new residents, despite the need. The Rural Physician Workforce Production Act addresses the unequal distribution of physicians in rural and underserved communities across the country stemming from the current structure of Medicare-funded graduate medical education (GME).

This legislation accomplishes the following:

Lifting the current caps on Medicare GME reimbursement payments to rural hospitals that cover the cost of taking on residents;

Allowing Medicare to reimburse urban hospitals that send residents to train at rural health care facilities during a resident rotation;

Establishing a per-resident payment initiative to ensure rural hospitals have the resources to bring on additional residents.

Rep. Harshbarger issued the following statement.

""I've been a pharmacist for over 30 years in East Tennessee, serving residents who live and work in rural America, so I have a deep understanding of their needs. The healthcare needs of folks living in rural areas are just as severe as those living in urban areas, but due to a lack of physicians they often aren't met as urgently as necessary. The lack of physicians in communities like mine leaves a void in access to vital care that my legislation fills.""

Country music legend Dolly Parton discusses her faith, family and music on America Reports.

Dolly Parton and Carl Dean had one of the entertainment industry's most enduring marriages, but very little is known about the country music legend's late husband. 

Despite being married to the internationally famous singer for almost 60 years, Dean, who died on March 3 at the age of 82, was a very private man who steered clear of the spotlight and was rarely seen in public. 

He's being remembered by Parton in a new song she promoted on social media called ""If You Hadn't Been There.""

""I fell in love with Carl Dean when I was 18 years old,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""We have spent 60 precious and meaningful years together. Like all great love stories, they never end. They live on in memory and song. He will always be the star of my life story, and I dedicate this song to him.""

The emotional song features lyrics like ""If you hadn't been there, where would I be / Without your trust, love and belief / The ups and downs we've always shared / And I wouldn't be here if you hadn't been there.""

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

Few of Parton's friends ever met Dean, and he avoided accompanying his wife to public events, leading to persistent rumors that he didn't actually exist.

However, in 1977, country music journalist Alanna Nash was ""flabbergasted"" when she received a rare invitation to join Parton at the Nashville house she shared with Dean for an interview for the May 1977 issue of Country Music magazine.

In a new essay for Variety, Nash detailed her two-day visit, offering a glimpse into the couple's home life and recalling her encounters with the ""delightfully unusual"" Dean.

Nash wrote that the interview took place in the living room of the Tudor-style home where Parton and Dean were living temporarily. The journalist described the room as decorated with Victorian furnishings, oil paintings of herself and Dean as children and ""butterflies everywhere"" — many of which she noted were mementos from fans.

Before the interview began, Parton asked Nash if she wanted to listen to the ""Jolene"" singer's album ""New Harvest… First Gathering,"" which had yet to be released at the time. After playing the first side of the record, Parton asked if Nash wanted to hear the second side. After Nash agreed, Parton told her, ""Well, before that,"" she said, ""Carl is here — he’s working outside — and I want him to come in and fix the fire. But he doesn’t want to hear my record, so we’ll have to wait.""

Nash recalled that Dean was initially reluctant to join the two, writing that she overheard him tell Parton ""I don’t want to do no interviews."" After being reassured by Parton, Dean entered the living room and Nash caught her first glimpse of the singer's elusive spouse. Nash described him as appearing ""shy and uncomfortable in the presence of a stranger.""

""He loves me good and all, but I’m really not his favorite singer.""

However, she noted that Dean was ""friendly and polite"" when he was introduced to her. As Dean tended to the fire, Nash observed that he was ""ruggedly handsome"" and ""looked at his wife as if she were the only woman in the world.""

As their interview continued, Parton invited Nash to stay for dinner and try some of her ""world-famous spaghetti,"" saying she would tell Dean that Nash was a ""friend.""  Nash noted that the invite was a rarity since the couple ""rarely socialized and never entertained."" 

In Nash's essay, she recalled that Dean excused himself from joining them for dinner since he had a cold. However, he continued to return to the living room from time to time to fix the fire as Parton and Nash talked late into the evening. 

Nash remembered she was apprehensive that she might be intruding on the couple's private time, but the feeling began to dissipate as the night progressed.

""If I felt I were trespassing, the feeling faded as Carl reappeared several times, usually to bring Dolly and me something to drink as we taped late into the evening. ‘Y’all growin’ roots?’"" he asked at midnight, Nash wrote. 

She continued, ""With each successive visit, he was more at ease, more likable and charming. At one point, he asked me if I’d gone to school for journalism. I told him I had, in New York City. He then, in an offhand way, began asking me about New York politicians. I wasn’t sure whether he was just making conversation, testing me, or pulling my leg, which I’d heard he liked to do.""

After Dean's final visit of the night, Parton began to play the second side of ""New Harvest… First Gathering"" and explained why she waited until her husband was out of earshot.

""He just doesn’t want to hear the record, because we’re both so emotional,"" she told Nash. ""He’ll put it on and listen to it sometime when he’s here by himself, and if he likes it, he’ll tell me it’s pretty good. I bought him a video tape recorder, and he tapes me every time I’m on TV, but he won’t watch it unless he hears I done good.""

""You know, he loves me good and all, but I’m really not his favorite singer,"" Nash recalled Parton saying with ""a little girl’s smile and giggle.""

""We have a great relationship and he’s a wonderful person, but he’s not my biggest fan,"" Parton added. ""He likes bluegrass and hard rock music.""

Parton also addressed the speculation that Dean didn't exist, and she had made him up to ward off admirers. 

""I know that’s a big rumor,"" she told Nash. ""He’s a real mystery person to the public. That’s good, though.""

""I mean, that’s fine with us, fine with him,"" Parton clarified. ""My career being separate from my marriage is perfectly natural for us. We like it that way. It’s too right and too natural and too comfortable and too secure for it to ever be anything else.""

The couple was married for almost 60 years. (Dolly Parton Instagram)

Parton first met Dean at a laundromat in Nashville when she was 18 and he was 21. Two years later, the couple married in 1966 during a ceremony that was only attended by her mother, Avie Lee, the preacher and the preacher's wife. 

During his lifetime, Dean rarely gave interviews. However, in 2016, he spoke lovingly of Parton while the couple were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.

""My first thought was, 'I'm going to marry that girl,'"" Dean told Entertainment Tonight about meeting Parton for the first time. ""My second thought was, 'Lord, she’s good-looking.' And that was the day my life began. I wouldn't trade the last 50 years for nothing on this Earth.""

Over the years, Parton provided glimpses into their lives during interviews and has occasionally shared throwback photos of herself with Dean on social media. In 2021, she shared a throwback snap of the two, writing, ""Find you a partner who will support you like my Carl Dean does!""

On Valentine's Day in 2022, the 10-time Grammy Award winner marked the occasion by posting an image of herself with her longtime love. She captioned the photo, ""Happy Valentine’s Day y’all! Remember to squeeze your loved ones a little tighter today and tell them you love ‘em!""

Parton announced Dean's death in a heartfelt statement that she shared on Instagram on March 3. 

""Carl and I spent many wonderful years together,"" the ""9 to 5"" singer wrote. ""Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.""

On Thursday, Parton expressed her gratitude for the love and support that she had received following Dean's passing.

It seems as if Rebecca Gayheart has had a change of heart when it comes to her marriage to Eric Dane — she has filed to dismiss the divorce she filed for seven years ago.

The Jawbreaker actress, 53, has filed paperwork to dismiss the divorce petition, according to court documents obtained by TMZ, published on Friday, March 7. Gayheart — who shares daughters Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13, with Dane — was married to the Grey's Anatomy star for 14 years when she filed for divorce in February 2018.

At the time of their split, Dane, now 52, told People that he and Gayheart ""have decided that ending our marriage is the best decision for our family,"" adding: ""We will continue our friendship and work as a team to co-parent our two beautiful girls as they are the most important thing in the world to us.""

In the years since, the actors have frequently sparked reconciliation rumors due to their close co-parenting relationship — and how they've cozied up together. In January 2023, Gayheart and Dane were spotted holding hands together while on vacation with their kids in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Just several months earlier, in August 2022, the Scream 2 star posted an Instagram slideshow of her and Dane's European vacation with their teen daughters.

A post shared by instagram

Co-parenting their children, however, didn't always come naturally to Gayheart and the Euphoria star — in fact, the actress admitted it was quite difficult at the beginning.

""We're doing our best. It isn't easy. But we are trying and we are committed,"" she told Us Weekly in October 2018. At the time, she also explained that she wanted to set an example for her daughters as a working single mother.

""I think that as a female you need to be able to always take care of yourself and never depend on a man,"" she told the outlet. ""I'm going back to work and I think it's partly because I want my daughters to see me work. I took some time off to have my kids.""

Gayheart added: ""A lot of little girls watch [movies] and they start fantasizing about Prince Charming [saving them]. I think that's a message that's very old-fashioned.""

Taylor Swift fans are convinced that the pop star may have secretly contributed to Lady Gaga's new track, ""How Bad Do U Want Me.""

The track was featured on Gaga's new album MAYHEM, which was released on Friday, March 7. Despite Swift not being officially credited on the song, many of her fans are convinced they hear her distinct background vocals, sparking a wave of theories online.

""This song is so Taylor coded,"" said one user on X (formerly Twitter).

Another person pointed out, ""this can be true... remember when both (taylor and gaga) [were seen] getting out of the same studio back in 2023?""

A third noted, ""This just sounds like a Taylor song but I don't think it's her I don't think they'd collab.""

""I don't believe the vocal part but I always think every time I play the song that the intro sounds like the intro to gorgeous,"" a fourth explained.

Though the two iconic pop stars have never worked together, they have shown mutual admiration. In a Vogue interview last year, Gaga, 38, expressed her support for Swift, 35, and other rising stars. ""I watch it all, and I'm like, 'Yup. Go! Just go,'"" Gaga shared. ""I'm not only cheering them on, I want them to know that my heart is in it with them. I want them all to feel really happy.""

Swift has recently shown her support for Gaga as well, defending her from pregnancy rumors in July 2024 with Swift calling comments about the ""Bad Romance"" singer ""invasive & irresponsible"" on TikTok.

For Gaga's new album, she sported a different look, straying from her typical platinum blonde locks. Back in January the pop star posted a teaser for MAYHEM, debuting a much shorter and darker hairstyle, pairing it with some bright red lipstick and dramatic eye makeup. The album can be streamed on platforms like Apple Music and Spotify.

Fatma Begum, born in 1892 into an Urdu-speaking Muslim family in India, holds the title of India’s first female film director. A pioneering figure in a male-dominated industry, her career not only defied gender norms but also helped shape the future of Indian cinema. Her resilience, creativity, and vision paved the way for women in filmmaking during a time when they were often marginalized.

Fatma Begum developed a passion for the arts early in life, performing in Urdu theatre as a youth. Though rumors circulated that she was married to Nawab Sidi Ibrahim Muhammad Yakut Khan III, a prominent figure in India’s royal circles, no legal records of their marriage exist. None of her daughters were recognized as his, adding an air of mystery to her personal life. Despite societal expectations that acting was an unsuitable career for women, Fatma pursued her passion for theater and filmmaking with determination, challenging conventional gender roles.

Fatma Begum made her film debut in 1922 at the age of 30 in the silent film Veer Abhimanyu (The Brave Abhimanyu), directed by Ardeshir Irani. In a time when the Indian film industry was predominantly male, with female roles often portrayed by men, Fatma boldly carved out her space. She went on to star in films such as Sati Sardaba, Prithi Vallabh, Kala Nag (Black Cobra), and Gul-e-Bakavali (A Nocturnal Flower) in 1924, solidifying her position in the industry.

In 1926, Fatma Begum became the first woman in India to establish her own production company, Fatima Films, which was later renamed Victoria-Fatma Films in 1928. As a producer, screenwriter, and actress, she created a platform for women’s voices in cinema. Her directorial debut, Bulbul-e-Paristan (Nightingale of Fantasyland), a fantasy film, was a major success but unfortunately no prints of it have survived. Despite this, it sparked a wave of fantasy films in Indian cinema.

Fatma’s contributions to Indian cinema were groundbreaking. She created leading roles for women, who were seldom in the spotlight at the time. Notable films she directed include Goddess of Love (1927) and Shakuntala (1929). Her studio, however, faced legal troubles in 1929, marking the end of its journey. Though many of her films have been lost, her legacy as a trailblazer for women filmmakers endures. Her daughter, Zubeida, went on to star in India’s first talking film, Alam Ara (1931), continuing Fatma’s trailblazing legacy.

Fatma Begum passed away in 1983 at the age of 91, leaving a lasting mark on Indian cinema and inspiring future generations of women filmmakers.

Michael Polansky's proposal to Lady Gaga directly inspired one of the songs on her new album, Mayhem, which was released today! 

The ""Bad Romance"" songstress told E!News that track 11, ""Blade of Grass,"" is a nod to a very real moment she experienced with her fiancé ahead of their engagement. Before Polansky asked Gaga to be his wife, the ""Born This Way"" icon told him to wrap a blade of grass around her finger. 

""He said to me, 'If I ever proposed to you, how do I do that? And I said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the backyard and wrap it around my finger.' And he did. He did that when he proposed.""

The adorable duo co-wrote the song together, with the chorus capturing the intimate nature of the proposal and the blade of grass serving as a symbol of their lasting union.

As for the writing process, the star referred to creating melodic magic with Polansky as ""a totally different experience"" than what she's used to. Gaga also hopes to explain the meaning behind the special track to their children one day. 

""That song gets to last forever and, hopefully, one day our kids will hear it,"" and when they do, the standout will say, ""'It's so special. That's about your dad.'""

Sonu Sood's action-thriller Fateh, which marked his directorial debut, has now arrived on an OTT platform after its theatrical release in January. The film, starring Jacqueline Fernandez alongside Sood, revolves around a former special agent who embarks on a dangerous mission to dismantle a cybercrime syndicate while searching for a missing girl.

The film follows the journey of a former Special Operations officer who has left his past behind and settled into a quiet life in Punjab, overseeing dairy farming. His life takes a turn when a young girl from a rural area falls prey to a cybercrime syndicate. Unable to ignore the injustice, he returns to action, taking on the criminal network. Jacqueline Fernandez plays a key role in assisting him in his fight.

The scheme will also see more than 320 eligible players get access to grants for fertility treatment - while those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption will be offered two months of paid leave.

Friday 7 March 2025 12:18, UK

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) is to provide up to 12 months of paid maternity leave to players who become pregnant.

The package is financed by the association's global partner, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).

The WTA said it was the first time a comprehensive package of maternity benefits had been made available to independent, self-employed athletes.

As well as the financial support, it will give more than 320 eligible players access to grants for fertility treatment.

Those who become parents via partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption can get two months of paid leave.

The WTA said it was ""the first time in women's sports history that comprehensive maternity benefits are available to independent, self-employed athletes"".

""Independent contractors and self-employed individuals don't typically have these kinds of maternity benefits provided and available to them. They have to go out and sort of figure out those benefits for themselves,"" said WTA chief Portia Archer.

""This is really sort of novel and groundbreaking.""

Saudi Arabia has invested billions of pounds in sport across the world through its Public Investment Fund, which critics have argued is a part of an attempt to sanitise its image and distract from its human rights record.

The kingdom claims the investments have boosted its gross domestic product (GDP).

Victoria Azarenka, the former world number one who sits on the WTA Players' Council and has an eight-year-old son, said: ""I'm honoured to introduce this programme, driven by players, and made possible with the support of PIF and the WTA.

""This marks the beginning of a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis, making it easier for athletes to pursue both their careers and their aspirations of starting a family.

""Ensuring that programmes like this exist has been a personal mission of mine, and I'm excited to see the lasting impact it will have for generations to come.""

Azarenka is one of several players who have returned to the tour after having children.

Belinda Bencic and Petra Kvitova are the most recent new mothers to resume their careers.

Indian Wells Open organisers suspended all matches on Thursday night due to adverse weather conditions. Two men's and three women's matches were rained off, and it was announced just after 10pm in California that they would be phased into Friday's schedule. A statement, released via the official BNP Paribas Open X account, read: ""Play has been suspended for the night due to rain. All matches still on court will be moved to Friday's Order of Play.""

Action was initially stopped for around 15 minutes at 8.20pm, and then again at 8.45pm, which forced players back to the locker rooms. When the call was made, Quentis Halys was one set up and cruising to victory over Pablo Carreno Busta in the second. The Frenchman will hope to retain his momentum once play resumes. Meanwhile in Stadium 2, Mariano Navone led American teenager Learner Tien 7-5 2-3.

Julia Grabher was a set up against Iva Jovic in Stadium 3, while matches between Lauren Davis and Elina Avanesyan, and Alycia Parks and Anna Kalinskaya, were in their early stages in Stadiums 4 and 1 respectively.

Organisers of the BNP Paribas Open have now released an updated Order of Play for Friday, with the five halted matches scheduled to take place after the opening 11am contests on each of the first five courts. Californian sunshine is forecast for Friday, and conditions are expected to heat up over the weekend.

The same could be true of the action on court. In the men's draw, the likes of Alexander Zverev, Cameron Norrie, Casper Ruud and Stefanos Tsitsipas are scheduled to begin their tournament today (Friday) before Novak Djokovic, Jack Draper, Carlos Alcaraz and Joao Fonseca appear on Saturday.

On the women's side of the draw, Iga Swiatek, Katie Boulter and Jessica Pegula are pencilled in for Friday before Mirra Andreeva, Madison Keys, Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenkaturn out at the weekend.

""I'm okay to lose a match,"" said Kyrgios. ""I've lost matches in my career many times. I guess it's just the amount of work I put in and I'm still having so much discomfort in my wrist. That's I guess why I got a bit emotional in the end because it's one of my favorite tournaments.""

Novak Djokovic is searching for a record sixth title at Indian Wells, having enjoyed real success in California during his career.

The Serbian ATP star has traveled to the United States searching for a first tour-level title of 2025, after suffering a shock defeat recently.

Djokovic lost to Italy’s Matteo Berrettini in his opening match at the Qatar Open, 6-7, 2-6, in just his third tournament appearance of the season.

At the Australian Open, Djokovic retired with an injury during his semi-final match with world number two Alexander Zverev, having pulled off an impressive victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round.

Now fully fit, Djokovic will work alongside Andy Murray in California, as the Grand Slam-winning pairing looks to return to form at Indian Wells.

Ahead of his opening match against Botic van de Zandschulp, Djokovic has received a significant confidence boost after beating a former world number three in a practice set.

Looking to get some good practice in, Djokovic took on world number 15 Grigor Dimitrov in a practice set.

Dimitrov and Djokovic held serve initially, before the 37-year-old broke when a backhand from the Bulgarian went long at 30-40, in the third game.

An error from Dimitrov in his next service game handed Djokovic a double break, as he stormed into a 4-1 lead.

Djokovic held his serve before two double faults from Dimitrov in his final service game saw the Serb take the set 6-1.

The world number seven’s level looked strong, as he thoroughly outplayed the 2017 ATP Finals champion.

Only time will tell if Djokovic can maintain his level when he takes on Van de Zandschulp in the Indian Wells second round on Saturday, March 8.

The 33-year-old enjoyed a strong season in 2024, as Dimitrov won his first ATP title in seven years at the Brisbane International, finishing the year ranked inside the world’s top ten.

The Bulgarian returned to the event this year looking to defend his title but was unable to do so, as he retired during the second set of his semi-final match with Jiri Lehecka.

Dimitrov has struggled for form since, losing his last three matches on the ATP Tour, as his injury issues persist.

Currently ranked 15th in the world, Dimitrov could potentially fall outside of the world’s top 20 upon the conclusion of this year’s ‘Sunshine Double’, thanks to his performances at the events in 2024.

Dimitrov reached the final of the Miami Open last year, losing out to Jannik Sinner in straight sets, 3-6, 1-6.

He is set to begin his Indian Wells campaign against Portugal’s Nuno Borges, who won their only previous meeting at last year’s Australian Open.

If he were to advance past Borges, he’d face a tough challenge against either Gael Monfils or Sebastian Korda in the third round.

Winning back-to-back matches for just the second time this season would likely set up a mouth-watering last-16 clash with two-time defending champion Alcaraz.

Dimitrov won’t want to get too far ahead of himself, however, as he first sets his sights on Borges, who he plays on Saturday, March 8.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

ORLANDO, Fla. – North Carolina A&T men's tennis kept its record unblemished on Thursday despite the tremendous amount of competition the Aggies have received while on spring break at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) National Campus in Florida.

On Thursday, A&T's latest close call was a 4-3 win over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) at the USTA National Campus. The Aggies completed their spring break trip 5-0 and will return to the east side of Greensboro 9-0 overall.

The Aggies had an outstanding start to the day by sweeping the doubles point to take a 1-0 lead. No. 3 doubles, manned by junior Mathieu Dussaubat and sophomore Kaua Santos, defeated the RPI duo of Archit Yemula and Quoc-Uy Vo 6-2. At No. 1 doubles, sophomore Said Akbarov and senior Ian Pedersen officially secured the doubles point for the Aggies with a 6-4 win over Aiden Drover-Mattinen and Andy Zhu 6-4.

""We started a little bit slow, making a few mistakes,"" said Pedersen. ""Toward the end, we started playing better and took the match.""

Freshman Jindrich Brill and sophomore Lucas Coupo-Moison topped off the successful doubles portion of the match with a 6-4 win over Tsubi Okada and Joel McCandless 6-4. The singles portion of the match got interesting and super competitive.

Drover-Mattinen established the Engineers as a series contender at No. 1 singles with a 6-4, 6-0 win over Pedersen. It was a heartbreaking loss for Pedersen, who led 3-0 in the first before Drover-Mattinen broke his serve and rallied to win.

""I relaxed too much and started to make too many mistakes,"" said Pedersen. ""I couldn't find my way back in the match.""

Despite that, Coupo-Moison uplifted his teammate by winning at No. 2 singles, 6-2, 6-3, over Yemula. Akbarov also secured a win in singles, defeating Okada 6-2, 7-5 at No. 4 singles. Brill brought it home for A&T at No. 5 singles. He defeated Tasmay Shah 6-3, 7-6, 8-6 in the tiebreaker.

""It was a tough match from the beginning,"" said Brill. ""I stayed strong on my serve in the important moments and broke his serve in the first. The second set was even tougher. We played so many rallies, but I finished the match with more intensity than him and won.""

Two thrilling three-set matches followed, starting with Dussaubat and RPI's Nico Luis at No. 6 singles. Luis dominated the first set before Dussaubat took over the second. Luis prevailed by winning 7-6, 7-1 in the tiebreaker. Zhu defeated Santos at No. 3 singles, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 to close things out.

Santos said fatigue set in, but he endured. ""I was very tired, but as I always do, I brought my energy and fire,"" said Santos. ""Unfortunately, I couldn't take the W for the Aggies.""

Dussaubat said he didn't feel his best during his singles match but pushed through the adversity.

""I'm happy for the team's win,"" he said.

The Aggies return to the classroom on Monday and to competition on Wednesday, March 12, when they host Norfolk State at the Piedmont Indoor Tennis Center at 1 p.m.

Redhawks Trek to the Sunshine State to Face Villanova
Southeast Missouri Tennis will be trekking to Orlando, Florida this weekend to face the university of Villanova at the UTSA Tennis Center at 2:00 p.m., CT on Saturday, March 8.

About Villanova
The Wildcats come into the weekend 3-8, winning 7-0 last time out over Seton Hall. Villanova are coming off of a 10-13 record last season, going 4-4 in conference play. Over the past four matches, graduate student Sophia Edwards has been 2-2 in doubles play on the No. 1 court, with the wins coming against St. John's and Seton Hall. Villanova has an experienced roster having just one freshman on the team. The rest of the team is made up of four sophomores, three juniors, three seniors, and one graduate student. Earlier in the season, the Wildcats had notable performances as they won back to back games against Bucknell University and Leigh University.

Series History
This will be the first meeting between the Redhawks and the Wildcats. This will be the fifth time this season Southeast Missouri is facing off against an opponent for the first time. 

The Florida Trip
The Redhawks will be playing their first ever match in the Sunshine State this weekend (As of 2009-2010). SEMO has yet to face an opponent in the state of Florida. Against Florida schools, Southeast Missouri is 2-1 all-time with wins against Florida Southern and the University of Tampa and a loss against West Florida. 

Redhawk Leaders
Juliette Demunck leads the Redhawks in singles this season. Demunck has a team best nine singles victories with four wins coming at No. 3 and five  wins at No. 4. Kristina Kozakova has six wins on the season but has only lost two matches this year between No. 5 and 6. 

The graduate pair of Lera Valeeva and Kristina Kozakova have the most doubles wins so far this year with seven. Valeeva and Kozakova have four wins at the number one position and three wins at spot two.

Weekend Seven Recap
The Redhawks went 1-1 over the past weekend with a 5-2 win over Missouri State last Friday and a 4-0 loss against North Alabama last Sunday.

Against Missouri State, the Redhawks No. 1 and No. 3 pairs of Lera Valeeva and Kristina Kozakova and Juliette Demunck and Yontha Tadoum captured the doubles point for SEMO. In singles play SEMO only fell in two of the matches. Kristina Kozakova scored the second point for the Redhawks after only letting her opponent score once during the entire match and won 6-0, 6-1. Mia Mayerova won in straight sets against Pols at the number five position 6-4, 6-3. Maja Bajorek clinched the match for the Redhawks with a straight set win on court three (6-4, 6-3). 

Against the Lions, the Redhawks fell in doubles to let North Alabama capture the doubles point. In singles action, the Lions won the first three matches in straight sets clinching the match. Bajorek and Valeeva were the lone Redhawks to win a set during the match. Bajorek won set one 6-2 and fell 6-2 in the second set before going unfinished at No. 3 against Ansorge. Valeeva was up 4-1 in set 2 and won set 1 6-4 before going unfinished against Bobrovnika.

Looking Ahead
After the trip down to Orlando, the Redhawks will begin conference play with their first OVC match on Saturday, March 15 against the Lindenwood Lions in St. Charles, Mo.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,How tennis became Buyunchaokete's life,https://www.atptour.com/en/news/bu-indian-wells-2025-feature,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 12:57:23 GMT","

When Buyunchaokete was young, a coach would visit his class to put the kids through physical activities like running and jumping.

“Then he just told me I need to try tennis and then I did,” Buyunchaokete told ATPTour.com. “I tried it and then it started [to be] my life.”

Now 23, ‘Bu’ has climbed as high as No. 65 in the PIF ATP Rankings despite not turning professional until age 20. The Xinjiang-born player began taking the sport seriously in his early teens, when he started to travel outside of China. At that point, Bu’s love of the sport came to the forefront.



Bu played tennis at school as a kid. Around the age of 14, he began doing a full day at school and a half day practising tennis. Within the next couple of years, tennis became more of a priority. With some good junior results, Bu went to Spain to practise by 16.

“I thought I loved it and everything came easy. Around Europe, you have a lot of tennis, a lot of tournaments,” Buyunchaokete said. “Even after becoming a professional, I still go there and I love it. It’s really easy for me.”

Bu is based in Alicante, where Carlos Alcaraz has famously trained at Juan Carlos Ferrero's academy. The Chinese player's coach, Spaniard Ricardo Ojeda Lara, reached a career-high World No. 171.

The Chinese player’s first goal was to crack the Top 100. During Bu’s formative years, no man from his country had broken into the elite group. Now there are four: Buyunchaokete, Zhang Zhizhen, Wu Yibing and Shang Juncheng.

“Before I was 18 or 20, our country never had a man inside the Top 100 in history. We just broke this three years ago,” Buyunchaokete said. “Of course, in my whole career, my coach, myself, everybody around me, wanted to have a Top 100 [ranking]. It was a big one, my dream.”

Buyunchaokete added: “When you get Top 100, of course you feel happy, and then all the little kids from China start watching more tennis. I think that’s a good thing.”

Last year’s Beijing and Hangzhou semi-finalist has learned a lot while spending time in Spain, even if that development has not necessarily come off court.

“Even right now, I speak really bad Spanish,” Buyunchaokete said, cracking a laugh. “I like the Spanish style of tennis. I also really enjoy Spain. And I also [have] a good coach there, so it’s really easy for me.”

It is fitting that Buyunchaokete’s favourite player is former World No. 1 Andy Murray, who also spent time in Spain.

“I like that he never gave up. Even though he lost many Grand Slam finals, he always believed he could win a Grand Slam,” Buyunchaokete said. “I like his style of tennis. I also like [his personality]. I played against him in 2023. I just loved it. It was super exciting.”

A fan of coffee and keeping to himself, Buyunchaokete explained: “Normally I like to stay alone, I love [when it’s] quieter. It’s easier to speak with myself, a lot deeper. That gives me more energy and more focus on my tennis, on my life.”

Buyunchaokete will need to be completely focussed when he takes on former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev in the second round at Indian Wells. It will be their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting and a chance for Bu to earn his second victory against a Top 10 opponent following his triumph against Andrey Rublev last year in Beijing.

Regardless of the result, this is just another step in Bu’s journey.

“I hope I can be in the Top 50,” Buyunchaokete said. “I don’t want to think too much. I’m just focused on my job every single day, so I just believe that the results will come if I work really good.”

Follow:


            Only a few years ago, João Fonseca was a young tennis fan eager to collect autographs from the world’s top players. Now, kids are starting to queue up for his signature.
    


            The 18-year-old is fast becoming one of the most exciting talents in men’s tennis, and on Thursday, he continued to impress with an opening-round victory against Britain’s Jacob Fearnley at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.
    


            It was by no means easy for Fonseca, who battled windy conditions and trailed 3-1 in the deciding set before coming from behind to win 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Only his second victory at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, the Brazilian had to demonstrate the sort of composure and tenacity that is fast earning him popularity with fans.

            “Everything is new for me – I’m still young and I’m still getting used to this,” Fonseca told reporters after the match. “But seeing people – not just Brazilians but from all over the world – cheering for me and calling my name, wanting autographs … It’s very nice to see those kids and people watching me.”
    


            After winning the first title of his young career at the Argentina Open last month, Fonseca has started to gain attention from all the right people.
    


            “(It) seems like there is a very good level of balance and professionalism and devotion, like what we have seen for the last couple years with (Carlos) Alcaraz,” Novak Djokovic said prior to competing at Indian Wells.
    


            The victory against Fearnley, and the manner in which he reeled off the last five games of the match in high-pressure circumstances, will only earn Fonseca more praise from the sport’s biggest names.
    


            He raced into an early lead with two breaks of serve and claimed the first set of the match with a forehand winner into an open court after Fearnley had stretched to make a return.
    


            However, the world No. 81, ranked just one spot below Fonseca, raised his level and responded well in the second set to level the contest. He then secured an early break in the decider and backed it up by holding his serve in the following game.
    


            But a double fault saw Fonseca draw level at 3-3 before he powered through the remainder of the set, wrapping up the victory in two hours with a well-angled backhand volley.
    


            “The first round of a Masters, it was windy, I was playing against a great guy – it was difficult conditions, but I got through, so I’m very happy with the way I fought today,” said Fonseca.
    


            He will now face another British player, world No. 14 Jack Draper, in the second round at Indian Wells. A deep run in California would continue Fonseca’s breakthrough year having previously knocked ninth seed Andrey Rublev out of the Australian Open in January. A month earlier, he became the second-youngest winner of the Next Gen ATP Finals in Saudi Arabia – a tournament for the best men’s players aged 20 and under.
    


            Elsewhere, Australian Nick Kyrgios’ latest bid to reignite his career was thwarted by a right wrist injury in his first-round match against the Netherlands’ Botic van de Zandschulp.
    


            Injuries have plagued Kyrgios’ progress in recent years, and he is now without a Tour-level win since October 2022. The former Wimbledon finalist retired while trailing 7-6 (7), 3-0 against van de Zandschulp after having held a set point in the first-set tie-break. As a result, the Aussie misses out on a second-round clash against Djokovic.
    


            Kyrgios appeared tearful at the end of the match, later explaining that he had experienced a flare-up of a recurring wrist injury during practice two days earlier.
    


            “No one in the sport’s had a wrist reconstruction and tried to play after that,” Kyrgios told reporters after the match. “There have been players that have had wrist surgeries, (but) nowhere near as bad as what I’ve had.
    


            “It’s all an experiment at this point,” he added, saying he was unsure when he would next be able to play. “I was told that I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again.”
    


            The first round of matches at Indian Wells continues on Friday, with men’s top seed Alexander Zverev in action against Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor.

The Bethune-Cookman women’s tennis team poses with USTA officials on campus.

Bethune-Cookman University (B-CU) recently received financial support to continue building state-of-the-art sports facilities for student athletes. 

On Feb. 28, USTA Florida visited B-CU to present administrators with a check for $100,000, which will be used to build the university’s first on-campus tennis courts. 

“This generous investment from USTA Florida marks a historic moment for our Wildcat Nation,” said Sherry Paramore, Vice President of Institutional Advancement at Bethune-Cookman University. “It represents a commitment to fostering a championship culture that provides our student athletes with the resources to compete at the highest level both on and off the tennis court.”

Added George Henry, head tennis professional at Play Tennis Gainesville and USTA Florida AMPLIFY Project member: “We are honored to assist Bethune-Cookman University, and personally it means a lot to me. I originally relocated to Florida to be the head coach and tennis director at B-CU before COVID. Little did I know that the university would have such an impact on me as a person.

“I truly took to heart the motto of ‘Enter to Learn. Depart to Serve.’ I am very honored to be a part of the USTA Florida Section in providing support for B-CU and all the Florida HBCUs,’’ Henry added.

In October 2023, B-CU administrators celebrated the completion of a new on-campus practice football field, and most recently launched a fundraising campaign with alumni basketball players to pay for improvements to the gymnasium.

Players will be handed same maternity pay regardless of ranking; grants also awarded for fertility treatment, such as IVF; WTA policy funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, with Victoria Azarenka saying: ""Ensuring programmes like this exist has been a personal mission of mine""

Friday 7 March 2025 10:51, UK

The Women's Tennis Association has introduced up to 12 months of paid maternity leave for female players.

The WTA says around 320 players will be entitled to the same, undisclosed fee, irrespective of their world ranking, with the policy funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, a global partner of the WTA Tour.

Players will not have to give back the money if they do not return to professional tennis.

Grants will also be handed out for fertility treatment, such as egg freezing and IVF, while the programme includes two months of paid leave for those who become a parent through partner pregnancy, surrogacy or adoption.

To receive assistance, players will need to have competed in a minimum of eight WTA tournaments in the previous 12 months or 24 over the previous 36 months.

Former world No 1 Victoria Azarenka, who sits on the WTA Players' Council and has an eight-year-old son, said: ""I'm honoured to introduce this programme, driven by players, and made possible with the support of PIF and the WTA.

""This marks the beginning of a meaningful shift in how we support women in tennis, making it easier for athletes to pursue both their careers and their aspirations of starting a family.

""Ensuring that programmes like this exist has been a personal mission of mine, and I'm excited to see the lasting impact it will have for generations to come.""

Azarenka is one of a growing band of players who have returned to the tour after having children, including Belinda Bencic and Petra Kvitova.

They are among 50 players to have benefited from a special ranking protecting their previous level that can be used for up to three years after giving birth since it was introduced in 2019.

Alanoud Althonayan, the head of events and sponsorships at PIF, said: ""The PIF WTA Maternity Fund Program - a first-of-its-kind and the only maternity program in women's sports to be fully funded and supported by an external partner - opens new pathways to motherhood while creating a more inclusive environment where athletes can thrive in both their professional and personal lives.""

Follow:


            For months, the tennis world has simmered with controversy in the wake of two doping cases involving top-ranking players: first, men’s player Jannik Sinner and months later, women’s player Iga Świątek.
    


            And when the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced on February 15 that Sinner had accepted a three-month ban to settle his case and avoid it going to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), it thrust the issue back into the spotlight once again, particularly as the ban length means the Italian player won’t miss any grand slam tournaments.
    


            “The anti-doping process is just all over the map, and it’s completely rogue,” Vasek Pospisil – a 2014 Wimbledon men’s doubles champion – told CNN Sport. “There’s absolutely no trust, that’s for sure.”
    


            Pospisil and Novak Djokovic cofounded the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), which acts as a players’ union.
    


            Pospisil and several others say that the saga has exposed the different experiences of the anti-doping system felt by players – where the likes of Sinner and Świątek, who was banned for a month, have escaped with short sanctions and some lesser-known players have been hit with more severe punishments.
    


            “The majority of the players don’t feel that it’s fair,” Djokovic told reporters at the Qatar Open. “The majority of the players feel like there is favoritism happening.”
    


            But, for Marjolaine Viret – an associate professor at the University of Lausanne specializing in health and sport – these accusations of inequality are more “rooted in the legal complexity of the system, and the fact that broader audiences” don’t normally pick up on the differences between the cases.
    


            Doping cases are inherently complicated, full of scientific and legal terms, and often take years to fully resolve as they wind their way through various courts and tribunals. Still, the  outcomes in the Sinner and Świątek cases “did not seem particularly special,” she told CNN Sport.
    


            Similarly, the fact that these cases were made public “is probably a healthy sign,” especially because they involve top players, said John WilIiam Devine, a senior lecturer in ethics and sport at the University of Swansea.
    


            “You could look at these cases and say the system held in the sense that the tennis authorities … didn’t brush them under the carpet,” he told CNN.
    


            Although the system seems to have held, there is a lingering perception among players that it has failed, revealing their lack of trust in the institutions, highlighting the financial inequalities among individual tennis players and spotlighting the issues with the way the current anti-doping system deals with contamination cases.
    


            Players have directed much of their ire towards the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) which originally dealt with Sinner’s and Świątek’s cases. The ITIA maintains it approaches every doping case “in the same way, irrespective of a player’s ranking or status,” it told CNN in a statement.
    


            Anti-doping works under the principle of strict liability, meaning that an athlete is automatically held responsible if a banned substance is found in their body and they have to prove how it got there.
    


            “For an anti-doping rule violation to take place, the athlete doesn’t need to have intentionally doped,” Silvia Camporesi, a professor in ethics and sport at the KU Leuven university in Belgium, explained to CNN Sport.
    


            A banned substance, even if it is unknowingly consumed in contaminated food or medicine, would leave an athlete liable and potentially facing sanctions. Both Sinner and Świątek say the banned substances entered their system in this way via contaminated products.
    


            “Contamination is the most used excuse by cheaters, but this is also the risk faced by the (clean) athlete,” David Pavot, professor of sports law at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada, told CNN Sport.
    


            Sinner twice tested positive for the banned substance clostebol in March last year and initially avoided suspension since an independent tribunal convened by the ITIA accepted his explanation that the anabolic steroid had entered his system via his physiotherapist, who had been applying an over-the-counter spray to his own skin – not Sinner’s – to treat a small cut.
    


            Świątek’s case has some key differences to Sinner’s. She tested positive in August for trimetazidine, a type of heart medication normally used to prevent angina attacks. Unlike Sinner, she initially couldn’t explain how the drug had entered her system, and she missed three tournaments during her provisional month-long suspension.
    


            Eventually, she explained the positive test by saying that a batch of melatonin she took to combat jet lag was contaminated by the banned substance – an explanation the ITIA accepted after testing the medication.
    


            There are good reasons why the doping system is built on this principle of strict liability, even if it catches out some innocent athletes, added sports ethicist Devine.
    


            As well as acting as a deterrent, it makes it easier for anti-doping authorities to sanction athletes who have doped.
    


            “One of the most difficult things to prove in any kind of criminal or civil case is intent … by operating with that strict liability doctrine … it makes it easier for cash strapped sporting bodies to prosecute these cases,” Devine said.
    


            Intent is considered later in the process, informing the length of the ban handed down to athletes, he added.
    


            To defend themselves and prove they didn’t intend to consume these substances, both Sinner and Świątek would have marshalled their considerable financial resources. Sinner hired one of the best sports law firms in the world. Świątek’s team tracked down the batch of melatonin she had consumed.
    


            In the end, Świątek received a one-month ban and Sinner a three-month ban. Neither of them missed any grand slam tournaments during this time.
    


            By contrast, Pospisil said that in his role at the PTPA, he has seen many players “just take the ban because they can’t afford to pay for a lawyer, even if they are innocent.”
    


            Articles picking over the fallout from these cases have drawn comparisons with other players – like Tara Moore, Stefano Battaglino and Simona Halep – who have faced much longer bans for seemingly similar positive tests.
    


            Current world No. 231 Moore was provisionally banned in June 2022 after testing positive for banned substances. It took an independent tribunal 19 months to accept her explanation that she had consumed contaminated meat in Colombia, resulting in 19 months “of lost time, of my reputation, my ranking, my livelihood, slowly trickling away,” she wrote in a statement on X.
    


            “I’m simply asking that everyone get the same treatment,” she said on X after Sinner’s three-month ban was announced. “I hope (Sinner’s) case will further improve the conditions in which players are treated and will be a precedent for future cases timeline.”
    


            Then there is Italy’s Battaglino, who tested positive for clostebol in what he said were eerily similar circumstances to Sinner. But, unlike Sinner, he was banned for four years and described himself as a “pariah” in an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
    


            As the then world No. 760, he had no access to his own physiotherapist like Sinner and would use those provided by tournaments. He says it was during one of these sessions that the clostebol entered his system.
    


            “(Eventually,) only towards the end of the trials, after endless lack of answers from the tournament director, did they track down the physiotherapist who had accidentally contaminated me,” Battaglino told Corriere della Sera. The physio told him he always wore gloves and washed his hands, and an independent tribunal concluded that he couldn’t prove the source of his banned substance, and so there was no cause to reduce his four-year ban.
    


            And there is two-time grand slam champion Halep, who was banned for four years after testing positive for the banned substance roxadustat. She released an impassioned statement in November, saying: “I stand and ask myself, why is there such a big difference in treatment and judgement?”
    


            She always maintained her anti-doping violations were unintentional and, in March last year, CAS agreed and reduced the backdated ban to nine months, clearing her to return to the sport. She has since retired from tennis.
    


            But in these cases, the players couldn’t prove the source of contamination as quickly as Sinner and Świątek could, meaning that their explanations weren’t accepted by the anti-doping authorities.
    


            The ITIA, meanwhile, offered different comparisons. It directed CNN to the case involving Marco Bortolotti, the current world No. 109 in men’s doubles, who tested positive for clostebol in October 2023 but provided evidence of contamination and escaped a ban.
    


            It also pointed to the case of Nikola Bartunkova, who was banned for six months after testing positive for trimetazidine which she later showed was caused by ingesting a contaminated supplement.
    


            WADA told CNN it is “satisfied that justice has now been delivered” and acknowledged that “what the Sinner case highlights most of all is the issue of contamination.” The organization said that it has created a working group to provide expert advice on this issue and that its code has “adopted an increasingly flexible and tailored sanction regime that aims to impose appropriate consequences to reflect the nature of the anti-doping violation.”
    


            For some, there is a sense that, to a certain extent, the anti-doping system needs “to reinvent itself,” said Viret of the University of Lausanne.
    


            “First, deal with these contamination issues,” she said, “find a way to address this risk in the athletes’ environment that goes to the very limits of the duties of diligence that you can impose on athletes.”
    


            Redirecting resources towards investigation instead of mass testing might prove more effective too, added Pavot, postulating that the actual prevalence rate of doping seems to greatly dwarf the proportion of positive tests recorded.
    


            And when WADA updates its code in 2027, athletes judged to bear “no fault” for a positive test could receive a reprimand or up to a two-year ban.
    


            Some players are also now calling for a complete overhaul of the sport’s anti-doping system.
    


            “It’s a ripe time for us to really address the system because the system and the structure obviously doesn’t work for anti-doping,” said Djokovic. Meanwhile, American star Jessica Pegula said recently she doesn’t think “any of the players trust the process at all right now.”
    


            While it’s unlikely that a complete overhaul will result from these cases, some changes have come out of it.
    


            In January, the PTPA launched a program to provide pro-bono legal support to tennis players facing anti-doping violations. It was co-founded by Moore who said in a statement that “all players are entitled to due process – financial constraints or a lack of resources should never stand in the way of their rights.”
    


            Whether a player who tests positive for a banned substance is guilty of doping, “that’s not for me to judge,” said Pospisil. “What I can judge is the fact that the system is just completely failed, it’s broken, and it needs reform.”

Novak Djokovic believes one teenage player has the potential to become a “really big superstar”. The current world No. 7 has achieved virtually everything possible in tennis and rewritten history. Now, he thinks one up-and-comer could bring plenty of eyes to the sport.

Joao Fonseca has been enjoying a breakthrough season, and Djokovic is buying into the hype. The 24-time Major winner has been impressed with the teenager’s composure and believes that a new Brazilian star could be just what tennis needs.

Fonseca has been taking the tennis world by storm in recent months. Aged just 18, he won the Next Gen ATP Finals in December and carried his momentum straight into the 2025 season.

So far this year, the Brazilian has won the Canberra Challenger, qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw, upset ninth seed Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open, and lifted his first ATP Tour title in Argentina.

Fonseca is in action in Indian Wells this week, and he’s already made an impression in his opening match winning the last five games to beat Jacob Fearnley 6-2 1-6 6-3. So it’s no surprise that Djokovic sees huge potential in the current world No. 80.

Following Fonseca’s latest victory in the Californian desert, Djokovic was asked what it was like to be an 18-year-old playing freely and shared his thoughts on tennis’ latest prospect.

“A little bit. It comes in flashes, but yeah, it does feel great, you know, when you're that young and playing in a high level, not much to lose, a lot to gain,” the Olympic champion said.

“Of course attention from the people, support, you know, builds up and it all adds to a great evolution of the player and the personality eventually will come to the point where it's going to convert into pressure and expectations from himself, from the others, and so forth.”

For now, Djokovic thinks Fonseca is on the right path. “He seems to be handling it all very well,” he added.

“I mean, I don't know him personally so well, but from what I have seen on the court, not only the way he plays but the way he behaves, and people around him, seems like there is a very good level of balance and professionalism and devotion, like what we have seen for the last couple years with [Carlos] Alcaraz.”

“He has the potential to be really a superstar of this game. No doubt about it. Coming from Brazil also, one of the biggest countries in the world, where they love tennis, love sports, very passionate people.

“It would be amazing for also our sport to have a Brazilian superstar, first really big superstar since Gustavo ‘Guga’ Kuerten, that was an idol of so many kids, incredible guy and big champion. Yeah, I wish him all the best.”

Fonseca will be delighted to hear the praise from Djokovic - especially after their heartwarming run-in after his opening match in Indian Wells. After his first-round win, the teenager got a brief moment to chat with the world No. 7.

“With Novak, I was just leaving the court that I practiced after my match, and then he was entering. He asked if I won. I said I won. Then he just congratulated me. It was just super cool that he was talking to me,” Fonseca said.

Novak Djokovic is back in the game, declaring his hamstring injury a thing of the past. Despite a rocky start to the year, including a first-round exit at the Qatar Open, Djokovic is optimistic about his form. The 24-time Grand Slam champion is set to tackle the prestigious “Sunshine Double” at Indian Wells and Miami for the first time since 2019. However, he’s still determined to clinch that 100th title. “I’m not going to get younger; I know that. But I definitely look to go deep in the tournament,” he mentioned during the pre-tournament press conference this year. Now, as the sixth seed at Indian Wells, Djokovic is ready to make a strong comeback. However, not everyone is convinced about his chances.

Dmitry Tursunov, a former Russian tennis pro, has carved out a successful coaching career, guiding top players like Aryna Sabalenka and Belinda Bencic to impressive heights. After a decade-long playing career, Tursunov transitioned to coaching, leveraging his experience facing elite opponents. Recently, he spoke with Sportklub about Djokovic’s future in the sport following his recent injury crisis. Making a bold statement, Tursunov said, “His own body is now his greatest opponent. No matter how he plans to cheat time, ‘tennis death’ will await him.”

You might recall Djokovic echoing similar sentiments during the Australian Open. After exiting his semifinal match against Alexander Zverev, he noted during the press conference, “This is probably the new reality I have to accept—that my body will probably betray me more often than it has throughout my entire career.” This came after he struggled with a hamstring injury sustained during his previous match against Carlos Alcaraz, raising concern among fans and himself.

Tursunov added, “Of course, he still has the motivation to play at the highest level, but in tennis, you lose the feeling of immortality much faster than in other sports. Previous achievements are quickly forgotten.” Djokovic stated that he isn’t looking to retire anytime soon, following questions about his future after Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal’s retirement last year. This leaves him as the last-standing legend from the Big Four era. Known for his fitness and tenacity, Djokovic is a 24-time Grand Slam champion with 99 titles to his name.

However, Tursunov isn’t convinced. He believes Djokovic’s passion will push him through tough matches, but he worries about a tough challenge at the Indian Wells Open. “Alejandro Davidovich Fokina could make a splash against Novak (they potentially meet in the third round), having already defeated him in Monte Carlo in 2022,” he noted. However, Fokina hasn’t made it past the first round, so he won’t face Djokovic. The real threat, according to Tursunov, is Carlos Alcaraz. “Djokovic is in a very difficult situation, his chances are slim if he faces Carlos Alcaraz.”

The Indian Wells Open is yet to kick off for top players, starting on March 9. Djokovic will first face Botic van de Zandschulp, with whom he has a head-to-head advantage of 1-0. Meanwhile, Alcaraz’s matchup hasn’t been announced yet. Djokovic is dismissing rumors about his “concerning injury” after being seen limping at the airport ahead of the tournament.

The tennis world was abuzz last month when a jaw-dropping video surfaced of Novak Djokovic limping into an airport in Doha. The clip sent shockwaves, especially given his recent hamstring issues at the Australian Open and a swift exit in Qatar. It seemed like another injury might be brewing for the world number one. However, Djokovic quickly put those concerns to rest during a press conference ahead of his Indian Wells campaign.

Can Djokovic defy age and injury to claim his 100th title, or is time catching up?

Debate

He humorously explained, “It was really, yeah, awkward to see that video, because I arrived to the airport and I hit myself really badly as I was walking out, because it was very early, I think, 4 or 5 a.m. I was just limping because I hit myself badly in the ankle. That’s all. It was just a hit. It was nothing else. But then people connected it to the injury and thought it was something escalating and coming back.”

Despite the drama surrounding his health, Djokovic is feeling optimistic about his form. He’s eager to take on the Sunshine Double, a feat he hasn’t attempted in six years. “But anyway, I’m feeling good. I really look forward coming to Indian Wells and Miami this year,” he said with enthusiasm.

As a five-time Indian Wells champion, Djokovic has a rich history at the event, with his first victory dating back to 2008. His last title was in 2016, marking his third consecutive win after also lifting the trophy in 2014 and 2015. This year’s appearance will be his first at the BNP Paribas Open since 2019. The last time he was defeated in the Round of 32 by Philipp Kohlschreiber.

Now, the Serbian is eyeing his 100th ATP trophy, and the stage is set for an exciting comeback. Will he be successful this time around? The anticipation is building and only time will tell!

Let the world know your perspective.

News release from Texas A&M Athletics:

BRYAN-COLLEGE STATION – The No. 15 Texas A&M men’s tennis team tamed the Auburn Tigers 5-2, at the Mitchell Tennis Center on Thursday.


Freshman Theo Papamalamis clinched the victory for the Aggies, extending Auburn’s losing streak on the road. After splitting the first two sets, No. 38 Papamalamis dominated in the third against Auburn senior Will Nolan, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.

Texas A&M (9-5, 3-1 SEC) opened with senior duo of Luke Casper and Giulio Perego taking court 3, 6-3.  Auburn (10-5, 2-3 SEC) responded with a win on court 1. It all came down to court 2, where the Aggies dropped the doubles point in a tiebreaker.

Senior Alan Magadan recorded his second win as an Aggie, and first win at Mitchell, defeating Billy Blaydes on court 3, 6-2, 6-4, to tie up the score one all.

Sophomore Tiago Pires extended his winning streak to six, staying undefeated in conference play. After a 3-5 deficit to start to the first set, Pires fought back to win the set 7-5, and kept the momentum going to win court 4, 6-3.

After giving up court 2, Casper put an end to his three-game losing streak to put the Maroon & White one short of the clinch, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Once the match was clinched, junior Togan Tokac continued his court 5 domination, extending his winning streak to four, 6-0, (5) 6-7, 6-4.

Coach’s Quotes
Head coach Steve Denton on losing the doubles point…
“I thought the doubles point was a very good point. I thought we did very well at court 3. We had lots of chances with deuce points on courts 1 and 2 and lost both of them. I have to give Auburn credit, they played a good tiebreaker to win it.”

Denton on the ability to turn around the match…
“Our guys were able to right the ship, we won 5 first sets, but Auburn kept fighting. They are a really good team, but our guys stayed tough the whole night. I was pleased overall with the match and how we competed on every court. That was a really good SEC battle. They came in with a lot of confidence after beating Georgia, but we were able to turn around a few things out there and win some close matches which ultimately was the difference.”

Denton on the singles wins from today’s action…
“Luke lost the first set and went off to collect himself and came out to play two really good sets against a good freshman from Auburn. He served well and finished out on his serve. Tiago kept on his winning streak. He started behind in his first set, but didn’t panic. Alan was solid at court 3. Theo was very good in the third set to round out the win.”

Coach’s Quotes

Head coach Steve Denton on losing the doubles point…

“I thought the doubles point was a very good point. I thought we did very well at court 3. We had lots of chances with deuce points on courts 1 and 2 and lost both of them. I have to give Auburn credit, they played a good tiebreaker to win it.”


Denton on the ability to turn around the match…
“Our guys were able to right the ship, we won 5 first sets, but Auburn kept fighting. They are a really good team, but our guys stayed tough the whole night. I was pleased overall with the match and how we competed on every court. That was a really good SEC battle. They came in with a lot of confidence after beating Georgia, but we were able to turn around a few things out there and win some close matches which ultimately was the difference.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Novak Djokovic gets the ultimate GOAT tribute from McEnroe,https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/novak-djokovic-goat-tribute-mcenroe,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 13:22:10 GMT","

Novak Djokovic might only be the best tennis player of all-time, but he could be edging himself towards the title of the greatest athlete of the modern era, according to Patrick McEnroe.

Speaking exclusively to Tennis365 at Indian Wells in his capacity as International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) President, McEnroe suggested the time has come to put Djokovic in the mix for the title of the ultimate athlete in the history of all sports as he suggested his longevit at the top has taken his reputation to the next level.

Djokovic has already won his battle to be etched into the tennis history books as the most successful player of all-time after he claimed more Grand Slam titles than his great rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Now McEnroe has told us that the Serbian’s achievements may be even more remarkable than enduring champions like soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, NFL star Tom Brady and basketball giant LeBron James.

“You are seeing this kind of longevity from great athletes in a few other sports, but what Novak is doing may be the best of the lot,” McEnroe told Tennis365.

“We have Cristiano Ronaldo at the age of 40 still playing on the biggest stages. Tom Brady continued his career for a long time, then you look at LeBron James doing what he is doing in baseball, but I would argue what Novak is doing is even more impressive.

“With tennis being an individual sport, it is harder to compete for as long as Novak has done and given everything he has won in the sport, his passion and drive for more is so impressive.

“There’s nowhere to run or hide in tennis. If you are Ronaldo, you have some protection from your team mates and may only need to contribute for sections of a game.

“Tom Brady has all that protection from his teammates and LeBron is a team player, but tennis is all about doing it on your own.

“That’s why I would say what Novak Djokovic is doing is one of the greatest achievements in the history of sport.

“He is about to be 38 and the fact that he is still competing as well as he did in a major as he did in Australia was amazing.

“He obviously hasn’t won a major in over a year now, but he did win the Olympics last year and he is still beating players like Carlos Alcaraz, so he is still right there.

“Who knows whether he will win another major. Wimbledon may be his best shot this year, but he obviously still loves the game and he is doing everything he possibly can to win again.”

McEnroe went on to suggest Djokovic’s drive to improve and grow as an athlete has allowed him to stay focused on tennis, as he cited an example of his attention to detail as he prepared for a Grand Slam tournament.

“I remember last year at the US Open in the week prior to the tournament, we were doing our shows on ESPN and he was going through his return of serve in incredible detail,” said McEnroe.

“He had his team filming him, what position his elbow was in and where his wrist was. It was really detailed stuff.

“I was looking at it and thinking this is the greatest tennis player of all-time, with the greatest return of all-time and he is still dissecting his game and trying to get better. I guess this is one of the reasons why he has been so successful. His attention to detail is like no other.

“Great players I played against like [Pete] Sampras, [Roger] Federer or my brother, they had so much natural ability and you didn’t feel they were dissecting the ins and outs of it as much as someone like Djokovic.”

The International Tennis Hall of Fame (ITHF) officially opened its Letters to Greatness booth at an event hosted by ITHF Presidents, Patrick McEnroe and Kim Clijsters.

McEnroe and Clijsters were joined by ITHF CEO, Dan Faber and upcoming 2025 Inductees, Bob and Mike Bryan, to kick off the event by recording their own Letters to Greatness – congratulatory messages to Maria Sharapova and the Bryan Brothers ahead of their formal induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this summer.

The Letters to Greatness booth will remain open throughout the remainder of the BNP Paribas Open, where tennis fans will have the chance to record or pen their own personal messages to the Class of 2025.

Nick Kyrgios was visibly upset before retiring hurt at Indian Wells with wrist injury; former Wimbledon finalist 0-3 in 2025 after missing all of 2024 and playing once in 2023; ""I feel I can compete [but] if I'm not able to finish matches it doesn't really matter at this point""

Nick Kyrgios' tennis future is unclear with the former Wimbledon finalist still searching for his first win of 2025 after retiring hurt with a wrist injury at Indian Wells.

The Australian withdrew from his first-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp while trailing 7-6 (9-7) 3-0 after becoming visibly upset during a medical timeout.

Kyrgios is now 0-3 so far this year after a defeat to Jacob Fearnley at the Australian Open followed a loss to Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at the Brisbane International.

The 29-year-old played just one match in 2023 and missed the whole of 2024 due to injury and surgeries on his right wrist and knee.

""It's all an experiment at this point,"" Kyrgios said after his match with Van de Zandschulp, in which he fashioned a set point in the tie-breaker.

""This process has been probably one of the biggest challenges I've faced in my life. It's just the amount of work I put in and I'm still having so much discomfort in my wrist.

""That's why I got a bit emotional towards the end because it's one of my favourite tournaments.

""We go back to the drawing board as a team and we try to navigate a way through these matches. If I'm not finishing matches that becomes a concern.

""I was told I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again. [But] I feel I'm like right there. I feel like I can compete. I competed with a very good player and I had chances - set points and break points.

""I'm there, but if I'm not able to finish matches it doesn't really matter at this point. I'm not too sure right now. I don't even... I'm not sure how it's going to pull up tomorrow.

""I want to go out there and I want to compete. If I really didn't want to play, I didn't have to rehab, I didn't have to try and get back on the court. I want to play.

""No one in the sport had a wrist reconstruction and tried to play after that. Players had surgery but nowhere near as bad as what I've had. I'll just keep looking forward and try to do the right thing.""

Asked whether he will now play at the Miami Open from March 18-30, Kyrgios said: ""The time frame is not ideal, but I was scheduled to play so I will see how my wrist responds.

""If not Miami, I will keep looking forward. I can't keep looking back and being disappointed. Otherwise I don't know how much enjoyment I will have in that.""

Van de Zandschulp will play Novak Djokovic in the second round at Indian Wells.

Friday 7 March 2025 10:34, UK

British No 1s Katie Boulter and Jack Draper were given byes into the second round as seeded players, while Sonay Kartal and Cameron Norrie have also reached that stage after first-round wins over Varvara Lepchenko and Luca Nardi respectively.

Emma Raducanu and Jacob Fearnley lost in the first round, with Raducanu - playing her first match since being targeted by a stalker in Dubai in February - beaten by Moyuka Uchijima and Fearnley eliminated by rising star Joao Fonseca.

Novak Djokovic is also playing as he resumes his hunt for a 100th singles title.

Five-time Indian Wells winner Djokovic will aim to become the third man to claim 100 singles titles in the professional era, behind Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103).

Jannik Sinner will miss Indian Wells after accepting a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Alcaraz is the two-time reigning Indian Wells champion, having downed Daniil Medvedev in the final of the last two editions.

Iga Swiatek is the reigning women's champion, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Australian Open winner Madison Keys will aim to topple the Pole.

""The 'sunshine double' of Indian Wells and Miami is very tough for any player to pull off because it's totally opposite conditions - even though it's two hard-court tournaments,"" said former British No 1 Laura Robson.

""It's a really long stint - both events are 12 days - and it's just a massive change conditions-wise, to go from one to the other as Miami is so hot and humid, compared to being in the desert of Palm Springs.

""Indian Wells, in particular, I always struggled at because it's much slower than you think. It doesn't always favour the Brits, who in general prefer slightly faster conditions and a pacier hard court that plays more lively, because you get a bit more out of your shots.""

Emma Raducanu suffered a demoralising defeat at Indian Walls, falling 6-3 6-2 to Japan's Moyuka Uchijima amid challenging windy conditions and a flurry of errors, but then denied she was distracted on her return to the court. Back in action after distressing events involving a stalker at last month's Dubai Open, Raducanu was hoping for better as she continues her partnership with new Slovakian coach Vladimir Platenik.

With only one win in her last six matches at a location where she has previously excelled, Raducanu acknowledged the need for vast improvement. ""It was just a very difficult match for me,"" she said in a press conference. ""I think it was tough conditions, difficult ball from my opponent. I tried to be aggressive, I tried to make the ball, but I guess it didn't work today. I had great support around me.

""I was feeling pretty good. I think today was just a bit of a curveball, but I guess I am just going to move on. I think I could improve every area of my game, to be honest, after today's performance.""

Despite the turbulent few weeks leading up to Indian Wells, which she signed up to at the last minute, Raducanu rejected suggestions she was distracted: ""I didn't have what happened in Dubai in my head at all today. If anything, (it was) a bit of a lack of preparation on the tennis court.""

She did however heap praise on her new coach, the seasoned Platenik: ""It is good that I have someone who is very experienced here, and we will see how the work goes and how we get on as well on and off the court and the methods and everything.

""I am looking forward to seeing how it goes. I think I just need to keep trying to put one foot in front of the other and not look back too much.""

Elsewhere, Britain's own Sonay Kartal, entering as a lucky loser, made a remarkable impression by defeating American qualifier Varvara Lepchenko with a 7-6(6) 6-2 scoreline, setting up an encounter with the 16th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia.

But Jacob Fearnley couldn't secure a match against his former junior rival Jack Draper, succumbing to Brazil's young talent Joao Fonseca. The 18-year-old Fonseca dazzled spectators by clinching five straight games to claim a 6-2 1-6 6-3 victory.

Reflecting on the match, Fearnley gave credit to Fonseca's powerful game and mental fortitude, stating: ""He hit a couple of forehands that were massive. So he has the ability to up his pace of shot. But I think what's impressive is how strong he is mentally, and at such a young age.""

Ons Jabeur outlines one wish for her tennis career as she aims to rediscover her best form.

The Tunisian ended her 2024 season early due to injuries and her fitness issues saw her drop out of the WTA’s top 10.

At her best Ons Jabeur is one of trickiest players to face given her artistry and unpredictable shotmaking abilities.

As much as she wants to win Grand Slam titles and climb back up the rankings, there is something else that the 30-year-old would love to achieve in the game.

Following the announcement of WTA Tour’s rebrand, they have made a very important announcement.

On Thursday the PIF and the WTA announced that players who give birth will receive paid maternity leave for up to 12 months.

Jabeur heard the groundbreaking news and wishes that one day she is able to have a child and return to action, while benefiting from this program.

“I’m just hoping the sponsors will follow,” the three-time Grand Slam runner-up told BBC Sport Africa.

“Because when you get pregnant you don’t get paid. It is very important to keep evolving in that and I’m sure it will happen one day.”

Jabeur returned to action following a shoulder injury at the start of 2025.

The World number 32 has claimed 12 wins so far and her best results are quarter-final appearances in Brisbane and Abu Dhabi.

One of her biggest wins came against Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng, who has just victory to her name so far this season.

At Indian Wells Jabeur is the final seeded player in the draw and will commence her campaign against Dayana Yastremska, who she will play for the first time.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Belinda Bencic has always been a fighter. But this time, she wasn’t just battling opponents on the court—she was proving that motherhood and professional tennis can go hand in hand. The Swiss tennis player welcomed her baby, Bella, with her husband and fitness coach, Martin Hromkovic, in April 2024. Just when Bella was 10 months old, the super mom fought back from a set down to defeat American Ashlyn Krueger in the final, lifting the WTA 500 trophy in Abu Dhabi. Her daughter was there to witness it all, cradled in Bencic’s arms during the trophy ceremony. A moment to remember. And now she’s celebrating a landmark victory for tennis moms everywhere.

The WTA rolled out its groundbreaking maternity policy, offering 12 months of paid maternity leave for eligible players. The initiative also includes two months of leave for those becoming parents through surrogacy, partner pregnancy, or adoption. And that’s not all—grants for fertility treatments like egg freezing and IVF are now part of the package. The program, backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, is the first of its kind in professional sports. More than 320 players qualify for paid leave, with all receiving the same payout, regardless of ranking. If they choose not to return to the sport, they won’t have to repay any of the money. That’s a game-changer. And it was the same day the Swiss tennis player won her first match at Indian Wells.

So, what does tennis mom Bencic think of this? After her first-round win at Indian Wells, she shared her thoughts in the post-match interview.“Well, of course, I think it’s a great thing. It’s absolutely giving players the chance to not have to make such a hard decision. I think it makes their decision a little bit easier if they are looking for having a family and didn’t have to decide so much if it’s worth it. Especially the lower-ranked players, I think it’s important for them to have a guaranteed income so they don’t have to worry about money when they’re out for a year and a half and not stress about things. So I think it’s a great thing. Also, you know, that tennis is the first sport to do it for female athletes, so I hope it paves the way for other sports, as well.”

A well-deserved moment of recognition for the sport and for the women who make it great. But the former World No.4’s return wasn’t just about policies—it was about defying expectations. Many doubted whether she could come back at the same level, questioning if motherhood would slow her down. Belinda Bencic, however, had other ideas.

Belinda Bencic defies odds—Can motherhood and top-level tennis truly coexist successfully?

Debate

“When I started my comeback, most people were like, ‘Oh, for sure, it’s not possible,’ you know? So, I always feel like people change their minds so quickly. And it’s fun for me to be like, ‘Oh, okay, you believe in me now, huh?’” she said to host Caroline Garcia. “It’s very classic. I had so many people saying: ‘Why she did this decision now in the middle of her career? It’s not possible to be back at the same level.’ But now (after Abu Dhabi) they say: ‘Yeah, she can win the Grand Slam for sure.’ I’m like, you changed your mind in one week!” she laughed.

It’s a testament to her resilience. The former world No. 4 and Olympic gold medalist never doubted herself. The Swiss tennis star further stated, “I also feel like all the work I did in my career, in my childhood, I don’t want to just throw it away. I just want to take out the most when I can out of my career and also like see that it’s possible to have both.”

Right now, the 27-year-old tennis player has won 14 of her 18 matches this season and sits firmly inside the top 60 in the world. The goal? Keep climbing and be seeded in major tournaments again.

With her determination and the WTA’s new policy paving the way, could we see more mothers dominating the tour?

If you had to list everything Billie Jean King has done for tennis, you’d be stuck deciding what tops the chart. She helped create the Women’s Tennis Association, pushed for equal prize money at Grand Slams, and made sure Title IX stopped educational institutions from discriminating based on gender. Then there was the Battle of the Sexes, where she took down the loudmouthed Bobby Riggs in 1973. And now, at 81, she’s celebrating another major step for women in tennis.

The WTA has just launched a groundbreaking maternity program. This initiative offers 12 months of paid maternity leave for eligible pregnant players and two months of leave for those becoming parents through surrogacy, partner pregnancy, or adoption. It also includes grants for fertility treatments like egg freezing and IVF. The program is backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, making it the first of its kind in professional tennis. More than 320 players qualify for up to a year of paid leave. The exact amount remains undisclosed, but every player, regardless of ranking, will receive the same payout. If they decide not to return to the sport, they won’t have to pay the money back.

Billie Jean King was quick to celebrate this milestone on her Instagram Story. She wrote, “Thrilled to see eligible WTA players will now have the financial support and resources to start or expand their families while pursuing their professional careers.”

Petra Kvitova and Belinda Bencic recently returned to the tour after maternity leave. Victoria Azarenka, a former world No. 1 who gave birth in 2016, told the BBC last year that maternity pay would be a “huge win for women in general.” Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion and mother, also called it “life-changing.”

King, who is still at 81, is an advocate for women’s sport. But let’s rewind to one of the moments that cemented her as a true icon—her legendary Battle of the Sexes.

It was September 20, 1973. As night fell in Houston, promoter Jerry Perenchio knocked on Billie Jean King’s dressing room door. “Are you ready?” he asked. King grinned. “Jerry, I was born ready.”

The 29-year-old King faced off against Bobby Riggs, a six-time Grand Slam champion who was 26 years older. Riggs had been running his mouth, making one sexist remark after another. “These women say they want to earn the same as us, and that’s ridiculous,” he scoffed. King let her racket do the talking, taking him down 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. The match had a winner-takes-all prize of $100,000, but it was about way more than money.

Is the WTA's new maternity program a game-changer for women's sports, or just a start?

Debate

Riggs had spent months hyping the match, calling himself a “male chauvinist pig” and declaring that women’s tennis was inferior. He had already beaten Margaret Court earlier that year in what became known as the “Mother’s Day Massacre.” But King wasn’t about to let him have the last word. Dressed in a blue-and-green sequined outfit, she walked onto the court with confidence. The crowd of over 30,000 in the Houston Astrodome and millions watching on television knew they were witnessing something historic.On the match’s 50th anniversary in 2023, King reflected on its significance in a post on X. “More than a tennis match, it was a catalyst for social change & one of the most important days of my life. We have come a long way since 1973, but we are not done yet. Let’s keep going for it.”

Half a century later, Billie Jean King is still pushing boundaries. Her influence on tennis and women’s rights continues to shape the sport today. The fight for equality is ongoing, but thanks to pioneers like her, progress keeps moving forward.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Nick Kyrgios makes confession after retiring mid-match,https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/nick-kyrgios-opens-up-after-heartbreaking-indian-wells-retirement,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 14:09:45 GMT","

Nick Kyrgios has called his Indian Wells retirement ‘heartbreaking’, after experiencing wrist discomfort once again – during his first-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp.

Kyrgios looked in solid form against the Dutchman, clawing his way back from a double break deficit in the first set – before losing a closely-fought tiebreak, where he possessed set point.

The Australian was then broken in the third set, before throwing in the towel at 3-0 down after seemingly shedding a few tears during the changeover.

“It’s just more so I guess the amount of work I’ve put in to get back, and just to know that it’s not – like, I can play some, there are glimpses of some really good tennis that I can still play,” Kyrgios said, during his post-match press conference.

“I guess this process has probably been one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced in my life. In reality, it’s not too bad, but for my tennis career, it’s by far the biggest. Yeah, just the amount of work that goes in when I go back home or when I’m not playing, it’s not fun.

“I got a bit emotional towards the end because it’s one of my favourite tournaments, I love it here. I’ve had so many good memories here. It’s one of the best tournaments we have.”

Kyrgios is a two-time quarterfinalist at Indian Wells – reaching that stage in 2017 and 2022.

The former world No 13 had a sensational 2022 season, reaching the final of Wimbledon and claiming an ATP 500 title in Washington – but underwent wrist surgery in September 2023 which forced him out of the entire following season.

Kyrgios returned to the tour earlier in 2025, losing out in his opening matches at both the Brisbane International and the Australian Open.

“No one in the sport has had a wrist reconstruction and tried to play after that,” Kyrgios stated, speaking about the surgery.

“There’s been players that have had wrist surgeries and nowhere near as bad as what I had.

“It would be nice if someone had this injury prior if I could just go there and ask them, okay, these are setbacks you were having. It’s all an experiment at this point. I was told I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again. I feel I’m like right there, I feel like I can compete.

“I had an amazing season, literally knocking on the door of a Grand Slam, and then you just get pulled right back, and now you’re going to start from – I literally don’t have a ranking at the moment, was out for one-and-a-half years, and I’m trying to work my way back.”

Nick Kyrgios continues Jannik Sinner feud in Tennis365 Instagram comments

Despite the setback, the Australian knows that his desire to keep playing is strong, whilst also lowering expectations.

“I want to play. I knew I was going to be in discomfort tonight after two days ago but I took the court,” admitted the former No 13.

“It’s brutal, especially because I was having such a good year. I think that’s what is painful for me. And I think the coach I’m here with this week, my physio, I keep talking about that year, and it’s, like, you can’t expect that anymore.

That’s I think, for me, what’s a bit heartbreaking just because I thought I’d figured it out.”

The former Wimbledon finalist is next scheduled to participate in Miami, March 19 – March 30: “The pain is not great but I’ll just keep moving forward trying to do the right thing.

“Obviously the time frame for Miami is not ideal, but that’s where I was scheduled to play so I’ll see how my wrist responds and if not Miami then I’ll keep looking forward. I can’t keep looking back and being disappointed.”


                Nick Kyrgios made the comment just a few hours before his Indian Wells retirement.            


                Novak Djokovic could be in line for a blockbuster opening match at the first ATP Masters 1000 tournament of the year.

Former Indian tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi said that India must host the Olympics and also talked about the challenges non-cricket sports face in India. Bhupathi was speaking at the at Trailblazers 3.0 Conclave organised by RevSportz in Kolkata. Speaking at the conclave, Bhupathi said, ""We must host the Olympics, be it in 2036 or 2046."" Notably, India has expressed interest in hosting the 2036 Summer Olympics. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA), on October 1 last year, formally sent a 'Letter of Intent' to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Future Host Commission, expressing India's interest in hosting the Olympics and Paralympics Games in 2036.

On challenges faced by India in other sports, Bhupathi said, ""The BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) filters down the money to the under-14 level, to the districts and villages. The BCCI is a private organisation. It has the money. But other sports cannot do that.""



Bhupathi also spoke about young up-and-coming tennis star Maaya Rajeshwaran, who has won six International Tennis Federation (ITF) singles titles at the age of 15 and is shaping up to be the next big star from India in the sport. He said about Maaya, ""Tennis is a big world and we are talking about just one Maaya. In Spain, for example, they have 30-40 Maayas.""

Indian squash ace, Saurav Ghosal, also agreed with Bhupathi on India hosting Olympics saying, ""It is important to create that impetus.""

The former All England champion and Indian badminton chief coach Pullela Gopichand also spoke on how India failed to carry momentum after the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which were hosted in New Delhi and saw India win 101 medals.



""We did not have the infrastructure then. It is much better now,"" he added.

The two-time Grand Slam champion, Victoria Azarenka, initiated a maternity fund for women players in partnership with PIF and WTA. The programme supports female tennis players in starting a family by giving paid leaves during the pregnancy period or providing funds for any kind of fertility treatments for the athletes.

Many women tennis players and other people from the fraternity celebrated this groundbreaking initiative taken by Azarenka in partnership with PIF and WTA.

Azarenka became a mother in 2016 when she gave birth to her son, Leo. At that time, there were no programs or policies supporting women athletes starting a family.

In 2019, the WTA introduced a protected ranking system for players on maternity leave. This allowed players to compete in tournaments without going through the qualification rounds, regardless of their ranking. However, it did not solve all the problems faced by a woman athlete who wanted to conceive a child.

Azarenka, a WTA players council representative, finally made it possible. What started as a personal passion project will now help hundreds of women athletes to start families without hesitation while still being able to compete at the highest level. Something that the Belarussian had envisioned years ago has now become a reality.

The five-time Grand Slam champion, Maria Sharapova, showed her enthusiasm by reposting the WTA tweet and wrote:

Another WTA player, Katie Boulter, who is currently ranked No. 38 in the world, also shared her enthusiasm by reposting and reacting to the WTA’s tweet.

Ons Jabeur, a Tunisian tennis player and former World No. 2, who had also raised her voice against the problem, was seen celebrating this initiative. She posted an Instagram story reacting to the program.

Judy Murray, Andy Murray’s mother and his former coach, also portrayed her happiness about the program through her Instagram story.

The widespread acknowledgment of the program showed its impact and significance. This will change how the players pursue their careers along with leading happy family lives. It is a huge step towards allowing the women tennis players to lead a life of their own choice without being bothered by external forces.

The former World No. 1 talked about how she was scared about being able to play the sport on the highest level again. While talking to CNN Sport, Victoria Azarenka said:

Azarenka had difficulty returning to the sport. Yet she battled through challenges to earn her place back in the tennis world, showing that motherhood and a career at the top of your sport are possible at the same time. She is ranked No. 35 in the world at the age of 35, which is quite impressive.

Victoria Azarenka's determination led to advocating the birth of a revolutionary policy that will shift the landscape of women’s tennis for generations. This initiative means that future players won’t have to choose between starting a family and maintaining their career, which was once an almost impossible thing to contemplate.

Modified Mar 7, 2025 | 12:30 PM EST

Paige Lorenze, the charming girlfriend of tennis star Tommy Paul, has carved out a niche beyond the tennis courts. As a successful influencer and entrepreneur, she founded the lifestyle brand Dairy Boy, reflecting her unique style and aesthetic. Lorenze’s passion for fashion and business shines through in her ventures, which include clothing, candles, and home decor. While she supports Tommy at tennis events, her interests extend beyond the sport, though she appreciates the athleticism involved. Her presence at tournaments has earned her recognition as a stylish and influential WAG. Now, she’s taking it to the next level with an exciting collaboration!

Remember when Paige dropped an electrifying teaser on her Instagram on February 28? She shared snapshots from the Indian Wells tournament, clipped onto a board from her home. What really caught attention was the photo hinting at a crossover between the ATP tournament and her burgeoning lifestyle brand, Dairy Boy. The title “Indian Wells x Dairy Boy March 2025” was emblazoned on a paper, showcasing sketches of potential outfits she might unveil during the tournament.

It turns out that teaser was more than just a hint! Known for its sweaters, tote bags, and jeans, Dairy Boy is now launching a new collection as the Official Merchandising and Player Gifting Partner of the Indian Wells Open. In a conversation with Forbes, Lorenze shared, “Over the past three years, my content as a creator has naturally reflected my life.” She began dating Tommy Paul in 2022 and has since been an integral part of his life, especially during his tournaments. Even taking tennis lessons from Paul, proudly noting her progress on Instagram: “T said I made a lot of progress 😂🤘🏼”

As she put it, “As the sport became a bigger part of my life, my content began to include more tennis, from style and travel to behind-the-scenes moments.” Remember when Lorenze stole the spotlight at the 2025 Australian Open with her flawless style while cheering on Paul? With over 800k Instagram followers, she shares snippets of her life with Paul, balancing personal and professional life. After his swift win over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Lorenze posted her outfit—a stunning black corset top with white shorts and heels—captioning it, “I’m out of captions 😀🎾.”

These moments inspired her to seize the opportunity with Dairy Boy: “When this opportunity came my way, it was an easy yes. It’s an honor to be recognized by my favorite tournament and to create something meaningful, not just for myself, but for the players, the fans, and simply for the love of tennis.” Now, her brand is launching its latest collection, the ‘Dairy Boy x Indian Wells’ collection. This exclusive drop features stylish crew neck sweaters, tote bags, and hats during the Indian Wells Open, which will be included in the gifting at the tournament for the players and various WAGs and available for purchase on the website!

It seems Lorenze is doing more than just supporting Paul, who is competing tomorrow against Tristan Boyer in the Round of 64. Her merch might just be the highlight to look out for, and Tommy is always down to support his partner’s move!

Is Paige Lorenze the ultimate WAG, blending fashion and tennis like no one else?

Debate

In January, Tommy Paul gave his girlfriend Paige Lorenze’s brand, Dairy Boy, a shoutout on Instagram. The clip teased a new clothing line set to launch on February 16, featuring Paige flaunting a yet-to-be-released pink outfit while riding a mountain bike. Paul hyped her up with a simple yet effective message: “Let’s gooo @dairyboy @paigelorenze.” Dairy Boy, founded by Lorenze in 2021, is a lifestyle denim, clothing, and housewares brand that aims to break the mold by embracing nature and life’s simple pleasures.

But on the same line, Lorenze has been a constant support for Paul as well. In 2023, she was at the Mexican Open, where Paul shared a humorous anecdote about her contribution to his match prep: “No one really knows how much we had to do to get ready for this match… I had my girlfriend and my trainer blow-drying my underwear this morning, trying to get me ready,” as reported by People Magazine. She also attended the US Open and the Australian Open, showcasing her unwavering support.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Nick Kyrgios continues Jannik Sinner feud in Tennis365 comments post,https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/nick-kyrgios-jannik-sinner-feud-in-tennis365-instagram-comments,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 10:32:10 GMT","

Nick Kyrgios has continued his criticism of world No 1 Jannik Sinner by suggesting the doping scandal was getting “more cringe every day”.

The three-time Grand Slam winner is currently serving a three-month suspension after reaching a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for failing two doping tests for the anabolic steroid clostebol last year.

But the length of the suspension, which sees Sinner return in time for the Italian Open and not miss a Grand Slam, has been criticised by many, particularly Kyrgios.

The Australian has frequently criticised the decision, saying at the time of its announcement that “fairness in tennis does not exist”, and now the 29-year-old has taken to the comments section of a Tennis365 post to continue his war of words with Sinner.

In a recent interview, Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill praised the reigning Australian Open champion’s maturity, saying the world No 1 gave him the following quote: “Don’t concern yourself with the criticism of someone that you wouldn’t take advice from.”

Cahill added that “this is coming from a 23-year-old. Because we have been talking about all the noise, some from players, some from coaches, some from the media around his particular case”

Underneath a graphic, Kyrgios responded: “Like his team that gave him a prohibited substance gets more cringe every day.”

Kyrgios’ initial criticism was put to Sinner but the 23-year-old maintained he does not care what other think.

“I don’t think I have to answer this, to be honest,” he said.

“How do I block it? It’s not that you just put it in a part and you just say I don’t think any more about this. In my mind I know exactly what happened, and that’s how I block it, no?

“I haven’t done anything wrong. That’s why I’m still here. That’s why I’m still playing. I don’t want to respond on what Nick said or what other players says.

“I think the most important part is to have my people around me who I can trust, people they exactly know what happened. That’s it.”

Kyrgios made the Instagram comment just hours before retiring from his opening round match at Indian Wells.

The Australian lost the first set 7-6 to World No 85 Botis van de Zandschulp before going down 3-0 in the second. After a wide backhand, the doctor was called onto the court to examine Kyrgios’ right wrist shortly before his retirement.

Kyrgios has yet to win a match in 2025 having lost in both the Brisbane International and the Australian Open in January. This latest injury comes after the 2022 Wimbledon finalist was forced to sit out the entirety of 2024 and there are now concerns about his long-term future in the sport.

“It’s all an experiment at this point,” Kyrgios said after his defeat.

“I was told I was arguably maybe not ever playing tennis again. [But] I feel I’m like right there. I feel like I can compete.

“I’m there, but if I’m not able to finish matches it doesn’t really matter at this point. I’m not too sure right now.”

                ""I literally don’t have a ranking at the moment, was out for one-and-a-half years, and I’m trying to work my way back.""            


                Alcaraz spoke about a controversial Indian Wells change - and Jannik Sinner's absence.            


                Alcaraz and Zverev could overtake the suspended Sinner as world No 1.             


                Sinner is currently serving a three-month suspension after settling his case with WADA.

Dark and Dangerous Shadow of Stalking Hovers Over Growth of Women's Sport

Reuters

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Emma Raducanu described being unable to see the ball through her tears after spotting a stalker at a match last month, and the image of the British tennis player taking refuge behind the umpire's chair encapsulated the darker side of women's sport.

On the eve of International Women's Day, women's sport is celebrating greater participation numbers and an unprecedented surge in popularity, but the rise of social media exposure and increased visibility have made women athletes more vulnerable than ever, experts say.

""People wanting photographs, people coming up close to (athletes), wanting to put their hands on them -- you've got a different dynamic with sports stars,"" safeguarding consultant Marcella Leonard told Reuters. ""There's an expectation that they should be nice to the public, they should allow the public to touch them, they should allow them to get photographs. 

""That gives a stalker the permission to do what they want to do and that's a really serious issue.""

Although one-in-five women in the UK will experience stalking at some point in their lives, there are no scientific studies around the stalking of athletes, Canadian forensic psychologist Sarah Coupland said in an interview with Reuters. 

Between 35% and 75% of people in the public eye such as politicians and television presenters, however, experience stalking, she added.

The 22-year-old Raducanu had not yet been born when world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by a fan in a 1993 on-court attack that brought the risk of stalking starkly into the public eye.

MULTIPLE STALKING INCIDENTS

Despite it being an under-reported crime, there have been countless stalking stories since, including several in the past few months.

Last month, Michael Lewis was arrested on a felony stalking charge after he repeatedly sent threats and sexually violent messages to Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark. The 55-year-old told Clark he had been ""driving around your house three times a day.""

In December, 40-year-old Robert Cole Parmalee pleaded guilty to charges of stalking University of Connecticut basketball player Paige Bueckers. Parmalee had posted on social media that he was travelling to Connecticut to propose to the player and to get her expelled from the university.

Last month, a distressed Olympic 200 metres champion Gabby Thomas posted on TikTok about her frightening experiences with a group of men who had stalked her at several airports. Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee and tennis player Coco Gauff were among the athletes who replied to her post, saying they had similar experiences while travelling.

Social media gives female athletes more exposure than ever, which is a double-edged sword as it opens up the possibility for fans to develop ""parasocial relationships,"" said Coupland. 

""You've got a person who's consuming a piece of media, and they start to form a one-way relationship,"" she said. ""The relationship is viewed (by the fan) as mutual, even though the (athlete) has no way of knowing that the person is actually there.""

BRAND EXPOSURE

Since athletes with large followings can amplify brands, sport sponsorship contracts usually require athletes to post on their social media platforms.

Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the UK-based Women in Sport charity, said sponsors and sport organizations need to stop pressuring female athletes. 

""It's just so wrong. The opposite should be true. Female athletes should be protected more and advised to do less exposing of their personal life,"" she told Reuters. 

""It's almost like as part of the mechanism for righting the wrongs of the past, where no investment or sponsorship were made in women's sport, women are expected to expose themselves to additional risk. It couldn't be more wrong, could it?""

The majority of stalking results in psychological harm, Coupland said. 

""Anxiety, potentially post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, depression, changes in functioning, ability to go to work, or in athletes' performance,"" she said.

Raducanu told reporters she ""could barely breathe"" when she spotted her stalker, who had previously approached her in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha, in the crowd at the Dubai Championships. 

It was not her first experience. Three years ago, another stalker Amrit Magar was given a five-year restraining order after he turned up at Raducanu's London house on several occasions, leaving unwanted gifts and cards and stealing personal items.

Some sport federations are ramping up their online protection of athletes. World Athletics recently offered 25 athletes year-round AI protection on their social media platforms after they were targeted by cyber bullies. 

The Premier League and Women's Super League have been monitoring players' social media accounts for several years.

President Donald Trump raged on Truth Social against “sleazebag journalists” for their portrayal of a moment with Chief Justice John Roberts. The situation was the result of a hot mic recording of Trump speaking to Roberts in the wake of Trump’s speech to Congress Tuesday night.

The moment, caught on tape, showed Trump shaking Roberts' hand and stating, “Thank you again. Thank you again. Won’t forget it,” while patting the Chief Justice on the arm. 

Multiple media outlets reported on the interaction, leading to widespread speculation about its meaning. Many interpreted Trump’s words as an expression of gratitude for the Supreme Court’s conservative-majority ruling, which granted him broad immunity from most criminal charges, both past and future.

Late Wednesday night, responding to the reports, Trump launched an attack on the media in a Truth Social post. “Like most people, I don’t watch Fake News CNN or MSDNC, but I understand they are going ‘crazy’ asking what is it that I was thanking Justice Roberts for?” Trump lambasted MSNBC. 

“They never called my office to ask, of course, but if they had I would have told these sleazebag ‘journalists’ that I thanked him for SWEARING ME IN ON INAUGURATION DAY, AND DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB IN SO DOING! The Fake News never quits!”

Notably, Trump received a series of Supreme Court wins, including a March 2024 ruling that blocked Colorado from removing Trump from its presidential election ballot for his role on January 6 and a July decision that freed former presidents from criminal prosecution for official actions, ending a federal case against the Republican.

Trump’s critics argue that the Court, under Roberts’ leadership, has repeatedly made decisions that have benefited him politically and legally.

Writing for The Atlantic, journalist Adam Serwer summarized the sentiment, stating, “We can’t know precisely what the president meant, but Trump does have a lot to thank Roberts for.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,"Can Melatonin Supplements ""Reverse"" DNA Damage Caused By Lack Of Sleep?",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/can-melatonin-supplements-reverse-dna-damage-caused-by-lack-of-sleep-7869105,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 09:09:46 GMT","

Sleep isn't just a luxury, it's a vital process that helps our bodies repair and rejuvenate. Researchers have started to uncover how the quality and timing of sleep can affect more than just how rested we feel – it might also affect the very blueprint of our cells: our DNA.

A new study from Canada found that melatonin, a hormone known for its role in regulating sleep, might help reverse some of the DNA damage caused by years of poor sleep.



Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland in our brains when darkness falls. It signals to our bodies that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep. Beyond its sleep-inducing properties, melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant.

Antioxidants help protect our cells from oxidative stress – a condition in which an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants can damage important cellular components, including DNA. Oxidative DNA damage is thought to contribute to the development of diseases, such as cancer.

Night-shift workers, who often battle irregular sleep patterns and diminished melatonin production due to exposure to artificial light, are at a particularly high risk.

Their disrupted sleep cycles can lead to a reduced ability to repair oxidative DNA damage, which might, over time, increase their risk of developing serious health issues.

In the Canadian study, 40 participants who regularly worked night shifts were given either a 3mg melatonin supplement or a placebo before their daytime sleep. The researchers then measured the repair of oxidative DNA damage by analysing levels of a marker known as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in urine samples. Higher levels of this marker indicate better DNA repair activity because damaged DNA is being successfully removed from cells.

The study found that during the period of daytime sleep, participants who took melatonin showed an 80% increase in urinary 8-OH-dG compared to those who took the placebo. This result, although described as “borderline statistically significant”, suggests that melatonin may boost the body's natural DNA repair mechanisms when the sleep schedule is disrupted. However, during subsequent night shifts – when melatonin levels naturally fall – the effect was not observed.

These findings are consistent with earlier research indicating that melatonin not only has antioxidant properties but may also boost specific genes involved in the repair process. Melatonin, then, appears to help the body recognise and get rid of damaged segments of DNA, potentially reducing the long-term risks associated with accumulated cellular damage.

When headlines claim that melatonin supplements “reverse DNA damage”, it's important to understand what that really means.

The study does not suggest that melatonin completely erases years of accumulated DNA damage. Instead, it points to melatonin's potential to enhance the body's repair capacity. For people who have suffered from years of poor sleep – whether due to night shifts, insomnia or lifestyle factors – melatonin might help mitigate further damage by improving the efficiency of the body's natural repair processes.

While the idea of reversing DNA damage is certainly appealing, more research is needed. The study was relatively small, and its participants were exclusively night shift workers – a group with unique challenges regarding sleep and circadian rhythms, the body's natural 24-hour cycle that controls sleep, wakefulness and eating.

Larger trials, exploring different doses and long-term use, will be crucial to determine whether melatonin supplementation can have a broader application for those who don't get enough sleep.

The research adds an interesting piece to the puzzle of how sleep and overall health are interconnected. Melatonin supplements are already widely used to help regulate sleep patterns and combat jet lag, but are only available on prescription in the UK.

This new evidence suggests that their benefits might extend beyond just helping you fall asleep – they could also play a role in maintaining the health of your DNA. While melatonin supplements might not completely “reverse” years of DNA damage from poor sleep, they do appear to boost the body's natural repair processes – a hopeful sign that improved sleep quality, aided by melatonin, could be a key element in our quest for better health.

That said, melatonin is not a magic bullet. A healthy lifestyle, including good sleep hygiene, balanced nutrition and regular exercise, remains essential for protecting your cells from damage.

Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss says Trump is ‘undermining the rule of law’ and weighs in on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the measles outbreak.

Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts

Democratic Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts is using his newfound power as a member on the Energy and Commerce Committee to push back against vaccine skepticism.

Auchincloss, a 37-year-old Harvard graduate and former Marine, is in his third term in office representing Massachusetts’ 4th District, an area reliant on the medical and education sectors. He is also the son of Hugh Auchincloss, who briefly served as acting director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases after Anthony Fauci resigned, and is distantly related to the Democratic dynastic Kennedy family.

Auchincloss is now using his background to heavily counter not only Trump but his distant cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

U.S. News & World Report sat down with Auchincloss in March to discuss the budget negotiations, how his district is being impacted by the mass layoffs and how he plans to defend vaccines and health care.

The following interview has been edited for clarity.

“Trump is undermining the rule of law, and he's raising costs on Americans.”

“Well, I'm not going to negotiate against myself. I don't want to see the government shut down. It's not good for my constituents. It's not good for the United States. But in order to vote for a bill to fund the government, there needs to be enforceable provisions about the president's respect for the law, and particularly his respect for the impoundment clause, which forbids him from impounding money that Congress has appropriated.

“We cannot cede the power of the purse. We cede the power of the purse, then we're a board of advisors, not a legislature.”

“Republicans control the House. They control the Senate, and they control the presidency. Everything that happens or fails to happen in Washington, D.C. is on the Republicans.”

“The core reality is that the executive branch has the benefit of the initiative. So the executive branch does things, the Supreme Court and the judiciary interpret the law and the legislature makes the law.

“So the feedback loops of executive action are very tight. He does something, boom, and it's out there in the world, and it happens. The legislature, the way it is constructed, has much longer feedback loops so I think what voters are responding to is the tight feedback loops from the executive versus the legislature and the courts.”

“Corruption.”

“Well, Massachusetts is an eds and meds economy, and so that has taken a blow.

“I was just speaking to tech transfer specialists at universities, they're the ones who take inventions in the lab and commercialize them into new businesses or help do that through intellectual property law and commercial investment.

“That whole ecosystem is being rattled right now. There is this general sense of uncertainty and lawlessness that is diminishing the animal spirits that drive a good economy.”

“Well, I can tell you what we're going to be hearing is home insurance and car insurance bills.

Between tariffs and reducing the labor force participation of migrants, we're going to see a double-digit spike in home insurance rates.

“The labor construction sector is the sector most dependent on migrant labor in the United States. So is lumber, steel, aluminum and semiconductors, which is what he's just slapped massive tariffs on.

“So home insurance companies are just gonna start sending out premiums that say to American homeowners, ‘this is what it's gonna cost in the future.’ And people are not gonna like the message from the future they're getting about the cost of living.”

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton Feb. 28, 2025



“We're going to protect science and children's health.

“Right now, the secretary is failing to unequivocally recommend the measles vaccine despite the fact that there are measles outbreaks in Texas and Georgia. He's doing the classic mealy-mouthed statement that anti-vaccine campaigners have long done, and if he persists, it's going to cost more children's lives.

“What he is doing is directly undermining public confidence in the MMR vaccine. So we're going to fight him tooth and nail on children's health. We're going to fight to protect the scientists, the EPA, the FDA and the CDC so that they can pursue evidence-driven policy insulated from politics and political interference.

“Finally, we'll look for where we can get something done in a bipartisan way. I’ll give one example: the MAHA (Make American Healthy Again) caucus in Congress is a strong supporter of community health centers (CHCs). They take up about 1% of U.S. healthcare spending, but treat 10% of American patients. If they want to work on ways to fund CHCs, I'll work with them on it.”

“He starts from a position of conspiracy and quackery, not from a position of science. So even when he ends up in the right place, as he does with chronic disease and rates of obesity and diabetes in the general population, it undermines the entire evidence-driven policy making and scientific enterprise that people should rely on with the Department of Health and Human Services.”

“He's not calling for people to get vaccinated.

“He is sowing uncertainty. He does not unequivocally state that it's safe and effective. There was no sentence in that op-ed that says, ‘parents, I recommend that you get your kid vaccinated.’”

“The thing I most proactively do is find the strongest counter argument to your point of view and really interrogate it. Whatever I believe, go out and find a really rigorous counter argument to it and grapple with it. Too few people in this building do that. I think that's an important way to legislate because it makes your legislation stronger and it makes your ability to defend the legislation stronger.

“What not to do?

“Don't count on Republicans to stand up to Donald Trump. I mean, the last 10 years have basically, you can sum it up as, will they stand up to him this time?”

Two Administrators Charged with Operating Multibillion-Dollar Crypto Money Laundering Service

US Department of Justice

The Justice Department announced today a coordinated action with Germany and Finland to disrupt and take down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations — including terrorist organizations — and sanctions violations. Since April 2019, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.

In conjunction with the operation targeting Garantex, the Department also announced the unsealing of an indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (previously Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident. Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex. Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda was Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.

Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims. According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform. For example, when Russian law enforcement sought records relating to an account registered to Mira Serda, Garantex provided incomplete information in response and falsely claimed the account was not verified. In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents, even while disclosing identifying information related to other accounts requested by Russian law enforcement.

On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and darknet markets. According to court documents, despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator’s personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities. Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex’s operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions. For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.

Despite doing substantial business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as required.

On March 6, U.S. law enforcement, led by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex’s operations. According to court records unsealed today, Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy were associated with the administration and operation of Garantex. The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes. Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

As part of the coordinated actions, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. U.S. law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, U.S. law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.

Besciokov and Mira Serda are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Besciokov is also charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.    

Supervisory Official Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant Director Michael Centrella of the USSS’ Office of Field Operations, and Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division made the announcement.

USSS and the FBI are investigating the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Bedell for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department’s National Security Division and Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance.

The Justice Department also recognizes the critical cooperation of the German Federal Criminal Police Office, the Frankfurt General Prosecutor’s Office, the Dutch National Police, Europol, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, and the Estonian National Criminal Police.

Finally, the Department thanks Tether and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic for their proactive assistance in this investigation.

Any individual who believes he/she is a victim whose funds were laundered through Garantex or who may otherwise have a claim to restrained funds should reach out to law enforcement via email address GarantexClaimants@secretservice.gov.

An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Just hours before the White House Crypto Summit, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a separate stockpile of other digital assets. The news plunged Bitcoin to $84,000 Thursday evening, however, as the federal government isn’t purchasing new bitcoins under the order; it’s merely establishing a reserve using its existing holdings. On Friday morning, Bitcoin was up 1%, hovering around $90,000.

Trump’s crypto advisor, David Sacks, stated on X that the Bitcoin reserve will be funded with Bitcoin already held by the federal government, seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

The Treasury Department will establish an office to manage the reserve. “Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency,” the order said. “Because there is a fixed supply of BTC, there is a strategic advantage to being among the first nations to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.”

Currently, the United States is the largest government holder of Bitcoin, with a staggering 213,297 Bitcoin in its possession, according to data from CoinGecko. At current market prices, this amounts to approximately $19.3 billion.

Most of these Bitcoin holdings have been acquired through cryptocurrency seizures, often stemming from law enforcement operations targeting illicit activities such as black-market trading and transactions on darknet markets.

Crypto leaders such as Coinbase (COIN+1.96% CEO Brian Armstrong, Strategy (MSTR-1.45%) executive chairman Michael Saylor, and Robinhood (HOOD-1.34% CEO Vlad Tenev will attend the White House Crypto Summit later today. They welcomed Trump’s move to create a strategic crypto reserve, calling it a historic moment for the crypto world.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Liverpool Confirmed Team News and Predicted XI vs Southampton,https://sports.yahoo.com/article/liverpool-confirmed-team-news-predicted-095000841.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 09:50:00 GMT","

As Liverpool prepare to host Southampton at the iconic Anfield, anticipation builds for what promises to be a thrilling Premier League encounter. The match, set for a 3pm GMT kickoff on Saturday, 8 March 2025, sees a Liverpool side well-equipped and looking to secure another victory in their impressive domestic campaign.

Liverpool’s manager, Arne Slot, faces minimal disruptions in his squad selection despite a few injury concerns. Notably, Tyler Morton, Joe Gomez, and Conor Bradley remain sidelined, whilst Cody Gakpo is still a doubt. However, the strength in depth of the squad means Liverpool still presents a formidable lineup. Predicted to start are Alisson in goal, with a back four of Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk, and Tsimikas. The midfield trio likely features Gravenberch, Mac Allister, and the attacking lineup is expected to include Salah, Jones, Diaz, and Nunez, forming a dynamic and potent offensive quartet.

Predicted XI: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, Van Dijk (C), Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Jones, Salah, Nunez, Diaz

Bench: Kelleher, Quansah, Robertson, Endo, McConnell, Szoboszlai, Elliott, Chiesa, Jota

Liverpool’s attacking force will be spearheaded by Mohamed Salah, joined by Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota, who recently shone in Paris. The inclusion of Jota alongside Salah indicates Slot’s trust in his attacking philosophy, further highlighted by Harvey Elliott’s recent heroics in France. Despite scoring a dramatic winner, Elliott may find himself on the bench, underscoring the depth and competition within the team. Slot commented on Elliott’s situation, stating, “I can understand that he is sometimes frustrated by the playing time he gets because he is a good player, but he is in competition for players that I hardly take off.”

Dominik Szoboszlai, known for his relentless energy and goal-scoring ability, is another player to watch. His role in midfield will be crucial in both orchestrating play and providing defensive stability.

Liverpool’s approach to this game will be critical, as they balance their Premier League ambitions with the upcoming Carabao Cup final against Newcastle. The management of player fitness and morale, particularly handling key figures like Salah and Jota, will be key to maintaining a strong end to the season.

Southampton, on the other hand, will not make the task easy. They come into this match aware of Liverpool’s high stakes and will likely look to exploit any signs of fatigue or distraction in the home squad. For Liverpool, maintaining focus and applying Slot’s tactical game plan from the outset will be imperative to secure three points.

While the match won’t be broadcast live in the UK, fans will undoubtedly follow the updates closely, as Liverpool seeks to consolidate their position at the top of the Premier League table. With a fully fit squad and strategic depth, Liverpool is well-positioned to tackle the challenges ahead, not just against Southampton but throughout the remaining fixtures of what could be a defining season.

As the Premier League season progresses, Liverpool’s consistency, depth, and tactical acumen under Arne Slot’s stewardship will be pivotal. This upcoming match against Southampton is not just another game; it’s an opportunity to demonstrate resilience, squad depth, and the strategic brilliance that Liverpool is known for in the modern football era.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

True Royalty TV co-founder Nick Bullen reveals the one lesson he believes the Duchess of Sussex should learn from her late mother-in-law's brief life. The Princess of Wales passed away on Aug. 31, 1997 at age 36.

Pamela Anderson's team is reacting to claims Meghan Markle copied the actress with her new lifestyle show, ""With Love, Meghan.""

Anderson released her own show, ""Pamela's Cooking with Love,"" in February, while Markle's hit Netflix on March 4. Some claimed Markle's show seemingly matched the ""Baywatch"" star's, sometimes ""frame-for-frame.""

However, Anderson's show co-creator did not seem to mind the accusations.

""We take pride in planting the first seeds – creating original, distinctive programming that audiences love – and it’s a compliment to see our work with Ms. Anderson resonate so strongly,"" Anderson's producer, Jesse Fawcett, told the Daily Mail.

MEGHAN MARKLE IN ‘DIRE SITUATION’ AMID REBRAND RIDICULE: EXPERT

Royal expert Neil Sean, in a video for his YouTube channel, called Markle’s show a ""frame-for-frame"" copy in some cases. 

""As you can see, Meghan has been inspired by her [Anderson’s] cookery show, right?"" Sean said, showing a shot of Markle high-fiving her guest on set next to one of Anderson high-fiving her guest. 

""There’s very little new in the world of cookery,"" he said.

""It’s difficult to reinvent it, but Meghan didn’t even bother with that. Clearly, she just got inspired,"" he said.

Sean said a ""very well-placed source"" told him Anderson is ""actually delighted with Meghan Markle. Well, maybe that’s stretching it a bit but, you know, kind of happy for this simple reason. You see, this has elevated Pamela’s show. You know, the sort of publicity she could have only dreamt about.""

""Not only that, this is going to be very successful for Pamela Anderson in effect, Meghan being inspired by Pamela's show,"" he added. ""It’s literally been an injection back into Pamela’s brand.

Despite being compared to Anderson's cooking show, Markle fell short of audience expectations. Many have criticized the Duchess of Sussex's Netflix endeavor as ""cringey.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard previously told Fox News Digital the show ""appears mundane and lacks wow factor.""

""Meghan seems eager to play the altruistic, kind soul, but it is a tad smarmy,"" she claimed. ""My toes are curling… This is so cringey and not fun at all. It feels too staged, and the tips and tricks are far too basic… Meghan comes across as a modern Stepford Wife.""

Regardless, Markle's show has been renewed for a second season. She shared the news Friday on Instagram.

""Lettuce romaine calm…or not(!) because I'm thrilled to share that Season 2 of 'With Love, Meghan is coming!"" she captioned a video of herself dancing.

Netflix revealed filming for season two has already wrapped and fans can expect the show to premiere in the fall.

Hannah Berner has apologized following her controversial interview with Megan Thee Stallion on the red carpet for the Vanity Fair Oscar Party.

On Sunday (March 3), Berner and her ""Giggly Squad"" podcast co-host, Paige DeSorbo, interviewed several Hollywood stars before they entered the Oscars after-party. 

The pair's interview with Megan Thee Stallion went viral due to comments Berner made toward the Grammy Award-winning rapper that social media users considered a ""microaggression"" and ""racist.""

""Your music has literally made me want — when I want to fight someone, I listen to your music,"" Berner told Meg, adding, ""When people are talking sh**, I go, 'Turn on Megan Thee Stallion!'""

Berner faced swift backlash for linking Meg with fighting, violence, and aggression when the ""Hot Girl"" is known for making music that empowers women to be confident and love themselves.

The podcast host and former reality television star addressed the backlash in a statement on her Instagram Story on Thursday (March 6).

""Interviewing Megan Thee Stallion was a dream of mine. I love her music and it's my go to whenever I need to boost my confidence before a show. Looking back at the interview, I wish I used any other word except 'fight' to describe how her songs impact me,"" Berner wrote.

""It was a careless choice of words and though there was no ill intent, I recognize and acknowledge that what I said has a deeper meaning and I am so sorry to Megan,"" she added. ""I appreciate everyone who brought this to my attention.""

During Sunday's interview, Megan appeared to respond to Berner's comments by diverting the conversation back to her message of self-love.

""You want to throw that fighting sh** out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad b****,"" the rapper said.

Social media users were more critical in their response to Berner's interview.

""Megan doesn’t have a single song about fighting,"" one social media user said.

""Meg was like “fight people? Girl, I make Bad Bih music. Do you see these nails? We don’t fight,"" another user added.

""Meg handled that micro aggression so well,"" a third user commented.

""The racism is loud,"" a fourth user said.

Ayrna Sabalenka definitely keeps heads turning left and right while she plays tennis all the time. Yet those swiveling heads might want to simply stop for a minute. Sabalenka showed off some striking looks along the beach.

These photos are part of a pictorial set that appear in ""Ocean Drive Magazine."" Taking a peek at these pictures might just add more fans to Sabalenka's 2.7 million followers on Instagram. In the first picture, Sabalenka has a blue-and-white-striped top on to go along with a blue bikini bottom.

Up next is a capture of the magazine's cover with her on it. Then, Sabalenka fans can get a glimpse of her in an orange bikini. She wraps up the photo share with a dress look that puts Sabalenka under the sun's warm rays. People catching her look here might feel a bit of warm feelings, too.

Sabalenka, 26, hails from Belarus. She proudly represents her home country while playing her heart out on the tennis court. Keep an eye on her if you're a tennis fan. If not, then checking out her Instagram on a regular basis might make you a new fan as well.

She's not shying away from showing off her beautiful side. Sabalenka knows that being herself away from the tennis game might endear herself to many others. Yet she knows that once she gets on the court, it's all business.

Joe is a freelance writer with The Sporting News. He has four decades of experience in the communications industry as a writer and editor.

Iran on Friday declined to resume negotiations on its nuclear programme with the United States if President Donald Trump continues to implement his “maximum pressure” campaign against it.

Trump wrote to Iran on Friday, asking Tehran's leadership to come to the negotiating table or face a military attack. “I've written them a letter, saying I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,” he told Fox Business.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AFP that his country will remain in contact with other negotiators under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, but not the US when Trump persists in ratcheting economic sanctions on his country.

“We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats, but it doesn't mean we will not negotiate with other parties; we are talking with the three European countries, we are negotiating with Russia and China, other members of the JCPOA, and these talks can continue, and I think we can reach a result from this path too,” Araghchi said.

“As long as the US government continues its pressure, we will also continue our resistance,” he added.

The foreign minister said that Tehran will respond to the language of respect and dignity like in the past, but not pressure and threats. He also urged Washington to observe the conditions of a fair and just negotiation.

“We are in close consultation with Russia and China, and we are continuing our discussions with other countries that are interested. It is natural that our points of view will be conveyed by these countries to the American government,” Araghchi said.

He also brushed aside Israel's threats to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, asserting that such installations are scattered throughout the country and well protected. “The first reason is that this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed,” he said.

Araghchi also said that Israelis have avoided such escalation so far as they are aware of Iran's ability to respond to military attacks ""very strongly and in a completely proportionate and balanced manner.

“I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region; not that we will do that. It is Israel's desire to involve the other countries in the region in a war. It is Israel's desire to draw America into a war. This is precisely an Israeli plan to drag America into war, and America is extremely vulnerable if it enters a war in the region. They themselves know this,” the minister said.

“I think that both Israel and America and others are fully aware of our capabilities, and therefore, if rationality prevails, even the permission for threatening Iran should not be given, let alone an actual military attack,” he added.

WASHINGTON — MAGA activists have turned against one of President Donald Trump's own appointees to the Supreme Court: Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Appointed by Trump in 2020, Barrett is a staunch conservative who has joined major rulings in which the court has moved U.S. law to the right, including on abortion and affirmative action.

But that's not enough for some of Trump's most aggressive supporters, who think the former Notre Dame Law School professor has been a disappointment. MAGA supporters see what some call an independent streak as a sign she isn't sufficiently aligned with or loyal to Trump.

""She is a rattled law professor with her head up her a--,"" said Mike Davis, who once clerked at the Supreme Court for Justice Neil Gorsuch and described Barrett as ""weak and timid.""

Barrett defenders have dismissed the attacks, scoffing at the idea that the justice’s conservatism is defined by how her decisions align with Trump and insisting Barrett won’t be affected by outside criticism. Barrett, reached via the Supreme Court, did not respond to a request for comment.

The anger from Davis and other right-wing personalities with large online followings stems mostly from a couple of recent high-profile, 5-4 decisions in which Barrett has been the deciding vote against Trump's side.

Swift and vicious reviews poured in from right-wing, Trump-allied figures this week when Barrett and other justices rejected a Trump administration attempt to avoid paying U.S. Agency for International Development contractors as ordered to by a federal judge.

""DEI judge,"" influencer Jack Posobiec posted on X, suggesting that Barrett was a ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" hire, presumably because she is a woman.

Trump at the time promised to pick a woman to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

""Amy Coney Barrett was a DEI appointee,"" another far-right influencer, Laura Loomer, wrote.

Her X post featured a photo of Barrett's family. Barrett and her husband have seven children, including two they adopted from Haiti, who are Black.

Even Barrett's brief interaction with Trump earlier this week, when he delivered an address to Congress, has been scrutinized by the online MAGA set.

""Look at how Justice Amy Coney Barrett looks at our duly elected President, the man who put her on the Supreme Court. She looks very bitter,"" Rogan O'Handley, an influential MAGA figure on X known by his handle DC_Draino, wrote in a post containing a video of the encounter.

One law professor, Josh Blackman at South Texas College of Law Houston, suggested that Barrett should step down from her lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court so that Trump can pick a replacement.

The White House did not respond to a message seeking comment. 

Barrett defenders have fought back, with Derek Muller, a Notre Dame law professor who studied under Barrett, saying in an interview he doubted she would be affected by the negative reactions.

""She has the resolve to be on the court just like the other justices do,"" he said. The justices know that ""unpopularity is not a measure of what a judge is doing,"" he added.

The conservative National Review also weighed in, posting a column Thursday titled “In Defense of Justice Amy Coney Barrett,” deriding the criticism as “nonsense.”

Barrett's USAID vote followed a decision in January when the court, once again split 5-4, rejected Trump's request to block a sentencing hearing in his criminal hush money case in New York. The decision prompted angry reactions from pro-Trump voices including Davis.

In both cases, Barrett joined fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority, aligned with the three liberal justices.

Even before those cases, Barrett has increasingly shown a willingness to separate herself from the right flank of the court with a considered and cautious approach.

What the online critics fail to address is that Barrett has consistently cast key votes in favor of conservative causes, including when the court overturned abortion rights landmark Roe v. Wade, ended affirmative action, expanded gun rights and undermined the power of federal agencies.

""It seems to me there is this impulse where personal loyalty to Donald Trump in an unquestioned way is seen as a requirement for a sitting justice on the Supreme Court. It doesn’t matter how conservative that person might be,"" said Anthony Kreis, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law.

The harsh criticism of Barrett comes amid a stream of similar and sometimes more violent rhetoric aimed at judges who have stymied Trump's agenda.  

Roberts recently warned that threats of violence and intimidation against judges have been increasing in recent years.

Barrett has spoken previously about how her appointment to the Supreme Court — and the security concerns that go with it — has affected her and her family.

Like all justices, she has protection not just at the court but also at her home in Virginia.

At a judicial conference last year, she recalled one of her sons asking her why she owned a bulletproof vest.

Security of the justices was in the spotlight three years ago following the leak of an early draft of the abortion ruling. Then, it was activists on the left who were angered by the decision.

An armed man was arrested outside the home of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and charged with attempted murder. Protesters also gathered outside several justices' homes, including Barrett's.

""After the attempted assassination of Justice Kavanaugh, we need to be vigilant about potential threats,"" Blackman said in an email.

But he stood by his criticism of Barrett, saying that some conservatives feel like they were misled about what kind of justice she would be.

""I think conservatives feel like there was a bait and switch,"" he added.

Country music singer-songwriter Ingrid Andress broke her silence for the first time on Thursday, nearly a year after she admitted herself to rehab following her admission that she had been ""drunk"" during her controversial national anthem performance at the 2024 MLB Home Run Derby.

Andress, 33, appeared on ""The Viall Files"" podcast this week to discuss the fallout from her performance and what transpired just before she took the field at Globe Life Field in Arlington in mid-July.

""That day started as a very – what seemed like a normal day,"" Andress recalled. ""At that point, like that day, I knew that I was drinking, but I was really loving the numbing feeling that I was having, and so I just didn’t stop.""

The four-time Grammy nominee explained that a recent split with her first manager and a breakup had prompted her to begin drinking excessively in the months leading up to her performance. She admitted that in her state at the time, she had been unaware of the crowd and fan reaction at home and had believed that she had ""kind of nailed it."" 

""It wasn’t until I woke up the next day where I was like ‘OK, this is so unlike me. This is not OK. I need help,’"" Andress said. ""I didn’t realize how much the video was going viral, because I had never experienced anything like that.""

Andress later admitted in a statement she shared on social media that she had been ""drunk"" while singing the national anthem. She said on Thursday that she had shared the statement while on plane to rehab.

INGRID ANDRESS ADMITS SHE WAS ‘DRUNK’ DURING MLB HOME RUN DERBY NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE, CHECKS INTO REHAB​​

""I'm not gonna bulls--- y'all, I was drunk last night,"" her statement read. ""I'm checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need. That was not me last night. I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country I love so much for that rendition. I'll let y'all know how rehab is, I hear it's super fun."" 

Andress said on Thursday that she had received an overwhelming amount of hatred and felt like ""America’s punching bag."" She joked that because of the political climate at the time, she took some solace in knowing that she could at least unify people on one thing. 

""I will say, at the time, politics was really bubbling, and I just feel like there was a lot of angst in general during that time. So, if anything, I feel like – I’m fine with being America’s punching bag, because for one moment, everybody was united in the fact that that was awful. So I feel like I united America in a way.""

Last month, Andress had the opportunity to redeem herself and performed ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at an NHL game in Colorado. She also released a new single earlier this week. 

She said on Thursday that after her stint in rehab and time with her family at home in Colorado, she felt ready to return.

""I spent a lot of time with family, and then I was like, ‘I think it’s time to re-emerge.’""

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration.

NEW YORK (AP) — Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing.

The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste.

“I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,” says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest.

Tobin’s job loss sent him scurrying to fill prescriptions before he lost his health insurance and filling out dozens of applications to find whatever work he can, even if it’s at a fast-food restaurant. But some relatives reacting to his firing as “what has to happen to make the government great again” has been one of the worst parts of the entire ordeal.

“They can’t separate their ideology and their politics from supporting their own family and their own loved ones,” says Tobin.

Kristin Jenn got a similar response from members of her family after she learned the National Park Service ranger job she was due to start had been put on hold by the billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency hiring freeze. She thinks it’s likely the job will be eliminated altogether.




As she has expressed her disappointment over potentially losing her dream job, some members of her mostly conservative family have unfriended her on social media. Others are giving her the silent treatment. Nearly all favor such cuts even if she’s a victim of them.

“My life is disintegrating because I can’t work in my chosen field,” says Jenn, 47, from Austin, Texas. “Lump on top of that no support from family – it hits you very hard.”

The strife has extended to Jenn’s mother, a former federal employee herself. When she has criticized the administration’s actions, her mother simply says she supports the president.

“She has somehow been convinced that public servants are a parasite and unproductive even though she was a public servant,” says Jenn.

The federal job cuts are the work of DOGE, which has been tearing through agencies looking for suspected waste. No official tally of firings has been released, but the list stretches into the thousands and to nearly every part of the country. 

More layoffs are expected as DOGE continues its work.

Eric Anderson, 48, of Chicago, was still absorbing the shock of being fired from his National Park Service job as a biological science technician when he came across his aunt’s social media post celebrating the DOGE cuts. The gist, Anderson said, was, “Man, it sure is great seeing all this waste being knocked off.”

He grows angry thinking about it.

“Do you think I’m a waste?” he says, his voice rising as he recalls the post. “There are a lot of people out there that are hurting right now that are not a waste.”

Erica Stubbs, who was working as a forestry technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Boulder, Colorado, is avoiding social media after seeing hate for federal workers.

Though most people in her life have been supportive since she was fired, some have made passing comments about the necessity of eliminating jobs like hers.

“What they tell me is it’s just cutting out the waste, the excess spending — that your job’s not that important,” says 27-year-old Stubbs. “I’m not saying it’s the most important job in the world but it’s my job. It’s important to me.”

Social media is teeming with posts reveling the layoffs and urging DOGE: “Fire more!” In a fiercely divided country, many saw the cutbacks through their own political lens.

One man’s devastation, it turns out, can be another man’s delight.

Riley Rackliffe, who was working as an aquatic ecologist at Lake Mead National Recreation Area in Nevada, was buoyed that his firing led so many friends and relatives to reach out, offering to pass his resume along, call their congressman or even help with his mortgage.

Mixed with that, though, has been the vitriol.

When his firing made the local news, a Facebook posting of the story led to a storm of comments deriding him and championing the layoffs. One person called Riley, who is 36 and holds a Ph.D., a “glorified pool boy” whose job nearly anyone could do.

Even some of Rackliffe’s friends paired their expressions of consolation for Rackliffe with support for cutting jobs they contended were unnecessary government bloat.

“Hey, I’m sorry you lost your job but I think we really need to cut out some of this waste in the government,” Rackliffe said one friend texted him, saying he supported DOGE’s aims. “He basically said, ’We’ve got to do this. We’ve got to rip off the Band-Aid.”

What stings most, Rackliffe says, is the contention that people like him were lazy and worthless, collecting big paychecks for meaningless work.

“It’s really hurtful for the president to insinuate that you don’t exist or that your job consisted of sitting at home doing nothing and cashing the paycheck,” he says. “I’d like to see him sifting through spiny naiad in 120-degree weather looking for parasitic snails. He’s the one that goes golfing on the government dime. I don’t even know how to golf.”

BEIJING — China's top foreign policy official, Wang Yi, cast Beijing as a force for good and blasted the U.S. for being ""two-faced,"" at a news conference during China's annual session of parliament on Friday.

Last month, the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports to the U.S., and on Tuesday added another 10%, arguing that China needs to do more to stop the flow of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the United States.

China has accused President Trump of using fentanyl as a pretext to threaten the country economically, and Beijing has retaliated with countertariffs and other measures.

Wang addressed the escalating trade war with the U.S. and promoted China as an ""anchor"" on the global stage as America retreats from international involvement. Here's what he had to say on five key issues.

Wang, who is a member of the elite Politburo and China's foreign minister, had very little positive to say about China-U.S. relations and instead offered criticisms of America's policies and exhortations for it to mend its ways.

Wang said the combination of tariffs on Chinese goods and Trump's expressions of willingness to have good relations with Beijing were incongruous.

""No country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing a good relationship with it on the other. Such a two-faced approach not only undermines the stability of bilateral relations but also fails to build mutual trust,"" he said.

On fentanyl, Wang said the problem is fundamentally the responsibility of the United States.

""In the spirit of humanitarianism, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S., and the U.S. should not repay goodwill with resentment or impose unjustified tariffs. This is not the behavior of a responsible major power,"" he said.

Wang said science and technology ""should not be tools for building iron curtains"" — a reference to a range of U.S. policies, including bans on the sale to China of the most advanced microchips.

""Wherever there is a blockade, there will be breakthroughs. Wherever there is suppression, there will be innovation,"" Wang said. ""High walls cannot block innovative thinking. Decoupling and severed links will only isolate those who impose them.""

More broadly, Wang took aim at the United States' confrontational approach to China.

""The U.S. should review what has been gained from years of tariff and trade wars. Has the trade deficit been reduced or increased? Has the competitiveness of manufacturing risen or declined? Has inflation improved or worsened? Have the lives of the people improved or deteriorated? Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations are mutual and reciprocal. Cooperation will lead to mutual benefit and win-win results, but if one side insists on pressure, China will take resolute countermeasures,"" he said.

Wang was asked directly whether Trump's retreat from multilateral forums, freezing of foreign aid and strained relations with allies presented a strategic opening for China on the global stage. He demurred.

""Imagine if every country prioritized itself above all else and placed blind faith in power and status — this world would regress to the law of the jungle, where smaller and weaker nations would bear the brunt of instability, and the international order and rules-based system would face severe disruption,"" Wang said.

He said major powers have a responsibility to fulfill their international obligations and act with accountability. ""Pursuing self-interest at the expense of others, or wielding power to intimidate, is unacceptable,"" Wang said.

China's stability will help ""anchor an uncertain world.""

Trump's tilt toward Russia has raised questions about him doing a possible ""reverse Nixon"" — i.e., cozying up to Moscow to isolate Beijing, flipping President Richard Nixon's script from the early 1970s, when the U.S. engaged in detente with China to pressure the Soviet Union, its primary Cold War rival.

But Wang said ""the historical logic"" of China's good relations with Russia was steadfast.

""I want to emphasize that regardless of changes in the international landscape, the historical logic of the China-Russia friendship remains unchanged and the internal driving forces behind our relationship remain strong,"" Wang said.

""Both sides have deeply reflected on historical experiences and have committed to long-term, good-neighborly relations, comprehensive strategic coordination and mutually beneficial cooperation. This approach best serves the fundamental interests of both peoples and aligns with the broader trends of global development and progress. China and Russia have established a unique model of engagement — one that is nonaligned, nonconfrontational and not directed at any third party,"" he said.

Wang said a ""mature, resilient and stable"" relationship ""will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be swayed by external influences. It is a constant in an uncertain world, not a variable in geopolitical competition.""

China has tried to position itself as a potential mediator able to help bring the war in Ukraine to an end, but since Trump's foreign policy shift toward Russia, Beijing has been left largely on the sidelines.

""China welcomes and supports all efforts aimed at achieving peace. However, it is also important to recognize that this crisis has deep and complex historical roots — it was not created overnight, and it cannot be resolved overnight,"" Wang said.

He said China is willing to work with the international community ""in line with the wishes of the relevant parties, to play a constructive role in achieving a lasting resolution.""

""The world must move toward a new security vision based on common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. Only by doing so can we achieve lasting peace and stability — not just in Eurasia but across the entire world,"" he said.

Wang was unequivocal when asked about Trump's plan to boot Palestinians from Gaza and turn the territory over to the U.S. to develop.

""Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,"" Wang said.

""Any attempt to forcibly change Gaza's status will not bring peace but will only trigger further turmoil. … The will of the people must not be violated, and justice cannot be ignored. If great powers truly care about the people of Gaza, they should push for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, increase humanitarian aid, uphold the principle of 'Palestinians governing Palestinians' and contribute to Gaza's reconstruction,"" he said.

In a speech before the United Nation’s General Assembly, a representative of President Donald Trump ’s administration rejected the U.N.’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Edward Heartney, a minister-counselor at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, called the 2030 agenda “a program of soft global governance that is inconsistent with U.S. sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans.”

Trump also said he’s “strongly considering” sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine, and he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal.

In economic news, uncertainty in world markets continues after Trump declared a weeks-long delay of tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada.

Here's the latest:

Travis Keith Lang, of Irmo, was arrested on Thursday and arraigned on Friday before a federal judge in Columbia.

The 47-year-old pleaded not guilty. He is being detained pending a bond hearing scheduled for March 14. The Secret Service is investigating.

A short indictment was filed in federal court on Tuesday. It says Lang threatened to “take the life of, to kidnap, and to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States.”

Lang filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president as a Republican in 2024. According to FEC filings, his only campaign donation was $6,000 he gave himself.

Trump denied reports that there was a clash between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk over sweeping government cuts during a Cabinet meeting at the White House this week.

“No clash, I was there,” Trump told reporters Friday afternoon.

Trump said immediately after the Thursday meeting that he instructed the Cabinet secretaries to work with Musk, the billionaire overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency’s widespread cuts to the government.

“Elon gets along great with Marco,” Trump said Friday. “And they’re both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.”

Trump announced that he’s creating a task force to prepare for the World Cup, which will be held in North America next year.

Soccer’s biggest tournament will have games spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico over the course of a month. It’s expected to draw millions of tourists to the continent from around the world.

Trump met Friday with officials from FIFA, the international soccer governing body.

“It’s a great honor for our country to have it,” Trump told reporters. He said he’d like to attend multiple games.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon cites what she describes as the Ivy League school’s failure to squelch antisemitism.

“Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus,” McMahon said in a statement Friday.

Columbia set up a new disciplinary committee and ramped up its own investigations of students critical of Israel, alarming free speech advocates. But Columbia’s efforts evidently didn’t go far enough.

Columbia has become the first target in Trump’s campaign to cut federal money to colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war. University officials vowed to work with the Trump administration to get the funding restored.

The 17 “sustainable development goals” included ending poverty, achieving gender equality and urgently tackling climate change.

The Trump administration now says it “rejects and denounces” them. Others included providing clean water and sanitation for all people, quality education for every child and promoting good health and economic growth.

Edward Heartney, a minister-counselor at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said these goals “advance a program of soft global governance that is inconsistent with U.S. sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans.”

U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said all 193 member states voted unanimously to deliver on the goals, and that the U.N. is holding onto it’s guiding principles “to advance a world of peace, prosperity and dignity for all.”

Fort Liberty’s short-lived existence came to an end Friday when the nation’s largest Army installation officially returned to its former name: Fort Bragg.

Christened a century ago to honor Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, the post in North Carolina was renamed in 2023 amid a drive to remove symbols of the Confederacy from public spaces.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s order reinstating the Bragg name instead honors Army Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II paratrooper and Silver Star recipient from Maine.

A few hundred members of the military and civilians gathered under black and yellow tents outside base headquarters to watch the ceremony.

But — at least for the moment — benefits for the nation’s more than 70 million Social Security recipients should still be on track.

On its website, DOGE lists 47 Social Security field offices set for closure across the U.S. The agency says some were unused or set to shutter before Trump took office, but Democratic are warning that constituents could suffer.

Earlier this week, a person familiar with the agency’s plans but not authorized to speak about them publicly said that the Social Security Administration was preparing to lay off at least 7,000 people from its workforce of 60,000.

Musk and Trump seem to differ a bit on the agency’s future: Musk has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme,” while Trump has said benefits “won’t be touched.”

Gina McCarthy, a former White House climate adviser and EPA administrator, is taking aim at President Trump for signing an executive order banning paper straws.

McCarthy, who served in two Democratic administrations, wrote in a sarcastic essay in McSweeney’s that only a man of Trump’s “stature, extraordinary power, intellect, sensitivity and unwavering focus on the needs of the American people” would find time to address the “insidious” issue of the “continued forced sucking of paper straws.”

Trump’s order will allow Americans to “fully embrace our patriotic duty to Make America Suck Again by ensuring that only plastic straws remain accessible in our towns, cities, states, businesses — and most importantly our schools,” she wrote.

Acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said in a note to staff that Noem’s treatment of transportation security officers aligns with a vision that aims at “maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.”

“By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,” Stahl wrote.

Breaking the contract, Stahl wrote, aims at “ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.”

Stahl said the agency “will establish alternative procedures” to address employee concerns and grievances “in a fair and transparent manner.”

The American Federation of Government Employees represents roughly 47,000 transportation security officers whose collective bargaining agreement is being unilaterally revoked by the Trump administration.

These workers are responsible for making sure every day that hundreds of thousands of passengers in airports nationwide don’t carry weapons or explosives.

The union said Noem is violating their right to collective bargaining and that the Trump administration “completely fabricated” its reasons for ending their union protections.

The AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal workers and has been pushing back on many of the administration’s cuts.

“Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action,” the union said.

President Donald Trump said Friday he plans to impose what he’s calling “reciprocal” tariffs on lumber and dairy imports from Canada as soon as later in the day or early next week.

Trump said the tax on these products would match Canada’s tariff rates in a possible escalation of a trade war that Trump started by imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada.

“They’ll be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it, and that’s what reciprocal means,” Trump said. “And we may do it as early as today, or we’ll wait till Monday or Tuesday, but that’s what we’re going to do.”

In his first statement since the board at the Virginia Military Institute voted against renewing his contract, retired Army Maj. Gen. Cedric T. Wins said the decision was “a partisan choice that abandons the values of honor, integrity, and excellence upon which VMI was built.”

“Unfortunately, the winds of resistance by the few have drowned out those who desire to bring the institute into the 21st Century,” wrote Wins, a 1985 graduate of the 189-year-old public college in the Shenandoah Valley that educated Gens. George Patton and George Marshall.

Schools and colleges across the U.S. have been rolling back diversity programs after President Trump threatened to pull federal funding.

The guidance, issued this week, escalates the role that Elon Musk’s efficiency group, known as DOGE, will play at the Environmental Protection Agency.

“Any assistance agreement, contract or interagency agreement transaction (valued at) $50,000 or greater must receive approval from an EPA DOGE team member,″ the EPA guidance says, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.

To facilitate the DOGE team review, EPA staff members have been directed to submit a daily one-page explanation of each funding action between 3 and 6 p.m. Eastern time. Other relevant forms also must be completed.

Trump spoke to reporters after sending a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new deal to restrain Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.

“Hopefully we can have a peace deal,” said Trump, who previously suggested the other option might involve the U.S. getting involved militarily in Iran.

“I’m not speaking out of strength or weakness. I’m just saying I’d rather see a peace deal than the other. But the other will solve the problem,” Trump said.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown is leading a coalition of attorneys general in a federal lawsuit filed late Thursday. They want the firings to stop and the workers to get their jobs back.

It says the mass firings of probationary employees is illegal, and will cause irreparable burdens and expenses on the states, which will lose tax revenue even as they support the workers’ rights to unemployment assistance.

Thousands of federal employees have been fired in Trump’s dramatic downsizing of the federal government. The lawsuit says the administration’s blanket claims of unsatisfactory performance are false, and that laws and regulations governing large-scale reductions in force must be followed.

The U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency cited “the Administration’s directive on support to Ukraine,” without elaborating.

The satellite imagery provider Maxar Technologies confirmed the U.S. decision to “temporarily suspend” the program. The loss of access was first reported by a Ukrainian website associated with its military, Militarnyi.

Western air-defense systems are crucial for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Ukraine has used Maxar’s images to plan attacks, see the results of their strikes and monitor the movement of Russian forces.

U.S. help is now uncertain under President Donald Trump, who held a tempestuous televised — White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump is planning to sign an executive order taking aim at a program that forgives student loans for people in public service careers.

White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf said the order aims to ensure people working for nonprofit organizations engaged in “improper activities,” such as illegal immigration, can’t have their loans forgiven.

It appears to be an attempt to target organizations working on causes Trump opposes.

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows people working for government or nonprofits to apply for the remainder of their loan to be wiped out after making 10 years of payments. It was created by Congress, so it’s unclear whether the Trump administration has authority to modify it.

A new Pentagon memo also says the cards now have a $1 limit.

Exemptions include travel “in direct support of military operations or a permanent change of station,” and the memo says senior leaders can issue additional guidance on what that covers.

The memo says any non-exempt worker now traveling must return “as soon as feasible.” Civilian employees also must cancel all future official travel reservations for anything that does not meet the exemption rules.

The credit card freeze is meant to comply with Trump’s DOGE mandate to cut costs as described in an executive order last week.

The State Department issued a broad exception to the order, and has not implemented the freeze.

The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, a centerpiece of Biden administration policy that cleared Congress with support from Republicans, was meant to make U.S. manufacturing more competitive with China and overseas producers.

Trump has since hailed foreign investment in U.S. chip production that began under Biden. But he insisted the legislation itself should be repealed “because it’s hundreds of billions of dollars and it’s just a waste of money.”

Trump talked up Friday’s jobs report that showed employers created 151,000 jobs last month, downplaying the possibility that tariffs or mass layoffs of federal workers would harm the economy.

“We’re here for just a little over four weeks and these are fantastic numbers,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.

Trump said his policies will create “a little bit of a disturbance” but will ultimately be beneficial.

“I think the labor market’s going to be fantastic but it’s going to have high paying manufacturing jobs,” Trump said.

The Trump administration is welcoming initial positive steps by the interim Syrian authorities and the global chemical weapons watchdog to address all remaining issues about ousted president Bashar Assad’s chemical weapons program.

U.S. deputy ambassador Dorothy Shea told the U.N. Security Council Friday that there is “a historic opportunity” to secure, declare and destroy any remaining chemical weapons under international verification.

Compliance is imperative, she said, “to ensure that any remaining elements do not end up in the wrong hands.”

Syria’s new rulers say they’re committed to destroying any remnants of Assad’s chemical weapons program, but Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani called for international help to bring justice to victims of Syrian chemical attacks.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright held a pep rally for expansion plans at a massive liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana.

Venture Global estimated that its $18 billion LNG expansion would enable exports of up to 20 million tons a year to Asia and Europe and generate 8.5 million tons of planet-warming emissions.

There’s strong local opposition. Watchdogs say Venture Global violated its permits thousands of times by flaring gas and releasing chemicals. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warned that “unfettered exports” could drive up gas prices for U.S. consumers.

But Burgum told reporters Thursday: “We can absolutely do both — we can sell energy to our friends and allies, we can lower the cost at home.”

As their party struggles to navigate the early days of Donald Trump’s second presidency, some Democrats are convinced their road to recovery lies in blaming Trump for the price of eggs.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year’s average of $3.17 per dozen.

Democratic officials shared new internal data showing voters are most worried about inflation and the cost of living. Democracy itself, by contrast, ranked No. 12. The party establishment’s focus on blaming Trump for inflation is a break with activists trying to mobilize against what they see as an existential threat — that Trump is a budding dictator has no regard for the Constitution.

Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who helped coordinate nationwide protests that put House Republicans on defense, said “bored, tired talking points” won’t stop authoritarianism: “It’s 2025 — this isn’t how politics works anymore.”

In a major attack on worker rights, the Department of Homeland Security says it’s ending the collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of frontline employees at the Transportation Security Administration who are responsible for keeping weapons and explosives off airplanes and protecting air travel.

The department’s announcement Friday says poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job, and that the contract was hindering the ability of the organization “to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.”

The director of the White House National Economic Council is cheering Friday’s report: U.S. employers added solid 151,000 jobs last month.

Kevin Hassett said that’s “really, really impressive” while noting that the mass federal firings Trump has championed likely won’t be reflected in jobs figures until next month or later.

Hassett acknowledged that the Biden administration had “some strong jobs numbers” too, but asserted that they were based on government employment, while Trump has promoted manufacturing and the private sector.

The report came in below the 160,000 jobs economists had expected for last month. Unemployment also rose slightly, to 4.1%.

A separate court order out of New York still puts limits on what Elon Musk ’s team can do inside the Treasury Department’s systems, however.

In Washington, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly previously restricted DOGE to two employees with read-only access. She declined Friday to grant a longer-term block, however. Her decision comes in a lawsuit filed by retirees and unions who fear DOGE’s activities could expose sensitive information.

Kollar-Kotelly found that concerns about DOGE are “understandable and no doubt widely shared,” but she hasn’t yet seen evidence of serious legal harm that would justify barring the team. She invited plaintiffs to return if more immediate risks emerge.

A labor union says 85 immigration courts employees have accepted Trump’s financial incentives to resign.

They include 18 judges, one assistant chief immigration judge and 66 support staff in a court system that typically takes years to decide each asylum claim.

Shortly after Trump took office in January, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review fired 20 judges without explanation, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers.

“This makes no sense,” said Matt Biggs, the union president. “Immigration judges are hard to replace given their specialized knowledge and legal experience. It takes at least a year to recruit, hire, train and conduct a background check on a new judge.”

Trump said he is “strongly considering” sanctions and tariffs on Russia in hopes of forcing a settlement to the war in Ukraine.

He said in a post on Truth Social that they could remain in place “until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.”

The post came as Trump faces criticism for increasing pressure on Ukraine to reach a deal while downplaying or even denying Russia’s responsibility for starting the war with its invasion three years ago.

“To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late,” Trump added.

Scrambling to replace their health insurance and to find new work, some laid-off federal workers are running into another unexpected unpleasantry: Relatives cheering their firing.

The country’s bitterly tribal politics are spilling into text chains, social media posts and heated conversations as Americans absorb the reality of the government’s cost-cutting measures. Expecting sympathy, some axed workers are finding family and friends who instead are steadfast in their support of what they see as a bloated government’s waste.

“I’ve been treated as a public enemy by the government and now it’s bleeding into my own family,” says 24-year-old Luke Tobin, who was fired last month from his job as a technician with the U.S. Forest Service in Idaho’s Nez Perce National Forest.

Trump’s comments about the letter to Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei were not immediately confirmed by the supreme leader.

Trump made the comments in an interview aired Friday by Fox Business News.

The White House confirmed Trump’s comments, saying he sent a letter to Iran’s leaders seeking to negotiate a nuclear deal. Trump made the comments in an interview that will air fully Sunday.

Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency reported on Trump’s comments, citing the broadcast. However, there was no immediate word from the office of the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has final say over all matters of state.

After European leaders committed Thursday to freeing up hundreds of billions of euros for security, Trump said he was “not so sure” that the military alliance would come to the United States’ defense if the country were attacked.

Here’s a look at how some EU leaders responded:

1. “We are loyal and faithful allies,” French President Emmanuel Macron said late Thursday, expressing “respect and friendship” toward U.S. leaders and adding that France was “entitled to expect the same.”

2. Māris Riekstins, Latvia’s ambassador to NATO, stressed the military alliance remained the most important platform for addressing transatlantic security issues. He emphasized the commitment from his country — which shares a nearly 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia — to defense spending.

3. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said his country would raise defense spending to reach NATO’s target faster than previously committed. But he did not specify when the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy — and NATO laggard — would hit the 2% of GDP military spending target.

WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it’s important for U.S. trade partners not to panic and engage in tit-for-tat measures but to embrace dialogue in reaction to Trump’s threats in recent days to impose tariffs.

Okonjo-Iweala preferred to describe the threats and reversals as “disruptions.”

“I think we need to listen to the United States and listen to what their concerns are, and say, ‘how can we also help them deal with their concerns,’” she said, speaking during a discussion alongside former German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the WTO headquarters in Geneva.

Wall Street is poised to open with gains Friday after another U.S. pivot on tariffs kicked off the third market sell-off in four days.

Futures for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.2%. Nasdaq futures rose 0.4%.

However, the high growth, tech heavy Nasdaq tumbled 4% into correction territory this week. The S&P shed. 3.6% over the last four days and closed at its lowest point since early November on Thursday. The Dow has slid about 2.9% since Monday.

The U.S. on Friday releases February employment numbers, which will show how many workers U.S. employers hired. Economists believe hiring accelerated last month.

Canada’s initial retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. will remain in place despite Trump postponing 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada for a month, two senior Canadian government officials said.

Two senior Canadian governments official told the Associated Press that Canada’s first wave of response tariffs will remain. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Canada’s initial $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) worth of retaliatory tariffs have been applied on items like American orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, appliances, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and certain pulp and paper products.

References to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan and the first women to pass Marine infantry training are among the tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge diversity, equity and inclusion content, according to a database obtained by The Associated Press.

The database, which was confirmed by U.S. officials and published by AP, includes more than 26,000 images that have been flagged for removal across every military branch. But the eventual total could be much higher.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks.

Billionaire Elon Musk is telling Republican lawmakers that he is not to blame for the firings of thousands of federal workers, including veterans, as pushes to downsize the government. Instead, he said in private talks this week that those decisions are left to the various federal agencies.

The message from one of Trump’s most influential advisers came as Republicans publicly support Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency digging up waste, fraud and abuse, but are privately raising questions as personnel cuts ripple through communities across the nation.

It’s a remarkable shift of emphasis away from the chainsaw-wielding tech entrepreneur whose vast power has made him an admired, revered and deeply feared figure in the second Trump administration.

European Union leaders on Thursday committed to bolstering the continent’s defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security after Trump’s repeated warnings that he would cut them adrift to face the threat of Russia alone.

With the growing conviction that they will now have to fend for themselves, countries that have faltered on defense spending for decades held emergency talks in Brussels to explore new ways to beef up their security and ensure future protection for Ukraine.

The resulting pledge underscored a sea change in geopolitics spurred on by Trump, who has undermined 80 years of cooperation based on the understanding that the U.S. would help protect European nations following World War II.

The order, issued Thursday, impacts nearly $2 billion in debts to partners of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department, giving the Trump administration a Monday deadline to repay the nonprofit groups and businesses in a lawsuit over the administration’s abrupt shutdown of foreign assistance funding.

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali described the partial payment as a “concrete” first step he wanted to see from the administration, which is fighting multiple lawsuits seeking to roll back the administration’s dismantling of USAID and a six-week freeze on USAID funding.

The ruling came a day after a divided Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to freeze funding that flowed through USAID. The high court instructed Ali to clarify what the government must do to comply with his earlier order requiring the quick release of funds for work that had already been done.

Ali’s line of questioning in a four-hour hearing Thursday suggested skepticism of the Trump administration’s argument that presidents have wide authority to override congressional decisions on spending when it comes to foreign policy.

President Donald Trump on Thursday postponed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from a broader trade war.

The White House insists its tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl, but the taxes proposed by Trump have caused a gaping wound in the decades-old North American trade partnership. Trump’s tariff plans have also caused the stock market to sink and alarmed U.S. consumers.

In addition to his claims about fentanyl, Trump has insisted that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. He emphasized while speaking in the Oval Office that he still plans to impose “reciprocal” tariffs starting on April 2.

“Most of the tariffs go on April the second,” Trump said before signing the orders. “Right now, we have some temporary ones and small ones, relatively small, although it’s a lot of money having to do with Mexico and Canada.”

Canada has blocked imports from the biggest U.S. pork processing plant, a facility run by Smithfield Foods in Tar Heel, North Carolina, the company said on Friday.

The suspension comes as Washington and Ottawa have sparred in a heated dispute over trade tariffs.

It is the latest blow for America’s farm sector, which has been roiled by concerns that U.S. tariffs will spark retaliation from top importers that reduces demand for American agricultural products.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the suspension was in line with standard protocols and unrelated to recent trade activity. The agency and Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork processor, did not specify what triggered Canada’s action.

“Under Canada’s policy, three noncompliance issues within six months trigger a temporary suspension,” USDA said.

Blocking shipments from the plant limits a market for U.S. pork products.

USDA is working with Smithfield to address the issues and develop a corrective action plan that will be communicated to Canadian authorities, according to an agency statement.

“Once reviewed and accepted, Canada may consider reinstating the plant’s export eligibility,” USDA said.

Canada halted imports from the facility on Thursday, according to a USDA website.

“The issue pertains to a limited number of certain offal shipments,” Smithfield spokesman Jim Monroe said.

Smithfield shares were nearly flat on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump exempted goods from Canada and Mexico on Thursday under a North American trade pact for a month from the 25% tariffs he imposed earlier this week.

Canada was the fifth-largest export market for U.S. pork last year, according to U.S. government data. Though shipments slipped, they were valued at about $850 million.

U.S. pork has a significant presence in the Canadian retail and foodservice sectors, said Joe Schuele, spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation, an industry group.

Smithfield, whose brands include Eckrich and Nathan’s Famous, returned to a U.S. exchange in January after more than a decade, in a spinoff by Hong Kong-based WH Group 0288.HK.

WASHINGTON (KXXV) — According to a database obtained by The Associated Press, the Defense Department is set to delete tens of thousands of photos and online posts, including references to a World War II Medal of Honor recipient, the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, and the first women to complete Marine infantry training, as part of an effort to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion content.

The database, confirmed by U.S. officials and reported by AP, identifies more than 26,000 images flagged for removal across all military branches, though the final total may be even higher.

The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes many posts that mention various commemorative months – such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women.

However, a database review also underscores the confusion among agencies about what to remove following Trump’s order.

It should be noted that theU.S. Department of Defensestill recognizes World War II war heroes as of Friday, 7, 2025.

President Donald Trump’s company sued Capital One Financial Corp., accusing it of illegally “de-banking” him for political reasons by abruptly canceling hundreds of accounts associated with his sprawling real estate business after his first term ended in 2021.

The Trump Organization had been doing business with Capital One for decades and was holding millions of dollars in its accounts when, “without warning or provocation,” the bank cut ties on March 8, 2021, according to the lawsuit, filed Friday in Florida state court. The termination of the accounts led to “considerable financial harm and losses,” interrupting the business’s access to banking services, the suit claims.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Delaware approves $30.2 million taxpayer-funded grant for Merck to build in state,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/money/business/2025/03/06/merck-manufacturing-facility-delaware-council-development-finance-grant/81358137007/,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 20:24:29 GMT","

Pharmaceutical giant Merck received a $30.2 million grant from the state in an effort to sway the company to build its $900 million manufacturing facility in the Wilmington area.

The taxpayer-funded grant is the highest amount that has been doled out to a company since Bloom Energy’s approval in 2011.

Merck & Co. has not confirmed whether or not it will choose Delaware as its place to expand, but business leaders in Delaware are optimistic about what the potential move could mean for the state.

Merck & Co. is a global health care company that specializes in the production and distribution of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and animal health care products.

Merck has been looking for a location to set up their newest manufacturing facility, which will produce drug substances and products with a targeted operational start date of 2030.

According to plans shared with Delaware Online/The News Journal via a Freedom of Information Act request, the company is considering constructing a $900 million multi-building complex for labs, manufacturing and distribution operations at the Chestnut Run Innovation and Science Park near Greenville.

Under the conservative estimates listed in the plans, the facility would bring roughly 375 full-time jobs to the area.

The company is reportedly still considering other locations, but is bound by nondisclosure agreements to reveal more about the other possibilities, as reported by the Delaware Business Times.

If Merck chooses the Delaware site, the company would be locked into a 20-year lease at the CRISP campus.

This wouldn’t be Merck’s first venture into the First State, however. The company already has an animal health facility in Millsboro.

The Delaware Council on Development Finance unanimously approved the grant application on Monday, Feb. 24.

The grant was divided into $4.7 million worth in job performance grants and $25.5 million in capital expenditure grants. The performance grants are dispersed after the company makes its investments into the facility and workforce.

Although nothing is promised yet, Michael Fleming, president and CEO of the Delaware Bioscience Association, remains optimistic and said that this deal could cement Delaware as a winner in the area in terms of attracting industrial and scientific investment.

“This new facility would be a tremendous boost for and validation of the growth and momentum of our dynamic life science industry,” Fleming said. “We look forward to welcoming Merck and applaud their interest in strengthening U.S. manufacturing and our supply chain right here in Delaware.

Susan Colby, senior manager of communications for the Delaware Prosperity Partnership echoed that the move would boost Delaware’s portfolio.

“This project would reinforce Delaware’s standing in the global biopharmaceutical ecosystem, and we are excited by the potential opportunities it would provide Delaware residents and businesses,” Colby said.  

As for what Merck has to say about the grant, Ned Ehrbar, associate director of Merck’s global media relations kept it vague, stating via email: Merck is considering Delaware as a potential location to develop a new commercialization and launch facility.

The CRISP campus, located at 984 Centre Road just outside of Greenville, has long been a mainstay in the state’s evolving life sciences investment.

Formerly a site for DuPont research, the 164-acre site was purchased by MRA Group in 2021 with hopes of transforming the site into the leading campus for Delaware’s life science laboratories and research facilities.

Amenities for the campus will include a hotel, childcare and fitness centers, an outdoor amphitheater and accommodations for restaurants.  

Chemical manufacturing company Solenis expanded its research and development facilities into the CRISP campus in late 2022 and precision oncology company Prelude Therapeutics cut the ribbon on their new headquarters at CRISP in February, 2024. DuPont is also leasing 190,000 square-feet of space at its former space.

Last month, the developer group broke ground on the Marriott Residence Inn, which will feature 127 rooms with both short- and long-term stay options, food services, a full-service bar, meeting spaces and outdoor patios

MRA Group declined to comment on the recently approved grant for Merck.

Awarding these grants worth tens of millions of dollars involves a process that is relatively new, with various “checks and balances” in place, but limited transparency at times.  

The Delaware Economic Development Authority was created by the General Assembly under former Gov. John Carney, intended to promote economic activity in Delaware. It is chaired by CJ Bell, the director of the Delaware Division of Small Business.

The Council on Development Finance is an advisor to the Delaware Economic Development Authority, and is responsible for conducting public hearings before the authority issues any financial support to potential projects.

The Delaware Prosperity Partnership, a nonprofit state economic development agency, often vets applications or potential investment opportunities and brings them to the Council. As previously reported by DelawareOnline, since DPP is not technically a part of the state government, it is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

In the seven years of its existence, the Council on Development Finance has approved every Strategic Funds application that has been brought to it by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.

The $30 million grant offered to Merck will be reimbursed after the company makes its investment – in this case, a nearly $1 billion one.

In 2021, the Council on Development Finance approved $19 million for WuXi AppTec, a Shanghai-based company that develops and manufactures drugs for pharmaceutical clients, to build its manufacturing campus near Middletown’s Amazon fulfillment center.

Gov. Matt Meyer has gone on record against these types of taxpayer-funded grants, announcing during a Delaware State Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that his administration will see “the use of cash assistance de-emphasized,” as reported by Spotlight Delaware.

Meyer’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the most recent grant funding.

PostNord will stop delivering letters to Denmark at the end of 2025, though package distribution will remain

COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- No more mail for Denmark: PostNord will stop delivering letters to the Nordic nation at the end of 2025, though package distribution will remain.

PostNord, a state-run agency that services Denmark and Sweden, announced the change Thursday. Roughly 1,500 mailboxes throughout Denmark will be taken down in the second half of the year, and Danes can seek refunds for stamps. An estimated 1,500 of PostNord’s 4,600 employees will be laid off this year.

Sweden’s letter delivery will not be affected, the agency said.

PostNord said the number of letters in Denmark has decreased by 90% since 2000, and by more than 30% in 2024 compared with the year before. The agency blamed an increasingly digital atmosphere in Denmark and worldwide, and 2024 Danish legislation that drove the cost of postage up.

“We have been the Danes' postal service for 400 years and therefore it is a difficult decision to put a bow on that part of our story,"" PostNord Denmark chief executive Kim Pedersen said in a news release. ""The Danes have become more and more digital which means that there are very few letters left for us to handle today, and the downturn continues so clearly that the market for letters is no longer profitable.”

Pedersen said the heart of PostNord's business is parcel delivery, which it will focus on in 2026.

Pelle Dragsted, a member of the Danish parliament, wrote on social platform X that the cessation of letter delivery will unfairly affect Danes who live in remote areas.

Letters can still be sent through private companies, Danish public broadcaster DR reported. The state will ensure that infrastructure remains for mail to be delivered to Denmark’s remote areas, including smaller island communities.

Pedersen also told DR that people can send their letters as packages through PostNord’s parcel shops.

Germany's Deutsche Post also announced layoffs on Thursday, with plans to cut 8,000 jobs

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,"Why the 'Trump put' for investors might be found in Treasuries, not the stock market",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-trump-put-for-investors-might-be-found-in-treasuries-not-the-stock-market-182109383.html,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 08:41:05 GMT","

Investors anxious for President Trump to return to his first-term playbook of tweeting about the stock market may have quite a wait ahead of them.

While tariffs have hit equity prices hard in recent weeks, a growing number of Wall Street strategists point to Trump's likely first order of business: lowering bond yields — even if it comes at the expense of a falling S&P 500 (^GSPC).

On Thursday, the broad-based index sank to its lowest level since November, bringing year-to-date losses to nearly 2.5%.

""It’s reasonable to think that the index has to fall quite a bit more before Trump views it as a concerning signal,"" Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote earlier this week.

""What we conjecture is that the relevant Trump put right now is for Treasuries, and that lower yields, not higher stock prices, are the best market indicator of success for Trump 2.0 policies,"" he added.

One important point to keep in mind: The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield is a benchmark for borrowing costs. A decrease in bond yields signifies lower costs for the refinancing of debt. On Thursday, the 10-year rose for a third straight session to 4.28%, but sat lower than the yield of more than 4.6% when Trump took office.

Draho added that ""the best indication of a Treasury put is that Trump himself has tweeted very little about stock market performance, instead posting more often about the debt ceiling and government spending.""

In front of Congress on Tuesday, Trump said, ""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening and it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we are okay with that. It won’t be much.""

When asked about the impact of tariffs on falling equity prices, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also telegraphed that the White House's priority in the short run isn't the stock market.

“Over the medium term, which is what we’re focused on, it’s a focus on Main Street,"" Bessent told ""Fox & Friends"" earlier this week. ""Wall Street’s done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers, so we are going to rebalance the economy.”

The presumption is that if the economy slows enough, the Fed would step in to lower rates, while tax cuts and deregulation would spur growth. ""Rather than slower growth being deemed a policy error, Trump may view this as a necessary precursor to higher future growth,"" Draho wrote.

""Investors, being impatient, would be more forgiving of this approach if it was coupled with future growth-enhancing policies such as tax cuts and de-regulation. Those policies are likely to come later in the year, an important sequencing that investors should not forget as they assess current growth,"" he added.

In a note on Wednesday morning, Nomura managing director Charlie McElligott wrote that a ""negative wealth effect"" is something the Trump administration is ""actively acknowledging in order to rebalance the US economic hierarchy, as he attempts to shift growth from being dependent upon Government spending excess into something that is driven more by the private sector.""

""This is hugely risky without a doubt,"" wrote McElligott. ""And there is a price for everything, i.e. in the case of an increase in the speed/velocity of market shocks, which can then absolutely force him to trial-balloon softer, 'conciliatory' tones.""

Those concessions started on Wednesday when the Trump administration gave a temporary exemption to the Big Three automakers after forging ahead with 25% tariffs against trading partners Canada and Mexico.

On Thursday, President Trump said he would pause tariffs on some Mexican goods, and the White House later said the delay also includes goods from Canada.

Star Entertainment will receive a $53 million lifeline, with its Hong Kong joint venture partners confirming they will buy its stake in the Brisbane Queen's Wharf development, pulling it back from the brink of collapse.

Australian shares fell to its lowest close in more than six months, wiping off about $50 billion in market value.

The price of Bitcoin plummeted on Friday after US President Donald Trump's administration signalled it would not acquire additional cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve beyond its current holdings.

Australia's share market fell to its lowest close in more than six months.

The ASX 200 and the All Ordinaries index both ended Monday's session 1.8 per cent lower, wiping off about $50 billion in market value.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index fell 1.8 per cent, or by 146.5 points, to 7948.2 at close - the worst fall for the Australian indices since September last year.

The index is down more than 7.5 per cent from its all time high of 8,615.2 on February 14, and has fallen for four straight sessions amid uncertainty over US trade policy announcements.

The Australian dollar was 1.7 per cent stronger against the greenback for the week, buying 63.06 US cents.

Embattled casino group Star Entertainment will stay alive, for now, after securing a $53 million lifeline in return for selling its 50 per cent stake in the new Brisbane casino.

Star has been in talks with the owners of the other half of Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development — Hong Kong investors Far East Consortium International and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises — since mid-February.

On Friday afternoon, Far East Consortium confirmed a deal had been struck, in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Under the deal, in return for Star Entertainment's 50 per cent stake in the Queen's Wharf precinct, it will acquire the Hong Kong parties' two-thirds stake in the Gold Coast project.

It's known that rebuilding efforts from natural disasters positively impact GDP (i.e. bump it up) since the recovery expenses are counted but the losses are not. Are there any estimates for the net effect on GDP of natural disasters like cyclones or floods?

- Charles

Thanks for the question Charles.

From time to time the ABS measures natural disasters such as droughts, cyclones, floods and storms with the associated impacts reflected in economic statistics.

As it notes on its website, ""these events will have had an impact on all aspects of the Australian economy to varying degrees"".

Sometimes the impact is identifiable in ABS's various statistical releases after the event.

Sometimes, the modelling looks at the impact of one-off large scale disasters like cyclones. So that could very well happen in the coming months.

The Insurance Council also often puts out detailed reports on the economic impacts of natural disasters.

We will keep an eye out for any reports and report them for you over the coming weeks and months.

In the meantime, you could listen to this podcast re Why Cyclone Alfred could boost the next GDP figure.

National credit card debt hit $18 billion in January 2025 — the highest level of debt accruing interest since August 2021.

The Reserve Bank's credit card statistics showed credit card debt accruing interest rose by $172 million (up 1 per cent) in January.

It is the fourth consecutive month credit card debt has risen (excluding commercial cards).

Canstar analysis of RBA figures shows credit card debt attracting interest charges has risen every January since 2015.

Australians are paying $9.2 million in interest charges per day on a collective credit card debt of $18.02 billion, at the average interest rate of 18.71 per cent.

""That's money that could be far better spent on groceries, rent or mortgage repayments.,"" Canstar's Sally Tindall said.

The total value of credit card transactions rose by $21 million in January compared to the previous month.

Overall, spending on both debit and personal credit cards rose by $207 million in the month and $3.1 billion compared to the same time one year ago.

Canstar analysis of RBA credit card statistics and in-house survey data shows that of those with credit card debt, the average amount owing is estimated to be $4,420.

Costco Wholesale would consider making changes to its international supply chain if tariffs from US President Donald Trump lead to big price hikes, chief executive Ron Vachris said on a conference call.

The membership-only retailer missed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit, but beat expectations on revenue.

Mr Vachris said while it was difficult to predict the impact of tariffs, about a third of Costco's sales in the US are imported from other countries and less than half of those are items coming from China, Mexico and Canada.

Costco could mix up its supply chain if tariffs prove painful, he said, and source from countries not exposed to them.

""As far as the tariffs go on the grocery items, our buyers deal with those like they would any other cost increase,"" he said.

""Sometimes the margins are much tighter in those categories, but they [buyers] are prepared to work closely with the suppliers and see how efficient we can bring goods to market - is there anything we can mitigate in those categories.

""The tariffs are very fluid right now. So it's hard to really give any predictions on what we can do, but we are prepared, our people are very well equipped to lower prices and defer any cost increase that come our way.""

Costco currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand and Sweden.

The retail giant's second-quarter revenue increased to $US63.72 billion, from $US58.44 billion during the same quarter in fiscal 2024.

Net sales for the quarter rose 9.1 per cent to $US62.53 billion, compared to $US57.33 billion in the year-ago period.

Membership fees for the quarter hit $US1.19 billion, up from $US1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with the company reporting 78.4 million paid memberships and 140.6 million total cardholders.

Worldwide, Costco’s membership renewal rate came in at 90.5 per cent, an increase of 0.1 per cent from last quarter.

Canadian dairy giant Saputo has sold Tasmanian cheesemaker King Island Dairy's facilities and brand to a new Australian owner.

The sale comes after more than a year on the market and the threat of closure hanging over it.

The dairy giant did not name those involved in the new entity but said it was being led by ""two experienced Australian businessmen with supply chain and manufacturing expertise"".

According to the corporate watchdog ASIC the entity was registered on March 3 this year, and lists Melbourne businessmen Nicholas Dobromilsky and Graeme Wilson as its directors.

""The buyer will make their own announcement in the coming days,"" Saputo said.

Why is ASX gradually falling since Trump is putting Tariffs on certain countries & why is this affecting my superannuation?

- Michael Langley 

Hi Michael,

While Australia isn't directly targeted by these new tariffs, economists have been warning for weeks that that a full-blown trade war could see global trade slow.

Let's not forget China remains our largest trading partner. If its economy takes a hit, so likely, will ours.

A trade war will especially impact Australia's resource exports — iron ore, coal, and natural gas - which are crucial to our economy.

A full-blown trade war could also impact the direction of local interest rates and the Aussie dollar — which has already faced much volatility.

And it knocks about investor confidence, which could see a more rocky sharemarket and a hit to your super savings.

In summary, it just makes the landscape more volatile and uncertain. Let's hope the worst isn't yet to come!

Hi Nassim . US government says it will only increase bitcoin reserve by “forfeiture”. How does that work when there is no physical coin?

- Phillip

Great question Phillip.

It isn't really clear how such a reserve would work or how it would benefit American taxpayers.

As noted, White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an executive order to establish a ""strategic Bitcoin"".

Sacks said the US government will have a strategy to maximise the value of its holdings in such a reserve, but he didn't offer details as to how.

With the RBA's easing cycle now underway, and with underlying inflation continuing to moderate, more interest rate cuts are likely but homeowners may need to wait a little longer in the year, says Bendigo Bank's chief economist David Robertson.

""Market pricing now matches our forecast of two more rate cuts, taking the cash rate down to around 3.6 per cent by year-end,"" Mr Robertson said in an economic note released on Friday.

""We continue to expect a relatively shallow easing cycle, and agree with the RBA that it would be foolish to rely on an April 1 cut (when they next meet), however the next quarterly CPI data out on April 30 should reveal more evidence that inflation is slowing, allowing a second rate cut on May 20.

""Our base case forecasts centre on a steady improvement in GDP growth in 2025 and cost of living pressures subsiding as inflation moderates, further helped by RBA rate cuts and last year's tax cuts, but the global backdrop remains as unpredictable as ever.""

He said with US tariffs now in force, the global outlook looked ""increasingly opaque"".

""US tariffs on trade with Canada, Mexico and China have just commenced, and beyond the uncertainty of what other tariffs will be imposed (and whether Australia will be exempted from them) the geopolitical landscape is remarkably complex and fast-moving, Mr Robertson said.

""Any global forecasts need to consider upside and downside scenarios, including the indirect impact of trade tensions on our largest trade partner China.

""Chinese fiscal support and targeted stimulus measures have proved successful so far and more policy support is expected, while exchange rates are also likely to play their part in offsetting tariffs.""

""But the further down the horizon we look, the more opaque the outlook becomes, and stock markets are also looking more cautious as the broader impact of tariffs takes shape.""

The price of Bitcoin plummeted on Friday after the US government signalled it would not acquire additional cryptocurrencies for its strategic reserve beyond its current holdings.

US President Donald Trump had sent the crypto world into a craze declaring during his reelection campaign that he would make America the the ""crypto capital of the world.""

He's also spent the past few months talking up a government strategic reserve that would hold bitcoin, ethereum as well as some other coins.

But White House-appointed 'AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin.

According to Sacks, the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve, instead keeping it as a store of value. He likened the reserve to a ""digital Fort Knox"" for the cryptocurrency often referred to as ""digital gold.""

The reserve will be funded with Bitcoin owned by the federal government, obtained through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

The executive order creates a US digital asset stockpile but the US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve.

The government will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings.

As a result Bitcoin slumped below $US85,000 on Friday. It's still trading down more than 3 per cent at US$87,042.06.

My colleague David Chau did a nice read in December on the promises Trump's been making on crypto and what a strategic reserve actually means. You can read that here:

Household spending rose 0.4 per cent in January, driven by Aussies spending more on areas including doctors visits and travel.

This follows a 0.2 per cent rise in December and a 0.8 per cent rise in November, according to seasonally adjusted figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

But nominal household spending slowed sharply to 2.9 per cent over the year to January, the slowest rate since September 24.

ABS head of business statistics Robert Ewing said that while spending on goods pushed up overall spending in late 2024, a 1.5 per cent rise for services drove the January growth.

In this category, health had the largest rise (+2.5 per cent), as households spent more on doctor and hospital visits.

Transport spending rose 1.1 per cent, driven by air and sea transport, as households booked in their travel plans for the year ahead.

Spending on the operation of vehicles, including petrol and motor vehicle repairs, also contributed to the rise.

But lower spending on new vehicle purchases reduced overall growth in household spending.

Also partly offsetting these rises were 1.5 per cent falls for furnishings and household equipment and clothing and footwear.

Overall goods spending fell 0.6 per cent in January, after rising for three months in a row.

Mr Ewing said the fall comes after households took advantage of promotional activity like Black Friday sales, which drove strong goods spending at the end of 2024.

The Albanese government recently introduced changes to ensure that telecommunication providers who are caught breaching industry codes will no longer be warned before being slapped with new multi-million dollar fines.

The changes allow the Australian Communication and Media Authority (ACMA) to take direct and immediate enforcement against telcos that have breached their obligations to customers.

Currently, ACMA must respond to breaches of co-developed industry codes with a direction to comply before taking enforcement action with fines capped at $250,000.

The Albanese government's proposed change would allow ACMA to take enforcement action immediately and seek fines of up to $10 million for industry code breaches.

But a group of 22 consumer advocates known as the Fair Call Coalition has written to ACMA urging the regulator to refuse to register the Telecommunications Consumer Protections (TCP) Code and instead support direct regulation of Australia's telco industry.

Consumer Action Law Centre CEO Stephanie Tonkin said the telco industry's self-regulating code ""has manifestly failed to protect consumers, especially those who are in vulnerable situations"".

""It is out of step with community expectations and other essential services sectors like energy,"" Ms Tonkin said.

Ms Tonkin acknowledged that Communications Minister Michelle Rowland had taken some welcome steps in strengthening the ACMA's enforcement powers but said ""the time has come to turn the page on the Code"".

""We continue to hear from callers to our frontlines of egregious examples of telco mis-selling and harm due to poor sales practices and credit assessment requirements,"" she said.

""The low standard of consumer protections in many areas of the Code has not changed and its time this Code was thrown in the bin and direct regulation implemented.""

Peter Gartlan, co-CEO of Financial Counselling Australia, added that everyone needs access to telecommunications services and said consumers aren't getting adequate protection.

""A self-regulating code just doesn't cut it,"" Mr Gartland said.

Tony Sycamore from IG has circulated a note that highlights how dire the price action has been on the stock market in recent weeks.

Here's what he's written:

""The horrific price action in the ASX200 has continued today, slipping below 8,000 for the first time in almost six months.

""This week's fall has seen the correction in the ASX200 from its 8615 high deepen to approximately 7.25%, a move that has unfolded in just four weeks. 

And he continues:

The falls this week have been driven by several factors, including US trade policy uncertainty at a time when fears of a looming US recession are rising. Locally, the falls have been exacerbated by more weakness in the big banks and worsened after BHP, RIO, South32, and energy giant Woodside all traded ex-dividend.

If the break below the psychologically important 8000 level is confirmed at the close of business today, it would open the way for the sell-off to extend towards 7600. A pullback to 7600 would be an 11% correction from the February 8615 high.

As for a potential catalyst for a turnaround in the ASX200, there isn't a clear one currently. US trade and tariff policy appears likely to remain volatile, and the upcoming Federal Election adds to the uncertainty, with the possibility of a hung parliament.

Mr Sycamore circulated that note 20 minutes ago. When he wrote it, the ASX200 index was trading at 7,996 points having lost 98 points (-1.22%).

But as I write, the ASX200 index is lower again, at 7,977 points (-1.45%).

Embattled casino operator Star Entertainment says it has been unable to reach a deal with Hong Kong investors to buy its stake in Brisbane's Queen's Wharf development.

Yesterday, there were media reports that Star was ""on the brink"" of inking a deal with its joint venture partners Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium, to buy its 50 per cent interest in the development.

This morning Star confirmed it has been in discussions, as it flagged in mid-February, but said it has been ""unable to reach an agreement"" to date.

The European Central Bank has cut interest rates as expected on Thursday and kept the door ajar to more, even as a looming trade war with the US and plans to boost military spending drive Europe's biggest economic policy upheaval in decades.

ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt “we have huge uncertainty. Some people have used the adjective phenomenal uncertainty and we debated as to whether it was high, high and rising.”

Easing for the sixth time since June, the ECB lowered its deposit rate to 2.5% in a nod to slowing inflation and faltering growth, and said that rates were still restricting growth, even if less so than in the past.

That wording suggests that more rate cuts may be coming as the bank has long declared that restriction is no longer necessary while inflation, at 2.4% last month, is safely heading back to its 2% target this year.

The ECB lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast for the fourth straight time on Thursday, putting expansion in 2025 at just 0.9, only slightly above the 0.7% pace recorded last year.

Inflation was meanwhile seen at 2.3% this year, above the 2.1% seen three months ago.

The Australian share market is off to a gloomy start on Friday.

The ASX 200 index lost 81 points or 1 per cent to 8,014, by 10:15am AEDT.

Ten out of the 11 sectors are in the red, with basic materials (+0.1pc) the only sector that's bucking the trend.

Real estate (-1.8pc), financials (-1.7pc) and tech (-1.5pc) led the losses in the first 15 minutes of trade.

Shares of wealth manager Insignia rose 12% to $4.76, as Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Shares of Star Entertainment were still suspended.

Insignia Financial has granted two key suiters access to its books after both Bain Capital and CC Capital raised their respective takeover bids to $3.34 billion, marking a pivotal moment in an escalating bidding war.

Insignia said on Friday the two firms now vying for control of one of Australia's largest wealth management firms had increased their per-share offers to $5 each — an 8.7% premium over their previous $4.60 bids.

Bain, best known in Australia for acquiring Virgin Australia out of administration, and CC Capital, a Wall Street-based private equity firm, now appear to have the upper hand after investment giant Brookfield entered the contest last month with a matching bid.

Insignia, formerly known as IOOF, oversees approximately $327 billion in client assets, making it the third-largest player in Australia's superannuation sector. 

Australia's publicly traded wealth management firms are drawing interest from investors attracted to the country's thriving pension system.

The federal government is launching a more than $6-billion aid package for businesses impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and relaxing some employment insurance (EI) rules to help workers.

Steven MacKinnon, Mary Ng and Rechie Valdez — the ministers of labour, international trade and small business — made the announcement Friday afternoon.

""We have tried and tested tools to get our people through the toughest of crises and we will not hesitate to use them,"" MacKinnon said.

As part of the supports for businesses, the government is providing $5 billion over two years for exporters to help them find new markets beyond the U.S. and a $500-million loan program through the Business Development Bank of Canada for businesses directly impacted by the tariffs.

Ottawa is also boosting the financing program for the agricultural sector — known as Farm Credit Canada — to the tune of $1 billion.

Ottawa announces billions to support businesses, relaxes some EI rules

The government is also temporarily relaxing rules around a program that allows employees to receive partial EI benefits while working reduced hours. The government says the temporary measures will increase access to the program and lengthen the time that those benefits are typically available.

In a partial climbdown on Thursday, Trump said he is pausing tariffs on some Canadian goods until April 2, offering a reprieve from across-the-board 25 per cent tariffs.

Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that Canada would delay its second round of retaliatory tariffs, worth $125 billion, until April 2. That's when Trump's batch of ""reciprocal"" tariffs is due to be imposed on countries around the world. Canada has currently levied $30 billion worth of U.S. imports.

MacKinnon asked about calls for more EI changes amid U.S. tariffs 

Asked by reporters if further measures would be taken to support businesses and workers, MacKinnon said it would depend on how the situation unfolds.

""The ball seems to bounce every day. We have every intention of customizing a response to tariffs or no tariffs as the case may be. Our first duty is to make sure that these tariffs don't get imposed on Canada,"" he said.

MacKinnon noted has Trump employed ""chaotic messaging"" when trying to justify his tariffs.

""First this trade war was about securing the border and ending drug smuggling. Then it was about migration and the flow of people going south and then, puzzlingly, it was about American banks or the auto sector,"" he said.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump threatened to hit Canada's dairy and lumber industries with additional tariffs.

""Canada has been ripping us off for years,"" the president said.

Canada hardly exports any dairy products to the U.S.

Lumber, on the other hand, has been a consistent sticking point in Canada-U.S. relations for years.

The U.S. already imposes anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, but Trump is threatening to top those with additional tariffs.

Widespread U.S. tariffs would have a devastating effect on the Canadian economy, with experts saying it would lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses and wreak havoc in key sectors such as Ontario's auto industry.

American tariffs on all steel and aluminum are still due to come into effect next week. Canada is the leading exporter of both metals to the U.S.

(AP Illustration / Peter Hamlin)

A growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.

The changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, President Donald Trump's executive orders aimed at upending DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector.

DEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks.

While hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. Instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.

These are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI:

Uber

After an conducting an internal investigation that found rampant sexual harassment issues within its corporate office under its founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick, Uber has been focused on overhauling its corporate culture since its current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took over in 2017.

Those changes had included a ramped-up commitment to diversity and inclusion as part of a commitment that the ride-hailing service highlighted in a section of its annual report for 2023.

But Uber dropped its diversity and inclusion section from its 2024 annual report filed last month. And the word “diversity” doesn’t appear anywhere in its 135 pages.

Uber didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

Salesforce

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff once was on a crusade to inspire other corporate leaders to become social activists in a drive to fix a “train wreck” of inequality, but he has since toned down that message while pledging to work with President Donald Trump “to drive American success and prosperity for all.”

Although Benioff personally has remained an outspoken supporter of LGBTQ+ rights, Salesforce is no longer touting its diversity program. After carving out a section of its annual report filed last year to declare, “Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Equality is a core value at Salesforce,” the San Francisco excluded any discussion of diversity programs in its latest annual report filed March 5.

“While we don’t have representation goals, we remain committed to our value of equality,” Salesforce said in a statement.

Pepsi

PepsiCo confirmed that it’s ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival Coca-Cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.

In a memo sent to employees, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. The company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.

Laguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay’s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi. The Purchase, New York-based company’s chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.

Goldman Sachs

Investment firm Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced IPO clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.

“As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,” said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in an email to The Associated Press. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.”

Goldman Sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards.

Google

Google rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company's leadership team by 30% within five years. In a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to Trump's executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting DEI practices that constitute “illegal discrimination.”

Google's parent company Alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is “committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.”

Target

The retailer said that changes to its “Belonging at the Bullseye” strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.

Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.

The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.

Target also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they’re connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.

Meta Platforms

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.

Like other companies that announced similar changes before Meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program since the Supreme Court’s July 2023 ruling upending affirmative action in higher education.

Citing an internal memo sent to employees, news website Axios reported the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead “focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.” The change means the company will also end its “diverse slate approach” to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.

Amazon

Amazon said it was halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been “winding down outdated programs and materials, and we’re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.”

“We also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don’t align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we’ll keep at it,” she wrote.

Rather than “have individual groups build programs,” Castleberry said, Amazon is “focusing on programs with proven outcomes – and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.”

McDonald’s

Four years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks, McDonald’s said earlier this month that it is ending some of its diversity practices.

McDonald’s said on Jan. 6 that it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.

McDonald’s said it will also pause “external surveys.” The burger giant didn’t elaborate, but several other companies have suspended their participation in an annual survey by the HRC.

In an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald’s senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage.

Walmart

The world’s largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment to a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRC’s Corporate Equality Index.

Walmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.

Additionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won’t be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.

Ford

CEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker’s employees in August outlining changes to the company’s DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRC’s Corporate Equality Index.

Ford, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn’t use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remains committed to “fostering a safe and inclusive workplace,” Farley said.

“We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,” the memo said.

Lowe’s

In August, Lowe’s executive leadership said the company began “reviewing” its programs following the Supreme Court’s affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had “individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.”

The retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.

Harley-Davidson

In a post on X in August, Harley-Davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. It said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.

The motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the HRC, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.

Harley-Davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.

Brown-Forman

The parent company of Jack Daniels also pulled out from participating in the HRC’s Corporate Equality Index, among other changes. Its leaders sent an email to employees in August saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then “the world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.”

The company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.

“Brown-Forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work,” spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway said in an email.

John Deere

The farm equipment maker said in July that it would no longer sponsor “social or cultural awareness” events, and that it would audit all training materials “to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages” in compliance with federal and local laws.

Moline, Illinois-based John Deere added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” But it noted that it would still continue to “track and advance” the diversity of the company.

Tractor Supply

The retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.

Tractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would “stop sponsoring non-business activities” such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns — and no longer submit data for the HRC index.

The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead “focus on our land and water conservation efforts.”

The National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supply’s president and CEO to step down shortly after the company’s announcement.

Note: View the indictment here.

The Justice Department announced today a coordinated action with Germany and Finland to disrupt and take down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations — including terrorist organizations — and sanctions violations. Since April 2019, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.

In conjunction with the operation targeting Garantex, the Department also announced the unsealing of an indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (previously Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident. Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

According to court documents, between 2019 and 2025, Besciokov and Mira Serda controlled and operated Garantex. Besciokov was Garantex’s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda was Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.

Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims. According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform. For example, when Russian law enforcement sought records relating to an account registered to Mira Serda, Garantex provided incomplete information in response and falsely claimed the account was not verified. In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents, even while disclosing identifying information related to other accounts requested by Russian law enforcement.

On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and darknet markets. According to court documents, despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator’s personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities. Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex’s operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions. For example, Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.

Despite doing substantial business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as required.

On March 6, U.S. law enforcement, led by the U.S. Secret Service (USSS), executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex’s operations. According to court records unsealed today, Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy were associated with the administration and operation of Garantex. The seizure of these domains will prevent these sites from being used for money laundering and additional crimes. Individuals visiting those sites now will see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.

As part of the coordinated actions, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. U.S. law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. In addition, U.S. law enforcement has also frozen over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.

Besciokov and Mira Serda are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Besciokov is also charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.    

Supervisory Official Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert for the Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant Director Michael Centrella of the USSS’ Office of Field Operations, and Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division made the announcement.

USSS and the FBI are investigating the case.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Bedell for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department’s National Security Division and Office of International Affairs provided valuable assistance.

The Justice Department also recognizes the critical cooperation of the German Federal Criminal Police Office, the Frankfurt General Prosecutor’s Office, the Dutch National Police, Europol, the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, and the Estonian National Criminal Police.

Finally, the Department thanks Tether and blockchain analytics firm Elliptic for their proactive assistance in this investigation.

President Donald Trump said Friday that he continues to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace and that he is “finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine.” His comments, to reporters in the Oval Office, came after Russia carried out a major missile attack against Ukraine while U.S. intelligence-sharing that normally helps Ukraine repel Russian forces was paused. Trump, who threatened to impose sanctions on Russia in response to the attack, said he had sent Russia a “very strong statement — can’t do that.” But he softened his tone during his Oval Office appearance. Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to address a White House cryptocurrency summit, elevating an industry he promised to aid during his campaign.

The National Republican Congressional Committee deleted a social media post baselessly claiming that Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) was an “illegal immigrant.”

Espaillat became a citizen after his family came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic almost 60 years ago. They overstayed a tourist visa but then obtained green cards.

The NRCC’s post asserted that “Democrats literally chose an illegal immigrant to give their response to President Trump’s address,” referencing Espaillat’s Spanish-language response to Trump’s address to Congress earlier this week.

The post was up for roughly 24 hours and remained online after Democrats sharply criticized the House GOP campaign arm for the escalated rhetoric.

Several Hispanic Republicans in the House were also irked by the post, with Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Florida) telling The Washington Post it is a term he would not have used, especially for a sitting member of Congress.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to create a White House task force to help prepare for the FIFA World Cup 2026, which is set to be played in the United States, Canada and Mexico. North America was awarded the right to host the tournament in 2018.

Asked by a reporter whether the latest political tensions over tariffs between his administration and the other two countries would affect the soccer tournament, Trump said, “I think it’s going to make it more exciting. Tension’s a good thing.”

Less than a month after placing the entire staff of the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights on administrative leave, the Environmental Protection Agency has reinstated dozens of employees in offices across the country.

Employees at regional EPA offices received an email Monday asking them to return to work, according to four employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, and they returned to work Wednesday.

President Donald Trump on Friday celebrated “big gains for native-born Americans” in the latest jobs report, suggesting that the early gains were a product of U.S. businesses gearing up for his administration.

“For the first time in 15 months, the job gains for native-born Americans — for American people, people born in America — exceeded job gains for migrant and foreign-born workers,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “This is the first time this has happened in more than 15 months.”

President Donald Trump is set to host the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

The event will put on display just how much Trump, once a skeptic of cryptocurrency, has aligned himself with the industry since winning the November election with the support of some of its biggest players. He tapped venture capitalist David Sacks to serve as his crypto czar and more recently announced a national crypto reserve.

President Donald Trump said he wants to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran and sent a letter this week to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader, indicating his desire to do so.

“I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing,’” Trump told Maria Bartiromo in an interview with Fox Business recorded Thursday and partially aired Friday.

Democrats demanded Friday that the Trump administration explain the U.S. DOGE Service’s request to access a sensitive database kept by a federal child-support office and whether the group successfully accessed the system, which includes data on nearly all U.S. workers’ earnings.

President Donald Trump indicated Friday that he is considering imposing “large scale” sanctions on Russia to pressure the country into a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine.

Elon Musk and his allies in the U.S. DOGE Service have justified their efforts to dismantle federal agencies by invoking a frequent refrain: They’re merely targeting fraud, waste and abuse.

WASHINGTON – As part of a coordinated international effort, the United States Secret Service seized website domains linked to Russian cryptocurrency exchange, Garantex and froze multiple crypto currency assets owned by the exchange. Garantex allegedly facilitates sanctions violations and money laundering by transnational criminal organizations—including terrorist organizations. Since April 2019, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.

On March 6, the Secret Service seized three website domain names used to support Garantex’s operations. The seizure order was authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia. These sites are Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex academy and are associated with the administration and operation of Garantex. The seizures prevent the owners and third parties from using the sites for money laundering. Individuals visiting those sites will now see a message indicating that the site was seized by law enforcement. The Secret Service also froze over $26 million in crypto currency transactions made through the site that were used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities. In addition, indictments were unsealed against Lithuanian national Aleksej Besciokov and Russian national Aleksandr Mira Serda for their alleged roles in the operation of Garantex. 

“The seizure of website domains associated with Garantex’s operations and the freezing of over $26 million in cryptocurrency strikes a serious financial blow to cybercriminals worldwide,” said Michael Centrella, Assistant Director of the U.S. Secret Service’s Office of Field Operations. “Alongside our U.S. and international law enforcement partners, this coordinated action will prevent additional funds from falling into the hands of criminals.”

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds and was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims. According to the indictment, Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that criminal proceeds were being laundered through Garantex and took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities on its platform. For example, when Russian law enforcement sought records relating to an account registered to Mira Serda, Garantex provided incomplete information in response and falsely claimed the account was not verified. In reality, Garantex had associated the account with Mira Serda’s personal identifying documents, even while disclosing identifying information related to other accounts requested by Russian law enforcement.

As part of the coordinated actions, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. Those servers have been taken offline at various locations around the world. U.S. law authorities have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. The FBI also assisted with the investigation.

U.S. president Donald Trump has signed an executive order, calling for the establishment of a U.S bitcoin strategic reserve and stockpile of other cryptocurrencies, following through on a campaign promise that some think could push the bitcoin price sharply higher.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price dipped after it was revealed Trump had signed the order, falling as traders expressed their disappointment it doesn’t commit the U.S. to buying more bitcoin or crypto (and following a “foolish” crypto price warning from Elon Musk).

Now, as the bitcoin and crypto market braces for a BlackRock earthquake, traders are scrambling to get ahead of other countries rushing to follow the U.S. into bitcoin—with one analyst predicting a $10 trillion bitcoin market capitalization by 2028.

""Incredible execution from the Trump administration and a historic moment for bitcoin and crypto,"" Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong posted to X. ""I expect many of the G20 to take notice, and eventually follow America’s leadership.""

The bitcoin reserve ""will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,"" David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, posted to X alongside a video showing Sacks calling the reserve a ""digital Fort Knox"" and promising it ""won't cost taxpayers a dime.""

Some have speculated that China is weighing creating its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race.""

“There have been rumours about China and South Korea exploring their own bitcoin strategic reserves,” Danny Scott, the chief executive at crypto platform CoinCorner, said in emailed comments. “It goes without saying now that all countries around the world will be paying attention and be looking at how they make their move,"" adding: ""It's going to happen globally.""

Trump’s bitcoin reserve executive order follows the announcement over the weekend that the U.S. will create a diverse crypto stockpile, cheered by the market as a “game-changer.”

“This week’s announcement—as imperfect as it is—marks the first time the U.S. has ever said that bitcoin is a strategic asset,” Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a blog post. “As long as that stays intact, it feels like a game-changer to me.”

Hougan said other countries would likely be watching the U.S. and considering following suit in creating bitcoin reserves.

“If you are Honduras, Mexico, or Guatemala, and you’re watching El Salvador and now the U.S. acquire bitcoin, can you really afford to be at zero?” Hougan asked. “If you’re Dubai, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia, are you comfortable with Abu Dhabi and the U.S. taking the lead? What about Russia? China?”

Excitement over a potential global race toward bitcoin adoption has added to expectations of increased crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S. under the Trump administration.

""That should add to that medium term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year, and $500,000 before Trump leaves office,” Standard Chartered Bank’s Geoffrey Kendrick told CNBC, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $10 trillion.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

March 7 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump, who has a financial stake in cryptocurrencies, brought crypto founders and investors to the White House Friday for what's billed as the first-ever ""crypto summit.""
Advertisement
Friday's event, the first of its kind and which was led by White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, attracted a list of who's who among cryptocurrency company leaders who gathered to discuss digital asset issues and regulation.
Trump's embrace of crypto is a dramatic departure from how other presidential administrations have dealt with emergent cyber currency. As a candidate, Trump got financial support from many crypto companies.
The so-called summit comes as Trump holds a stake in crypto company World Liberty Financial, and it's happening against the backdrop of the administration dropping cases against crypto companies and other corporations across several agencies.

The cases being paused or dropped include accusations of foreign bribery, safety violations, unfair labor practices and environmental crimes.
Sacks pointed out how Friday's event follows Trump's creation of a cryptocurrency strategic reserve. An executive order creating the crypto reserve -- the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve -- was signed Thursday in the Oval Office and it will be seeded with an estimated 200,000 bitcoins seized in court proceedings.

Sacks called it a ""digital Fort Knox.""
Trump's White House event is an overture to the industry that was a substantial contributor to his 2024 campaign and played a major role in his election win.
But the event also comes as more attention is being focused on that relationship between the industry and the president, as well as high-profile global cases of cryptocurrency fraud.
In a March 4 report, the watchdog group Public Citizen said that the Trump administration ""has already halted or moved to dismiss enforcement investigations and cases against 89 corporations"" including seven crypto companies.
Beneficiaries of dropped cases include billionaire tech executives from Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Sam Altman ad others, according to Public Citizen.
Public Citizen said in a statement, ""After freeing January 6 rioters, Donald Trump's second administration is rapidly moving toward a new priority: granting 'get out of jail free' cards to corporations facing investigations and federal lawsuits over corporate misconduct. Trump's administration is rapidly moving to halt and hinder federal investigations and cases against alleged corporate lawbreaking.""
Among the cases Trump's administration has dropped are SEC investigations and lawsuits against Trump contributors Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase.

Cryptocurrency criminal issues are a global concern, and there have been major crypto fraud cases and some led to collapse of crypto companies.
The cases include alleged South Korean crypto fraudster Do Kwon, who was extradited to the United States in January to face federal criminal charges in the $40 billion collapse of TerraUSD.
In May 2024, Gemini crypto exchange was forced by New York Attorney General Letitia James to return $2.18 billion to defrauded users.
In November 2023, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all charges in the multi-billion dollar fraud collapse of crypto exchange FTX.

March 7 (UPI) -- Working with Germany and Finland, U.S. officials disrupted and took down the online infrastructure used to operate Garantex, a cryptocurrency exchange that allegedly facilitated money laundering by transnational criminal organizations.
Advertisement
Those organizations included terrorist groups, according to U.S. Justice Department officials, who made the announcement in a press release on Friday.
An indictment unsealed in the Eastern District of Virginia leveled charges against Aleksej Besciokov, 46, a Lithuanian national and Russian resident, and Aleksandr Mira Serda (also known as Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw), 40, a Russian national and United Arab Emirates resident, according to Justice officials.
According to the indictment, Garantex has processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions since April 2019.

In the release, Justice officials said Mira Serda and Besciokov are charged with money laundering conspiracy, and Besciokov is charged with conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

Garantex was run by Mira Serda and Besciokov from 2019 to 2015, according to Justice officials. Authorities said Besciokov was Garantex's main technical administrator and responsible for maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Officials say Mira Serda was Garantex's co-founder and chief commercial officer.
U.S. officials say the crypto exchange Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal funding and was used to ""facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often with substantial impact to U.S. victims.""
Besciokov and Mira Serda knew that the exchange was facilitating crimes, Justice officials said, adding that Garantex took steps to conceal the facilitation of illegal activities, such as money laundering, on its platform.
According to Friday's release from the Justice Department, in April 2022 the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Garantex for its role in facilitating money laundering of funds from ransomware actors and so-called darknet markets.
According to court documents cited in Friday's release, ""despite the widespread publicity of the sanctions and Garantex administrator's personal knowledge of them, Besciokov and his co-conspirators violated those sanctions by continuing to transact with U.S.-based entities.
""Further, Besciokov and his co-conspirators redesigned Garantex's operations to evade and violate U.S. sanctions and induce U.S. businesses to unwittingly transact with Garantex in violation of the sanctions,"" Justice officials said.
Advertisement
As an example of attempts at evasion, Justice officials said Garantex allegedly moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis ""in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.""
Additionally and despite doing a notable amount of business in the United States and operating as a money transmitting business, Garantex failed to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required, Justice officials said.
The U.S. Justice Department said that, on March 6, U.S. law enforcement executed a seizure order authorized by a judge in the Eastern District of Virginia against three website domain names used to support Garantex's operations: Garantex.org, Garantex.io, and Garantex.academy.
According to officials, the seizure will prevent the sites from being used for money laundering and any other crimes. Individuals who go to those sites now see a message indicating that the site has been seized by law enforcement.
Additionally, officials said Friday that German and Finnish law enforcement also seized servers hosting Garantex's operations. U.S. law authorities, according to the Justice Department, have separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex's servers, including customer and accounting databases. More than $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex's money laundering activities have been frozen, U.S. officials said.

If convicted, Besciokov and Mira Serda face decades behind bars.

Sponsored by Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, the bill requires these operators to obtain licenses and submit quarterly reports to the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance.

The legislation also mandates risk, fee and exchange rate disclosures, anti-fraud measures, refund policies for fraudulent transactions, consumer warnings and transaction limits.

Additionally, LB609 adds controllable electronic records to the list of property that can be seized in criminal investigations.

The measure passed with a 48-0 vote on March 6.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, Democrats' resistance to passing a bill to protect female athletes and the latest on the effort to end the war in Ukraine.

The two most vulnerable Democratic senators voted against advancing a bill this week to prevent biological males from participating in women's and girls' sports, despite popular public support for such a policy. Now, they're justifying why they did it. 

""I listened to what I heard in New Hampshire, and what we heard from people who were keeping track of how many — Charlie Baker, for example, who heads the NCAA, who said that it only applies to one person,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told Fox News Digital. 

""I don't think we need legislation to do that. I think we can police it through the organizations,"" she said.

SENATE BID TO PREVENT BOYS FROM PLAYING GIRLS' SPORTS GETS STUCK ON FILIBUSTER

Sens. Ossoff and Shaheen explained why they voted with all Democrats to block a bill to bar males from women’s sports. (Getty Images)

""This bill was overreach,"" Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a statement. 

""School districts and athletic associations can ensure fair, safe competition without subjecting the bodies of adolescent student athletes — children — to intrusive investigation by the federal government,"" he said. 

Fox News Digital reached out to Ossoff's office but did not hear back in time for publication. 

In a recent New York Times/Ipsos survey, the vast majority of Americans said men and boys who identify as transgender women and girls ""should not be allowed to compete in women's sports."" 

However, in a Senate procedural vote on Monday, every single voting Democrat blocked the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act from moving on to a final vote on passage. 

All voting Republicans voted in favor of limiting debate on the measure and thereby overcoming the legislative filibuster, which is what the 60-vote threshold on Senate cloture motions is often called.

Because the vote was only 51 to 45, the bill won't move forward to a final vote at this time. 

Among Democrats in the NYT/Ipsos poll, 67% agreed with Republicans that biological males shouldn't be allowed to participate in female sports. 

The bill, introduced by Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., would require Title IX to treat gender as ""recognized based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth"" and would not allow for it to be applied to a differing gender identity. 

""This past week showed us how evil the Democrat party truly is. Every single senator voted to strip away the rights of women and girls everywhere,"" Tuberville said in a statement. 

""Both Sen. Jon Ossoff and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen pretend to care about women, but they clearly don’t give a rip about their privacy, safety, or right to fair competition. They think protecting female athletes is an ‘overreach,’ but are perfectly okay with forcing women to share locker rooms and shower with fully intact males. One thing is clear: Jon Ossoff and Jeanne Shaheen are completely out of touch with their voters.""

After their votes, the National Republican Senatorial Committee took a shot at its top Senate targets. ""Jon Ossoff could have joined the overwhelming majority of Georgians in the fight for common sense and keeping men out of women's sports,"" NRSC Regional Press Secretary Nick Puglia said in a statement. ""Instead, he told parents and their daughters that Democrats believe they must play sports and share locker rooms and bathrooms with biological males.""

Both Shaheen and Ossoff are up for re-election in 2026 in New Hampshire and Georgia. While Ossoff has been gearing up for a tough Senate battle for months, Shaheen has yet to announce whether she will be running. 

She is expected to announce her decision at some point this month, sources in New Hampshire confirmed to Fox News Digital. 

Shaheen is the only remaining Senate Democrat in a competitive seat who has not yet publicly revealed her re-election plans. 

Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., is the GOP favorite to take on Ossoff for the southern state's Senate seat, but he has not said whether he will launch a bid. He said he has ""really got a lot on my plate right now,"" in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""I know I can't keep holding out forever, so we'll have something to say on that down the road,"" he added. 

Nonpartisan political handicapper the Cook Political Report has rated the Georgia Senate race as a ""Toss Up,"" while the New Hampshire seat is considered ""Lean Democratic.""

Sports betting struck out again this year in the General Assembly.

The state House of Representatives passed 75 bills Thursday in the daylong flurry of activity known as Crossover Day, the annual deadline for legislation to clear either the House or Senate to remain alive for the year. But sports betting wasn't among them.

Also left by the wayside when lawmakers gaveled out Crossover Day shortly before 11 p.m. was a Senate bid to deny state funding to Georgia K-12 public schools, colleges and universities that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), legislation in the House overhauling the process the state uses to compensate the wrongfully convicted, and a Senate bill exposing banking institutions to lawsuits if they deny services to customers because of the way they exercised their rights under the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

Legislation to ban mining adjacent to the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and require Georgia Power to pass along the costs of power-hungry data centers to operators of those facilities rather than residential and small business customers never made it out of House committees to reach the floor of the chamber.

This year's push for online sports betting came in the form of a proposed constitutional amendment placing the issue on the statewide ballot next year and a separate ""enabling"" bill containing details on how the industry would operate in Georgia. Both made it through the House Rules Committee Thursday night, but Speaker Jon Burns, R-Newington, did not put them on the floor for a vote before Crossover Day came to an end.

""I'm disappointed,"" Rep. Marcus Wiedower, R-Watkinsville, chief sponsor of both measures, said after the gavel fell. ""A lot of work went into this. I thought it was a good measure.""

Supporters of legalizing sports betting have tried to get a statewide referendum through the General Assembly every year since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018 legalized gambling on sports in states other than New Jersey and Nevada. Opponents - spearheaded by religious groups - have argued sports betting would lead to an increase in crime and problem gambling.

The Senate spent much of the winter focused on controversial topics, including guns and race. DEI policies -- a hot button for President Donald Trump -- were also a vehicle for Republican outrage in Georgia, where the Senate's Republican leadership had been pushing for a ban in schools and colleges.

Senate Bill 120, which was the subject of bitter hearings and press conferences in recent weeks, would have punished public educational institutions that had implemented DEI policies by withholding state funding.

The bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Marty Harbin, R- Tyrone, called such policies an ""erosion of meritocracy."" But the measure's critics said DEI helps Black students and other historically marginalized people integrate and succeed.

""People died, people were lynched, all kinds of things happened in this country that caused people that were descendants of slaves to not have an equal opportunity,"" said Roger Bruce, a former Democratic state representative who came to the Capitol for a protest.

SB 120 was scheduled as the final bill for debate in the Senate Thursday night, but the leadership ended the legislative day just before calling it up.

Another controversial culture war bill also failed to pass the Senate, although it did get a hearing and a vote on the floor.

Senate Bill 57 would have punished banks that decide not to do business with companies due to disagreement about social issues, a custom that critics call ""debanking.""

An example offered in a legislative hearing last month was Daniel Defense. The Georgia-based firearms manufacturer became a target of criticism after one of its rifles was used in the 2022 mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The founder and chairman, Marty Daniel, testified that two banks dropped his company in quick succession, costing him $1 million each on lawyers and fees.

The bill triggered a heated debate on the Senate floor Thursday. Democrats were opposed and so were a critical mass of Republicans who worried about the potential impact on local banks. The bill got just 13 votes in favor, all Republicans, with a bipartisan opposition of 43 votes.

The House passed resolutions Thursday night to compensate five Georgians who spent years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of crimes. However, the House did not take up a separate bill to remove the General Assembly from the process of compensating wrongfully convicted Georgians. Instead, claims for compensation would be heard by administrative law judges, who would make a recommendation to the chief justice of the state Supreme Court.

Sports betting wasn't the only cause supporters have pushed for years in the General Assembly that fizzled again in 2025. Two bills that called for either placing a five-year moratorium on mining near the Okefenokee Swamp or banning mining altogether didn't get out of the House Natural Resources & Environment Committee.

Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals is seeking state permits to open a titanium dioxide mine along Trail Ridge on the southeastern edge of the Okefenokee. Supporters say mining would draw down water levels in the swamp, threatening the largest blackwater swamp in North America and the tourist dollars it brings to the region.

""When you lose the peat from the dried-up ground, we're going to have terrible fires like they did in Southern California,"" Rep. Darlene Taylor, R-Thomasville, the bills' chief sponsor, said during a hearing last week.

Opponents said the mine would bring much-needed jobs and boost the local tax digest in an economically distressed part of the state.

Like sports betting and protecting the Okefenokee, the fight over the data centers bill also was left over from last year.

While the rapid growth of data centers in Georgia unquestionably represents a boost to the state's economy, environmental and consumer advocacy groups have warned the vast amounts of electricity they consume threaten to further drive up electric rates. They cited a series of Georgia Power rate increases during the last couple of years to cover rising fuel costs and the completion of two additional nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed a bill the General Assembly passed last year that would have temporarily suspended a state sales tax exemption aimed at attracting data centers to Georgia after business interests objected to the measure. Opponents to this year's version of the bill in the Senate Regulated Industries Committee argued that the state Public Service Commission (PSC) should oversee data centers rather than the legislature.

The PSC voted in January to prohibit the Atlanta-based utility from passing on the costs of serving new large-load customers including data centers to residential customers. But supporters of the data center bill called the commission's new rule worthless because it's full of loopholes.

While the data centers bill never got out of the committee, the Regulated Industries Committee did approve a second energy measure bringing back the Georgia Consumer Utility Counsel, a watchdog agency that was disbanded in 2008 amid budget cuts brought on by the Great Recession. However, the full Senate didn't take up the measure on Crossover Day.

Everyone tells you how hard it is to win a championship, but what happens after you win — when the Champagne stops flowing and the invincibility fades?

You find yourself playing 82 playoff games, having to muster a higher intensity than most good teams, or deciding when to use this reservoir of energy that isn’t an unlimited supply.

The standings show the Boston Celtics are one loss away from their total of 18 from last year, when they romped through the entire season and postseason, barely being touched or challenged on the way to claiming banner No. 18.

Their 17th loss this season came in a haze of Detroit aggression, Motown dancing and shimmying as the upstart Pistons won their eighth straight game, putting the NBA on notice with an impressive 117-97 win over the Celtics on Feb. 26 at Little Caesars Arena. It was arguably the franchise’s biggest regular-season home game since the 2007-08 season, when it took on the newly formed Paul Pierce-Kevin Garnett-Ray Allen Celtics at the Palace of Auburn Hills in a preview of the Eastern Conference finals.

The Celtics weren’t ready for the emotional onslaught the Pistons brought. Detroit’s youth and improvement were evident from the opening layup lines, the players sensing an opportunity for more skins on the wall.

It isn’t the case for every game, but there is extra motivation for every team opening its doors to the visiting Celtics or walking into Boston's TD Garden this season. Whether the Celtics realize it or not, they’re playing two games in one, almost every night. The mental and physical fatigue is just as daunting as the actual competition.

There's a reason — not the biggest one, but a factor — the NBA hasn't had a repeat champion since the Stephen Curry-Kevin Durant Golden State Warriors in 2017-18. It’s the longest such stretch in the NBA since the late-1970s, right before the Magic Johnson-Larry Bird decade of dominance began.

“We have to hunt again. We want to win another championship, and we have to be hunting again,” Kristaps Porziņģis said last week in Detroit. “But you know, the season is long.”

Porziņģis was arguably the last piece to the Celtics' championship puzzle last season, along with Jrue Holiday. His health has been an issue throughout his career, but when he’s right, the versatility he provides seemingly makes them unbeatable.

Last year, the Celtics were 43-14 in the 57 games he played. This year, the Celtics are 20-12, with the majority of his inactivity coming at the start of the season as he recovered from an ankle injury he suffered in last June’s NBA Finals.

""We’re working towards something, we want to peak at the right moment,"" said Porziņģis, who was measured and calm after the team's blowout loss in Detroit. ""We don’t want to overreact to a loss, but with every loss we can learn something and take something from it. Tonight is no different.""

All-Star Jaylen Brown was dinged up from the night before, and the Celtics sat him. It was one of those nights where he was needed. Jayson Tatum had pesky swingman Ausar Thompson in his chest all night, and not that Tatum was truly careless (he had four turnovers), but there weren't any other premier shot-creators on the floor to alleviate pressure.

Tatum’s numbers are almost identical to last season’s, with shooting percentages slightly down but everything else holding form. Brown has improved his playmaking, while his shooting has taken a slight dip from 3.

As long as those two are upright, though, the Celtics have a strong chance.

“I think we have great continuity,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I think that’s what you trust throughout the season. (Brown), he puts his body on the line regardless and sometimes you gotta save guys from themselves. And that’s what was best for everyone and best for the team. And you trust the continuity over the course of the season.”

It was one of those nights, at the end of a road back-to-back with games against title contenders Cleveland and Denver looming ahead at home. Cleveland overcame a huge deficit to shock the Celtics on national TV, in a boon for its title hopes, while the Celtics took care of business against the Nuggets two nights later — again, on national television.

“It’s a little bit of (everything). You’re playing against teams trying to win a title,” Tatum said last week. “Everything counts. So you never get too high or too low.""

The Cavaliers game means a lot more in some eyes because they’re likely on a collision course to meet in the Eastern Conference finals in a rematch of last year’s second-round series, which the Celtics won easily.

But the Cavaliers are true challengers, and the season series ended with both teams winning two games each. In today’s economy of parity, though, there are a lot more contenders this time of year than usual.

Mazzulla, whose unique quirks belie how good of a coach he’s been for this team, seems to look at the changing lineups and hostile energy in arenas as opportunities as opposed to impediments.

“It’s not a toll as much as it is a responsibility we talk about,” Mazzulla said. “It’s a compliment that we have to execute and deliver.”

The Milwaukee Bucks are still lurking, having found a rhythm after the trade deadline. The New York Knicks are potentially explosive, but the Celtics have handled them in their three meetings this year.

And if they should get back to the Finals, the Western Conference is full of hopefuls, from the conference-leading Thunder to the surging Lakers — whom they play in another marquee game Saturday night — to the aforementioned Nuggets and even the Golden State Warriors, who’ve made a run since trading for Celtics nemesis Jimmy Butler.

Since drafting Tatum and Brown, they’ve always been in the championship conversation, making the conference finals in four of the past five years. But it’s a little different being the champions.

“You gotta be in it,” Tatum said. “Over recent years, we’ve gotten everybody’s really good shot. Now, on a nightly basis we get everybody’s best shot. We’re like the standard. You win the championship and that’s with any champion in history. The next year, they are the standard and guys are trying to get what they have. So our responsibility comes with that.”

They’ve worn the crown well, even with the lulls. One thing that separates them from champs of recent vintage is continuity, both in style and in personnel. The Nuggets lost critical pieces in Bruce Brown and veteran Jeff Green after winning the 2023 title. The 2022-23 Warriors had chemistry issues from training camp on.

The 2021-22 Milwaukee Bucks probably had the best chance to repeat on paper, but health quelled their bid, as it would anyone with the margins so thin in today’s game.

The Celtics’ top eight scorers returned this season, and Payton Pritchard has taken on a bigger role as a top candidate for the Sixth Man of the Year award — he dropped a career-high 43 Wednesday against Portland, hitting 10 3-pointers, while Derrick White added 41. Pritchard was once a hard-playing, low-ceiling player, now he's a critical element to their repeat hopes.

Last year the Celtics were experienced enough, now you wonder if this year they’re old in some spots. Holiday will be 35 by the time the Finals roll around and has been dealing with nagging injuries, most recently a nerve issue in his right shoulder. Porziņģis always has injury concerns and Al Horford is nearing 39 years old.

But … they’re still a top-five team on both ends, third in offensive efficiency and fifth on defense. That is usually a prerequisite for contention, regardless of record. And as they have under Mazzulla, the Celtics launch more 3s than anyone, fewer 2s than anyone — and that’s probably what will determine their fortunes.

Last year, the Celtics beat everyone with math. This year, they’ll have to be more cunning to beat a new slew of challengers.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Midfielder Aleksandar Pavlovic will miss upcoming Bayern Munich matches and probably also Germany's Nations League quarter-final tie with Italy due to illness.

Bayern said on Friday that Pavlovic ""is currently suffering from a lingering infection. The 20-year-old midfielder will therefore not be available to FC Bayern until further notice.""

Pavlovic has missed the last two Bayern games due to the illness, 3-1 in the Bundesliga at VfB Stuttgart and 3-0 over Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League.

He is now also set to miss Bundesliga matches against Bochum and Union Berlin, and the European return leg in Leverkusen before the start of the international break on March 17.

Due to lacking matches he is doubtful for the March 20 and 23 Nations League games against Italy. National team coach Julian Nagelsmann will announce his squad on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Florida State is expected to hire Sacramento Kings assistant Luke Loucks as its next coach, sources told CBS Sports. Negotiations are in the final stages and a deal is nearly done, though a source added that FSU won't make Loucks' hiring official until Sunday at the earliest, following the team's home finale Saturday against SMU.

The news dovetails with Leonard Hamilton's 23-year run with the program coming to an end. On Saturday, the school will be honoring him with a ceremony. The Seminoles will also play in next week's ACC Tournament. 

Loucks is an alumnus of the university, having played for Hamilton from 2008-12. He got into coaching in 2016 with the Golden State Warriors, where he worked until 2021. He's been with the Kings since 2022. CBS Sports previously reported Loucks was tagged as the front-runner for the job in late February. In recent days he has been working on building a staff, sources said, including searching for a general manager to help manage the portal immediately.

FSU is 16-14 heading into Saturday's game. The program hasn't made the NCAA Tournament since 2021.

Loucks is set to join Alex Jensen at Utah and Kevin Young at BYU as NBA assistants to take high-major jobs in the past 11 months. Jensen (previously with the Dallas Mavericks) was just hired at Utah on Thursday, while Young left the Phoenix Suns last year.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

The Seattle Seahawks are moving on from a franchise legend. The team is releasing wide receiver Tyler Lockett in a cap-related move, it announced Wednesday. The 32-year-old spent all 10 NFL seasons in Seattle, and thanked the Seahawks faithful on social media when the news broke. 

""I really enjoyed being in Seattle!"" Lockett wrote. ""I met so many great people and captured so many great memories! The 12's really make this place meaningful! Although, my time on the Seahawks may have run its course I'm thankful for everything!! God gets all the glory forever!!!!""

Lockett knew this move was coming, and he was noticeably reflective following the final game of the 2024 regular season -- a 30-25 victory over the rival Los Angeles Rams. 

""Ten years with the same team, I think the only people that's done it since I've been able to play on this team were K.J. (Wright), Bobby (Wagner), and Russ (Wilson)…,"" Lockett said, via the Seahawks' official website. ""It's very difficult to do just being able to play in NFL, and so for me, I don't take it lightly. I think I've had so many great relationships with not just the players, but everybody that's been inside of the building from people on the second floor to people on the third floor, to our nutritionist, to the strength and conditioning coaches -- they need to get a raise too, by the way, both of them --but yeah, I just think overall, man, that's what makes coming into the building fun. When you have relationships with people outside of football, it makes you excited to get up to be able to go and try to achieve this journey that we're all on to try to get to the playoffs, to win the Super Bowl or just create a team that wants to be able to play for their coaches, that wants to be able to play for the community and the city. And so I appreciate the city too, man. I think the city is amazing. I'll always view Seattle as a college town, and maybe this isn't the end, maybe it is the end, but I always will be a Seahawk through and through.""

The Seahawks aren't totally closing the door on the possibility of Lockett returning for next season.

Seattle general manager John Schneider spoke to the media about his message to Lockett, saying, ""Go out and see what's shaking [on the market], and we'll stay in touch.""

Lockett came to Seattle as a third-round pick out of Kansas State. In his first season, he caught 51 passes for 664 yards and six touchdowns, and earned All-Pro honors as a return specialist after racking up 1,231 combined punt and kick return yards, plus one punt return touchdown and one kick return touchdown.

Lockett departs Seattle as the franchise's No. 2 all-time leading receiver, having caught 661 passes for 8,594 yards and 61 touchdowns. Only Steve Largent has caught more passes, touchdowns and recorded more receiving yards.

One potential landing spot for the veteran pass-catcher is the Las Vegas Raiders, ESPN reports, as former Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll is now leading the Silver and Black. Vegas has plenty of holes on its rebuilding roster, including at wide receiver.

Lockett was due $17 million this upcoming season, including a $5.3 million roster bonus that was due on March 16, per ESPN. Seattle has been busy adjusting its books, as it was reported Tuesday that the Seahawks were also releasing safety Rayshawn Jenkins, offensive lineman George Fant and defensive linemen Dre'Mont Jones and Roy Robertson-Harris, per the Seattle Times.

UnitedHealth Group, the largest health care company in the U.S., has clear ambitions of getting bigger. 

The sprawling conglomerate — which owns a major health insurance company, physician practices, a pharmacy benefit manager, and numerous other firms — acquired or created more than 250 subsidiaries in 2024. Pretty much all of those deals weren’t publicly announced, since the transactions are small relative to UnitedHealth’s size. And just like in 2023, UnitedHealth has prioritized outpatient surgery centers.

UnitedHealth acquired full or partial ownership stakes in more than 100 surgery centers in 2024, according to a STAT review of UnitedHealth’s newest annual financial documents. Many of those outpatient centers are focused on highly profitable services, like heart cath labs, orthopedic surgery, ophthalmology, and gastroenterology. More than a dozen are part of a joint venture with Texas Health Resources, a nonprofit hospital system in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that generated $6 billion in revenue last year.

NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ACHC).





On September 27, 2024, the Company disclosed the receipt of a voluntary request for information from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York as well as a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri “related to its admissions, length of stay and billing practices.” Then, on October 30, 2024, the Company disclosed that it had lowered its full-year 2024 revenue outlook to a range of $3.15 to $3.165 billion and its full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to a range of $725 to $735 million due in part to slower same-store patient day growth of only 3% in the month of October.



The Company has been sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing.



KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether Acadia’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to Acadia’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

A nonprofit healthcare clinic in Normal that serves a largely uninsured clientele is hoping an update to its patient income qualifications will encourage more people to seek services.

The Community Health Care Clinic [CHCC] is now accepting applicants who make up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level [FPL], according to an email the clinic sent to donors. Previously, applicants could make up to 185% of the FPL.

Updated 2025 poverty guidance says that a single household falling within 250% should make no more than $39,125 a year and a four-family household, no more than $80,375 a year. This, according to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation

Executive Director Holly Wayland-Hall said in the email that the organization’s policy was outdated and forced the clinic to turn many potential clients away.

“In the last two years, CHCC had discharged or not accepted hundreds of patients who exceeded income qualifying criteria but otherwise had no other access to healthcare,” she said. “A review of applicant data and comparison with other free and charitable clinics in Illinois revealed that an increase was in order.”

This marks the first time CHCC — which offers primary, dental and behavioral health care — is updating its guidance for patient income qualifications since the nonprofit opened over three decades ago. The nonprofit noted that the minimum wage has increased by $10 since then.

CHCC is encouraging patients who were previously turned away, as well as new patients who meet the updated criteria to apply for services.

Wayland-Hall wrote in the email that the clinic’s hope is “that we can once again be the medical home for those who have no other way to access healthcare, so they can manage chronic medical conditions and be able to continue working and providing for their families.”

10About Town at 4 p.m.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A Republican bill in the Tennessee legislature could allow healthcare providers to deny patients some kinds of treatments and services, such as birth control, based on their religious, moral or ethical beliefs.

SB 0955 was introduced by Senator Ferrell Haile (R-Gallatin). It would prohibit healthcare providers from requiring medical workers to participate or pay for healthcare procedures and treatments that they don't agree with. The bill includes language meant to ensure healthcare providers continue following their duties to treat people — as long as those treatments ""do not violate the healthcare provider's conscience.""

The bill also said insurance companies that are contractually obligated to pay for procedures and treatments would still need to pay for them, even if a provider objects to a treatment.

The bill would also protect healthcare providers who choose not to provide treatment from civil lawsuits or criminal prosecution. However, the bill also says protections do not extend to ""procedures, treatments, or services governed by federal law, including the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.""

It also does not extend to situations in which a person is in imminent danger of harming themselves or others.

""The bill prevents healthcare professionals from being forced to provide certain treatments, but it does not allow them to refuse care to specific groups of people,"" Haile said.

He said pharmacists who refuse to give prescriptions for birth control because they object to it would be protected under the bill.

The bill passed the Tennessee Senate Thursday in a 27-3 vote, with four senators not voting. It will be discussed in the House Health Subcommittee on March 12.","{'href': 'https://www.wbir.com', 'title': 'WBIR.com'}"

Southeast Georgia Health System is asking residents in Brantley, Camden, Charlton, Glynn, McIntosh and Wayne counties to participate in an online survey to share their feedback on health care needs and concerns.

The online Health Needs Assessment Survey is completely anonymous— meaning no one can connect you to your answers. The survey, which takes less than 10 minutes to complete, is accessible now through March 21, 2025. Those interested in participating must be 18 years or older. Click on the links below to participate today!

Information derived from the survey responses will provide the Health System with a better understanding of community needs and help guide decisions on how best to tailor programs and services to address those needs. “We encourage the community to participate in this survey and share their thoughts on how Southeast Georgia Health System can better address the health needs of the populations that we serve,” says Christy Jordan, Interim President & CEO/Chief Legal Officer. “The survey results provide valuable feedback which influences our strategic planning, allocation of resources, and development of partnerships with local programs.”

The Affordable Care Act requires all not-for-profit hospitals to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment of their service areas every three years. In addition to surveying local residents in six counties, data is collected from public sources, health experts, and public health and federally qualified health centers. Previous survey findings have resulted in Health System investments in recruitment of additional primary care physicians, screenings for cancers and diabetes, and community health education. Results of the survey will be made available on the Health System’s website later this year.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Lady Gaga has looked into her future and revealed that her ""greatest vision"" is to build a family of her own.

The 38-year-old pop sensation, who just released Mayhem, her seventh studio album, shared the news in an interview with Access Hollywood.

""I really want to be a mom,"" Gaga said when asked what her next decade will look like. ""The greatest vision I have is that.""

The ""Abracadabra"" singer got engaged last year to venture capitalist Michael Polansky, 41, who she's known for several years and first got to know after her mother met him at a charity event and then introduced the two.

When the couple will have kids remains to be seen, and Gaga declined to share details on wedding planning. However, she conceded of her walking down the aisle: ""I think that's going to be the most special day of my whole life. It'll be a real dream, I know that.""

Polansky was an executive producer on Gaga's latest album and co-wrote some of the songs. ""Making music with the one that you love is really special, and deeply intimate,"" she told Access Hollywood.

The experience of collaborating brought the couple closer, and may have sparked heartfelt conversations about their shared vision for their future children.

Gaga told Elle in January that she and her fiancé have talked a lot about allowing their kids to be their own people. ""It's such an intense thing for kids coming into the world,"" she said. ""And they're told how to think and what to believe in and how to eat...I just kind of want to let my kids find out who they are.""

Matt Amodio won his second game of the 2025 Jeopardy! Invitational Tournament on Thursday, March 6, meaning he won the entire tournament. He played against Roger Craig and Juveria Zaheer and is now speaking out about his first tournament win.

The champion appeared on the Inside Jeopardy! Podcast the day after his win to talk about his fellow competitors, how he practiced, and what’s next for him. Amodio had finished in third and sixth on Jeopardy! Masters, so winning feels good, he shared.



Podcast host Sarah Whitcomb-Foss asked Amodio how he felt going into the competition going up against 26 other Jeopardy! greats. Out of the contestants, Amodio had only ever played against Amy Schneider and Jonathan Fisher.

“I didn’t feel great about it,” he shared. “There were some people that I’ve been a big fan of and then some I didn’t know but wowed me. Knowing how much talent was in this pool, I did not expect that it would end up like this.”

Cohost Michael Davies asked the champion if there was any difference to his approach in this tournament compared to regular Jeopardy!. Amodio shared that he was mostly doing the same thing, but he knows he’s in “tournament life” forever and has to “raise the obscurity level on the trivia.” He added that he is going to have to brush up on the pop culture questions.

The JIT winner said that with his full-time job as a quantitative researcher, studying for Jeopardy! will have to “take a back burner.” He added, “But it will never be further back from that because it’s just fun. I am obsessed with learning and knowledge, so it’s just a pleasure to have extra reason to do this.”

About his win, Amodio said that he had “some good buzzer mojo” and “the winds of fate” behind him. “I got some key correct things when I needed it,” he said.

However, in game one, the game show contestant admitted that he didn’t feel like it was going “all that well” as it was happening. “With two very talented people next to me, I felt like I was on a knife’s edge,” Amodio said.

At the beginning of the tournament, Amodio shared that he was trying to be the game show’s new villain. Davies asked him if he is going to play into that the next time he competes. Amodio said that he might have to grow a handlebar mustache and “find some train tracks to tape a damsel in distress to.”

To wrap up the conversation, Whitcomb-Foss asked the player what he had learned from his Jeopardy! journey. “I’ve learned to enjoy it, whatever it is. It’s easier to enjoy it when you win, but you never know how it’s going to come out,” he said.

“Don’t take it personally. Sometimes, it just doesn’t go your way. It’s not an indictment of you as a human being. And also, don’t get too big for your britches,” he concluded.

Amodio will compete on Jeopardy! Masters coming up in the next few months.

Lady Gaga fears feeling alone.

The 38-year-old pop star is one of the best-selling artists of all time, but Gaga has admitted that she felt isolated in the early years of her music career.

The 'Alejandro' hitmaker - who is engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky - told the BBC: ""I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own. And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.""

In recent years, Gaga has realised that she doesn't need to have a ""dividing line"" between her personal and professional lives.

The chart-topping singer - who released her debut album, 'The Fame', back in 2008 - explained: ""I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being.

""The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.

""I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.

""That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.""

Gaga considers her new album, 'Mayhem', to be another landmark moment in her career, with the singer believing that she's reclaimed ownership of her music.

She shared: ""When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.

""So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.""

Topic:Indigenous Australians

Ash Barty, who won Wimbledon in 2021, says she played her best tennis after changing her mindset. (Anychance/Getty Images: Simon Bruty)

Former world tennis champion Ash Barty is no stranger to pressure. 

Watching her victorious Wimbledon match from 2021, you can hear it building in the crowd every time her opponent Karolina Pliskova missed the ball.

At just 25 years old, Barty was carrying the weight of the country on her shoulders.

Barty says some of her toughest times have actually been opportunities for growth. (Reuters: Toby Melville)

And while that would be anxiety-inducing for many, Barty had a secret weapon she used in times like these — her positive mindset.

""I had so much genuine interest and investment and people wanting me to do well, and I think sometimes that can be perceived as pressure,"" she told the ABC's Indigenous Affairs Team.

""But I learned to really embrace it and understand it's coming from a good place.""

The freedom that came from that new mindset helped her play some of her best tennis, she said.

After a three-set thriller, she became the first Australian ladies' Wimbledon champion in 41 years.

Barty has overcome many challenges to get to the top — from her body image battles as a teenager to the burnout that led to her 15-month tennis hiatus in 2014 — so how does she deal with setbacks?

""It's important to lean into the emotions you're feeling, whether it's sadness or anger; that's part of being a human being,"" the Ngarigo woman said.

""When I was going back through some of those moments, I really try and see the opportunity for growth, for learning and what I could've done better.

The three-time Grand Slam singles champion is now notching up another 'first' with the launch of Mattel's first Aboriginal Barbie doll.

Barty and her friend, fellow Indigenous global tennis star Evonne Goolagong Cawley, recently launched the dolls, which are part of a special collection.

""When we saw the dolls for the first time, it was pretty surreal,"" she said.

""To be able to do it with Evonne, someone who's been an idol of mine, a friend, a mentor, it was really neat.""

For Barty and Googalong Cawley, the one-of-a-kind Barbie 'Role Model' dolls are also about empowering the next generation through representation.

""I've always been a big believer, if you can see it, you can believe it,"" Barty said.

""It's obviously special to be the first Indigenous release for Barbie but I think it spreads wider.

""It's creating this endless possibility of what girls can be, what they can dream of, and what they can achieve,"" she said.

Many people recognise Maminydjama Maymuru — also known as Magnolia Maymuru — from her iconic 2021 Vogue cover with her baby Djarraran and her AACTA award-winning role in the 2018 Netflix series The Nightingale.

She has graced the runways from local Australian fashion shows to international high-end brands.

But one decision during her modelling debut could have cost her her career before it began.

""During the bikini contest, I told them I was not comfortable,"" the proud Yolŋu woman said.

It was 2016 and Ms Maymuru had been selected to represent the Northern Territory in the contest for Australia's Miss World candidate — a chance to compete in one of the world's big four beauty pageants.

""My mob, specifically my group of people, we don't expose ourselves to that degree because it's sacred,"" she said.

""We only do these specific things in ceremonies. I wanted to feel comfortable and have my elders be proud of me.""

Fortunately, the organisers were understanding.

""They respected my views, my beliefs, and allowed me to sit that one out,"" she said.

More than a decade later, Ms Maymuru has continued to break barriers with the help of other strong Blak women, while learning the art of walking in two very different worlds.

""I had a life coach, Jody, she was a beautiful strong, Blak woman … From posture to how to speak to capture people's attention, she taught me so much,"" she said.

""She was one of the women that guided me through that first year in becoming 'Magnolia'.""

It took years before the isolating feeling of being the only First Nations model in the room disappeared but she has always remained steadfast in who she is and where she comes from.

""They keep me grounded and motivate me to do better.""

As her career took off, she faced a devastating turn of events when her grandmother was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

""It was a big change,"" Ms Maymuru said, after deciding to become her grandmother's full-time carer.

""She took me in when I was six years old … I have an obligation; it was just fulfilling my role but I think it was only difficult for my career when I had to turn jobs down.""

Maminydjama is well-versed when it comes to change — it's something she embraces.

And as she juggled her duties with being a new mum, it was watching her grandmother 'fight to get better' that kept her going — the same person who ignited the fire inside her during her modelling debut.

For Aunty Marjorie Anderson, her career wasn't as clear cut as Ash Barty's or Maminydjama Maymuru's.

""I just say the elders put me where I need to be when I need to be there. I've never planned a career as such,"" the proud Gamilaroi woman said.

It was a journey that led her to co-design Australia's first Indigenous crisis hotline.

Her initial thoughts? ""I have no idea what I'm doing.""

Like Barty, there was a weight leaning heavily on Aunty Marjorie to get this right, with the devastating suicide rate of First Nations people on the rise.

Aunty Marjorie Anderson says improving the lives of First Nations people is always at the centre of her work.  (Supplied: Lifeline Australia)

She says there wasn't a playbook to follow in Australia or overseas; Aunty Marjorie was developing the first hotline of its kind.

""I had to start with a blank sheet of paper and I made sure I got the diversity of our community in working groups to design the hotline.

""My motto has always been: 'Fake it till you make it and don't be scared of anything'.""

That advice has paid off, with the hotline receiving tens of thousands of calls since launching in 2022.

The most rewarding part, she says, is hearing the words: ""You saved my life.""

This International Women's Day, Aunty Marjorie has been named 2025 NSW Aboriginal Woman of the Year, recognising her great contribution to her community.

She credits her tenacity and determination to growing up in Redfern, which is often described as the birthplace of the civil rights movement for First Nations people.

""I come from a long line of strong women,"" she said.

But when she was at school, the advice was different.

""When I was a student, I was told I would never amount to anything, and I should sit down and shut up,"" she reflected.

""I had a lot of people around me who were fighting for legal services, medical services for Aboriginal people and the freedom riders really pushing and making a real difference.""

It gave her the resolve to push back.

""I looked at that generation of Aboriginal people above me, and instead of buying into that advice, I fought against it.""

LEXINGTON, Ky. – The University of Kentucky women’s tennis team fell to No. 1 Georgia, 4-0, on Friday in SEC action at the Boone Tennis Center. The Wildcats were unable to capture a win as the Bulldogs claimed the match with dominant performances in both singles and doubles.

Georgia’s No. 13-ranked pair of Mell Reasco and Dasha Vidmanova handed Kentucky’s Ellie Eades and Lizzy Stevens a tough 6-1 loss at the one spot.  On court three, Georgia’s Aysegul Mert and Hayden Mulberry defeated Kentucky’s Zoe Hammond and Tess Bucher, 6-0. The second doubles match between Julia Zhu and Asuncion Jadue (UK) and Georgia’s No. 70-ranked Guillermina Grant and Anastasiia Lopata went unfinished, with Kentucky trailing 3-1 and the Bulldogs taking the doubles point.

At No. 5, Georgia’s No. 82 Grant defeated Kentucky’s Ellie Myers, 6-2, 6-1, to secure the Bulldogs’ second point. On court one the nation’s top singles player, Vidmanova, beat Hammond 6-1, 6-2. Reasco also made quick work of Stevens, earning a 6-2, 6-4 victory at the third singles spot and securing the win 4-0 for Georgia.

Several other matches were left unfinished, including Zhu’s contest with Georgia’s No. 48 Lopata (2-6, 3-2), and Bucher’s match against No. 41 Mert (4-6, 0-5). Kentucky’s Jadue was also trailing Sofia Rojas, 6-4, 0-4, when her match was abandoned.

With the win, Georgia improves to 11-1 overall, while Kentucky drops to 6-6 on the season. The Wildcats will look to regroup and bounce back in their next match, set for Sunday at South Carolina.

MALIBU, Calif. — After competing in the Pacific Coast Men's Doubles Tournament last week, the #28 Pepperdine men's tennis team returns to dual match play by hosting #39 Vanderbilt and #46 Middle Tennessee State.

The Waves will play the Commodores on Sunday at 11 a.m. before playing the Blue Raiders on Tuesday, March 13 at 2 p.m. Admission to Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center is free to the public. All pertinent live stream and live stat links can be found on the men's tennis team's schedule page on pepperdinewaves.com.


MATCH 15: #28 Pepperdine (7-5) vs. #39 Vanderbilt (8-6) | Sunday, March 9 | 11 a.m. PT | Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center | Malibu, Calif.
MATCH 16: #28 Pepperdine (7-5) vs. #46 Middle Tennessee State (9-8) | Tuesday, March 11 | 2 p.m. PT | Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center | Malibu, Calif.

SCOUTING THE WAVES
Returning to dual match play after nearly two weeks away, the #28 Pepperdine Waves will take on two NCAA Tournament hopefuls to bolster their non-conference resume.
While Pepperdine has been ranked as high as 23rd in the Intercollegiate Tennis Rankings, the Waves' recent drop can be attributed to what the rest of the top-25 teams accomplished recently. Despite the break, Pepperdine has five wins over ranked teams and six against 2024 NCAA Tournament squads. This week's opponents will be no exception: Both Vanderbilt and Middle Tennessee made the NCAA Tournament last year.
Like all Adam Schaechterle-coached teams, the Waves feature a competitive doubles point, top-end talent in the singles lineup and a deep roster.
The top of the lineup features #69 Edward Winter and #47 Maxi Homberg, giving the Waves multiple NCAA Singles Championship qualifiers on the roster for the first time since 2013. In last week's 4-1 win over Rice, Winter and Homberg were responsible for two of the Waves' singles wins, which was just the third time this season the duo has picked up wins in the same dual match. If Pepperdine can count on both players to win consistently, the Waves could be a top-16 team.
So far, captains Winter and Linus Carlsson Halldin lead the team with six singles wins this spring. Winner of his last two singles matches, Lasse Poertner comes into this weekend with the longest active win streak of the Waves while playing at the fifth position.
One could make a convincing argument that Pepperdine could have one of the most underrated doubles lineups in the nation.
Despite having just one nationally ranked team in #72 Carlsson Halldin and Homberg, the Waves have won the doubles point seven times this year. Part of this is due to the efforts of Poertner and Aleksa Pisaric at the third position: The duo most recently made a run to the Pacific Coast Men's Doubles Championship finals, where they fell in three sets to UCLA's veteran team of Alexander Hoogmartens and Giacomo Revelli. Additionally, the freshmen duo has won seven of their last eight matches in dual match competition.
Pepperdine leads the all-time series with Vanderbilt 2-1, which includes a 4-3 win over the Commodores in Nashville last year. In that match, Homberg clinched the top-30 win for the Waves with a three-set win over Jeremie Casabon at the fifth position. The Waves and Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders will square off for the first time on Tuesday.

ACROSS THE NET
Competing in a loaded Southeastern Conference, the Vanderbilt Commodores are trying to make another postseason appearance after sneaking into the postseason with an at-large berth a season ago. The Commodores are looking for a breakthrough season under second-year head coach Scott Brown, who led his alma mater to the program's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2019 a year ago.
Vanderbilt's 8-6 record is a bit misleading. All six of its losses are against nationally ranked teams, and three have been to #4 Texas, #11 Duke and #21 Alabama. Competing in the ultra-competitive SEC will give the Commodores plenty of opportunities for quality wins without taking many bad losses, but Sunday gives the Commodores a realistic chance at improving their resume.
Checking in at No. 28 in the latest ITA rankings, the Commodores' doubles team of Nathan Cox and Michael Ross is Vanderbilt's only representation in the national rankings. The duo has a 5-2 record in dual match play but is looking to snap a two-match losing skid. The second and fifth positions are the strongest parts in the singles lineup thanks to Danil Panarin and Henry Ruger, respectively. Ruger leads the team with eight dual match singles wins.
Making their first ever trip to Ralphs-Straus Tennis Center, the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders are looking to defend their Conference USA title this season.
Longtime head coach Jimmy Borendame's squad comes to Malibu after losing a pair of road matches to then-No. 20 Princeton and #11 Harvard. However, MTSU was on a six-match win streak against the likes of NCAA Tournament hopefuls Oklahoma State, Indiana and Arkansas. Like the Commodores, the Blue Raiders' record of 9-8 is deceptive: All of MTSU's losses are against either Power-4 teams or Ivy League powerhouses.
Although MTSU boasts NCAA Doubles Qualifiers #40 Ondrej Horak and Karim El-Amin, the Blue Raiders have struggled to put together the doubles point against postseason-caliber opponents. MTSU has won the doubles point in six of its 17 matches so far.
However, the middle of the Blue Raiders' lineup has picked up the slack this year. Although MTSU has a winning record at the second through sixth positions, the middle of the lineup is where the team excels. Freshman Kasper Szymkowiak and junior Shu Matsuoka lead the team with 11 and 10 wins, respectively — and while Szymkowiak has gradually moved up from fifth to first in the lineup, Matsuoka has been consistent at the fifth position. MTSU's depth is uniquely equipped to challenge Pepperdine's freshmen at the fourth through sixth positions; if the Blue Raiders want to win, the path will start there.

WHAT'S NEXT
Pepperdine heads to Indian Wells, Calif. to compete in the UTR Sports Collegiate Championships at the BNP. The Waves' first-round opponent is #14 Baylor on Friday, March 14. All schedule updates can be found on the men's tennis team's schedule page on pepperdinewaves.com.

Moments later, the Bobcats secured the doubles point when they got the win on court one, 7-5. Even though Montana State had already won the doubles point, they finished out the match on court three, which saw Lumberjacks Andrea Noguera and Leontina Stojanovic come up short to Angel Bean and Nia Gelashvili, 6-4.
 
In the singles portion of the match,  NAU had strong performances all around by winning all six of the singles points.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – Senior Elza Tomase earned her 90th career singles victory as the sixth-ranked Tennessee women's tennis team defeated No. 25 South Carolina in a 4-1 triumph. Tomase is the 15th player in program history to reach the 90-win mark.

""South Carolina is very good; they just came off of a fantastic win against Auburn,"" head coach Alison Ojeda said. ""They are a heck of a team that fights for every single point. I thought our doubles teams did an outstanding job. Going into singles, Elza had a huge win against Sarah Hamner. Hamner is fantastic. To Elza's credit, she played very disciplined tennis. Elza has had an outstanding career at Tennessee and I am very proud of her. ""

Tennessee (9-2, 3-1 SEC) got off to a hot start, grabbing a 1-0 advantage with back-to-back doubles wins against South Carolina (7-5, 2-2 SEC). The pairing of Tomase and Maeve Thornton landed their first win together, taking down the No. 36-ranked duo of Sarah Hamner and Kaitlyn Carnicella, 6-0. The freshmen tandem of Conley Raidt and Saray Yli-Piipari edged Helena Buchwald and Misa Malkin in a 6-3 affair. The No. 52-ranked duo of Catherine Aulia and Leyla Britez Risso were mounting a comeback against Bella Larsson and Olympe Lancelot, 3-5 when play halted.

""All three of our doubles courts came out with so much energy,"" Thornton shared. It was our SEC match at home, so we wanted to take advantage of that. Elza Tomase and I clicked together and played very well. Kudos to Conley Raidt and Saray Yli-Piipari as well. Everyone fought so hard. 

In singles, the Big Orange found its groove and never looked back. No. 8 Tomase filed her 90th singles career victory against No. 19 Sarah Hamner, 6-3, 7-5, to put UT up by two. No. 103 Britez Risso posted a 7-6(2), 6-2 decision. Thornton added the final point from a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 triumph over Lancelot.

""It is a big honor to be beside all of the outstanding former Lady Vols that came before me,"" Tomase said. ""It means a lot, but this team means more to me. I am really happy that we got this win today and I am really proud of everyone.""

Francesca Mattioli was the lone Lady Vol to drop a contest, falling to No. 93 Misa Malkin, 5-7, 4-6.

Up Next: Tennessee will hit the road to face top-ranked Georgia on Sunday. The match is slated for 1 p.m. at Dan MaGill Tennis Complex.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,How Sara O’Leary built Virginia women’s tennis into a tight-knit powerhouse,https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/03/how-sara-o-leary-built-virginia-women-s-tennis-into-a-tight-knit-powerhouse,"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 20:01:38 GMT","

O'Leary currently has her Cavaliers ranked No. 1 in the country.

Just last week, Virginia women’s tennis became the No. 1 team in the nation, an achievement never before earned in program history. To some, this surge to the top may seem sudden, even unexpected, but for this program, it has been years in the making. And at the center of it all is the coach who has transformed the program in under a decade.

When Coach Sara O’Leary took the helm June 12, 2017, the team was coming off a season in which it finished ranked No. 43. Almost eight years later, O’Leary has not only rebuilt the program but turned it into an ACC powerhouse and a national title contender. Her accolades speak for themselves — 2024 ACC Coach of the Year, two-time ITA Atlantic Region Coach of the Year and six NCAA Tournament appearances. 

Under her leadership, the Cavaliers have consistently ascended into the top 10 of the rankings, reaching No. 9 in 2019-20 as well as a record-breaking No. 4 in 2021-22 before claiming the top spot now. They also set a record with a 25-win season in 2023-24. Yet, players say that O’Leary’s most telling impact goes beyond wins and rankings — it is the culture she has instilled in her players and the development she has fostered.

Her philosophy has been simple but effective — focus on daily improvements rather than just long-term results. The success has been no accident. O’Leary inherited a struggling program and implemented a structured, player-centric development plan. 

Former Virginia star Natasha Subhash, who played under O’Leary from 2019 to 2024, credits the coaching staff’s emphasis on player development for her own growth. 

“The coaches, led by Coach O’Leary, prioritized player development above all else,” Subhash said in an interview. “For me, one of the biggest things that set U.Va. apart, and the coaches especially, was that they created this developmental plan for me as a recruit.”

This commitment to individual progress has resulted in 16 All-American honors during O’Leary’s tenure — more than in the program’s entire history before her arrival.

A prime example of O’Leary’s developmental expertise is Virginia alumna Emma Navarro, who won the 2021 NCAA Singles Championship under her guidance. Navarro’s dominance on the national stage cemented O’Leary’s reputation as a coach who could not only recruit top talent but also elevate it to elite status.

The impact of O’Leary’s approach is also evident in the team’s rise through the rankings and its consistent deep runs in the NCAA Tournament. In 2022, Virginia reached the quarterfinals for the first time since 2016, a feat it repeated in 2024 while securing an ACC regular-season co-title.

Just as important as the developmental expertise she’s passed onto individual players, O’Leary has fostered an environment that emphasizes unity, teamwork and resilience. Her teams have developed a reputation for their close-knit culture, where lifting each other up is paramount. 

“I think the biggest thing is just focusing on the culture first,” O’Leary said after the Georgia Tech match Feb. 23. “That's just what we always go back to. We're not super focused on the wins and the losses, just making sure we're doing the little things well and better every single day.”

According to Subhash, this culture is a defining aspect of the program. 

“In all my five years, we never had a problem with lineup disputes,” Subhash said. “Every single person on the team — no matter what you played or if you played at all — everyone mattered equally.”

Senior Elaine Chervinsky exemplified this camaraderie during the team’s ACC opener against Clemson Feb. 21. Though sidelined due to injury, she remained on court alongside her doubles partner, senior Melodie Collard, and Collard’s temporary partner, freshman Isabelle Lacy, for the entirety of their match. Collard and Lacy were struggling to gain the upper hand, and Chervinsky provided unwavering support, offering encouragement and strategic advice, fully engaged despite being unable to compete in such an exciting match.

Another pillar of O’Leary’s healthy culture is the program’s emphasis on leadership. Players are encouraged to take ownership of their improvement and to inspire those around them. One such player, graduate student Sara Ziodato, was recently named ACC Player of the Week, a recognition O’Leary attributes to her dedication and leadership.

“I think we have great leadership with Sara Ziodato and Nicole Kiefer,” O’Leary said Feb. 23. “They've been amazing leaders this spring … showing the younger players, this is how we do things, just the sacrifices they've made, they're just so committed.”

This type of culture is not only crucial in tennis but is difficult to achieve. Matches have a tendency to feel very individual, and it is easy to feel like you are competing with your teammates. A team-first mentality is also crucial during tight matches, where a close bond can combat the high-pressure environment.

One hallmark of O’Leary’s teams has been their dominance in doubles play. The 2022-23 season, for instance, saw two Virginia doubles teams ranked in the top 10 nationally. Graduate student Julia Adams and senior Mélodie Collard reached the NCAA doubles semifinals, tying the program’s best-ever finish, while Subhash and Chervinsky peaked at No. 3 in the national rankings.

O’Leary’s approach to doubles is meticulous, pairing players based on complementary styles and honing their chemistry through rigorous practice. 

“I think there's so much strategy that goes along with it. I think figuring out who they partner well with personality wise, game style wise, makes a huge difference,” O’Leary said. “I think we're just a team that loves playing doubles.”

That makes sense given O’Leary’s history. She won the 2007 NCAA doubles title as a senior at North Carolina. That was part of a career that included All-America honors in 2006 and 2007.

O’Leary spent six years as an assistant coach at North Carolina after that, helping guide the Tar Heels to their first NCAA final and developing multiple All-Americans. As a head coach, she led Davidson to three consecutive winning seasons, earning Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year honors before coming to Virginia.

With back-to-back NCAA quarterfinal appearances and a deep, talented roster, the Cavaliers are poised for even greater heights. O’Leary’s ability to recruit players like Subhash and develop players, coupled with her strategic acuity, suggests that an NCAA championship could be within reach.

But for O’Leary, the goal remains the same — continuous, daily improvement. 

“The culture that the coaches built was something to fall back on,” Subhash said. “ … Whenever we would have a couple tough results, it was never a fear of ours that we wouldn't ever get it back.”

Under her leadership, Virginia women’s tennis is not just relevant — it has become a force to be reckoned with. And with O’Leary at the helm, the best may still be yet to come.


                        The Cavaliers have a solid record, but half of the lineup has underperformed.
                    


                        Virginia's NCAA Tournament hopes are officially gone.
                    


                        You might not know it yet, but when you talk about that culture, you will already be talking about James Hopper.
