                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former United States Women's National Team (USWNT) forward Alex Morgan has taken to social media to share the first images of her second child. The 35-year-old announced her pregnancy last September, at the same time she shared her heartfelt decision to retire from football. This week, Morgan posted images of newborn son Enzo, alongside daughter Charlie and husband Servando Carrasco. ‚ÄúWatching Charlie step into the big sis role has been so special‚Ä¶ we're soaking in every second.‚Äù She has been documenting the journey post-retirement to share with fans, including a subtle gender reveal in January. Back in her retirement announcement, she said of the pregnancy: ‚ÄúAs unexpected as this came, we are so overjoyed. I wouldn't be here without my husband and my family uplifting, motivating, encouraging, and supporting me and sacrificing for me for the last 15 years as a professional athlete.‚Äù Her nation's fifth-highest goal scorer, she is still heavily involved in the progress of women's football off the pitch ‚Äì but for now, she is busy ‚Äòsoaking' in the joy of becoming a family of four. ‚öΩ Relive the best football moments from Paris 2024 üèÖ Alex Morgan is one of the best and most influential players in USWNT history but did you know that she co-founded a female-led content platform with Chloe Kim, Sue Bird and Simone Manuel?</p>

From Pep Guardiola's Barcelona to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, its implementation has yielded trophies and thrilled fans. 

But is the 4-3-3 all attacking swagger, or does its inherent vulnerability leave teams exposed at the back? Let's delve into the dynamism and potential pitfalls of this iconic system.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just over a year until World Cup 2026 ‚Äì which will be played across the US, Canada and Mexico ‚Äì tournament organizer Fifa has run a poster campaign that's seen host cities each commission a local artist to celebrate football and regional culture. Across March and April, a new poster was unveiled every two days and now they're all live. It comes off the back of a similar project that saw each host city reveal its own sonic identity. Many offer a simple, effective glimpse into how the games might feel in each city and generate some tangible excitement. We've shared some of our favorites in this article, which we think best capture the spirit of what Fifa is trying to achieve. Interbrand, which designed the visual identity of the tournament which was first revealed back in 2023, says it has had nothing to do with either the poster or sonic ident projects, while a Fifa spokesperson says the organization worked with the host cities directly on both. The World Cup 2026 identity is the first ever to feature an image of the World Cup trophy in its true likeness and, according to Fifa, will form a template for future tournament identities. An official tournament song has been remixed by producers in each host city, including Houston, San Francisco and Mexico City. Although nothing's really captured our imagination quite like the underwater football scene imagined in the Boston poster by John Rego, which depicts a lobster attempting a scorpion kick not seen since Colombia keeper Ren√© Higuita tried it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RIYADH: Hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2034 is expected to transform Saudi Arabia's tourism sector and accelerate the nation's economic diversification, experts said. Saudi Arabia's sports tourism sector has been witnessing rapid growth since the launch of Vision 2030 nine years ago, with the Kingdom drawing 2.5 million visitors through 80 international events in the last four years, Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said in February. Saudi Arabia's ambitious National Tourism Strategy aims to attract 150 million visitors by the end of this decade. Speaking to Arab News, Federico Pienovi, chief business officer and CEO of New Markets at Globant, said that the mega football event presents immense opportunities for the Kingdom to develop multiple sectors. ‚ÄúHosting the FIFA World Cup is a game-changer for Saudi Arabia's tourism sector. For Saudi Arabia, FIFA World Cup 2034 represents a key milestone in its Vision 2030 strategy, accelerating economic diversification beyond oil by boosting tourism, hospitality, infrastructure, and smart city development,‚Äù said Pienovi. Thibault added that the event is also expected to accelerate Saudi Arabia's national strategies in tourism, transport, and quality of life, creating opportunities in construction, hospitality, fan engagement, and talent development ‚Äî all while mobilizing private sector investment. ‚ÄúOn a macroeconomic level, past World Cups have contributed up to 10 percent GDP growth, as seen in South Africa 2010, while creating tens of thousands of jobs. Max Klante, managing director and partner of Boston Consulting Group, said that major sporting events such as the 2034 World Cup, Formula 1, and the upcoming Asian games, will serve as an entry point for global audiences, showcasing Saudi Arabia as a travel destination. Thibault said that hosting such events will help Saudi Arabia establish itself as a premier sports destination globally, strengthen global ties, attract international business, and enhance the Kingdom's geopolitical influence. ‚ÄúWhen executed strategically, major sporting events leave a lasting impact beyond the tournament itself. Mega-events drive billions in tourism, investment, and job creation. He added: ‚ÄúIn terms of urban transformation, such events accelerate infrastructure development and reshape cities. The Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics revitalized an entire region, turning legacy resorts into prime real estate. Saudi Arabia's smart city and transport investments will ensure similar long-term benefits.‚Äù The Oliver Wyman official further said that hosting such global events could help Saudi Arabia strengthen its bilateral relationship with several countries. ‚ÄúMega-events further enhance global ties by bringing nations together through sport, fostering cultural exchange, trade, and investment partnerships. By attracting global leaders, Saudi Arabia can deepen international collaborations, expand economic alliances, and position itself as a key player in global sports diplomacy,‚Äù said Thibault. Klante also expressed identical views and said that successfully hosting global tournaments will enhance Saudi Arabia's standing as a reliable and capable partner on the world stage. ‚ÄúThe ability to deliver top-tier sporting events creates unique opportunities for diplomatic engagement and strengthens economic and cultural ties with other nations. Stronger ties promote global understanding, security and prosperity,‚Äù added the BCG official. Klante added that hosting major international events will establish Saudi Arabia's credibility in sports management and global event organization, while also opening opportunities for developing long-term partnerships with international teams, leagues, and sports federations. Experts who talked with Arab News also talked about the potential challenges Saudi Arabia could face as the Kingdom gears up to face global sporting events. According to Pienovi, the challenge for the Kingdom lies in integrating cutting-edge technology for seamless fan interactions ‚Äî whether it's AI-driven crowd management, frictionless ticketing, or hyper-personalized digital experiences. Implementing biometric entry, tech-driven loyalty programs and real-time engagement solutions will be key to delivering a next-level experience,‚Äù said Pienovi. He added: ‚ÄúThe challenge is not just in adopting these technologies but in making them intuitive, frictionless, and scalable across multiple venues.‚Äù The Globant official believes that ensuring seamless connectivity across all platforms ‚Äî from real-time streaming to AR-powered second-screen experiences ‚Äî will be crucial for reaching international audiences and keeping fans engaged beyond the stadium. He added: ‚ÄúEnsuring global accessibility, efficient transport, and a smooth visitor experience will be critical to success. A focus must always be placed on how the visitor journey interacts with the various city and intercity transport solutions ‚Äî creating a unified experience like no other.‚Äù Thibault also expressed similar views and said that logistics, crowd management and infrastructure development are crucial for Saudi Arabia to seamlessly host mega events like FIFA World Cup. Legacy planning is key to avoiding underutilized venues, ensuring stadiums transition into training hubs, community centers, or professional league facilities,‚Äù added Thibault. SINGAPORE/NEW YORK: Oil prices rose for a second session on Friday buoyed by potential de-escalation of the US-China trade war, but the market was headed for a weekly decline amid concerns about oversupply. ‚ÄúFor today, oil prices are slightly up as the market responds to signs of easing tensions around Trump's tariffs and a potential shift in the Fed's policy stance, contributing to a broader market recovery,‚Äù said LSEG senior analyst Anh Pham. ‚ÄúOn a weekly basis, however, prices are down as concerns over oversupply from OPEC+ persist, while the demand outlook remains uncertain amid ongoing trade tensions. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks between the US and China were underway, pushing back against Chinese claims that no discussions had taken place. China is considering exempting some US imports from its 125 percent tariffs and is asking businesses to provide lists of goods that could be eligible in the biggest sign yet of Beijing's concerns about the economic fallout from the trade war. China hiked its tariffs after Trump announced higher levies on Chinese goods. Oil prices tumbled earlier this month after the tariffs sparked concern about global demand and a sell-off in financial markets. Several OPEC+ members had suggested the group accelerate oil output increases for a second month in June, Reuters reported earlier this week. The US and Russia are moving in the right direction to end the war in Ukraine, but some specific elements of a deal remain to be agreed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with CBS News. And Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Thursday he was ready to travel to Europe for talks on Tehran's nuclear program. Iran is the third-biggest oil producer in OPEC behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. BEIRUT: Lebanon's parliament on Thursday granted regulatory bodies greater access to bank account information, a key reform demanded by international creditors before the crisis-hit country can unlock bail-out funds. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called parliament's approval of changes to banking secrecy laws ‚Äúa necessary step toward the desired financial reform that our government promised to achieve, and a fundamental pillar to any recovery plan.‚Äù Since then, authorities have come under local and international pressure to amend the laws amid accusations that influential figures spirited large sums abroad while regular depositors were locked out of their life savings and the local currency's value plummeted. Lebanese rights group Legal Agenda said the amendments allow ‚Äúbanking supervisory and regulatory bodies‚Äù including the central bank ‚Äúto request access to all banking information without linking the request to a specific objective.‚Äù These bodies will now be able to audit customer accounts by name, access deposit details and look into possible suspicious activity, the group said. Finance Minister Yassine Jaber told local broadcaster LBC that the amendments ‚Äúopened greater space‚Äù for Lebanon's central bank to access accounts. But ‚Äúwe should not think that with this law, anyone can enter a bank and demand account details‚Äù for whoever they like, added Jaber, who is in Washington with other senior officials for meetings with the IMF and the World Bank. Alain Aoun, a member of parliament's finance committee, said the move followed 2022 banking secrecy amendments that the IMF had viewed as ‚Äúinsufficient.‚Äù Now, regulatory bodies will be able to request ‚Äúthe information they want‚Äù on bank accounts, he said. WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund plans to work with Syria to help it reintegrate into the global economy, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, citing a meeting on the war-scarred nation held this week. ‚ÄúOur intention is to, first and foremost, help them rebuild institutions so they can plug themselves in the world economy,‚Äù she said. The high-level Syrian government delegation's Washington trip marked the first US visit by Syria's new authorities since former President Bashar Al-Assad was toppled in December. Much of Syria's infrastructure has been left in ruins by nearly 14 years of war sparked by the government authorities' deadly crackdown on protests against Al-Assad. The government that took over after Al-Assad was ousted has sought to rebuild Syria's ties in the region and further afield and to win support for reconstruction efforts. But tough US sanctions imposed during Al-Assad's rule remain in place. In January, the US issued a six-month exemption for some sanctions to encourage humanitarian aid, but this has had limited effect. Reuters reported in February that efforts to bring in foreign financing to pay public sector salaries had been hampered by uncertainty over whether this could breach US sanctions. The MSCI Tadawul Index also surged by 11.97 points, or 0.80 percent, to close at 1,500.71. The main index's top performer, Saudi Paper Manufacturing Co., recorded a 9.97 percent increase in its share price, closing at SR69.50. Other notable gainers included Derayah Financial Co., which rose 8.22 percent to SR30.95, while Al-Baha Investment and Development Co. saw its share price climb 6.34 percent to SR3.52. Saudi Arabian Mining Co. also recorded a positive trajectory, with its share price rising 5.74 percent to SR47.00. Saudi Reinsurance Co. posted similar gains, increasing 5.29 percent to close at SR43.75. Mulkia Gulf Real Estate REIT recorded the steepest decline on TASI, with its share price slipping 4.71 percent to close at SR5.26. Musharaka REIT Fund followed with a 3.51 percent drop to SR4.67. Saudi Cable Co. also saw a notable decline of 3.20 percent to settle at SR139. Other top gainers on Nomu included Al Mohafaza Co. for Education, which surged 7.79 percent, or SR1.80, to close at SR24.90, and Shalfa Facilities Management Co., which rose 7.43 percent, or SR5.50, to reach SR79.50. Osool and Bakheet Investment Co. posted the largest decline on Nomu, with its share price falling 8.11 percent to SR34. Altharwah Albashariyyah Co. fell 7.86 percent, or SR3.85, to close at SR45.15, while Meyar Co. declined 7.32 percent, or SR4.80, to settle at SR60.80 ‚Äî making them among the top decliners on the parallel market. JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia has launched a major dairy industrial cluster in Al-Kharj, reinforcing its ambition to become the region's leading hub for dairy production and food manufacturing. He said it will offer investors access to fully developed industrial land, modern facilities, storage solutions, and a comprehensive support system. In a statement on social media, Alkhorayef expressed gratitude to Riyadh Governor Prince Faisal bin Bandar for his patronage of the forum and for inaugurating the country's first dairy industrial cluster in Al-Kharj Industrial City. Al-Kharj alone contributes over 70 percent of the Kingdom's total dairy output, supplying both local and regional markets.</p>
