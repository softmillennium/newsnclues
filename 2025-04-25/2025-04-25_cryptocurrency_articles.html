You can get in touch with Suzanne by emailing s.blake@newsweek.com. Investor and CEO Cathie Wood's ARK Invest firm projects that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million per coin by 2030, according to its newly released Big Ideas 2025 report. Bitcoin is currently trading near $95,000, after reaching a record high of approximately $108,000 in December. ARK's prediction, if realized, would represent a more than 1,400 percent increase from today's levels. These projections were modeled based on Bitcoin's penetration rates into various total addressable markets (TAMs), including institutional portfolios, digital gold markets and use as a safe haven asset in emerging economies. "Institutional investment contributes the most to our bull case," said ARK research analyst David Puell, explaining that a 6.5 percent penetration rate into the $200 trillion global market for financial assets could propel Bitcoin's price dramatically. Bitcoin's growing appeal as "digital gold" was also emphasized, with ARK estimating Bitcoin could capture up to 60 percent of gold's $18 trillion market cap under favorable conditions. Additionally, Bitcoin's role in protecting wealth in emerging markets suffering from inflation could be a major driver of demand, contributing substantially to future valuation growth. Strike CEO Jack Mallers also weighed in on Bitcoin's prospects, suggesting that Bitcoin could climb to between $250,000 and $1 million by 2030, citing rising dysfunction in traditional financial systems as a tailwind, CCN reported. Newsweek reached out to ARK for comment via email. Bitcoin has had a mixed track record over the last five years. Sometimes it follows market trends, rising and falling as the S&P does. "Investors have soured on Cathie Woods ever since she has failed to replicate the magnificent returns she enjoyed during the pandemic rally. She has experienced significant outflows given her underperformance of the S&P 500 over recent years. To be honest, I often see many pundits bashing her as sort of envious of what she has become in a male dominated industry." Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, told Newsweek: "You know what's fascinating about Bitcoin predictions? Cathie Wood's $1.5 million forecast is fueled by institutional FOMO, not fundamentals. Because nobody gets famous for saying 'expect reasonable 7 to 9 percent returns.'" Trump's proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, outlined after his return to the White House, has energized crypto advocates who see government support as a potential catalyst for faster mainstream adoption. While ARK's models provide a roadmap for Bitcoin's potential, the firm acknowledged that risks remain significant, including adoption hurdles and market volatility. Still, Wood's team sees Bitcoin as uniquely positioned to evolve from a speculative asset into a core pillar of the global financial system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Atkins' first public event as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was a crypto roundtable on Friday, where the new agency chief devoted his inaugural speech to assuring the industry that he'll continue to remake securities policy to favor digital assets innovation. The agency and industry have been awaiting congressional action to establish crypto market-structure oversight that will likely set guardrails, and Atkins told an audience at the SEC's Washington headquarters that the regulator will work toward delivering "a rational, fit-for-purpose framework" for crypto. "It's always good to have Congress' input, and if there's a statute to back up what we're doing, I think that's all the better," Atkins said. "But we have ample room to maneuver under existing rules and laws." Atkins further suggested that he thinks the concept of special-purpose crypto broker dealers, a little-used registration most prominently represented by Prometheum, has been very successful and may need to be reconsidered, and he said the agency will look at whether custody rules need to be changed to "accommodate crypto assets and blockchain technology." Read More: Crypto Ally Paul Atkins Sworn In to Replace Gary Gensler Atop U.S. SEC As interim chairman, Uyeda reversed or sidelined a number of crypto policy efforts pursued under Gensler and has abandoned most of the regulator's prominent enforcement actions targeting the industry. Atkins had served as an adviser to crypto entities such as the Digital Chamber and as a board member of tokenization firm Securitize, and his ties to Off the Chain Capital had previously linked him to its investment stakes in big crypto companies like Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Kraken. Crypto custody has been a particularly dicey topic at the agency, which under Gensler's reign had sought to approve a policy demanding investment advisers put their clients' digital assets only with certain qualified custodians.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American fund manager Bitwise Asset Management has registered a trust entity named Bitwise NEAR ETF in Delaware — a move that typically precedes a formal filing with the SEC for an exchange-traded product that would track NEAR, the native asset of the NEAR Protocol. If successful, Bitwise's proposed fund would be the first US-based ETF tied to the layer 1 blockchain focused on scalability and developer accessibility. Prior to Bitwise's move, other asset managers such as 21Shares and Grayscale had already introduced NEAR-related investment products. Meanwhile, Grayscale operates the Grayscale NEAR Trust, a private placement vehicle that gives accredited investors access to NEAR, though it is not structured as an ETF. A US-listed NEAR ETF would expand institutional access to the token as it offers a regulated, exchange-traded vehicle. The ETF structure enables institutions to gain exposure to NEAR without the complexities of managing private keys, custody arrangements, or wallet infrastructure. Plus, by tracking the spot price of the underlying asset and disclosing holdings daily, the ETF provides real-time price transparency and a closer alignment with market value—features critical for portfolio management and compliance. The company manages a wide range of investment products, including crypto index funds, thematic equity ETFs, spot crypto ETPs, multi-strategy alpha solutions, separately managed accounts, and private funds. Bitwise's spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which launched in January 2024, has grown to $3.6 billion in assets under management, according to the latest data. Despite being on the market for just over a year, BITB ranks among the top-performing Bitcoin funds, with steady growth and strong investor demand. The new registration is part of Bitwise's ongoing effort to expand its digital asset offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, as institutional appetite for altcoin exposure gains momentum. Bitwise, as well as other fund managers, anticipate that a crypto-friendly environment in the Trump era will help accelerate the approval and adoption of crypto investment products. Earlier this week, Trump Media and Crypto.com finalized a deal to launch America-first ETFs, including ones tied to Cronos. Newly sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins, along with other Commissioners, is expected to review and rule on several pending ETF applications in the coming months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Fed has urged banks to be vigilant around crypto-related risks US banking regulators announced on Thursday they were pulling back several documents that urge banks to show caution when dabbling in cryptocurrency and related activities. The Federal Reserve said it was withdrawing a pair of supervisory letters stipulating that banks should seek advance approval from regulators before engaging in crypto-asset and stablecoin activities. Under the prior guidance, regulators warned banks to be wary of volatility, legal uncertainty and liquidity risks when considering whether to provide crypto-related services or take on crypto companies as clients. Scrapping that guidance marks the latest move by the Trump administration to strike a more crypto-friendly stance. In its statement announcing the changes, the Fed said regulators would be looking into whether new guidance to "support innovation, including crypto-asset activities, is appropriate."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto prices have roared back as a leak reveals U.S. president Donald Trump's radical plans for crypto are causing growing “panic" among the establishment. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has climbed toward $100,000 per bitcoin, up from April lows of around $75,000, as bullish traders bet the market is heading toward a $19 trillion “tipping point.” Now, as fears swirl crypto “contagion" could blow up the financial system, the Federal Reserve has quietly rolled back rules that deterred Wall Street from engaging with bitcoin and crypto—just as institutional investors push up the bitcoin price. The Federal Reserve has announced it is withdrawing guidance originally issued under Democratic Party president Joe Biden that deterred Wall Street banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities by requiring them to get advance approval. Under the guidance, the Fed had warned banks to be wary of volatility, legal uncertainty and liquidity risks when considering whether to provide crypto-related services or take on crypto companies as clients. “With these restrictions now lifted state member banks can pursue crypto ventures without prior approval though such activities will still be monitored through standard supervision," analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. "This move reflects the Trump administration's increasingly pro-crypto stance including reduced regulatory enforcement, support for a national bitcoin reserve and the appointment of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Paul Atkins, known for backing digital assets.” The move has been welcomed as a victory over the Biden era rules that had been described as a clandestine "Operation Choke Point 2.0" by some and at least led to banks backing away from crypto. Over the last year, following the debut of a fleet of wildly successful spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wall Street, banks have been rushing to offer bitcoin and crypto to clients. Pressure is mounting on the Fed to cut rates more aggressively, which could trigger broader U.S. dollar outflows.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Or better yet, will there soon be no difference at all? That sets up the entire crypto sector, from Bitcoin to the best altcoins altcoins and meme coins, for ever-greater success. Back in 2023, after the epic FTX collapse, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency all required banks and financial institutions to give prior notice to regulators before undertaking crypto activities. ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0,' as crypto folks call it, served to limit collaborations. Importantly, the change of rules doesn't give crypto-focused banks access to so-called ‘master accounts,' required for Fed members to access the central bank's services. So far, the Fed has refused to give any crypto bank master account access. It feels like PayPal might somehow be flying under the radar, but the company still managed to generate nearly $32B in profit in 2024, when $1.6T was spent on the platform. The centralized exchange will waive purchase fees for $PYUSD and make it easier for users to swap the stablecoin 1:1 for USD; that could make the stablecoin an attractive on- and off-ramp option for crypto-to-fiat moves. If Coinbase and PayPal can help to make stablecoins mainstream, that could in turn boost broader adoption. Some analysts see stablecoins as on the verge of a ‘ChatGPT moment,' ready to move from fringe use cases to an integral part of everyday life. There's already been considerable growth in recent months. Continued growth could send the stablecoin market cap – currently $211M – skyrocketing to new levels. Even their low-end estimate sees stablecoins reaching $1.6T. With stablecoins growing and the Federal Reserve moving further towards crypto approval, are the scales tilting back towards altcoins again? The market is certainly more favorable for non-Bitcoin cryptos than it used to be. Here are three of the best altcoins to keep your eyes on. Relationships between creators and fans are vital for the success of content creators, and $SUBBD token brings increased clarity and ease of access to the growing SUBBD platform. There's a flat 20% APY on $SUBBD tokens for the first year, after which staking moves towards a platform benefits model. Content creation is an established market sector worth over $85B; $SUBBD token could transform it entirely. The platform provides a suite of AI tools for better content management for creators and gives fans access to exclusive content such as behind-the-scenes and live streams. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers a next-gen crypto wallet with an intuitive interface and features tailored for beginners and power users alike. It's built to be the only wallet you'll ever need, and comes loaded with features to find the next big thing in crypto – such as the Upcoming Tokens section. Early investors can increase their earnings even further by staking $BEST during the presale at 127% APY; learn how to buy Best Wallet tokens in our guide. Our analysis shows the potential for $BEST to reach $0.072 in 2025 on the back of a successful presale, which has already raised $11.8M. Aimed at institutional investors, Ondo provides exposure to short-term US Treasuries with $OUSG and yield from stablecoins with $USDY. Those are institution-only products, but everyday investors can snag $ONDO for indirect exposure. As institutions increasingly look for compliant crypto exposure, Ondo is positioning itself as a go-to platform. The discussions focused on tokenizing publicly traded US securities, offering yet another investment vehicle for major financial institutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's growing decoupling from US equities is fueling its appeal as a safe-haven asset alongside gold, BlackRock's Jay Jacobs told CNBC. In a recent interview with CNBC, Jacobs said that geopolitical tensions and rising global uncertainty are accelerating diversification strategies among central banks. He pointed to a long-term trend where countries have been reducing their reliance on dollar-based reserves in favor of assets like gold and, increasingly, Bitcoin (BTC). He said that recent geopolitical fragmentation has intensified the push toward alternative stores of value. Source: YouTubeRelated: Crypto, stocks enter ‘new phase of trade war' as US-China tensions rise He noted that this environment is fueling demand for uncorrelated assets, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed alongside gold as a safe-haven asset. And this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently,” Jacobs said. Related: Bitcoin ‘decouples,' stocks lose $3.5T amid Trump tariff war and Fed warning of ‘higher inflation' Several analysts have also observed that Bitcoin is beginning to decouple from the US stock market. On April 22, Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of the Nansen crypto intelligence platform, said Bitcoin's price is showcasing its growing maturity as a global asset, becoming “less Nasdaq — more gold.” Echoing this sentiment, QCP Capital said in an April 21 Telegram note that Bitcoin seemed to be sharing some of gold's limelight as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has just blasted through the $5 million mark in its ICO. This Bitcoin-linked meme coin is generating serious buzz by promising actual BTC airdrops when Bitcoin hits milestone prices. And with one top analyst predicting “huge” returns post-listing, BTCBULL is quickly becoming a hot topic. BTC Bull Token's setup is drawing lots of attention. Here's how it works: When Bitcoin hits key price milestones (starting at $150K and moving up in $50K chunks), BTCBULL holders get actual Bitcoin airdropped to their wallets. BTCBULL's team also burns tokens at various Bitcoin price points ($125K, $175K, and $225K), permanently removing them from circulation. This approach helps create scarcity, which tends to push prices up over time. However, that hasn't stopped investors from locking up over 1.2 billion BTCBULL tokens already. The project's Telegram channel members see BTCBULL as a way to bet on Bitcoin's price action while receiving a sort of “dividend” along the way. The ICO has been gaining serious momentum, with options to buy using crypto, bank cards, or directly through the Best Wallet app – making it accessible to new traders. BTCBULL's team has also set aside 10% of the supply for initial liquidity. ZEUS is extremely bullish on BTCBULL's unique milestone system, believing it could create massive wealth for holders if Bitcoin goes on another bull run. He also pointed out the lack of bull-themed meme coins in today's market. Most meme coins focus on dogs, cats, or frogs, yet BTCBULL takes an entirely different approach that could help it stand out. Bitcoin hitting $125K, $150K, or even $200K this year isn't some crazy fantasy. With institutional money still flowing in and supply getting squeezed, these milestones could happen faster than most people expect. It's a double-whammy that could boost gains far beyond what holding Bitcoin alone would give you. When Bitcoin runs, investors tend to look for higher beta plays. BTCBULL positions itself as one of these plays, and given the size of its X (Twitter) community, it's already building the kind of momentum that could translate into serious FOMO once exchange listings are announced. The $5 million milestone might be just the beginning of what could become one of 2025's most talked-about token launches if Bitcoin continues to rise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on his YouTube channel, Hoskinson says he doesn't “think Ethereum will survive more than 10 to 15 years.” According to Hoskinson, Ethereum faces existential threats both from within its ecosystem and externally. And users will gradually migrate to other places and then they're going to get eclipsed by Bitcoin DeFi (decentralized finance). Because once that turns on, the TVL (total value locked) will be larger than Ethereum and a lot of people will start migrating in that particular direction… But people have fundamentally different paradigms that over the long term are intrinsically superior. “The number one problem Ethereum has is that they took an easy road out where they did three things wrong. Second, what they chose to do to solve these problems is put in all these weird slashing economics and layer-twos and other things and now they're living with all of the consequences of these types of things. And third, they really don't have a good on-chain governance system So really what needs to happen is you need a parallel track with solving all those three things.” Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

ADA Price Prediction: Can It Break the $1 Mark Next Month? Zora Airdrop Scandal: From “For Fun” to Loss of Trust Gold vs. Bitcoin: Two Pillars of Value Preservation, But Which Is Better? XRP Deep Dive: A Masssive Player in Today's Crypto Market Study: 88% of Businesses Reported Higher Revenue after Accepting Crypto Payment Survey: Nearly 80% of FTX Creditors Will Reinvest in Crypto with Their Repayment As NFT adoption expands across digital markets, the blending of collectible culture, gamified incentives, and blockchain-based utility continues to deepen. This fusion is especially noticeable in platforms that rank among the highest rated casinos, where mechanics like digital ownership, scarcity-driven value, and interactive rewards closely reflect those found in many NFT ecosystems. Understanding how these systems intersect can offer NFT enthusiasts new perspectives on utility, interactivity, and value in decentralized environments. Additionally, this active engagement model mirrors strategies of many high-performing digital platforms. To retain users, these platforms entice repeat participation by creating incrementally rewarding systems, tiered perks, and gamified value roll-up schemes. NFT platforms have a wide range of features, and the most sophisticated digital casinos all have one thing in common: the loyalty program and engagement-centered recreation promote off-activity association toward predefined NFT or tokenomic value targets they need to achieve or milestones they unlock through participation. Even more sophisticated systems allow for custom point scoring that can be set by the users themselves. The challenge comes from crafting fair engagement models that earn users' earned social capital through posted interactions and incentivize user engagement at sustainable levels while maintaining verifiably transparent token economics. Projects such as Capsule House and Art Blocks thrive on this mechanic, introducing unprecedented freedom into partnered user experiences. Interactive digital platforms often implement RNG to ensure fairness and uniqueness; some are even audited under regulatory scrutiny. The connected industry applies RNG in similar ways, depicting how both industries are attempting to blend randomness with value, wherein the outcome is both pleasantly unexpected and extremely desirable. Users can participate in DAOs, vote on roadmap decisions, or create assets—all these activities contribute to shaping NFT ecosystems. It is striking to point out that leading NFT projects have focused on transparency and usefulness of value over time, which explains why they sustain community engagement. There are examples that illustrate this participatory model: those centered around user innovation. Take, for instance, the most popular casinos and countless other platforms that use a sharpened focus on engagement. Responsibly driven engagement tools make users devoted to the brand, along with transparent communication. Success, in both spaces, relies on the amount of funding and outreach incentive provided to communities. From NFT profile picture collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club to avatar skins in metaverse games, NFTs offer status and functionality to their owners. These assets can be used across various platforms and are not limited to gaming, branding, or social networking; they serve multiple purposes. This cross-platform use comes hand-in-hand with other engagement trends, such as loyalty programs that reward user interaction in the highest-rated casinos. In every form, users are more than just players or holders: They actively participate in ecosystems where their contributions and assets matter continually. The broader application of fundamental principles like RNG, tokenomics, gamified advancement, and participatory governance underscores the emerging innovation nexus between NFTs and other decentralized ecosystems. The advancement of NFT platforms with a focus on user experience, engagement, and openness will mark industry leaders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although short-term price movements reflect shifting momentum, on-chain metrics signal deeper changes that may have broader implications for Ethereum's network health and investor sentiment. Recent data from CryptoQuant reveals that long-term Ethereum holders are increasing their activity. This coincides with rising network activity, including a notable uptick in active addresses and transactional volume. Together, these developments suggest that behind the surface-level volatility, there may be a quiet phase of accumulation and user engagement building within the Ethereum ecosystem. CryptoQuant contributor OnChainSchool reports a significant development among Ethereum's long-term holding addresses. In the last 48 hours, over 640,000 ETH flowed into wallets that have maintained a strict accumulation pattern without any recorded selling behavior. This marks the largest inflow to such wallets since 2018, suggesting that entities with a long-term outlook are increasing their exposure during the current price range. The behavior of these accumulation-only wallets is often viewed as a proxy for investor conviction, particularly among participants who are not influenced by short-term volatility. It's also notable that these inflows come at a time when Ethereum fundamentals such as its transition to proof-of-stake, L2 adoption, and evolving staking mechanisms continue to advance. If sustained, this trend could help establish a support zone around current price levels. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Carmelo Alemán, highlights that the number of active Ethereum addresses grew by nearly 10% between April 20 and April 22, jumping from around 306,000 to over 336,000. This metric counts unique wallet addresses that were involved in transactions as either senders or receivers over a given period. While active addresses alone do not capture the full picture, Alemán notes that the metric should be viewed alongside others such as exchange volume, gas fees, transaction count, and Layer 2 activity. The rise in address activity, especially when paired with a simultaneous price increase, is often taken as a sign of broader user engagement and growing application-layer demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DraftKings, the popular sports betting and fantasy sports company, has agreed to a $10 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning its now-defunct non-fungible token (NFT) platform, DK Marketplace. The class-action lawsuit was filed in March 2023 by lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who argued that DraftKings' Reignmakers NFTs qualified as investment contracts under U.S. securities law, specifically based on the Howey Test. In July 2024, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper denied DraftKings' motion to dismiss the case. Following this decision, DraftKings shut down its NFT platform, leaving thousands of users with illiquid assets that dropped drastically in value. This could involve more than 175,000 investors, according to reports from Cointelegraph and SBC Americas. After deducting legal fees and administrative expenses, the settlement funds will be shared proportionally among eligible class members. Lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe is also expected to receive a $50,000 service award for representing the class. DraftKings cited “recent legal developments” as the reason for shutting down its NFT marketplace, a move that left Reignmakers NFTs illiquid and virtually worthless. This closure also came shortly after DraftKings reached a separate undisclosed settlement in January 2025 with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), which had sued the company for using NFL player likenesses in Reignmakers without paying royalties. More about the NFLPA can be found at their official site: 🔗 https://www.nflpa.com/ If you are a U.S. resident who purchased, sold, or held a DraftKings NFT through DK Marketplace during the defined class period, you may be eligible to claim part of the settlement. Claimants should keep an eye on official notifications or updates via legal settlement portals. Details about claim submission deadlines and methods will be published following final settlement approval by the court. This case adds to a growing list of legal actions targeting crypto and NFT platforms over alleged securities violations. It underscores increasing regulatory scrutiny of digital assets and reinforces the need for consumer protection in evolving financial markets.

Rumors of a Pokémon Web3 entry via a Sui blockchain partnership are circulating due to recent policy updates and deleted mentions. While exciting, the Pokémon-Sui connection remains speculative without concrete proof. Something curious is happening in the world of crypto – and it has Pokémon fans and blockchain watchers leaning in. Nothing is confirmed yet, but the signs are starting to add up. On April 23, Pokémon HOME introduced a new feature that lets users collect medals. At first glance, it seemed like a small, routine update. In certain regions, the policy now includes a mention of Parasol Technologies—a new name for most users. This quiet policy change has led many to believe there could be a bigger collaboration in the works between Pokémon and the world of blockchain. In an early version of the blog post, Pokémon NFTs were mentioned—only for the reference to be quickly removed. A well-known crypto commentator known as Shotgun pointed out that the new medals in Pokémon HOME aren't just static tokens—they could potentially be digital collectibles that are tradable, adding a whole new layer of excitement if they're connected to blockchain. The official Sui Foundation blog confirmed (and removed) Pokémon NFTs.⁰They seem to be developing a cloud infrastructure that uses blockchain technology to address bugs, hacks, and duping while enabling transfers between compatible games—something that is already possible with… pic.twitter.com/pNtWVDB3du One user on X reminded everyone that crypto is no stranger to overhyped speculation. Without actual contracts or blockchain code to examine, there's still no solid proof that Pokémon is officially involved with Sui. rumors and speculation drive hype cycles but rarely reflect reality. until then it's just noise in the signal. While rumors swirl, SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, is making major moves of its own. The token recently broke through key resistance levels and is now trading comfortably above $3.00. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows noted that if this momentum continues, SUI could climb to around $3.80 to $4.00 by early May. Large holders, known as whales, have started accumulating more SUI, and daily trading volume has surged past $128 million. That's a strong sign of growing interest. The Sui ecosystem is thriving, with its native token ranked 13th in market cap at $9.88 billion. SUI's recent price surge to over $3.00 reflects a 26% increase in a single day, driven by high trading volumes and rising investor interest. The ecosystem's total market cap has exceeded $15.79 billion, with SUI making up 90.5% of it. Whether you're deep into crypto or a longtime Pokémon fan, the idea of Pokémon entering the blockchain world is a major headline. While there's no official word yet, the clues are getting harder to ignore. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. Additionally, SUI has broken through key resistance levels, supported by bullish technical indicators. Increased trading volume and growth in the Sui ecosystem, especially in DeFi, have further added to the momentum. ​As of now, there is no official confirmation that Pokémon is entering the Web3 space through a partnership with the Sui blockchain. Speculation has been fueled by recent developments, including a Pokémon HOME privacy policy update mentioning Parasol Technologies, a blockchain gaming studio acquired by Mysten Labs, the team behind Sui.</p>

This allows retrospective analysis and predictions, revealing that PM sources are distinct, dynamically changing over time, and often asynchronous with interventions. Additionally, we estimate source contributions to PM2.5 and its compounds, highlighting the increasing impact of biomass burning. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2100, PM levels may decline to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m³ in the Americas and 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m³ in Asia under climate mitigation scenarios but will still exceed WHO guidelines without further controls on natural emissions. Guiding future interventions with isotopic big data is essential for addressing air pollution challenges. Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts Earth's radiation budget1, global climate2, and public health3,4. Exposure to ambient PM, even at low concentrations, harms human health5. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the recommended annual PM2.5 (PM ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) exposure limit to 5 μg/m3 in 20216. However, recent global estimates indicate that 99.82% of the land area and 99.99% of the population are still exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding this limit6. This underscores PM pollution as a pressing global challenge, necessitating effective interventions. Precisely tracing PM emissions and evaluating the effectiveness of past pollution interventions are essential for designing future PM strategies. However, it is difficult because PM composition is complex, including both local emissions and regional transport7. The pollution levels exhibit a complex nonlinear relationship with emissions. This introduces uncertainties in previous bottom-up emission inventories and molecular-/element-based top-down tracing methods8. Recently, isotopic techniques have provided high-precision fingerprints for top-down tracing of PM emissions9. Isotope ratios tend to show distinct signatures (i.e., fingerprints) among various sources due to different formation processes10. Importantly, these isotopic fingerprints are preserved through complex atmospheric processes11. To date, 14 elemental isotopes, carbon (fM-14C for radioactive; δ13C for stable), nitrogen (δ15N), oxygen (δ18O), silicon (δ30Si), sulfur (δ34S), iron (δ56Fe), nickel (δ60Ni), copper (δ65Cu), zinc (δ66Zn), strontium (δ87Sr), neodymium (δ144Nd), hafnium (δ177Hf), lead (207Pb/206Pb), and mercury (δ202Hg), have been utilized for source tracing of PM species12,13,14,15. Nevertheless, these applications mainly concentrate on short-term PM pollution events on a local scale. Only two global long-term nitrogen isotope studies have focused on nitrates and ammonium12,16, which is inadequate for assessing overall PM. Therefore, a global long-term analysis of PM and their emissions' isotopic big data is particularly important for tracing PM sources and interventions. To achieve global isotopic big data analysis, we developed the Isotopic Database for Global Atmospheric Research (IDGAR). A blockchain architecture was integrated into IDGAR to ensure the accuracy and traceability of isotopic big data. Based on IDGAR, we created a comprehensive global isotopic map of 1890 pollution events across 66 countries from 1957–2023, revealing the regional-specific source-end isotopic values for PM tracing. Moreover, we identified main emissions and assessed their specific effective intervention durations for different PM species by analyzing the trends and change rates of isotopic big data. Relying on these comprehensions, we estimated the source composition of PM2.5 and its critical components, and characterize the spatiotemporal variations of these source composition. We reveal the rising impact of biomass burning and liquid fossil fuels combustion. Furthermore, we project future PM2.5 trends in scenarios aimed at meeting climate goals of 1.5 °C and 2 °C by 2100. The blockchain-based isotopic big data directly connects PM, sources, and interventions, providing important guidance for future atmospheric research. We developed the IDGAR database (http://idgar.org/) by compiling 34,815 non-redundant global isotopic observations, including 7,053 source and 27,762 PM isotopic data published between 1957 and 2024 (Supplementary Fig. These observations include 14 elements across 1,890 PM pollution events and isotopes such as fM-14C, δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, δ30Si, δ34S, δ56Fe, δ60Ni, δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ87Sr, δ144Nd, δ177Hf, 207Pb/206Pb, and δ202Hg (Supplementary Fig. For light elements (e.g., C, N, S), the isotopic characteristics of different compounds, including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and sulfate (SO42-), have been thoroughly compiled. Moreover, we integrated a blockchain architecture into IDGAR's data management system, ensuring that the isotopic-driven tracing process is immutable and traceable. Specifically, the curated isotopic data and their details (e.g., sampling date, site location, reference), along with user operations (including authentication information, downloads, and uploads), are transformed into unique 64-character hexadecimal strings using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA256, a cryptographic function) and stored as a block in IDGAR (Supplementary Fig. Moreover, each future user action or data update is digitally recorded with timestamps, which are input into the SHA256 function along with the previous block's string to generate a new block string. Through this iterative hashing pattern, each block is closely linked to all preceding blocks in chronological order, thereby systematically growing the blockchain. Even a minor alteration results in distinct changes in subsequent blocks, enabling precise identification of affected blocks and files by tracing back to the initial block that experienced a hash change. By ensuring data tamper-proofing and increasing trust, IDGAR facilitates the accurate and sustainable application of publicly shared atmospheric isotopic big data for researchers worldwide. To obtain complete and definitive source-end isotopic values for accurately explaining PM origins, we developed the global isotopic map of PM sources based on IDGAR. This map includes the source isotopic fingerprints of various PM species, e.g., EC, OC, NO3-, NH4+, SO42-, and metals, across diverse global regions (from 75.10° S to 83.20° N) between 1957–2023 (Figs. For instance, EC has sources such as coal combustion, C3 plants burning emissions, C4 plants burning emissions, and vehicle exhaust, while OC is not entirely the same, as it also includes emissions from liquefied petroleum gas. Therefore, PM source tracing require multi-species isotopic fingerprints. Notably, most isotopic fingerprints showed notable variations among these sectors for different species (P < 0.05), indicating their potential for PM source distinction (Fig. Moreover, a closer examination revealed regional heterogeneity in source isotopic fingerprints of certain individual species, e.g., Pb, across Asia, Europe, and the Americas (P < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1 & 2). This variability may be attributed to the diverse industrial structures and lifestyles in these regions. However, formal bootstrap testing indicated no statistical dependence of isotopic fingerprints on latitude and longitude within these regions (P > 0.05, Supplementary Fig. These blockchain-based continent-specific source isotopic values enable to provide accurate reference for tracing PM and their species sources. a Geographical distribution of 7,053 isotopic fingerprints in global PM emissions. The map was created using Natural Earth. Free vector and raster map data are available at naturalearthdata.com. b–m Statistical differences in isotopic fingerprints among different emissions. The labels VE, CC, BB, BBC4, BBC3, LFF, WM, LE, VF, MicP, VEdiesel, VEgasoline, OE, NS, IOC, NEE, NEERP, NEET, NEEBP, and WI in (b–m) represent vehicle exhausts, coal combustion, biomass burning, C4 plants burning, C3 plants burning, liquid fossil fuels combustion, waste materials, livestock emissions, volatilized fertilizer, microbial processes, diesel vehicle emissions, gasoline vehicle emissions, ore-related emissions, natural soil, industrial oil combustion, non-exhaust emissions, non-exhaust emissions-road paint, non-exhaust emissions-tire, non-exhaust emissions-brake pad and waste incinerator. The isotopic composition of ammonium (NH4⁺) and nitrate (NO3⁻) sources is conventionally expressed in terms of their precursor compounds, namely the isotopic composition of NH3 and NOx, respectively47,48. Note: the isotopic compositions of Zn (j) and Pb (m) from different sources show significant differences (P < 0.05), but there are too many statistical results to be clearly labeled in the figure. Additionally, details on the number of isotopic data points in each window (b–m) are also provided in the Source Data file. IDGAR provides an unprecedented opportunity for long-term analyzes of global PM isotopic fingerprints, enabling the identification of shifts and intervention effectiveness on main sources of PM species. The isotopic fingerprints of PM species represent a linear mixture of different sources. By analyzing their temporal trends and comparing them with the aforementioned isotopic fingerprints, the main sources during a corresponding period can be identified. If the rates of change in PM isotopic fingerprints (i.e., the slope between isotopic fingerprints and year) show a continuous decline but do not reverse direction, it indicates that the main sources' contributions are increasing, but the growth rate is slowing down. This suggests that the intervention targeting the main sources has begun to take effect. Perhaps this scenario is suspected to be due to the increase in contributions from sources with opposite isotopic compositions. However, if this is the case, the isotopic fingerprints of PM will show opposite trend changes and the corresponding change rates will also reverse direction. Therefore, analyzing the temporal trends and change rates of isotopic big data can identify the main sources of PM species, and evaluate the effectiveness and timing of interventions on these main sources. Considering the temporal trends and magnitudes may be influenced by the selection of the start and end years, we performed formal bootstrap testing procedures and moving subset window analysis. We found that global fM-14C, δ15N, 207Pb/206Pb, δ18O, δ30Si, δ34S, δ56Fe, δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ87Sr and δ202 Hg of PM species show varying temporal dynamics, including different trend breaks, tendencies, and change rates (Fig. This indicates that different PM components have distinct main sources and interventions during different periods. For instance, the global fM-14C of EC in PM increased significantly before 2014, then declined (Fig. 2a), indicating that their main emissions shift from non-fossil fuel source (i.e., biomass burning, fM-14C = 1) to fossil fuel combustion (coal or oil, fM-14C = 0)21,22 in 2014. By analyzing the EC δ13C trend and source isotopic values, we further identified whether biomass burning before 2014 was dominated by C4 or C3 plants. Specifically, the rise in EC δ13C during 2001–2008 and 2012–2014 suggests C4 plants burning (δ13C-EC = −15.4 ± 2.73‰) was the main source, while the decline from 2009–2011 points to C3 plants burning (δ13C-EC = -27.5 ± 2.69‰). Notably, the rate of increase in fM-14C slowed continuously during 2005–2007, and 2012–2014 (Fig. 2b), suggests effective interventions targeting C4 plants emissions during these periods (Supplementary Fig. a, c, e, g Temporal trends of fM-14C for EC (a) and OC (c) δ15N for NH4+ (e) and NO3− (g) were analyzed using formal bootstrap testing procedures. The abbreviations EC, OC, NH4+, and NO3- represent elemental carbon, organic carbon, ammonium, and nitrate, respectively. The different-colored lines in (a, c, e) and g represent liner fits for different periods, with the corresponding shading indicating their 95% confidence intervals. b, d, f, h Moving subset window analysis of the temporal change trends of fM-14C-EC (b), fM-14C-OC (d) δ15N-NH4+ (f) and δ15N-NO3− (h) over 5-year periods. The bars represent isotopic change rates (k) every 5 years. Details on the amount of isotopic data in each plot are provided in the Source Data file. Statistical robustness was verified using the Theil–Sen estimator (Supplementary Figs. The color scale of the bars correspond to temporal trends, without specific indication. i Global distribution of atmospheric particulate matter isotopic observations and pollution levels. The global atmospheric particulate matter pollution levels are represented by the annual average concentrations of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for 2022. Isotopic observations are primarily concentrated in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The map was generated with Natural Earth, which provides free vector and raster map data available at naturalearthdata.com. j The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) map shows global atmospheric particulate matter isotopic affinities within the IDGAR. Most isotopic data form distinct clusters rather than random distributions. In contrast to EC, global fM-14C of OC in PM dropped sharply before 2015, then rose (Fig. 2c), indicating fossil fuel combustion (oil or coal) dominated pre-2015, while biomass burning (fM-14C = 1) became dominant afterward. The OC δ13C has steadily increased, surpassing the isotopic end-member value for oil (Supplementary Figs. 1c), pointing to coal combustion as the main source before 2015, with a shift to C4 plants emissions thereafter. The slower decline in fM-14C of OC from 2009 to 2011 (Fig. 2d) suggests effective interventions on coal combustion during this period (Supplementary Fig. Moreover, global δ15N of ammonium salts in PM decreased from 2001 to 2013, then rose from 2014 to 2020 (Fig. 2e), indicating a shift in main sources of ammonium salts from isotope-depleted to isotope-enriched ones, e.g., vehicle exhaust. Notably, during 2017–2020, the rate of δ15N-NH4+ increase slowed continuously (Fig. 2f), suggesting effective interventions targeting vehicle-derived NH4+-bearing PM (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, δ15N of NO3− increased from −12.0 ± 15.9‰ to 6.1 ± 6.5‰ between 2001 and 2018, suggesting coal combustion as the main source. Afterward, δ15N-NO3− declined, pointing to non-coal sources, e.g., gasoline combustion, microbial processes, or biomass burning (Fig. The rate of δ15N-NO3− increase slowed between 2013 and 2018 (Fig. 2h), indicating effective measures against coal-related NO3− in PM (Supplementary Fig. Similarly, δ34S in sulfate generally declined, with a brief increase from 2015 to 2016 (Supplementary Fig. The rate of decline slowed during 2010–2012 and after 2020 (Supplementary Fig. Based on source δ34S values, we suggest that before 2015, coal or biomass combustion was the main source of sulfate, effectively controlled between 2010 and 2012. After 2020, isotopic values fell below 2‰, indicating that biomass burning (δ34S = 1.84 ± 5.41‰) became the dominant source and has been progressively managed. In addition to these high-abundance components, a detailed discussion on the main sources of other components and the effectiveness of their interventions is provided in the Supplementary Note 2. Overall, effective interventions were only observed for the main sources of PM components, e.g., EC, OC, NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, Pb, Sr, and Hg, and their effectiveness was limited to specific periods rather than the entire study duration (Supplementary Fig. These results indicate that the main sources and corresponding interventions are not synchronized. The heterogeneity of different PM species underscores the importance of considering multi-species isotopes in tracing overall PM source and interventions. To further characterize the relationships among multi-species isotopic, we performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis on the isotopic fingerprints from 1890 global PM pollution events. Despite being distributed across various global regions (from 69.37° S to 85.64° N, Fig. 2i) and potentially subject to different interventions at different times, isotopes of the same components tend to cluster into unique groups rather than distribute randomly (Fig. This highlights the independent indicative capacities of these isotopes and the importance of considering multidimensional isotopes in PM source tracing. Using the isotopic big data, the Bayesian stable isotope mixing model implemented in the R package (MixSIAR), the mass concentrations of various PM2.5 components, we conducted source tracing analyzes for individual PM2.5 compounds. By aggregating the emissions of different components, we estimated the contribution of each subdivided source to PM2.5. The uncertainty of source apportionment results was derived from MixSIAR model analysis and error propagation formula (see “Methods” for details). Noteworthy, although the isotopic fractionation correction of certain components, such as NH4+ and NO3-, during the conversion process has been accounted for in the MixSIAR model (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 3 for details), future in-depth studies on the isotopic fractionation mechanisms of specific transformation reactions under real-world environmental conditions will further improve the accuracy of source apportionment results. Furthermore, the robustness of MixSIAR performance was verified using the other Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, i.e., MixSIR and Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals (FRUITS) (Supplementary Note 4). Significant variations were observed in the contributions of different sources to PM2.5 and its components (Fig. Globally, biomass burning and coal combustion are the main sources of PM2.5, and the main component affected by these sources is most likely OC (Fig. Additionally, biomass burning and vehicle exhaust are the leading contributors to EC in PM2.5, accounting for 2.17 ± 0.09% and 2.23 ± 0.09% of the total mass of PM2.5, respectively, through EC emissions. Natural soil and coal combustion are the major sources of Si in PM2.5, with Si emissions from these sources contributing 1.99 ± 0.08 % and 1.22 ± 0.06%, respectively, to the overall PM2.5 mass. Additionally, some subdivided sources also affect PM2.5 pollution levels by emitting specific components. For instance, the combustion of liquid fossil fuels and industrial fuel oil primarily impacts PM2.5 levels by altering concentrations of OC and sulfates. Non-exhaust emissions are a key source of metal elements in PM2.5, especially Fe and Zn, with Fe and Zn emissions contributing 0.26 ± 0.02% and 0.15 ± 0.01% to the total mass of PM2.5, respectively. Waste materials, livestock waste, and volatilized fertilizer influence PM2.5 pollution levels through the NH3 emission. These refined source apportionment results are essential for the precise implementation of PM2.5 source control measures. a, b, c, d The source composition of PM2.5 and its components in the worldwide (a) Asia (b) the Americas (c) and Europe (d). The labels CC, BB, VE, LFF, IOC, NS, BP, WM, NEE, LE, VF, and WI are abbreviations for coal combustion, biomass burning, vehicle exhausts, liquid fossil fuels combustion, industrial oil combustion, natural soil, biological process, waste materials, non-exhaust emissions, livestock emissions, volatilized fertilizer, and waste incinerator, respectively. Biological processes include plant debris, fungal bacteria, pollen, particulate matter generated by the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, microbial processes. Note: in the isotopic source tracing analysis of OC in PM2.5, the liquid fossil fuels combustion is classified as a subdivided source, while OC emissions from vehicle exhaust are not double-counted. Due to the absence of the δ¹⁵N values for ammonia from biomass burning in the Americas and Europe, the global source apportionment study relied on the δ¹⁵N values for ammonia from Asian biomass burning to estimate global values. Regionally, a closer characterization revealed heterogeneity in the source composition of PM2.5 and its components across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. From 2001 to 2023, coal combustion is the dominant source of PM2.5 emissions in Asia, whereas biomass burning serves as the primary contributor to PM2.5 emissions in Europe and the Americas (Fig. This finding aligns with high coal consumption in Asia23. Moreover, the same type of sources, such as biomass burning, show varying contributions to PM2.5 components across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. For instance, biomass burning in Asia contributes ~1.29 ± 0.82% of PM2.5 through EC emissions, which is lower than its contribution in the Americas (6.12 ± 1.70%) and Europe (5.06 ± 4.30%). This result may be attributed to the higher frequency of wildfire emissions in Europe and the Americas24. Noteworthy, some subdivided sources show regional differences in PM2.5 components and contributions. For instance, industrial oil combustion contributes substantially more sulfate to PM2.5 in Asia than in Europe and the Americas. These differences may be attributed to the industrial structures in different regions. We further analyzed the temporal changes of PM2.5 source composition across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. In Asia, the contribution of coal combustion has gradually decreased since 2013, probably due to interventions targeting OC emissions (Supplementary Figs. Since 2004, the contribution of biomass burning to PM2.5 has remained stable. Yet, vehicle exhaust emissions have improved significantly since 2018, likely due to the rapid development of new energy vehicles25. Notably, contributions from some subdivided sources—such as liquid fossil fuel combustion, industrial fuel oil combustion, and waste incineration—declined significantly after 2013–2015 but have stabilized since 2016. These results might reflect the effective implementation of targeted regional emission reduction measures. In the Americas and Europe, the contribution of most sources, e.g., coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, and livestock waste, to PM2.5 has shown a gradual downward trend (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, contributions from biomass burning and liquid fossil fuel combustion have either remained stable or increased, suggesting these sources necessitate greater attention and further intervention. Notably, current source-tracing analysis mainly relies on the critical components of PM2.5, where isotope fingerprints can be obtained. As more component isotopic fingerprints become available, e.g., NH4+ in the Americas and Europe, the accuracy and precision of source tracing will further improve. In addition to current interventions, global climate actions aimed at controlling warming will lead to systemic change in PM2.5 emissions, e.g., fossil fuels26,27,28. To better plan future PM2.5 interventions, we projected the trends of PM2.5 pollution levels (Fig. This simulation was conducted by integrating the IDGAR database, the global change assessment model (GCAM), and the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry analysis (WRF-Chem). For further details see “Method” section. In both the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1–1.9 (1.5 °C temperature control target) and SSP1–2.6 (2 °C goal temperature control target) scenarios, PM2.5 pollution levels in Asia and the Americas are projected to continuously decline. By 2100, with anthropogenic sources expected to have achieve net zero emissions (Supplementary Fig. These results are close to the WHO guideline limit of 5 μg/m3 but do not quite achieve it. In Asia, the projected PM2.5 concentrations for 2100 are 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m3 and 14.2 ± 1.82 μg/m3 in the SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 scenarios, respectively. These PM2.5 levels are comparable to current levels in the Americas and fall short of the WHO recommended limits. Hence, we propose that, in addition to implementing stricter climate targets, designing targeted interventions remains crucial for controlling PM2.5 pollution, particularly for Asia. Specifically, (a) the Americas, (b) Asia. Simulations were conducted with the global change assessment model (GCAM), IDGAR database, and the stable isotope analysis in R model (SIAR). The scenarios, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, combine Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which correspond to future radiative forcing and their climate impacts. These projected results by 2100 are close to the WHO guideline limit of 5 μg/m3, but have not yet been achieved. Addressing the current limitations of isotope-based PM2.5 driver tracing, which primarily focused on local-scale, short-term pollution events involving single component, we constructed the global atmospheric isotopic database, IDGAR. Through global long-term temporal dynamic analyzes of isotopic big data, we identified the main sources and corresponding interventions for different PM2.5 species over the past two decades. Moreover, we achieved the source constraints on PM and its components based on IDGAR's multi-species isotopic fingerprints. However, projections indicate that WHO's recommended PM2.5 limit of 5 μg/m3 will not be met by 2100 under the current climate targets, need additional effective interventions, particularly in natural emissions. Blockchain technology is critical for the accuracy and sustainability of IDGAR isotopic big data. It ensures each isotopic data point is unique, immutable, and traceable, thereby enhancing the accuracy of PM source tracing and intervention assessments. Given that isotopic analysis requires a high level of analytical capability and considerable time, the amount of isotopic data from a single laboratory is very limited, necessitating global trusted collaboration. Blockchain's tamper-proof and traceability features make IDGAR a trustworthy platform, encouraging researchers to enrich and utilize its isotopic data. Moreover, unlike traditional administrator-based databases, blockchain-based IDGAR implements a decentralized data management model, ensuring equal data management rights for all users. Retrospective analysis of isotopic big data reveals remarkable intervention effects on C4 plants burning, coal combustion, or vehicle exhaust, particularly for EC, OC, NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, Pb-bearing PM. Our study have identified the main sources of most curated element species but not all, e.g., Fe-bearing PM, Zn-bearing PM, which require targeted interventions. In contrast to previous measure-specific intervention assessments based on bottom-up emission inventories29, our study provides a complementary top-down, component-level assessment, mitigating the impact of the nonlinear relationship between emissions and PM concentrations. Notably, hardly any PM species has been effectively intervened continuously in the past 20 years. This probably because the main sources of the target components have changed, but the intervention designs have not yet to respond. The asynchronous changes in the main sources and intervention effectiveness suggest that future intervention designs should be dynamically adjusted for different PM species. An ideal approach would be to develop an isotopic-guided intelligent system for designing interventions for different PM species within the IDGAR framework. Source tracing utilizing isotopic big data reveals the specific emissions of critical PM2.5 components, which is essential for implementing precise source control. While the temporal changes in source composition highlight notable intervention effects on coal combustion, resulting in reductions of OC-bearing PM emissions in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Additionally, we further reveal the increasing impact of biomass burning and liquid fossil fuels combustion on PM2.5 levels in these three regions. This is consistent with prior projections indicating that climate-driven natural emissions, e.g., wildfire smoke, will worsen PM2.5 exposure30,31. In the Americas, satellite observations and global climate model projections show that biomass burning, e.g., wildfire smoke, will increasingly impact PM pollution24, intensifying with ongoing climate warming32,33. Therefore, developing interventions targeting wildfire may be effective for reaching WHO recommended threshold in the Americas. However, managing wildfires requires specialized interventions distinct from those employed for regional anthropogenic emission, which are not adequately covered by current air pollution regulations34. Moreover, soil-related dust is another important driver of PM pollution, especially in Central and East Asia38. Therefore, simultaneous and intensive interventions targeting agricultural biomass burning, wildfires, and dust are necessary in Asia to achieve WHO guidelines. In summary, we have launched the blockchain-based isotopic database for global atmospheric research. This database provides region-specific source-end isotopic values for PM tracing. Our analysis of long-term trends and change rates of isotopic big data reveals varying main sources and asynchronous interventions for different PM species. Predictions under climate mitigation scenarios indicate that controlling natural sources, e.g., biomass burning, is essential to meet WHO guidelines. Isotopic big data are critical for atmospheric research, extending beyond PM and emission tracing. The data can be used to quantify PM transport ranges and estimate deposition fluxes. Moreover, integrating isotopic big data with public health or policy factor datasets could contribute to source-specific health effect assessments and intelligent policy making. The database developed in this study includes 34,815 non-redundant isotopic data points related to PM species and corresponding emissions, as recorded up to March 31, 2024. This database includes isotopic fingerprints for compounds and elements such as OC, EC, nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate, Si, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb, and Hg; different types of PM, e.g., PM2.5, PM10, and total suspended particulate matter (TSP); different PM sources, such as e.g., biomass burning, coal combustion, vehicle exhausts, waste materials, volatilized fertilizer, livestock emissions, microbial processes, industrial oil combustion, natural soil; and additional details such as specific components, sampling methods, locations, time periods, and analytical methods/measurement techniques. For detailed information, please refer to Supplementary Table 3–5. Briefly, the sampling of NH3 from sources is categorized into active and passive sampling. For source apportionment applications, data correction for passive sampling is performed by adding 15.4‰, following commonly used methods in the literature39. Source emissions of NOX are collected through active sampling using the standard solution absorption method40. Similarly, almost source emissions of SO2 are also collected via active sampling with solution absorption. Since only one study used passive sampling for SO2, we excluded its reported values from S source tracing to ensure data standardization and the reliability of the research findings41. Aside from NH3, NOx, and SO2, other PM components (such as OC, EC, Si, and metals) included in the database are not sampled individually but are collected through active sampling of source emissions, followed by the analysis of the specific isotopic fingerprint characteristics of the different components within the particulate matter. Additionally, different components may be analyzed using various methods. For instance, the nitrogen isotope measurement is conducted using both chemical conversion and bacterial conversion methods; for Strontium (Sr) isotopic measurement might be performed using thermal-ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), both of which undergo strict quality control. The isotopic results from different analytical methods are reported with reference to international standard reference materials, ensuring consistency and standardization. Regarding different standard reference materials, such as Zn, the Zn isotopic composition is typically expressed in per mil (‰) relative to the “zero point” of the isotopic standard reference material, IRMM-3702. Notably, some publications report the Zn isotopic composition relative to JMC 3-0749 L Lyon (another reference material). The Zn isotopic composition of JMC 3-0749 L Lyon is +0.32‰ relative to IRMM-3702. For clarity, the Zn isotopic signatures presented here have been converted to be relative to IRMM-3702. Notably, given the importance of data standardization and the emergence of more precise cross-validation methods, the data in this database needs to be standardized and updated. using Web Plot Digitizer (version 4.2, San Francisco, California, USA). The specific keywords, number of samples, type of data, and specific reference are provided in Supplementary Table 3 and “References” in Supplementary Information. These information can also be found in IDGAR database (http://idgar.org/). ArcGIS Pro (ESRI; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) was used to visualize the specific geographic locations of these isotopic data. The base map was downloaded from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/. In addition to radiocarbon (14C) and Pb, the isotopic fingerprints of other elements are reported as delta values (δ) relative to an isotopic standard reference material (SRM) using the following formula: where E represents a selected element and x and y describe the mass numbers of the isotopes of element E. Notably, the isotope analysis methods used for an element may vary among publications. This expression, relative to an SRM with a “zero point”, makes it feasible to perform comprehensive analyzes based on multiple isotopes. The specific SRMs (Supplementary Table 3) and analytical accuracy of these isotopic analyzes are collected in the developed database. Isotopic fingerprints for radiocarbon (14C) are reported as the fraction of modern carbon (fM-14C) as follows: Due to the lack of a unified standard reference material, Pb isotopic signatures are reported as 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb. Additionally, the data of PM concentrations in 2021 were sourced from the public dataset of ground-level PM2.5, measured at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° from 1998 to 2022 (V5.GL.04), calculated by the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group43. A web portal for the IDGAR including PM data and the corresponding emissions was established using blockchain technology. The IDGAR website was developed using the Spring Boot framework with the MVC architecture pattern, and MariaDB was utilized for data storage. The website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is publicly available at http://idgar.org/. Moreover, blockchain technology is used to secure the database against data tampering and to support operations across multiple nodes. The SHA256 hashing function is used to process data: user registration details are hashed, generating a 64-character hexadecimal string. This hash string is then stored across various database nodes for security. Each user's information hash string forms a block, and the blocks are connected in chronological order to create a blockchain. The IDGAR includes a data validation procedure, in which the hash strings are continuously recalculated in real time (every 5 minutes). If any discrepancies in the hash strings are detected, we can precisely identify the affected block and tracing the origins for non-compliance. Newly uploaded data undergo real-time hash string validation and are rigorously compared with existing strings in the database. If a conflict occurs, the system automatically assigns incremental version numbers to subsequent file versions. The irreversible nature of blockchain prohibits direct editing of uploaded data in the IDGAR. If a user makes an honest error and needs to correct the uploaded content, they can submit the corrected data with a clear statement, automatically generating incremented version numbers for the file. Moreover, an early warning system activates promptly if a node is attacked, transferring all the data once the network virus is eradicated. This decentralized management fosters equitable data sharing. Notably, unpublished data are not decentralized but rather controlled by the uploader using password-based key derivation encryption. With the development of the IDGAR, unpublished data can be uploaded with clear statements to foster academic collaboration. One-way analyzes and Pearson correlation analyzes were carried out by using SigmaPlot version 12.5 (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the Origin 2016 statistical package (OriginLab Corporation, USA). The remaining statistical analyzes were conducted in R version 4.1.3 using the “stats” package, unless stated otherwise. Briefly, the temporal trends of the PM isotopic fingerprints were analyzed via bootstrap procedures. The method of formal testing was used to identify the breakpoints from all years. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Moreover, a one-dimensional moving subset window analysis was employed to estimate the temporal trends in the PM isotopic composition from 2001 to 2022, including dependencies on longitude and latitude for source isotopic changes. For each isotope, the data were segmented into several subsets based on sampling times or locations, with each subset encompassing several consecutive years, longitudes, or latitudes. Subsequent subsets were formed by excluding data from the earliest year or site of the previous subset and incorporating an additional step. Briefly, all of the data are uniformly transformed into corresponding 64-dimensional vectors through a shallow neural network based on a given corpus. This process was carried out in Python version 4.1 with the “gensim” package. Then, dimensionality reduction was performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction of multivariate statistical data26, after preprocessing with principal component analysis (PCA), which was carried out in R version 4.1.3 with the “tsne” package. The relative proportions of the selected species (e.g., compounds, metals) in PM from diverse emissions are quantitatively estimated by the Bayesian MixSIAR model. This model was performed in R version 4.1.3 with the “MixSIAR” package. Considering increasing the data volume and the number of simulations can effectively improve the reliability of the analysis, we conducted source tracing analysis of PM components using IDGAR isotopic big data rather than relying on a few scattered data points. Moreover, we set the number of iterations to 1,000,000 with a burn-in of 500,000 in our MixSIAR simulation. Furthermore, the Isospace plots and Markov chain Monte Carlo diagnostic tests (including Gelman-Rubin and Geweke) have been incorporated into the MixSIAR package to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. The MixSIAR method can identify the most reasonable source composition of a mixture based on isotope mass balance5. Moreover, the fractionation effect of some isotopes (e.g., NH4+) and the variabilities in isotopic fingerprints of measurements and sampling can be incorporated into this model (see Supplementary Note 3 for details)6. For OC, we first determined the contributions of fossil and non-fossil fuel combustion using fM14C-OC, followed by a detailed analysis of specific fossil and non-fossil fuel contributions using the isotopic chemical mass balance of δ13C44. The overall calculation principle of source tracing can be expressed as follows: Afterward, using the fi value multiply the mass concentration (%) of the selected compound or element (e.g., EC) in PM, we can estimate the weight of this component emitted from each source to PM2.5. The detailed mass concentrations of the curated species in PM2.5 are provided in Supplementary Fig. The calculation processes can be expressed as follows: where F represents the relative contributions of sources to PM2.5 by emitting the selected component. The detailed calculation process is as follows: where σSsum represents the standard deviation of the total contributions from source ‘S' to PM2.5. XE denotes the mass concentration of component ‘E' in PM2.5, and CES represents the relative contribution of source ‘S' to component ‘E' in PM2.5, as calculated by MixSIAR. To further validate this method, we used fM-14C to evaluate the δ13C-based source tracing results of EC in PM2.5. Specifically, we calculated the fM-14C isotopic compositions of EC in PM2.5 based on the fM-14C of primary sources and δ13C-based relative contributions, and compared them with the observed values. Furthermore, the comparison of model performance among MixSIAR, MixSIR, and FRUITS confirms the robustness of the source apportionment results in this study (see Supplementary Note 4 for details). The framework for PM2.5 pollution simulation in the Americas and Asia comprises two sub-sections, i.e., emission projection and air quality modeling. The future emission changes of diverse sectors under climate mitigation scenarios towards 2100 were performed with the global change assessment model (GCAM). Specifically, we selected two scenarios, SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6, which integrate different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). SSPs show the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation, capturing key socioeconomic factors. RCPs reflect the levels of ambition in climate policies. The scenarios SSP1–1.9 (SSP1 + RCP1.9) and SSP1–2.6 (SSP1 + RCP2.6) align with global climate goals of limiting warming to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively. These scenarios represent the most likely patterns of global development in the future. Using updated emission data, we further estimated the trends in PM2.5 pollution and their isotopic composition through the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry analysis (WRF-Chem) and the SIAR model. It is worth noting that, due to noticeable uncertainty in emission inventories, the predicted PM2.5 pollution levels usually require optimization and correction. Isotopic-based source tracing results can refine the inventory from a top-down perspective, enhancing the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions (Supplementary Fig. The raw data used in this study are available in the IDGAR database [http://idgar.org/]17.
