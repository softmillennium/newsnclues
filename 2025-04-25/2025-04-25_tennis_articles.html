                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Courier has suggested a player who Carlos Alcaraz may not want to face at the French Open. Carlos Alcaraz conquered Roland Garros a year ago by reversing a two sets to one deficit to defeat Alexander Zverev. The World number two will aim to repeat his accomplishment in 2025, but Alcaraz could face some pretty stiff competition from the outset. He will have to be on his game from the outset, especially if he were to face someone like Reilly Opelka. With his monstrous nerve, it could cause players like Alcaraz problems and Jim Courier, a two-time French Open winner in his own right, thinks this is something the Spaniard would want to avoid. While reviewing Alcaraz's chances at the French Open, Courier said: “I wouldn't be concerned about his tennis level because the best of five gives these players more time, they are protected from a seeding standpoint from playing anyone inside the top 32. “Unless you run into someone like Reilly Opelka who can make it not about the tennis and about reactions, that would be worrying if I was on Team Alcaraz. But other than that I think he will have time to work his way into the tournament.” “When you have to do those in the latter stages of a major and up that risk profile, that's when things can get a little skewed.” Alcaraz is experiencing some deja vu as injury has played a role in his clay court season once again. He played just one event on clay prior to the 2024 French Open, and a year later, Alcaraz will watch his home tournament from the sidelines. The World number two did some damage to his hamstring and groin in the second set of Sunday's Barcelona Open final. He was able to finish that match, but now the Spaniard will have to watch his home tournament from the sidelines. “I wanted to take this moment to thank you for the support, for the encouragement—just know that I hear you, I read so many of your messages, and we'll come back stronger.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CARLOS ALCARAZ has revealed how he was almost banned from Wimbledon, because of his UNDERWEAR. On both occasions the 21-year-old managed to topple tennis superstar Novak Djokovic. However, Wimbledon's strict all-white kit policy applies to absolutely everyone without exception. And that fact almost cost Alcaraz his spot at Wimbledon as he revealed how wearing colour briefs landed him in hot water. "I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, ‘Next time, we won't let you play.' "I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!" Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles across his career so far, with only the Australian Open continuing to allude him after winning the 2022 US Open and 2024 French Open on top of his Wimbledon titles. He also lost in the Olympic god medal match at the Paris Olympic Games last year. Earlier this week Alcaraz was forced to pull out of the ATP 1000 Madrid Open due to a right leg injury and struggles with a left hamstring issue. He required treatment on his right groin during his Barcelona Open defeat to Holger Rune last weekend and underwent MRI tests which revealed a problem with his right leg adbuctor. In a statement during a press conference, he said: "I couldn't practice the entire week and found out I had hamstring and groin injuries. "On Monday I'll have more medical tests and after that we will have a better idea on how long I'll be out. The injury blow comes ahead of his title defence at Roland Garros which starts in just over a month's time. He was also scheduled to play at the Rome Masters but could now be forced to sit out. "It's not an easy decision because Madrid is the first tournament I have ever been to as a young kid, it's the most special place for me to play. "But (prioritising Roland Garros) was a big part of my decision to stop and recover properly.” This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As ever, we preview and predict the matches scheduled for you. Jack Draper is having a solid 2025 and currently stands at 6th in the world while Tallon Griekspoor has had a lot of wins under his belt this year. They met each other once, almost two years ago, and a lot has changed since. Draper will like to have a good week here to build up momentum for the French Open and while Griekspoor impressed in the first round, expect the Brit to be at his aggressive best and start strong. He faces Reilly Opelka, who is under protected ranking, and maybe clay is not his favorite surface to play on. That being said, Khachanov is a solid baseliner and on clay he should be able to create more chances on Opelka's serve. Kei Nishikori did struggle in his first round match here but the Japanese is highly experienced and he knows these courts very well. He takes on the flamboyant Denis Shapovalov who would love a good week here. He reached the last eight but was double bageled in that match. Jarry won his first match on clay this week but Dimitrov is a big step up in quality. The first WTA Madrid round of 32 contests will be played on Day 5. Teenage prodigy Mirra Andreeva and US Open semifinalist Emma Navarro are Hamad Medjedvovic, at 21 years old, may just be the next big thing for Serbian tennis. That is a pretty bold statement considering the fact</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first WTA Madrid round of 32 contests will be played on Day 5. Teenage prodigy Mirra Andreeva and US Open semifinalist Emma Navarro are among the top players scheduled to compete. Starodubtseva was helped by not having to play Karolina Muchova in the last round due to the Czech's withdrawal, but she still deserves credit for taking advantage against Elisabetta Cocciaretto. There will not be much variety in this matchup against Samsonova. On a clay court, I trust Samsonova to implement that game more consistently. While Haddad Maia's win was scrappy, Bencic performed excellently against Zeynep Sonmez and the 20th seed, Clara Tauson. Neither player has reached the heights of last season so far in 2025. That is especially true of Vekic, but an exception was her impressive performance to beat Navarro at last month's BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Predicting the winner in their first match on clay is a challenging task. Navarro's level on the dirt is more consistently reliable, but Vekic winning a silver medal at Roland Garros last year proved her capabilities. The American is backed to beat Vekic for the first time by utilizing her more complete game, but it is a 50/50 matchup. Andreeva's best level is simply much better than Frech's. Hamad Medjedvovic, at 21 years old, may just be the next big thing for Serbian tennis. That is a pretty bold statement considering the fact</p>

Last year, Arnaldi reached the fourth round of Miami and made the semis in Canada, a tournament Djokovic skipped after winning his only title of 2024, Olympic gold. On dirt, Arnaldi got into the sweet 16 at Roland Garros, so his clay-court acumen is there.But 2025 has been a comedown for the Italian, who is just 9-9. He's also just 1-2 on clay, but his first-round win in Madrid was notable. First, it was 7-5 in the third, after a pair of three-set losses on clay; second, it was against Borna Coric, who has been winning plenty of late.At this point for the 37-year-old Djokovic—just 12-6 this season—any relatively accomplished opponent should present some caution, and I think Arnaldi will give him a serious test. But Madrid's faster clay should aid the Serbian's game, and the fact that Roland Garros is right around the corner should see Novak more focused than ever this season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We felt that it was time to take a pause and reflect about everything that happened,” said the 18-year-old Fonseca, who has been quickly rising through the ATP rankings and is considered one of the sport's most promising players. I needed time to rest my mind. He went back to Rio de Janeiro to practice and try to recharge after playing several tournaments in a row late last year and early this season. He is playing at the Madrid Open this week, where on Saturday he is scheduled to face Tommy Paul in the second round of the ATP 1000 clay-court tournament. “Now there are a lot of people talking about me...in the media, the Internet,” Fonseca said. Former players Andy Murray and Boris Becker, as well as four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz, were among those praising the Brazilian recently. Fonseca started attracting more attention after winning the Next Gen ATP Finals last December, a tournament that brings together the season's best players who are 20 or younger. “I became more well known around the world.” “I'm getting more used to those kind of tournaments and the stadiums,” he said. “Today I was a little bit more experienced than the other guy. It's difficult to say that because I was younger than him, but I already knew how it was to play on big stadiums, and I think it was his first time and he was a little bit more nervous. I'm feeling a little bit more like of a routine, feeling more adapted on those courts.” Fonseca is already an idol to Brazilians, who haven't had much to cheer in tennis since former world No. 1 Gustavo “Guga” Kuerten, who won the French Open in 1997, 2000 and 2001. Loud Brazilian fans have been following Fonseca closely across the world, with big crowds at his matches both in Madrid and in Miami this year. Fonseca said he doesn't want to be considered the new Guga, though. “Thankfully I have a great foundation, with relatives, friends and coaches who have been helping me keep my feet on the ground and stay humble to keep on working,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juan Martin del Potro has proclaimed that Novak Djokovic will be “the best” for as long as he continues playing and expressed his belief that the Serb can win more majors. Djokovic holds the all-time men's Grand Slam singles title record, having secured his 24th and most recent major at the 2023 US Open. The closest Djokovic has come to claiming a 25th Grand Slam crown was at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships, where he was a runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz. The next stop on Djokovic's major quest is this year's French Open, which will be held from May 25 to June 8. Djokovic, who will turn 38 on May 22, won his 99th and most recent title at the 2024 Paris Olympics in August. “Joao's generation could be a good generation, but it's too early to say if they will be as good [as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz],” said the Argentine. Novak Djokovic's Madrid Open titles, record, and pathway to 100th ATP title in 2025 Novak Djokovic reveals ‘priority' as he gives insight into work with Andy Murray “Winning a Grand Slam is something very personal for him, I believe. It would be a great thing for the world of tennis if he manages to win again after some time, as he did in Paris with the gold medal.” The 2009 US Open winner and former world No 3 also revealed he would coach Djokovic if his friend and former rival offered him the opportunity. “I have my tennis academy in Boynton Beach, Florida. That excites me a lot, coaching kids, all kinds of people,” del Potro added when asked about coaching on the tour. But of course, if Novak asks me to work with him, I'll be happy [laughs].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Serbian legend enjoyed rivalries with some of the ATP Tour's greatest-ever players on his way to a record-24 Grand Slam titles. 20 times, Djokovic has played either Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, or Andy Murray in a Grand Slam final, coming out victorious on 13 occasions. However, during that period, Djokovic came unstuck against another of his biggest rivals in their two Major finals. Speaking ahead of this year's Madrid Open, Djokovic has heaped praise on the three-time Major champion, whom he considers to be ‘very underestimated'. “I think he is very underestimated in the discussions. “He has won a Gold medal at the Olympics, three Grand Slams. “He is 40 years old with God knows how many surgeries on the knees, and he is still pushing and still coming in early in the tournaments, one of the first people who show up in the club and practices early and does everything he needs to do,” said Djokovic. “It says a lot about champion spirit and mentality that these guys have.” The world number 158 has won just one ATP Tour main draw match in 2025, but reached the quarterfinals of a Challenger Tour event in Napoli last month. Wawrinka is scheduled to return to action at the Challenger level for the tournament in Francavilla, Italy, on May 5. Appearing in his second Career Grand Slam final, Wawrinka beat Djokovic to win the French Open title ten years ago. “By that time, I still had not won Roland Garros, and that was I don't know which final for me already [3rd]. “I thought I am not playing Rafa [Nadal] for a change in the final and I liked my chances to win my first French Open title but then Stan [Wawrinka] stole it from me, and he played some incredible tennis.” “We still joke around and I tell him that the reason why he played so well was because of the shorts,” he said. “I don't know how many of you remember those famous shorts he was wearing, and he came up to the post-finals press conference with those shorts, and I really hated him since then.” Always one to step up for the big occasion, it'll certainly be interesting to see what would happen if the pair faced off at any of the three remaining Grand Slams in 2025. The 2025 French Open is set to begin on Sunday, May 25.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic is the first to admit that his level of tennis has been patchy recently, but there is no reason to be overly concerned as his main aim is to peak at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. That was followed by a second-round exit from the Monte Carlo Masters. Djokovic concedes his standard has not been at the desired level, but he is using the ATP Tour events to prepare for the French Open and Wimbledon. “That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Novak Djokovic compares Carlos Alcaraz to ‘Big 3' in lavish comments Three-time Madrid Open champion Djokovic is seeded fourth at this year's ATP 1000 event in Spain and he will kick his campaign off against Matteo Arnaldi in what will be a first career meeting between the two. Djokovic, though, admits that motivation is sometimes lacking during practice, but that is where Murray comes into the picture. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy. “Then it's obviously about specific elements in the game with certain shots that are happening in a certain pattern for days or weeks already. “It's really a combination of things, I would say. To be ready to play points and matches, not just from the game standpoint but also mentally and emotionally. Things are going in the right direction. Obviously, that it's not a guarantee that I'll play very well in the match, but we're generally happy with where we're going.” Juan Martin del Potro believes Novak Djokovic is still "the best." Novak Djokovic's Madrid Open quest begins against Italy's Matteo Arnaldi. Novak Djokovic was asked if Carlos Alcaraz is playing tennis to match the game's all-time great and his response will raise eyebrows. Jannik Sinner is set to become just the 10th man to spend 52+ weeks as the world No 1.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis legend Björn Borg has long been a symbol of stoic brilliance on the court, but in a rare moment of introspection, the Swedish icon recently shared the deeply personal reasons that led to his early departure from professional tennis. Known for his calm demeanor and incredible success—11 Grand Slam titles, including six at Roland Garros and five consecutive Wimbledon crowns—Borg's retirement at the age of just 26 shocked the sporting world. In his own words, Borg revealed that the constant spotlight became overwhelming. “I think if you lose motivation, because in my time, few years ago or many years ago,” said Bjorn Borg with a chuckle. I had the media, the photographers-I could not be myself- to be private, to feel good about life in that way”, said Bjorn Borg to the media at the Madrid Open For Borg, the tennis court remained the only place where he felt a sense of solitude and control. “The only time when I felt really good was when I went to the court, the tennis court,” he said. “I was by myself, no one disturbing me. “And I think I'm Swedish to be private, but for me it's more important to have a life, to feel good,” continued Borg. His career may have been brief, but it was glorious and his legacy remains etched in history as one of the sport's greatest champions, and a master of multiple surfaces.</p>

World number one Aryna Sabalenka was beaten for the fourth time in the Porsche Grand Prix final on Monday when she fell 6-4, 6-1 to former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko and missed out on the sports car from the main sponsor yet again.

"I think you hate me now, you wanted the car so badly. You will get it another time," Ostakenko told Sabalenka in a light-hearted exchange.

Sabalenka said "enjoy your beautiful car" and quipped "I will order one now" after failing like in 2021 against Ash Barty, and 2022 and 2023 against Iga Swiatek, to claim the Porsche by winning the final of the star studded indoor clay court event in Stuttgart.

"Congrats Jelena you were the better player than me," Sabalenka added on a serious note after she found no answer against her 24th-ranked opponent and went down in 1 hour 25 minutes.

Ostapenko broke Sabalenka in the opening game which set the tone, and was undeterred when Sabalenka tied at 4-4.

She went on to win eight of the remaining nine games and allowed Sabalenka a mere five points in the last five of them en route to victory with a return winner on first match point.

Ostapenko finished with 21 winners and just eight unforced errors.

It was Ostapenko's first win over Sabalenka in their fourth meeting, and a first clay court title for her since the surprise Roland Garros success in 2017.

The Latvian beat the two top ranked players in the world to get a ninth career title in what she named "an amazing week," having ousted second ranked triple French Open champion Swiatek in the quarter-finals.</p>

That chapter officially closed last December during his farewell match, where he was joined by tennis legends like Gabriela Sabatini and Novak Djokovic. Interestingly, it's Djokovic who could entice del Potro back to the circuit. That said, if Novak asked me to work with him, it would make me very happy,” del Potro told Olympics. The door isn't 100% closed, but I believe my time as a coach will come later”. Currently, Djokovic's primary coach is Andy Murray, a retired tennis icon. This marks an intriguing difference between the two legends, who are both 37 years old and faced each other on some of the biggest stages in tennis history. Novak Djokovic of Serbia and his coach Andy Murray working on his serve during a practice session at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. With 24 Grand Slam titles, Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most major wins in tennis history, ahead of Rafael Nadal's 22 and Roger Federer's 20. According to del Potro, that tally could still grow. Not Alcaraz nor Sinner: US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro names the best tennis player in the world “I think winning a Grand Slam is something personal for him. “It would be great for tennis if he could win another, like when he claimed Olympic gold in Paris. Djokovic's most recent Grand Slam victory came at the 2023 US Open, a year in which he captured three of the four major titles, falling short only at Wimbledon. Since then, younger stars like Jannik Sinner (23) and Carlos Alcaraz (21) have claimed the subsequent five majors, though Djokovic reached the final of the 2024 Australian Open, a tournament he's won a record 10 times. He began his professional career in 2020 with Mundo Deportivo US, where he made his initial strides as a writer. Gianni has covered major sports events such as the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the NBA Finals, and Grand Slam tournaments like Roland Garros. His ability to report on real-time events and write under pressure has established him as a valuable member of a top-tier team of journalists. In 2024, he joined Bolavip US, where he covers a wide range of sports, including European soccer, MLS, and the NBA. Bolavip, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.</p>

And for me, as long as he's active on the tour, he's the best,” Del Potro said in a recent interview with Olympics.com. “He has so much experience, and if he's physically in good shape, for me, he's going to keep trying—and he just might do it,” said Juan Martin, who also speculated about Djokovic's main motivation to keep competing on the ATP Tour at 37: “I think he can still win more Grand Slams… Achieving that is something very personal for him.” At the same time, the 2009 US Open winner made it clear he hopes to see Novak claim at least one more major title before retiring. During his prime, Juan Martin Del Potro competed against Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray. “It's not just tennis—it's mentality, physicality, character, the way they handle pressure. And for many years they did it better than all of us, especially in key moments or at big tournaments,” added Juan Martin. Now, many young talents are competing to take that mantle, including Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and Del Potro weighed in on what the future may hold. “It could be a good generation, but they're still very young and it's too early to say whether they'll be that good,” explained Juan Martin. “What's important is that they play really well and have the potential, but often potential and talent alone aren't enough. You need hard work, discipline, and good health.” “Before, there were only six spots left in the Top 10 because the Big 4 was impossible to break,” he said. “Now that the Big 4, David Ferrer, Stan Wawrinka and I are no longer there, the Top 10 is changing a lot.
