But Trump, now in office for a second time, allegedly wants to cut the agency's US$9-billion budget by 55% and its workforce by 50%, according to Science. In a farewell letter to staff, Panchanathan wrote, “I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency”, adding, “while NSF has always been an efficient agency, we still took the challenge of identifying other possible efficiencies”. All requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the press. “I respect him more for deciding to resign and not signing the agency's death warrant,” says one NSF staffer. Neal Lane, a former NSF director under Democratic president Bill Clinton, offered praise for Panchanathan, who goes by ‘Panch'. “Panch has done an outstanding job” amid the effort to “diminish NSF's role in science, education and pretty much everything else”, Lane says. Asked for comment, an NSF spokesperson referred Nature to Panchanathan's farewell letter. The latest bout of upheaval began on 17 April, when NSF staff members were given guidance for receiving “VIP visitors” from the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative led by Trump ally Elon Musk to reduce federal spending and shrink the federal workforce. Exclusive: Trump team freezes new NSF awards — and could soon axe hundreds of grants Exclusive: Trump team freezes new NSF awards — and could soon axe hundreds of grants Two members of DOGE, Luke Farritor and Zachary Terrell, were quickly given complete access to NSF grant-management systems despite statements in the guidance to staffers that they should initially receive read-only access. The numbers match crowdsourced data compiled in an online database by Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Noam Ross, a computational ecologist based in Brooklyn, New York, who is executive director of rOpensci, an open-science, global non-profit. About 80% of these terminated awards overlap with a list of around 3,500 grants released in February by Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas who chairs the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The list stems from a Cruz-led report saying that the grants ‘promoted Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)', a concept that it suggests is “extremist”. Last week, an analysis by Democratic staff for the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, found that the Cruz list contained a “slew of embarrassing mistakes” and used flawed methodology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Found in a mudflat off the coast of Oregon, this organism's electricity-conducting abilities could make it ideal for bioelectric devices. You and I are alive today because of the bioelectric field that permeates our cells. Although we've evolved from Volta's first fish-inspired battery, the world of bioelectricty still has a lot to offer us. That couldn't be more apparent than in a new study, published this week in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, which details the discovery of a new cable bacteria—built from rod-shaped cells attached end to end—on the central Oregon coast. Because of their rod-shaped bodies, these cells create filaments that can stretch up to several centimeters in length. Electrothrix yaqonensis's conductivity likely arises from it's optimization of metabolic processes in their environment. “This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,” Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University and co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.” This could make the bacteria particularly effective in a variety of fields, including medicine, industry, and environmental monitoring. “Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics.” Remediation can be one of the most time-consuming and costly aspects of infrastructure projects—particularly if a former brownfield site hopes to be reclaimed as a park or another public space. Having bacteria that can actively clean up the soil thanks to its electric biology could be a huge boon for environmental efforts. Our understanding of electricity has come along way since Ancient Greece, but the biological world still has more than few electrifying tricks to teach us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you want to do something that is physically impossible in the real world, such as flying, you can leap into the air and  take flight. Someone who realizes they are trapped in a nightmare can convince themselves to wake up. The state known as lucid dreaming is an unquestionably surreal one, and it just got even more so. A team of researchers—led by Çağatay Demirel from the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands—has discovered that lucid dreaming has now been found to be a state of consciousness separate from both wakefulness and REM sleep (the state usually associated with dreams), and is in fact associated with its own unique type of brain activity. They published a study on their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience. “This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself,” Demirel said in a press release. To identify what sets lucid dreaming apart from the rest of sleep, he and his team pulled previous studies—in which brain activity was measured with EEG sensors—together into what is now the most extensive dataset in this field of sleep research. The researchers then compared brain activity patterns for wakefulness, REM sleep, and lucid dreaming to find that that the eerie self-awareness experienced in lucid dreams has a connection to the electrical rhythms in neurons known as brain waves. Perception and memory processing in the lucid dreaming state were found to be different from non-lucid REM sleep. The consciousness of existing in a dream was associated with with beta waves in the right central lobe (which controls spatial awareness and nonverbal memory) and parietal lobe (which controls the sense of touch and spatial awareness). Beta waves are a type of high-frequency electromagnetic activity in the brain involved in conscious thought processes like solving problems or making decisions. Our consciousness is dominated by beta waves when we are awake. This might explain why there is so much cognitive control in lucid dreams. Dreamers deep in REM sleep have no sense of control over factors like thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but those in lucid dreaming states do. These are the fastest brain waves, which become visible on an EEG at times when the brain is especially alert and focusing on something. These types of psychedelic experiences are also associated with the precuneus, whose activity is modified when waking imagery is seen despite having closed eyes (something usually only experienced with psychedelics). Interestingly, however, lucid dreams may even go a few experiential steps past psychedelics.

In an unprecedented effort, a coalition of more than 50 research teams has surveyed a swathe of Brazilian biomedical studies to double-check their findings — with dismaying results. The scientists wanted to assess publications “based on methods, rather than research area, perceived importance or citation counts”, de Abreu says. And they wanted to do so on a large scale. And teams disagreed about how closely to follow the tested protocols. “It was like trying to turn dozens of garage bands, each with its own way of playing, into an orchestra,” says project coordinator Olavo Bohrer Amaral, a physician at the UFRJ. Reproducibility trial: 246 biologists get different results from same data sets Reproducibility trial: 246 biologists get different results from same data sets Then the authors randomly selected biomedical papers that relied on those methods and were published from 1998 to 2017 by research teams in which at least half the contributors had a Brazilian affiliation. The collaborators initially chose a subset of 60 papers for replication, guided by factors such as whether a paper included certain statistical information. Three labs tested each experiment, and an independent committee judged which of those tests was a valid replication. ‘Doing good science is hard': retraction of high-profile reproducibility study prompts soul-searching My ‘woke DEI' grant has been flagged for scrutiny.

In the meantime, to ensure continued support, we are displaying the site without styles and JavaScript. Functional specialization of brain areas and subregions, as well as their integration into large-scale networks, are key principles in neuroscience. Consolidating both local and global perspectives on cortical organization, however, remains challenging. Here, we present an approach to integrate inter- and intra-areal similarities of microstructure, structural connectivity, and functional interactions. Using high-field in-vivo 7 tesla (7 T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and a probabilistic post-mortem atlas of cortical cytoarchitecture, we derive multimodal gradients that capture cortex-wide organization. Inter-areal similarities follow a canonical sensory-fugal gradient, linking cortical integration with functional diversity across tasks. However, intra-areal heterogeneity does not follow this pattern, with greater variability in association cortices. Findings are replicated in an independent 7 T dataset and a 100-subject 3 tesla (3 T) cohort. These results highlight a robust coupling between local arealization and global cortical motifs, advancing our understanding of how specialization and integration shape human brain function. Understanding how the spatial organization of the human brain gives rise to cognitive functions is a challenging, yet fundamental goal for human neuroscience1. Complex brain networks at multiple scales arise from overlapping variations in cortical microstructure, function, and connectivity2,3. This network involves both the global integration and local specialization of cortical regions, giving rise to distributed functional communities that enable complex computations4,5,6,7. Global integration prominently manifests within higher-order systems, notably the transmodal association cortex, which engages in increasingly abstract and self-generated cognition8,9,10,11,12,13,14. In contrast, local functional specialization is more frequent in sensory and motor regions that interact more closely with the here and now6,8,15,16. The interplay between contrasting local and global motifs contributes to the hierarchical organization of the brain, underpinning segregated and integrative information processing across different cognitive functions. Mapping structural and functional descriptors to define discrete brain areas is essential for understanding hierarchical brain organization at macroscale. Constructing precise maps of cortical areas has been a long-standing objective in neuroanatomy, as it reduces complexity and bias when studying brain regions and inter-regional relationships3,17,18,19. Cytoarchitecture, encompassing the arrangement, distribution, composition, and layering of cells, has emerged as a gold standard to define areas20. Microstructural insight from this post-mortem approach enhances our understanding of connectivity patterns and can illuminate the role of a region in cortical functioning. However, the microstructural patterns in the human brain and their relation to cortical function remain challenging to address in a systematic manner due to the constraints of invasive techniques. Recently, a 3D probabilistic atlas of human brain cytoarchitecture19 has been made available, offering valuable opportunities for examining both the micro- and macro-organization of the human brain, and for contrasting local specialization with global integration. It can, thus, help to guide investigations of structure-function association across the cortical manifold within defined areal subunits. Gradual changes in cortical organization at macroscale have been described as well, even in early work21. While atlases of cortical areas discretize the brain into non-overlapping constituents, recent advances emphasize a potential complementary utility of using dimensional descriptions of the cortex. Such a perspective can help to account for cytoarchitectonic changes within an area (e.g., ocular dominance columns, border tuft and fringe area in the visual cortex), as well as changes occurring at macroscale between different cortical areas20. Recent work in computational anatomy has confirmed that such complementary descriptions of macroscale cortical organization can be derived from eigenvector decomposition of cortex-wide similarities in neural patterns (commonly known as cortical gradients22,23,24). These gradients differentiate cortical systems in an ordered and continuous manner, and can be applied to different types of neural data, both based on in vivo neuroimaging as well as post-mortem histology. Notably, converging hierarchical trends, spanning from sensory to transmodal regions, were observed across microstructural7,23,25,26,27 and functional gradients22,28. These multiple dimensions can effectively capture nuanced patterns of cortical organization26, and may provide synergy in understanding subregional heterogeneity and functional multiplicity of different cortical areas29. More broadly, gradient mapping techniques have robustly differentiated transmodal association cortices from primary sensory/motor systems, mirroring their hierarchical contributions to cognition. In effect, such gradients have been found to align with functionally relevant properties, including disproportionate expansion during primate evolution30,31,32, reduced heritability and increased experience-dependent plasticity27,33, increased network idiosyncrasy34, and the balance of internal vs. externally oriented processing35,36,37. Moreover, gradients may help to potentially account for recent findings showing that functional activation patterns, as well as functional connectivity, can shift across different contexts and individuals38,39,40. Local vs. global organization can be interrogated at the level of microstructure (e.g., cytoarchitecture), connectivity, and function. In this context, MRI serves as an ideal technique to bridge structure and function across varying spatial scales41,42. T1 relaxometry is sensitive to cortical microstructure and myelination43,44, diffusion MRI tractography approximates structural connectivity45,46, and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has delineated macroscopic functional networks4,47,48. Notably, while conventional MRI acquisitions at field strengths of 3 T and below may have limitations in terms of resolution and signal, recent in vivo studies that have moved to high fields of 7 T and above have benefitted from enhanced resolution, sensitivity, and biological specificity49,50,51. In addition, imaging paradigms that combine multiple MRI datasets acquired across different scanning sessions in a given individual have been shown to further increase precision for the analysis of microstructure52, connectivity53,54, and function53,55. Several of such “precision neuroimaging” datasets have already led to an advanced characterization of functional systems56,57 or fostered enhanced microstructural modeling, but previous precision imaging datasets were either prioritizing functional or structural imaging acquisitions, and rarely both in the same subjects. Moreover, prior precision imaging investigations were mainly carried out at 3 T. In this study, we expand this work by leveraging a recently introduced precision neuroimaging (PNI) dataset58, which combines repeated high-resolution structural and functional acquisitions at 7 T, offering an opportunity to interrogate cortical organization in the living human brain with high sensitivity and specificity. The current work examined the interplay of local cortical arealization and global integration. Leveraging probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the recently disseminated Julich-Brain atlas19, we subdivided the cortex into 228 areas. In those, we profiled microstructural, structural, and functional gradients derived from repeated 7 T MRI scans. We then examined how multimodal gradient profiles differed across areas. As local-global cortical organization is presumably tied to cognitive functional architecture, we cross-referenced our maps to multiple fMRI tasks conducted in the same participants, and in particular studied the relation between inter-areal gradient profiles and functional diversity across different tasks acquired in the same subjects. The main analyzes were replicated using different parcellation atlases and datasets to validate the robustness and reliability of our findings. By integrating measures of cortical cytoarchitecture with multimodal high-definition MRI, our work sheds light on local-global cortical organization and advances our understanding of cortical structure-function relationships. We constructed high-resolution cortex-wide connectomes, encompassing microstructural profile covariance (MPC)23, structural connectivity (SC)59, and functional connectivity (FC)22,60, in 10 healthy adults who underwent three repeated multimodal MRI scans at 7 T (Fig. We estimated connectome eigenvectors that characterized spatial gradients of MPC, SC, and FC, focusing on the first five gradients in each modality, which explained most of the variance (MPC: 31%; SC: 18%; FC: 25%). In line with prior work23, the principal MPC gradient was anchored on one end by primary sensory areas and on the other end by paralimbic regions. The principal SC gradient exhibited anterior-posterior axis, clearly dividing the cortex into two parts bounded by sensorimotor areas, as reported previously61. The first FC gradient differentiated sensory and motor cortices from the default mode network, recapitulating earlier work22,60. Other gradients were also in keeping with prior reports (Fig. To ensure equal contribution from each modality, we normalized the gradients within each modality and then averaged them in areas derived from the Julich-Brain atlas (Fig. The Julich-Brain atlas enables the investigation of structure-function association within cytoarchitectonically defined cortical subunits, though it does not cover the full cortex (please see the replication analyzes, where a cortex-wise parcellation was used). This process generated an area-wise gradient profile matrix. This matrix captures most of the information in multimodal connectomes, making it an ideal measure for investigating inter-areal differences and similarities. A Cortex-wide connectomes were constructed from microstructural profile covariance (MPC)23, structural connectivity (SC)59,61, and functional connectivity (FC)22,60 at a vertex-level based on repeated 7 T MRI. We applied non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques129 to each connectome and aggregated the first five eigenvectors/gradients. B Probabilistic area definitions were derived from the Julich-Brain atlas19, a post-mortem cytoarchitectonic atlas based on the mapping of areas of ten postmortem brains, and their superimposition in MNI space. Please note that this probabilistic atlas does not cover the entire cortex. C We averaged vertex-wise gradients in each of the 228 areas, producing area-specific multimodal gradient profiles. These gradient profiles were reordered according to their principal component to assess inter-areal similarity. Middle panel: the reordered multimodal gradient profiles. Right panel: the first principal component from the original multimodal gradient profiles. Abbreviation: PCA principal component analysis, WM white matter. We examined the similarity and differences of gradient profiles between different areas. To this end, we first conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) on the multimodal gradient profiles. These gradient profiles were reordered based on their principal component (which explained 29.6% of the variation), following a sensory-fugal axis anchored on prefrontal/cingulate regions on the one end and central/occipital regions on the other (Fig. This approach integrates salient features of its constituents (i.e., the individual MPC, SC, and FC gradients) in a synoptic manner, suggesting an overarching principle of cortical organization across multiple modalities. Specifically, we observed that the bottom region of the PCA axis, corresponding to sensorimotor areas, exhibited lower gradient z-scores for MPCG1 and FCG1 and higher scores for SCG1 and SCG2. This pattern suggests that the sensorimotor network represents one end of the hierarchy across all modalities. In contrast, the middle region displayed a relatively uniform z-score distribution, suggesting its role in linking higher-order and lower-order regions for multimodal information processing. To further quantify area-to-area differences, we computed an inter-areal cosine distance matrix based on the original multimodal gradient profiles (Fig. The mean value of each row in this matrix indicates the overall dissimilarity of a given area from all other areas in terms of the multimodal gradient profiles. To identify cortical areas with significantly higher/lower dissimilarity compared to all other areas, we conducted spatial permutation tests (1000 permutations) that randomly rotated the Julich-Brain atlas on a sphere62. We found significant and highest inter-areal dissimilarity in sensorimotor regions (pspin < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) correction; Fig. 2A), indicating that these areas are the most unique across the cortex in terms of their multidimensional gradient profiles. Conversely, we observed the lowest dissimilarity in insular and fronto-temporal regions after spatial permutation tests (pspin < 0.05, FDR correction). This suggests that sensorimotor areas are most segregated within the overall cortical hierarchy, supporting functional specialization. Although inter-areal dissimilarity was found to correlate with temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) map (r = 0.66, pspin < 0.001; Supplementary Table 1), no significant correlations were observed with other technical imaging metrics, including the B1+ field map (r = −0.05, pspin = 0.22), the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) map from T1 scans (r = 0.12, pspin = 0.28), or the SNR map from diffusion scans (r = −0.11, pspin = 0.34). To investigate functional integration patterns, we estimated the participation coefficient (PC)63 and global FC strength. Positive, but non-significant, correlations were observed between these metrics and inter-areal dissimilarity (PC: rho = 0.13, pspin > 0.05; global FC strength: rho = 0.32, pspin > 0.05). Similar findings were observed when calculating these metrics based on group-level resting-state FC (PC: rho = 0.13, pspin > 0.05; global FC strength: rho = 0.36, pspin > 0.05). A We calculated the cosine distance between each pair of cortical areas and computed the mean value for each area. To identify cortical areas with the highest and lowest inter-areal dissimilarity, we conducted 1000 permutation tests62. Regions with significantly higher inter-areal dissimilarity compared to other areas after applying FDR correction were highlighted using black boundaries (p < 0.05). B The left panel illustrates the distribution of inter-areal dissimilarity across four cortical hierarchies. To examine differences between each cortical hierarchical level, two-sided two-sample t-tests were conducted with FDR correction (correlations with *: pFDR < 0.05; correlations with **: pFDR < 0.001). Sample sizes: Paralim (45), Hetero (75), Uni (79), and Idio (29); all are technical replicates. Box plots display the median (center line), interquartile range (box bounds =  25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). To explore associations with the histological gradient, two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficients were computed (p = 0.001), and p values corrected using spin permutation tests62. C The gradient profile of parcel i was calculated by averaging the gradients across all vertices belonging to parcel i. The intra-areal dissimilarity of parcel i was then determined by calculating cosine distance between vertex-wise gradients and gradient profile of parcel i. By repeating this procedure for all parcels, we generated a map illustrating the distribution of intra-areal dissimilarity across the cortex. Regions with significantly higher intra-areal dissimilarity compared to other areas after applying FDR correction were highlighted using black boundaries (p < 0.05). D The distribution of vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity in four cortical hierarchies is shown in the left panel. To assess differences between each cortical hierarchy, two-sided two-sample t-tests were performed with FDR correction (correlations with *: pFDR < 0.05). Sample sizes: Paralim (789), Hetero (2,342), Uni (2,403), and Idio (1779); all are technical replicates. Box plots display the median (center line), interquartile range (box bounds  = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the IQR. To explore associations with the histological gradient, two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed with FDR correction. Abbreviation: Paralim Paralimbic, Hetero Heteromodal, Uni Unimodal, Idio Idiotypic. To gain a deeper understanding of these patterns, we investigated the distribution of inter-areal dissimilarity across four cortical hierarchical levels derived from a prior taxonomy of the primate brain proposed by Mesulam64. Using a two-sample t-test, we compared overall inter-areal dissimilarity between each pair of cortical hierarchical levels (i.e., paralimbic, heteromodal, unimodal, and idiotypic). The results revealed that the idiotypic system had the highest inter-areal dissimilarity compared to other systems (e.g., Unimodal vs Idiotypic: t = −4.73, pspin = 0.001, Cohen's d = −0.99, 95% CI = [−0.068, −0.028], FDR correction, Fig. In contrast, paralimbic systems showed lowest inter-areal dissimilarity (e.g., Paralimbic-vs-Heteromodal: t = −9.16, pspin = 0.001, Cohen's d = −1.46, 95% CI = [−0.089, −0.058], FDR correction), aligning with prior findings. To further explore associations between inter-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructure, we generated a MPC matrix of histological data obtained from the BigBrain dataset65, a 3D reconstruction of post-mortem human brain histology, and estimated its principal gradient. This gradient has previously been shown to closely recapitulate Mesulam's taxonomy of cortical hierarchical organization. In effect, we also observed a significant correlation between the histological gradient and inter-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.61, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.706, −0.552]), supporting a close association between regional cytoarchitecture and macroscale organization. To examine inter-areal similarities using an alternative approach, we performed hierarchical clustering on cortical similarity matrices and found equivalent results, providing four robust clusters recapitulating sensory-fugal hierarchies (Supplementary Fig. We furthermore explored the layout within each parcel to better understand local organization. Here, we calculated the cosine distance between the gradient profile of each cortical vertex and the mean gradient profile of the area to which it belongs, as a measure of intra-areal dissimilarity (Fig. We found that intra-areal dissimilarity was considerably lower compared to inter-areal dissimilarity (which also confirms the utility of the used parcellation). The medial supplementary motor areas exhibited highest intra-areal dissimilarity (pspin < 0.05, spatial permutation tests, FDR correction), while the medial orbitofrontal cortex showed the lowest values under the same statistical threshold. Additionally, we found that intra-areal dissimilarity was positively correlated with parcel size (rho = 0.44, pspin = 0.001). Comparing vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity across hierarchical levels, we did not observe the same relationship between different levels as for inter-areal dissimilarity. In fact, there was a trend indicating that intra-areal dissimilarity was higher in heteromodal and unimodal association systems compared to idiotypic and paralimbic regions, though this difference was only marginally significant (Paralimbic vs Heteromodal: t = −6.03, pspin = 0.042, Cohen's d = −0.25, 95% CI = [−0.019, −0.010]; Paralimbic vs Unimodal: t = −6.54, pspin = 0.045, Cohen's d = −0.26, 95% CI = [−0.021, −0.011], FDR correction; Fig. Moreover, there was no significant association to the histological gradient derived from BigBrain (rho = −0.17, pspin = 0.12, 95% CI = [−0.280, −0.035]). The cortical layout is intricately linked to cognition23,66. To investigate how functional connectivity patterns change across diverse cognitive states, we administered nine different fMRI tasks, including episodic memory encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, mnemonic similarity task (MST), and four passive movie watching paradigms in the same participants at 7 T. Functional connectivity for all cognitive states was constructed by cross-correlating the vertex-wise timeseries. We then calculated the cosine distance between the corresponding whole brain functional connectivity matrices to estimate cross-task diversity for each area (Supplementary Fig. Focusing on overall diversity, we calculated the average of values across all tasks to generate the cross-task diversity map (Fig. We observed highest functional diversity in the medial temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex, while lower diversity in the medial frontal lobe and primary sensory cortex (Fig. To further explore how this functional diversity relates to cortical organization, we assessed associations between the cross-task diversity map and inter-areal dissimilarity. This was done by computing Spearman's correlation coefficient and correcting p values using 1000 spin permutation tests. Notably, we identified a marked correlation between cross-task diversity and inter-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.738, −0.583]; Fig. To control for potential influences from image quality, we performed partial correlation analyzes. The results remained consistent when controlling for tSNR (rho = −0.46, pspin = 0.001), B1+ field map (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001), CNR from the T1 data (rho = −0.70, pspin = 0.001), and SNR from the diffusion data (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001). The results were consistent when we excluded regions with lowest tSNR (rho = −0.70, pspin = 0.001). As expected, paralimbic areas exhibited more variable connectivity across different tasks, suggesting a more flexible functional integration into large-scale networks. In contrast, primary cortices showed less variable patterns, potentially supporting their more fixed functional specialization. Again, we only found a weak association with intra-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.19, pspin = 0.065, 95% CI = [−0.254, −0.056]). A The FC matrices were generated using time series data obtained from for nine tasks fMRI sessions in the same subjects. This was followed by the estimation of cosine distances across different tasks. This process resulted in a cross-task diversity matrix of dimensions. To quantify the cross-task diversity for the first vertex of all tasks, the average of each column in this matrix was computed. B By repeating the procedures outlined in (A) for each vertex and subsequently mapping the results to areas, we created an area-wise cross-task diversity map. Two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed, and p values were corrected using spin permutation tests. C By taking the average of each row of the vertex-wise FC within area and calculating the standard deviation (SD) across tasks, we generated the vertex-wise cross-task SD. Taking the average of all SDs within an area and repeating this procedure for all areas, we generated the intra-areal cross-task diversity map. Two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed, and p values were corrected using spin permutation tests. We also investigated how intra-areal functional connectivity patterns changed across different task contexts (Fig. Here, we defined intra-areal cross-task diversity as the standard deviation between vertex-wise FC across different tasks, with the effect of parcel size controlled. We observed highest intra-areal diversity in the superior temporal lobe, while lower diversity was observed in paralimbic cortex. By computing Spearman's correlation coefficient, we identified a significant correlation between intra-areal diversity and inter-areal diversity (rho = −0.49, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.603, −0.407]). This correlation remained significant when controlling for tSNR as a covariate (rho = −0.48, pspin = 0.001; Fig. No significant correlation was observed between intra-areal diversity across tasks and intra-areal dissimilarity in gradient profiles, however. To assess robustness of our findings with respect to analysis parameters, we recalculated gradients, gradient profiles, as well as inter- and intra-areal gradient profile dissimilarity for each modality using different thresholds of the connectivity matrix (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%). Correlations between inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity derived from gradient profiles with different thresholds were assessed, revealing consistent results (Supplementary Fig. Moreover, we investigated the impact of varying the number of gradients within each modality, ranging from three to seven. Inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity was estimated, and consistent results were observed across different numbers (Supplementary Fig. This atlas is purely MRI-based, but aggregates information from different modalities and offers whole-cortex coverage. Again, consistent results were observed when using this atlas (Supplementary Fig. We assessed our findings at each of the ten individual participants who were scanned at 7 T. Similar results were found across all participants, including gradient profile matrices (Fig. Moreover, we observed marked negative correlations between inter-areal dissimilarity and the histological gradient (rho = −0.58 ± 0.047, ranged from −0.63 to −0.49, all pspin < 0.001), and between inter-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.53 ± 0.067, ranged from −0.64 to −0.45, all pspin < 0.001). Inter-areal dissimilarity across participants was highly correlated (r = 0.90 ± 0.008; Fig. Also, intra-areal dissimilarity across participants was highly correlated (r = 0.76 ± 0.007; Fig. Individual-level intra-areal dissimilarity was considerably lower compared to inter-areal dissimilarity, and no significant associations to the histological gradient or cross-task diversity were observed. To examine the effect of sex, we conducted sex-disaggregated analyzes on the main results and observed consistent findings across both male and female subgroups. A For each of the 10 subjects, we generated gradient profiles and inter-/intra-areal dissimilarity. Associations between individual inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient, as well as cross-task diversity were examined using Spearman's correlation coefficients. B Associations between individual inter-areal dissimilarity were estimated using two-sided Pearson's correlation. Distributions of rho values between inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.58 ± 0.047; sample sizes n = 10, with 10 biological replicates), and with cross-task diversity were examined (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.53 ± 0.067; sample sizes n = 10, with 10 biological replicates). Box plots display the mean (center line = 50% of the group), interquartile range (box bounds = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). C Associations between individual intra-areal dissimilarity were estimated using two-sided Pearson's correlation. Distributions of rho values between inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.19 ± 0.051; n = 10, with 10 biological replicates), and with cross-task diversity were examined (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.21 ± 0.069; n = 10, with 10 biological replicates). Box plots display the mean (center line = 50% of the group), interquartile range (box bounds = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the IQR. Abbreviation: MP2RAGE magnetization-prepared 2 rapid gradient echo. We conducted replication analysis based on 12 healthy young adults (age: 29.75 ± 4.75 years, 7 females) with one session scanned at 7 T. We observed consistent results as for the main findings (Supplementary Fig. We conducted a second replication analysis in an independent sample of 100 healthy adults (age: 34.33 ± 4.07 years, 47 females) scanned at 3 T61. Results were consistent, with similar multimodal gradients, gradient profiles, and inter-areal dissimilarity (Supplementary Fig. Notably, associations with histological gradients (rho = −0.40, pspin < 0.001) and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.59, pspin < 0.001) remained consistent, albeit with slightly smaller effects as for the 7 T dataset. Again, we observed only a marginal association between intra-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.09, pspin > 0.1; Supplementary Fig. 7C), with no significant correlation found for histological gradients. Functional specialization and integration are two cornerstones of neural organization67,68. While specialization relates to distinctive neural behavior across different contexts69, functional integration emphasizes the shared influence among regions, ultimately contributing to coherent experiences and behavior69,70. The present study combined multimodal MRI acquisitions with robust areal descriptions of cortical cytoarchitecture19, in order to identify the similarity and divergence of inter-areal gradient fingerprints. Vertex-wise multimodal connectomes were constructed from high-field 7 T MRI data, and cortical gradients were estimated, aligning with those described in prior studies22,23,59. We noted higher inter-areal dissimilarity in sensorimotor cortices and lower inter-areal dissimilarity in the transmodal system, indicating the distinctiveness of the primary sensory cortex as a functionally specialized system. Additionally, functional connectivity in the primary cortex exhibited less variability across tasks, suggesting that information processing from different tasks may converge at early stages. Significant associations were identified between cross-task functional diversity and inter-areal gradient profile dissimilarity, indicating a link between global cortical motifs and functional flexibility across different task contexts. These findings suggest a sensory-paralimbic differentiation in cortical gradient profiles, providing insights into neural motifs contributing to specialized and integrative brain function. The availability of multimodal neuroimaging data offers opportunities for examining brain organization across different spatial scales12,41,42. In this work, we leveraged repeated MRI scanning at ultra-high fields of 7 T, which we hypothesized would result in high signal71, reliability, and precision53,54,55,56,57. The first principal component of our estimated multimodal gradient profiles demonstrated that sensory-functional axes jointly guide hierarchical patterns of cortical microstructure, structure, and function. Our work presents a converging overarching principle, extending prior work that has focused on specific modalities in isolation22,23,72. These findings suggested a convergence of organizational principles across different scales and at the level of structure and function. Notably, and in addition to harnessing a multimodal imaging approach, we leveraged a recently disseminated atlas derived from post-mortem histological data to finely partition the brain into distinct areas based on cytoarchitecture, a presumed gold standard for cortical mapping19. Our work, thereby, integrated dimensional gradient and area-based descriptions of macroscale cortical spatial patterns, providing a unified framework for understanding the cortical layout. This framework could identify key principles of between- and within-parcel heterogeneity, distinguish different zones across the cortical hierarchy, and reveal associations between these heterogeneity patterns and cross-task diversity. Given that the gradient profiles in our study represent vectors in a multidimensional space, we then measured the distance between all cortical areas using a cosine distance metric. As expected, we observed an overarching pattern of inter-areal dissimilarity, with one end featuring sensory and motor cortices that had the highest dissimilarity and the other end encompassing heteromodal and paralimbic areas in the transmodal apex. This suggests that functional specialization in primary sensorimotor areas is accompanied by a more distinctive organization pattern. Reliability analyzes indicated that this inter-areal pattern was not influenced by potential methodological biases, including the B1+ field map, SNR of diffusion data, or CNR of T1 data. While tSNR was correlated with inter-areal dissimilarity, the correlation between inter-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity remained significant even after controlling for tSNR. Overall, the axis of inter-areal dissimilarity is consistent with the gradients previously reported for single modalities that are, especially at the level of function and microstructure, also anchored in primary systems on the one end, and heteromodal and paralimbic regions on the other end22,23. Such findings are potentially in support of their more specialized functional profiles60,73. Notably, the pattern of cortical organization within the limbic system closely aligns with that of other cortical areas, extending previous findings derived from single modalities22,23,72,73. For instance, the paralimbic system with more long-distance connections was reported to have higher microstructural similarity60. Similarly, another study combining structural and functional connections revealed that less diverse unimodal regions show a preference for local communication, while more diverse multimodal regions engage in more global communication patterns74. It is highest in primary areas, such as the visual and somatosensory cortices, and then decreases in unimodal and heteromodal regions, to reach its lowest level in agranular areas7,77. Projection patterns similarly follow this gradient78,79,80. Together, these organizational patterns, spanning from the microscale to the macroscale, may support the integrative role of the limbic system, enabling it to participate in various cognitive processes81. However, it is important to note that no significant associations were observed between PC63 and either inter-areal dissimilarity or cross-task functional diversity, suggesting a more complex relationship between cortical heterogeneity, functional diversity, and different indices of macroscale functional integration. Distance-dependence theory suggests that proximal regions are more likely to be inter-connected82,83. In addition, those areas sharing similar microstructural and neurobiological characteristics are also more likely to be interconnected than regions with distinct features78,84,85. These findings support the overarching idea that adjacent regions with short-range connections often share gene expression and microstructural similarities, contributing to their specialized functional roles. Conversely, while nearby neurons are expected to share similar microstructural properties when extending smooth macroscale topography to the microscale86, prior electrophysiological experiments in various mammalian brain regions have shown that nearby neurons can exhibit disparate response properties87,88,89,90. By examining intra-areal dissimilarity in gradient motifs in the current study, we furthermore probed intra-regional consistency vs heterogeneity in neural organization. Overall, intra-areal gradient profile divergence was relatively low compared to inter-areal divergences, confirming the utility of areal parcellations to meaningfully subdivide the cortex more generally56,91. Notably, although there was no clear difference in intra-areal dissimilarity between networks, we observed a trend towards increased dissimilarity within the unimodal and heteromodal cortices. We speculate that this may be related to their more integrative functional role and increased functional flexibility compared to primary sensory and motor areas, which deserves further verification in future work. Meanwhile, the potential effects of region size should also be considered, as larger regions are more likely to exhibit higher intra-region dissimilarity. Moreover, and in contrast to the inter-areal findings, we did not observe noteworthy associations between intra-areal variations and functional and microstructural indices of the cortical hierarchy. We speculate that intra-regional heterogeneity can support the processing and integration of inputs across a given cortical territory76. That is, for disparate types of information to be integrated, they must at minimum be present in the same brain regions. Moreover, these findings are aligned with the tethering hypothesis of cortical patterning, where a disproportionate enlargement of uni- and heteromodal systems during human evolution and the progressive decrease of genetically mediated signaling gradients may have contributed to their higher intra-areal dissimilarity and relative structure-function decoupling30,92. There is growing evidence for flexibility in the functional organization of the cortex, even within a relatively fixed structural and cytoarchitectural layout38,39,40,93. For instance, recent studies found that functional activation and connectivity change in certain areas in the same individual across different tasks38,39,93. Another study found that graph theory measures such as clustering coefficient and nodal degree can change significantly when comparing the same subjects across different task conditions40. To explore this further, we investigated the inter and intra-areal functional diversity across different fMRI tasks in the same participants. Multiple patterns of inter-areal functional diversity were found in association cortices, consistent with prior studies39, where cortical regions specialized for the same functions were strongly coupled. However, high diversity was found in functionally flexible regions that participated in multiple functions, supporting their role in integrating specialized brain networks39. We also found a negative correlation between cross-task functional diversity and inter-areal dissimilarity, suggesting that globally more specialized regions, such as sensorimotor and visual cortices, exhibit more stable functional connectivity patterns across tasks. A recent study reported that functional connectivity in somatomotor cortex increased with age during childhood through adolescence, whereas it declined in association cortices, reinforcing the differentiation of sensorimotor and association systems in typical development94. These findings support the existence of a sensorimotor-association axis of cortical organization8,22, and may explain higher stability of functional connectivity in sensorimotor cortex across tasks. For intra-areal cross-task diversity, we identified a specific axis, indicating relatively stable patterns in primary sensory and paralimbic cortices. Interestingly, paralimbic areas exhibited the least intra-areal dissimilarity compared to other cortical regions, showing higher inter-areal diversity but lower intra-areal diversity in functional connectivity across tasks. This may be due to the involvement of these regions in a wide range of cognitive and affective processes81,95. Prior findings suggest that paralimbic cortices with a simple laminar structure are well suited to integrate a neural “workspace” for a unified conscious experience due to their position in cortical hierarchies and their connectivity96. We inferred that the low intra-areal diversity in paralimbic cortices across tasks is due to their relatively simple local connectivity structure. However, the interaction patterns between the paralimbic cortices and other brain regions are dynamic, adapting to integrate different sensory inputs and meet various cognitive demands when performing different tasks96,97. Collectively, these findings suggest that the heterogeneity in global and local cortical motifs across different regions is reflected in their diverse participation across different functional contexts. A series of robustness analyzes, exploring the influence of thresholds for gradient estimation and the number of gradients, yielded similar results, suggesting that our analyzes was not affected by variations in specific analysis parameters. Moreover, we observed consistent findings at the level of individual participants and could replicate our findings using an independent dataset of healthy participants scanned at 3 T. Nevertheless, future studies could explore additional sources of variability, both between participants and within the same participant over time, which may arise from individual differences and temporal factors98. In this study, we focus on structure-function relationships within areas with similar cytoarchitecture and how these relationships differ between areas. Using the Julich-Brain atlas offers significant benefits because it is based on ground-truth cytoarchitecture. However, a potential limitation is its lack of coverage of the entire cortex. This limitation is anticipated to be addressed with the future publication of the whole-brain probabilistic map, currently under development19. To mitigate this issue in the current work, we replicated our main analyzes using the Glasser atlas and found consistent results. As our work shows, cortical parcellation and gradient descriptions provide synergistic information to understand human brain organization. By thus reconciling local and global cortical patterns, our work provides insights into the neuroanatomical basis of specialized and integrative cortical functions. Our study was based on three independent human neuroimaging datasets. A 7 T dataset (MICA-PNI, 10 subjects, multiple time points) was for the main analysis and cross-subject reliability assessment. A 7 T dataset (MICA-7T, 12 subjects, one time point) was used for replication analysis. A 3 T dataset (MICA-MICs, 100 subjects, one time point) was used for replication. Sex was determined through self-reporting by participants and was considered in the study design. To minimize potential biases, we aimed to collect an equal amount of data from both male and female participants. For our main analysis, we investigated the imaging and phenotypic data of 10 unrelated healthy adults (age: 29.20 ± 5.20 years, 5 females). Each participant underwent three sessions on separate days. Data were collected between March 2022 and June 2023. This dataset is openly available at the OSF platform (https://osf.io/mhq3f/). This dataset consisted of 12 unrelated healthy young adults (age: 29.75 ± 4.75 years, 7 females). This dataset consisted of 100 unrelated healthy young adults (age: 34.33 ± 4.07 years, 47 females). Data were collected between April 2018 and February 2021. A subset of 50 participants is openly available (https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/mica-mics)61. The studies were approved by the Ethics Committees of McGill University and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, respectively, and written and informed consent were obtained from all participants. In addition, participants were compensated financially for each MRI scanning session attended as reimbursement for their time and participation. MP2RAGE is acquires two 3D images with different inversion times (TI) to generate a myelin-sensitive map of the T1 relaxation times and a synthetic T1-weighted (T1w) image. Scans were visually inspected to ensure minimal head motion, and repeated if necessary. Both inversion images were combined for T1 mapping and to minimize sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities99,100. DWI data was acquired using a multiband accelerated 2D spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. The parameters used were: 1.1 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 7383 ms, TE = 70.60 ms, flip angle = 90°, refocusing flip angle = 180°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.1 mm, multi-band factor = 2. Reverse phase encoding b0 images were obtained for distortion correction of the DWI scans. All multi-echo fMRI were acquired with a 2D blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging sequence. The parameters were as follows: 1.9 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 1690 ms, TE1 = 10.8 ms, TE2 = 27.3 ms, TE3 = 43.8 ms, flip angle = 67°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.9 mm, multiband factor = 3, and echo spacing = 0.53 ms. During the 6-min rs-fMRI scan, participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, fixate on a cross presented on the screen, and not think of anything. Two spin-echo images with opposite phase encoding directions were also acquired for distortion correction of the rs-fMRI scans, with the following parameters: phase encoding = AP/PA, 1.9 mm isovoxels, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.9 mm, TR = 3000 ms, TE = 18.4 ms, flip angle = 90°. Based on a validated open-source protocol101, we collected multiple task fMRI scans, including episodic encoding/retrieval and semantic tasks, as well as the MST, which both lasted ~6 min. During the episodic memory encoding, participants memorized paired images of objects. In the retrieval phase, participants were shown an image and asked to identify the paired object from three options. Semantic memory retrieval involved identifying the object that is most conceptually related to a target image from three options. In all memory tasks, there were 56 trials, and the difficulty was modulated based on semantic relatedness scores102. During the MST, participants determined whether the object in images was indoor or outdoor, and then identified whether the object shown in images was old, similar, or new. We also collected fMRI data while participants watched movies, tracking hemodynamic activity during naturalistic viewing conditions103. A detailed imaging protocol is provided in the data release (https://osf.io/mhq3f/), including the complete list of acquisition parameters. Two T1w scans with identical parameters were acquired with a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (0.8 mm isovoxels, matrix = 320 × 320, 224 sagittal slices, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3.14 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, iPAT = 2). Scans were visually examined to ensure minimal head motion, and repeated if necessary. Both inversion images were combined for qT1 mapping to minimize sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities and optimize intra- and inter-subject reliability99,100. DWI data was acquired using a 2D spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence, consisting of three shells with b-values = 300, 700, and 2000 s/mm2, and with 10, 40, and 90 diffusion weighting directions per shell, respectively (1.6 mm isovoxels, TR = 3500 ms, TE = 64.40 ms, flip angle = 90°, refocusing flip angle = 180°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.6 mm, multi-band factor = 3, echo spacing = 0.76 ms). b0 images acquired in reverse phase encoding direction were used for distortion correction of DWI scans. A 7-min rs-fMRI scan was acquired using multiband accelerated 2D-BOLD echo-planar imaging (3 mm isovoxels, TR = 600 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 52°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, mb factor = 6, echo spacing = 0.54 ms). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, not fall asleep, and look at a fixation cross. Two spin-echo images with reverse phase encoding were also included for distortion correction of the rs-fMRI scans (phase encoding = AP/PA, 3 mm isovoxels, TR = 4029 ms, TE = 48 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, echo spacing = 0.54 ms, bandwidth = 2084 Hz/Px). The MP2RAGE scans of each subject were reoriented using FSL104, linearly co-registered, averaged, with background noise removed, corrected for intensity nonuniformity using N4 bias field correction from ANTS105, and segmented into white and gray matter using FSL FAST104. Resulting volumes were skull stripped using FSL104,106. Cortical surface models were generated from native T1w scans using FastSurfer107. Surface reconstructions for each subject underwent manual correction for segmentation errors, by placing control points and applying manual edits. Regarding the DWI data, pre-processing was carried out using MRtrix108 in the native DWI space. The DWI data underwent denoising109,110, b0 intensity normalization, and correction for susceptibility distortion, head motion, and eddy currents. These corrections were performed using FSL111 and involved utilizing two b = 0 s/mm2 volumes with reverse phase encoding. Anatomical masks for tractography were non-linearly co-registered to native DWI space using the deformable SyN approach implemented in ANTs112. For each participant, voxel-wise SNR maps were generated by dividing the mean map by the standard deviation map. These SNR maps were subsequently projected onto the fsLR-5k surface. For the rs-fMRI scans, pre-processing steps were conducted using AFNI113 and FSL104 tools. The first five volumes were discarded to ensure magnetic field saturation. We applied Multi-Echo Independent Components Analysis114,115 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and effect of motion correction. Spike regression was applied to remove timepoints with large motion spikes, effectively removing nuisance signals116,117. The volume time series were registered to FastSurfer107 space using boundary-based registration implemented in ANTs using linear and non-linear methods118. The tSNR maps were estimated for each participant.

The volume time series were registered to FastSurfer107 space using boundary-based registration implemented in ANTs using linear and non-linear methods118. To investigate the vertex-wise multimodal connectomes, we first constructed a downsampled fsLR-5k surface using HCP's workbench tools (wb_command)120. The fsLR-32k surface templates and resampling spheres between “fsaverage” and “fs_LR” were accessed from the HCP's open-access pipeline121. Subsequently, we downsampled the surface template, registration spheres, and mid-wall mask to 5k, resulting in a mesh comprising 4432 cortical vertices for each hemisphere. All vertex-wise analyzes were performed based on this fsLR-5k surface. We calculated vertex-wise MPC matrices for each participant. Consistent with previous work23,122,123, we constructed 14 equivolumetric surfaces between the pial and white matter boundaries to sample qT1 intensities across cortical depths. This procedure generated distinct intensity profiles reflecting intracortical microstructural composition at each cortical vertex. Data sampled from surfaces closest to the pial and white matter boundaries were removed to mitigate partial volume effects. Intensity values at each depth were mapped to a common template surface, resampled to fsLR-5k surface, and spatially smoothed across each surface independently (full width at half maximum [FWHM] = 3 mm). Vertex-wise intensity profiles were cross-correlated using partial correlations controlling for the average cortex-wide intensity profile and log-transformed. This procedure resulted in the MPC matrices representing participant-specific similarity in myelin proxies across the cortex. To generate each individual's SC, we employed MRtrix on pre-processed DWI data108. Each surface vertex from the fsLR-5k surface was translated into a volumetric region of interest that filled the cortical ribbon using workbench tools120. This process yielded ~10 k seeds/targets for structural connectome generation. Anatomical segmentations and volumetric seeds were then mapped to DWI space, applying the non-linear registration warp-field mentioned earlier. Next, we estimated multi-shell and multi-tissue response functions124 and performed constrained spherical deconvolution to derive a fiber orientation distribution map125,126. This procedure, achieved through MRtrix, generated a tractogram with 40 M streamlines, with a maximum tract length of 250 mm and a fractional anisotropy cutoff of 0.06. To reconstruct whole-brain streamlines weighted by cross-sectional multipliers127, we applied spherical deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2). Connection weights between seeds/targets were defined as the streamline count after SIFT2. Next, individual rs-fMRI timeseries mapped to subject-specific surface models were resampled to fsLR-5k surface. Surface-based rf-MRI data underwent spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 3 mm). An individual's FC matrix was generated by cross-correlating all vertex-wise timeseries. Correlation values subsequently underwent Fisher-R-to-Z transformations. FC matrices of all task fMRI scans were also generated using the same approach. We converted each participant's SC, MPC, and FC matrices to a normalized angle affinity matrix, respectively, and applied diffusion map embedding on these matrices to generate multimodal gradients128. This non-linear dimensionality reduction procedure identified eigenvectors that describe main spatial axes of variance. Procrustes analysis aligned subject-level gradients to a group-level template generated from the group-average matrix of all participants. Gradients of the right hemisphere were aligned to the left hemisphere. Gradient analyzes were performed using BrainSpace (v0.1.10; http://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace), limiting the number of gradients to 10 and using default sparsity (keeping the top 10% of SC weights) and diffusion (α = 0.5) parameters129. Here, we focused on the first five principal gradients of each modality (Fig. For each modality, all gradients were normalized by dividing by the maximum value in the absolute value of gradients, with values ranging from −1.0 to 1.0. The Julich-Brain is a 3D probabilistic atlas of the human brain's cytoarchitecture, resulting from the analysis of 10 post-mortem human brains19 (Fig. The probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps (Julich-Brain v2.9, https://julich-brain-atlas.de/) were projected onto a template fsLR-5k surface to generate a surface-based representation19. Surface-based probabilistic maps contained values indicating the probability of an area being localized in each voxel, ranging from 0% to 100% overlap, with values ranging from 0 to 1. For each vertex, we defined its area label by identifying the area with the highest probability at that position. This area label was then used to assign all vertices on the fsLR-5k surface to the 228 areas defined by the Julich-Brain. Understanding the relationships between diverse brain regions, including their similarities and differences, is essential for investigating the spatial patterns of brain organization. In this study, we focus on exploring inter-areal heterogeneity and homogeneity to further reveal the global layout of cortical area. To quantify inter-areal heterogeneity, we computed the inter-areal dissimilarity for each area. Specifically, we calculated the cosine distance between gradient profiles of each area, resulting in a cosine distance matrix (Fig. The inter-areal dissimilarity was defined as the mean of each row in the cosine distance matrix, representing the distance between an area and all other areas. To identify cortical regions with significantly higher or lower inter-areal dissimilarity, we projected the inter-areal dissimilarity map onto a sphere and conducted 1000 spin permutation tests. An area was considered to have the highest inter-areal dissimilarity among the cortex if its original inter-areal dissimilarity value exceeded 97.5% of the permutation values. Conversely, an area was regarded as having the lowest inter-areal dissimilarity if its original value was lower than 97.5% of the permutation values. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied the FDR correction. To further investigate patterns of inter-areal dissimilarity, we conducted a network-level analysis utilizing the scheme proposed by Mesulam64, which delineates four cortical functional zones (i.e., idiotypic, paralimbic, unimodal, heteromodal; see Fig. Inter-areal dissimilarity between each pair of cortical hierarchies was compared using a two-sample t-test. FDR corrections were applied to correct for multiple comparisons, while spatial autocorrelation spin permutation tests were conducted for all tests. In order to explore the associations between inter-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructural hierarchy, we generated a MPC matrix based on histological data from BigBrain65, an ultrahigh-resolution 3D human brain model. From this matrix, we estimated the principal histological gradient as a representation of microstructural hierarchy. To examine the associations between the histological gradient and inter-areal dissimilarity, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient, with p-values corrected using 1000 spin permutation tests. To investigate the relationship between inter-areal dissimilarity and functional integration patterns, we calculated the PC63 using four cortical hierarchical levels64 as communities. Additionally, we estimated global FC strength by averaging the FC values for each region. Differences between cortical regions are crucial to functional specialization, but at the same time, similarities between regions support the realization of higher-order cognitive functions and functional integration across brain regions. To assess the homogeneity of cortical areas, we calculated (1-cosine distance) to represent the similarity between regional gradient profiles, resulting in an affinity matrix (Supplementary Fig. To evaluate the association between inter-areal similarity and cortical hierarchy, we examined the distribution of similarity coefficients across four hierarchy levels. To identify cortical areas with higher similarity, we performed hierarchical clustering on the affinity matrix to detect groups among the areas. We evaluated the clustering performance by calculating criterion values to determine the optimal number of clusters. We scrutinized the clusters with the highest criterion value and assessed the distribution of cortical hierarchies within each cluster to investigate the association between inter-areal homogeneity and cortical laminar differentiation. Functional segregation of distinct regions is a critical principle of the human brain. Given that each area was originally defined based on shared neuroanatomical features, we expect to find overall high intra-areal homogeneity. Here we quantified, however, to what extent the level of homogeneity varies across the brain. We assessed inter-areal dissimilarity at both the region-level and network-level. As previously described, we calculated the gradient profiles for each area by averaging the vertex-wise gradients within that area. For a given area i, we calculated the cosine distance between the vertex-wise multimodal gradients and gradient profile of area i, resulting in the generation of intra-areal dissimilarity of area i (Fig. This procedure was repeated for all areas, yielding the vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity map. To visualize the patterns of intra-areal heterogeneity more effectively, we calculated the average vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity within each area. By controlling for the number of vertices within each area, we accounted for the effect of area size. We examined the distribution of intra-areal dissimilarity within these four cortical hierarchies and compared the differences between each hierarchy using a two-sample t-test with FDR correction and spatial autocorrelation spin permutation tests. To investigate associations between intra-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructural hierarchy, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient between the histological gradient and intra-areal dissimilarity, correcting the p value using 1000 spin permutation tests. To explore patterns of functional diversity across tasks, we constructed vertex-wise FC matrices by cross-correlating timeseries data derived from multiple task fMRI sessions. The cosine distance between each vertex from different tasks was then computed, resulting in a cross-task diversity matrix (Fig. To quantify the cross-task diversity for a specific task, we averaged all distance values between that task and others. This process was repeated for all tasks, and the outcomes were mapped to areas, generating area-wise cross-task diversity for each task. Focusing on overall diversity, we calculated the average of values across all tasks to create the cross-task diversity map (Fig. To investigate associations between cross-task diversity and inter-/intra-areal dissimilarity, we computed Spearman's correlation coefficient. The resulting p values were corrected for spatial autocorrelations using 1000 spin permutation tests. To further investigate how intra-areal FC patterns change with tasks, we estimated the intra-areal cross-task diversity. For each area, we calculated the mean of FC strength between each vertex v to other vertices within a. We repeated this process for all tasks t and estimated the standard deviation across tasks (Fig. We summed all vertex-wise standard deviation values within the area and divided it by the number of vertices in this area to control for the effect of parcel size. We examined the correlation between intra- and inter-areal cross-task diversity by computing Spearman's correlation coefficient, controlling tSNR as a covariate, and controlling for the spatial autocorrelation using 1000 spin permutation tests.

Nature Communications volume 16, Article number: 3904 (2025) Cite this article A rift has occurred within the scientific community between two formerly close-knit fields: condensed matter physics and electronic device engineering. What started as a union to understand the fundamental optical and electrical properties of semiconductors has been split by divergent interests. While the partnership has produced revolutionary changes in the way that information is processed and consumed by an increasingly interconnected society, now the two disciplines rarely speak to one another. As the years have passed, condensed matter physics has become enamored with delicate electronic effects in increasingly complex materials and geometries to the detriment of realistic applications. Meanwhile, device engineering has remained steadfastly focused on room-temperature performance and overall efficiency, prizing incremental improvement over potential disruptive advances using alternative materials and physics. Recent advances in topological electronic systems—in particular those exploiting Chern insulators—while elegant, prompt a necessary reexamination of the device engineering needs and the associated metrics with the goal of establishing a commonality within the blooming field of topological electronics. The purpose of this Comment is to initiate such a reexamination in the hopes that, with a better understanding of future device needs, perhaps the two areas may reunite to usher in the next electronic revolution via the use of topological phenomena. An uncontroversial observation concerning the trajectory of topological condensed matter research, is that the bifurcation into fundamental and applied categories has been accelerating1,2. The previous acknowledgment of applications in publications has been a slight reference to a specific use case at the end of the abstract and a second time in the concluding statements. This has been replaced by detailed and precise demonstrations of topological phenomena, with the specific intention of investigating the potential role of topological matter in future device technologies. Perhaps one of the most recent and elegant demonstrations of such applied topological research comes in the form of Chern networks3,4,5,6. Generally speaking, a Chern network, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, refers to the electrical and/or magnetic control of dissipation-free 1D chiral edge state propagation between non-local electrical contacts within a heterogeneous device design. To be clear, the definition of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a state in which the longitudinal resistivity disappears, ρxx = 0, while at the same time the Hall resistivity becomes exactly quantized as ρxy = h/e2 in the absence of a net magnetic flux penetrating the device structure7,8. By controlling the sign of the applied perpendicular magnetic field, or ultimately an applied electric field as illustrated in Fig. 1(A), the chirality of the edge state may be controlled. The roots of 1D chiral edge transport in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry may be traced directly back to the foundational work by Haldane9. Nevertheless, the functional physical principle behind Chern networks is the successful exploitation of the bulk–boundary correspondence between fabricated device regions that possess any discrepancy between regional (first) Chern numbers. Therefore, the idea of being able to use applied electromagnetic fields to alter the direction and destination of dissipationless edge current flow provokes images of a clear topological means to guide the transmission of information within interconnected and arbitrarily complex device geometries, as shown in Fig. In a short amount of time, the evolutionary arc that connects the early efforts in the fabrication of a Chern network using antiferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 layers grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) immersed within a strong, but non-quantizing, magnetic field3 to the most recent use of magnetically-doped topological insulators created via an in-situ MBE mask that function without the need for continuous application of an external magnetic field6, it is clear that continued refinement of Chern networks will produce quantized topological transmission of current between non-locally connected contacts. While the continued improvement of Chern networks may be a forgone conclusion, the more pertinent questions, asked from a more applied perspective, are two-fold: (1) what device need is being addressed? (2) how does the successful implementation of the Chern network compare with other proposed device engineering solutions? Questions about the form of future electronic device technologies have been a topic of heavy debate for many years. To be more specific, the most quoted proposed solution that Chern networks are cited to address is the issue of power consumption. Currently, traditional electronic information processing is accomplished using highly interconnected complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device technologies. It is well-known that within CMOS, most of the power input to a chip is consumed when the state of the device is being altered either from the “off" state to “on" state or vice versa. Given the sheer number of power dissipating transistors that comprise current microelectronic chip designs—134 billion in the Apple M2 Ultra10—it is unsurprising that even the most energy efficient device solutions will dissipate a significant amount of energy in the course of normal operation. To this end, the semiconductor industry, and device engineers more broadly, are keenly aware of the power dissipation issue and have actively sought alternative “Beyond CMOS" device technologies using new physical principles and materials. If, indeed, the Chern network or another forthcoming solution proposes a device for practical consideration then there exist well-established device metrics that may be found in the International Roadmap of Devices and Systems (IDRS) against which these proposed devices must be benchmarked11,12,13. In this Comment, I point to some of the issues related to size, temperature, and performance that may hinder Chern networks as a viable technological solution by device engineers, and I ask questions that require the attention of both physics and engineering researchers. In doing so, my goal is to take one step towards normalizing and applying the relevant figures of merit, where appropriate, to prod the nascent dialog between condensed matter physics and device engineering towards joint solutions that address real-life performance needs. A Illustration of an electrostatically tunable Chern insulator, otherwise known as the quantum anomalous Hall insulator, shown as evolving from a Chern number of C = −2 to C = + 2 as tuned by an external gate voltage, VGATE. As the value of the Chern number changes, the number and chirality of the edge states propagating about the periphery of the system, as shown by the associated directional arrows. B An illustration of a Chern network where multiple externally tunable Chern insulators, each containing regions of distinct Chern number, are brought into close proximity to one another. The interactions change the overall direction of the flow of information in an externally controllable manner allowing for potentially complex designs. Current is input into the system and, given the pattern of Chern numbers in the network, the propagating current is directed into different remotely located voltage probes before exiting the network. In the quest to find stronger overlap between device engineering and condensed matter physics through applied topological electronics, it is legitimate to ask to what extent the work done in applied topology originating in condensed matter addresses an identified need within device engineering. In an attempt to resolve the question with regards to the Chern network, consider first the basic building block of the Chern network—the QAH insulator—from an engineering perspective. From the perspective of condensed matter physics, one of the features of the QAH insulator is the fact that the conduction is performed completely at the interface between two regions of differing Chern numbers. From the device engineering perspective, one of the largest faults of the QAH insulator is that the conduction is performed only along a thin section of the system. To have such a wide area of the 2D bulk between the counter-propagating edge states of potential chip space left unused is unacceptable in high-performance circuit design. On the other hand, it is impossible to have only one single chiral edge state without the associated 2D bulk to support the 1D holographic edge state. Therefore, the edge state topology is only protected while there is sufficient separation between the counter-propagating edge states so as to forbid the scattering of quasiparticles from one chiral edge into the anti-chiral partner localized on an opposing edge within the device structure. The application related question of minimum device size becomes a vital one that condensed matter has started to address. To this point, in recent work, the confinement of the QAH insulator edge state has been examined in MBE grown topological insulator (TI) devices comprised of 3 quintuple layers (QLs) of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 with 4 intervening QLs of undoped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. Quantum transport measurements on these layers have been systematically conducted as a function of applied magnetic fields and gate voltages over a wide range of QAH insulator widths from w = 300 nm to w = 10 μm with a minimum width of wmin = 72 nm14. The results illustrate how the penetration of the edge state into the bulk, perhaps aided by the presence of bulk disorder, limits the width to be w ≈ 72 nm given a decay length of the edge state into the bulk of Ledge ≈ 36 nm. For comparative purposes, using the IRDS 2022 edition, the width of center-to-center distance for the first metal interconnect line, or pitch, in production year 2022 CMOS-based logic devices was already at 24 nm. Additionally, the CMOS logic technology is based on FinFET architecture, in which a nanoribbon of semiconductor is contacted on three sides to form conducting channels, that may then be stacked to form the eventual multi-billion transistor application. Put in this perspective, Chern networks would need to be scaled in size to well below currently accessible dimensions to be competitive either as logic or interconnect implementations. Furthermore, in the context of multi-billion device applications, the presence of a comparably large resistance of Rchern = 25.8 kΩ per Chern device is noteworthy. The fundamental resistance implies that significant, compared to CMOS, energy will be dissipated in Chern networks not just during switching events, but during steady-state operation. Such limitations portend questions about the overall power efficiency of large multi-device Chern networks as they are scaled by number and not only size. From an engineering perspective, temperature is a vital quantity. Naturally, if the intended application is to be within the context of, for example, superconducting electronics15, then the energy scales of the system are expected to be small and, therefore, a path to functionality at room temperature, here defined to be TRT = 300 K, need not exist. However, if conventional computing, memory or spintronic applications are the goal, then there must necessarily be a path—regardless of the circuitry—that ends with room-temperature operation. To date, there are two separate paths that have been explored as a means to implement the QAH effect within topological materials. The first and most successful approach is to use magnetic dopants to fabricate compounds such as Cr-doped (BiSb)2Te3 or V-doped (BiSb)2Te36,16,17. Indeed, such material systems have demonstrated the QAH effect, albeit with two caveats. First, the observation of the QAH effect is at very low temperatures, typically below T ≤ 200 mK despite observed Curie temperatures that are on the order of TC ≈ 20K17. The second caveat is that the longitudinal resistance ρxx ≈ 0 only at the lowest system temperatures and in the presence of the smallest excitation currents. The difficulty in obtaining quantized transport in magnetically doped topological materials indicates that the magnetic exchange gap, ΔEX, that is opened by the ferromagnetic orientation of the dopant ions is very small compared to the system thermal energy18,19. Furthermore, the non-quantized transport at the edge of the system dictates that the system is not topological and indicates the existence of an alternative conduction path via the bulk16,17. Nevertheless, opportunities exist to make progress towards greater thermal stability in Chern networks. Rather than appealing to an overall ferromagnetic state mediated by magnetic dopants, an alternative that may lead to higher resilience to thermal effects may be proximity-induced magnetism. From a naive perspective, the existence of a multitude of magnetic materials boasting Curie temperatures that are greater than TRT and topological materials that host topological phases at temperatures greater than TRT accommodates the possibility of engineering a high-temperature QAH insulator phase20,21. To this end, there have been a number of significant studies that have paired magnetic materials with high Curie temperatures and topological materials21,22,23,24. At this time, however, while there are clear signatures of induced magnetism in the target topological material, there is no clear evidence of a Chern insulator produced via proximity coupling of disparate magnetic and topological materials. Yet one of the most compelling implications resulting from the experimental and subsequent theoretical work25 is that the presence of an overall long-range magnetic phase—either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic—may be irrelevant to the ability to instill high-temperature proximity-coupled phases within an adjacent topological material. In this context, if high-temperature operation is to be optimized, then the choice of magnetic materials should not be predicated on the energy scale associated with TC but rather based on two criteria: (1) the median physical distance between the magnetic atoms within the host magnetic material and the surface of the topological material, and (2) the magnitude of the magnetic moment associated with the magnetic atoms in the host magnetic material. When considering applied topology from both the condensed matter and device engineering perspectives, there is no larger separation between the disciplines as when considering the performance expectation gap between condensed matter perception and device engineering reality. Within condensed matter physics literature, the Chern network is a virtual panacea that is poised to cure the real engineering problems surrounding the reduced performance enhancements obtained by the inexorable shrinking of CMOS implementations of semiconductor logic devices. However, the performance degradation obtained with device scaling is well understood by the device engineering community and routinely updates the metrics by which they measure the performance of semiconductor logic and the constituent devices12. Furthermore, device engineering has recognized the need to find disruptive technologies that will enhance the performance of key components of digital information processing11. Thus, any proffered solution must be benchmarked against current CMOS on these key figures of merit (FoM). For instance, the use of topological materials, and even Chern networks, has long been proposed as a methodology to overcome the rise in the resistance of copper interconnects with continued scaling due to grain boundary and surface scattering12. Benchmarking the use of topological materials as interconnects has, indeed, shown benefits over copper with the caveat being that such topological benefits only become appreciable when the interconnect diameters are scaled below 6nm in width and ignores the question of how one would integrate these interconnects into the CMOS fabrication process to replace Cu26. In light of this, we apply basic benchmarking to the Chern network to determine where, as of now, this scientific development sits amongst other current and proposed technologies on two key FoM: subthreshold slope and drive current. Thus, to make a comparison between the Chern network performance and the 2022 generation, or 3nm-node logic device specifications, we use an analogy with the edge channel current to represent the drain current, IDS, with the backgate voltage being the same as the gate-to-source voltage, VGS. We begin with the subthreshold slope (Ssub), which is a FoM that quantifies the amount of power that is required to change the current flow by one order of magnitude: Subthreshold slope is one of the primary measures for overall comparison of effectiveness of current modulation via an external applied electric field. For a standard CMOS transistor, the subthreshold slope is limited by thermionic emission of carriers over the potential barrier that separates the origin of carriers within a transistor, i.e., the source, from the point where the injected carriers are extracted, i.e., the drain. The fundamental limit for CMOS transistors is Ssub = 60 mV/dec and state of the art transistors operate very close to this fundamental limit at between Ssub = 75 – 82 mV/dec in the 2022 production line12. A simple calculation using published data indicates that the Chern network, currently, has a subthreshold slope of Ssub = 333.45 mV/dec5. While the calculated Ssub may be improved over successive iterations, the major difficulty is that these measurements are carried out at 20 mK and not at room temperature. Further, the voltages that are applied to the gate to modulate the conduction are several orders of magnitude larger than in the state-of-the-art CMOS transistor. However, the expressly low temperature operation may be advantageous in certain applications due to the inability of CMOS devices to operate at low temperatures due to dopant freeze-out—or the state where the thermal energy imparted to the dopant atoms is insufficient for them to become ionized. Therefore, Chern networks may find utilization in applications such as superconducting spintronics for alternative forms of low-temperature logic27,28. The reality of the highly interconnected architecture of CMOS is that the successful operation of one isolated device is of questionable value. While such singular demonstrations are important as a means of determining basic proof of concept, it is crucial to ensure that a path exists for one singular device concept to be capable of producing sufficient current to drive subsequent stages of device architecture. In logic core devices produced for the 2022 3 nm technology node, the main MOS architecture is the FinFET, which consists of a thin Si nanoribbon that is surrounded on three sides by a metal gate12. Therefore, when the device is turned on by inverting the surface beneath the gate, three conductive channels are produced resulting in an on-state current of between Ion = 65 – 88 μA per device with a corresponding off-state current of Ioff = 0.1 – 10 nA/μm12. Given the topological nature of the current flow in the Chern network, it is natural to expect the Hall current to be quantized. Using the same topological argument, the longitudinal current may flow without dissipation, however, there is an associated active device resistance that is fundamentally limited to h/e2. For comparative purposes, consider the drive current density within a Chern network, \({J}_{on}^{CN}={e}^{2}{V}_{on}/h{L}_{edge}\), with Von being the drive voltage. Chern networks are currently incapable of approaching the current density in a CMOS transistor, \({J}_{on}^{CMOS}=874\,\mu A/\mu m\). However, additional iterations of Chern networks using different magnetic and/or topological materials may show increased current density by increasing the topological gap size, ΔEX in the Chern network. Increases in ΔEX effectively reduce the size of Ledge, thereby, increasing the resultant current density in a Chern network. Nonetheless, the consequences of such low current flow within the device structure may best be understood by considering the device concepts of static and dynamic fan-out. Fan-out is defined as the number of logic-gate inputs that may be driven by the output of a given logic gate without degradation of the logical state. While the static—or resistive DC component—of fan-out may be improved by better mitigation of contact resistances in Chern networks, the dynamic—or AC capacitive component—is more pernicious. The speed at which a signal moves through logic gates is limited by the charging time of the inherent capacitance of the logic gates, leading to propagation delays. Propagation delays may be, in part, overcome by using higher input currents to charge the next logic gate, via (2), Iinput is the input current fed into the logic element from a previous logic stage, Clogic is the capacitance and Vlogic is the voltage of the current logic gate, respectively. (2) indicates that by increasing the current fed into subsequent logic stages from previous stages, the voltage across the current logic stage increases faster thereby increasing the speed of signal propagation. Cast in this light, the small output current from the Chern network will produce significant delays in signal propagation if integrated within a CMOS framework. The advances put forth in the recent series of Chern network experiments represent a glimpse of the functionality and the variability of topological materials and responses. Given the difficulties discussed, namely scaling, temperature and performance, it is unlikely that such systems will find a home in next-generation CMOS technologies. However, while the specific expression of topological behavior may not impact the device architecture landscape, the important lessons learned within these impressive works must serve as the basis for continued exploration of topological materials from the applied or device perspective. To me, the overarching question germane to both perspectives is “Does the presence of topology matter for enabling new technologies?". Nevertheless, many open questions remain from both the fundamental and applied perspectives. From the applied perspective, questions remain around fundamental device properties, such as understanding the electrostatic and transport properties of deposited metals on topological materials, as this relates directly to the device contact resistance—a crucial parameter in any application15,29. From the fundamental perspective, an intriguing question surrounds the importance of crystallinity to device performance. Put another way: is it necessary to have perfectly crystalline topological materials to be able to exploit topological functionality? When considering time-reversal invariant topological materials, like (Bi,Sb)2Se3, the topological nature is protected by the inversion of band ordering that is brought about by the strength of the spin–orbit interaction. However, amorphous materials, characterized by randomized hopping strengths and positions of atoms within a material possessing neither long-range or short-range order, constructed from atoms with strong spin–orbit interactions, have been shown to possess the same topological features30,31. Therefore, perhaps the consideration of a cheaper quasi-crystalline topological system may be able to produce similar behavior at lower cost and effort32, if the presence of a topological surface state is the critical requirement for device implementations. Regardless, my perspective remains that the goal of topological technologies should be to replace functionality at the system level rather than at the level of individual devices. As we begin to look towards bringing the areas of condensed matter physics and device engineering closer, I believe that by starting the dialogue by examining some of the recent condensed matter successes and open device engineering questions to be addressed, we may collectively move towards a viable topological technology.
