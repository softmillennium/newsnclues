A senior Russian military officer died in a car blast in the city of Balashikha, just east of Moscow, according to authorities. Russia's Investigative Committee said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device and has opened a criminal probe into the case.

            A senior Russian general died in a car bombing in the Russian city of Balashikha on Friday, authorities say, the same day that US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
    


            Witkoff spent three hours meeting with Putin at the Kremlin in Friday, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters after the meeting, adding that the talks were “constructive and very useful.”
    


            Witkoff's trip to Russia, the fourth since Trump returned to the White House in January, came at a crunch time as the US president's self-imposed deadline of ending the war within his first 100 days in office nears.
    


            “This conversation allowed the Russian and US positions to be further brought closer together, not only on Ukraine, but also on a number of other international issues,” Ushakov told reporters in a call.
    


            Ushakov, who is a former Russian ambassador to Washington, was part of the meeting with Putin, as was Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, Russian state news agency Tass said.
    


            The United States has been applying more pressure on Ukraine after threatening last week it could walk away from the talks “within days” if it becomes clear a deal cannot be reached.
    


            The latest framework, presented by the Trump administration in Paris last week, proposed significant sacrifices from Kyiv, including US recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and Ukraine ceding large swaths of territory to Russia, according to an official familiar with the plan.
    


            According to Ushakov, part of the discussion considered direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow – a possibility that would likely require further discussion and delay in the diplomacy the Trump White House has hoped would yield concrete results in a matter of days.
    


            “As for the Ukrainian crisis itself, the discussion was, in particular, about the possibility of resuming negotiations between representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine,” he said.
    


            Witkoff and Putin likely also discussed an amended peace proposal which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said emerged from a week of diplomatic wrangling. Zelensky said President Donald Trump had received on his desk a fresh document proposing a path forward in negotiations more amenable to Ukraine and its European allies.
    


            Two diverging versions of a peace deal have been at the heart of the past weeks' discussions – one supported by Ukraine and its European allies, and another backed by Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
    


            A European official familiar with the different drafts said the Ukrainian and European proposal envisaged a ceasefire followed by discussions of about territory, with Kyiv receiving Article-5 like guarantees from its allies.

            The official said that Witkoff's version proposed the recognition of Crimea as Russian by the United States, “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine, Kyiv not joining NATO, and sanctions against Russia being lifted.
    


            The full details of the competing versions were first reported by Reuters.
    


            Vice President JD Vance earlier on Wednesday called “to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.”
    


            Asked what concessions Russia was offering on Thursday, Trump replied, “stopping the war,” suggesting that not “taking the whole country” is a “pretty big concession.”
    


            CNN reported this week that Trump was getting frustrated with the stalling talks and has privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated.
    


            Recognizing Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula Moscow ilegally annexed in 2014, as Russian would cross a major red line for Ukraine and its European allies, and would be in breach of established international law.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the idea, saying there was “nothing to talk about” as recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would be against Ukraine's constitution.
    


            Friday's highly anticipated meeting took place soon after the announcement that General Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, had been killed in the explosion of a Volkswagen Golf in Balashikha, which lies less than 20 miles east of Moscow.
    


            Russia's Investigative Committee confirmed Moskalik's death, adding that the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel.
    


            No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The attack appeared similar in nature to previous assassination of Russian officials, including that of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, a top Russian general who was accused of orchestrating the use of chemical weapons on the battlefields in Ukraine.
    


            Kirillov – who headed Russia's radiological, biological and chemical protection forces – was killed in December, after a remotely operated bomb planted inside an electric scooter went off outside an apartment building in Moscow.
    


            CNN has reached out to Ukrainian authorities for comment.
    


            The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the car when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. CNN can not independently verify this report.
    


            Little is known about Moskalik, who held the rank of Lieutenant General.
    


            Rybar described him as “competent and demanding” and said “he was not well liked” because he was “tough on his subordinates.”
    


            Russia's Investigative Committee said it has opened a criminal probe into the explosion. It added that an investigative team, including forensic experts and law enforcement officers, had begun examining the scene.
    


            Tass earlier reported that the explosive device was “homemade.”
    


            Friday's reported blast comes two days after a fire broke out at an underground car park in Moscow's business district following an explosion there.

            Pope Francis, who died on Easter Monday, is breaking with tradition when it comes to where he will be laid to rest – choosing a light-filled basilica instead of the grottoes of the Vatican.
    


            Popes are usually buried within Vatican City, beneath St. Peter's Basilica. But Francis will be the first pontiff in more than a century to be buried outside the Vatican, as he requested a “simple” tomb a couple of miles away in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore – also known as St. Mary Major.
    


            Francis' funeral will take place on Saturday in St. Peter's Square, before his body is taken to the basilica – on the other side of the river in central Rome – for burial.
    


            “The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration and with the only inscription: Franciscus,” the pontiff said in his will, released by the Vatican. He also said the costs of his burial would be covered “by a sum provided by a benefactor.”

How Pope Francis' progressive legacy changed the church



            While Francis' tomb will be humble, the basilica above it glitters with sunlight and gold. The ceiling is covered in gilded wood, and light pours in through high-up windows to illuminate intricate mosaics that line the nave. Mourners and visitors have flocked here in the days since Francis's death, interested to see for themselves a place that he loved.
    


            Perched on top of one of the seven hills on which ancient Rome was built, Santa Maria Maggiore is one of four papal basilicas. Its bell tower is the tallest in the Italian capital, rising to a height of 246 feet, and its position on the hill makes it the highest point in the city.
    


            The legend goes that the Virgin Mary came to both Pope Liberius and an Italian aristocrat asking for the church to be constructed in her honor in a place that would be miraculously revealed. Rome's Esquiline Hill was identified as the spot after snow fell on its summit in August of 358, at the height of summer. In contemporary times, a celebration marking the “Miracle of the Snow” takes place at the basilica on August 5 every year.
    


            The church as it stands today was commissioned by Pope Sixtus III in the year 431. The mosaics date from that time, and the interior also boasts Classical columns plundered from other buildings, although it's encased in a Neoclassical facade built in the 1700s.
    


            The church has long held a special significance for Pope Francis, who used to visit on Sunday mornings to honor the Virgin Mary.
    


            He would often visit the basilica before and after foreign trips, as well as after hospital stays, to pray to the most important Marian icon, the Salus Populi Romani, to which he entrusted the protection of his apostolic journeys, in keeping with Jesuit tradition.
    


            Clearly a spot close to his heart, it's where Francis began his first full day as leader of the Catholic Church in 2013. It is also the first place he visited after leaving the hospital last month, offering flowers to be placed before the icon of the Virgin Mary before returning to his residence in the Vatican.
    


            Francis revealed his plans to be buried there in December 2023, explaining that he felt a “very strong connection” with the basilica. “I want to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore,” Francis said. “Because it is my great devotion.”
    


            A “place is already prepared” for his burial, the pope said in 2023, adding that he had been working on streamlining papal funerals.
    


            “We simplified them quite a bit,” Francis said. “I will premiere the new ritual,” he added with a smile at the time.
    


            Although seven other popes are buried in Santa Maria Maggiore, Francis will be the first not to be interred in St. Peter's Basilica since Leo XIII, who died in 1903 and was laid to rest in the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano. The last pope to be buried at Santa Maria Maggiore was Clement IX, back in 1669.
    


            This is not the only time the pope has broken with tradition: Francis also refused to live in the Apostolic Palace, the official papal residence, instead choosing to live in a small apartment in the Vatican guesthouse, Santa Marta.
    


            Throughout his life, he was known for eschewing luxuries. As a cardinal in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he was known for taking the subway instead of using a chauffeured car. Later in his career, he would travel to work at the Vatican in an unassuming blue Ford Focus.
    


            The day after his death, Basilica ﻿di Santa Maria Maggiore was far busier than usual, with mourners, worshipers and other visitors coming by the hundreds. The atmosphere was filled with sentiment but not somber, and the afternoon Mass opened with a brass quintet and bright organ music.
    


            “It was just a remarkable experience,” Kerry Bruder, 71, from Ontario, Canada, said after seeing the vast artworks and marble sculptures inside the church. “You know that people for centuries have been going in there… and it just made you feel small, but in a good way.”
    


            Victoria Ferreira, who traveled to Rome from Brazil for Easter, said she had already visited the basilica days before – but it felt different after the pontiff's death, adding that “it was very emotional.”
    


            Ferreira, 33, told CNN that as a Catholic, she hopes the next pope will direct the church down the same path as Francis.
    


            “He filled us with love, with empathy, with hope,” she said. “And I think we need to, more than ever, have this in our mind and in our actions – to be like him.”

Nearly 700 essays from around the world have been unveiled in Moscow ahead of a major global forum on the future economy, with authors sharing bold ideas for shaping a better world.

Moscow hosted a presentation on Thursday of essays submitted for a contest which is part of the upcoming Open Dialogue: ‘The Future of the World: New Platform for Global Growth'. The event, scheduled for April 28-30, will bring global experts to the Russian capital to explore what lies ahead for the world economy and society.

The National Centre RUSSIA, which organized the contest, received nearly 700 submissions from 102 countries. The countries with the most active participants included Mexico, India, China, Oman, Italy, Egypt, Vietnam, Türkiye, Colombia, Canada, and France, according to the organizers.

The essays, now compiled into four volumes, center on four themes: Investments in people, Technology, Environment, and Communication. The organizers say the goal is to identify breakthrough ideas that could inform future economic planning.

“Soon, there will be 10 billion of us on the planet, and we must decide what to do about electricity and environment in the future,” Gerald Sakuler, the president of the Austrian Business Club in Russia, said. “There are many ideas. Every proposal will be heard.”

Thursday's presentation brought together experts, contributors, and organizers to discuss highlights from the submissions and exchange ideas ahead of the main forum.

The upcoming Open Dialogue forum will gather representatives from think tanks, government agencies, universities, development organizations, media, and youth groups to debate strategies for global development.

The full event program is available in Russian, English, Chinese, Arabic, and Portuguese on the National Centre RUSSIA website.

By Sasan Karimi, adjunct professor at the University of Tehran Faculty of World Studies and International Politics Program Director at the Nuclear Watch Network

The current phase of relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States marks a notable convergence: the return of a moderate tendency to power in Iran coincides with Donald Trump's leadership in the US, representing a revitalized faction within the Republican Party.

However, the nuclear issue, once briefly regarded as the sole resolved point of contention between the two nations, has resurfaced as the foremost challenge since Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018. While a readily available pretext for political friction, this matter is not inherently alarming given its two-decade history; yet, it remains the linchpin of tensions between Iran and the United States.

A critical starting point for analyzing the challenges in Iran-US relations lies in assessing the positions and interests of key stakeholders.

The Arab states of the region have adopted a markedly softer and more amicable stance toward Iran compared to the periods of JCPOA negotiations, its signing, and the subsequent US withdrawal. Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain – previously strained for reasons not entirely clear – have evolved into a state of cautious friendliness, if not outright warmth. Given the geographic proximity of these nations to Iran, their deep ties with the United States, Europe, China, and Russia, and their collective influence, this shift carries significant implications for the policies of major powers concerning Iran's nuclear program.

Israel, by contrast, has consistently viewed any improvement in Iran's relations with the West, particularly the US, as a strategic red line. Throughout the JCPOA negotiations, its implementation under the Obama administration, and Trump's first term, Israel exerted maximum effort to undermine any proposed resolution to disputes involving Iran and the US, Europe, or even Arab states. For Israel, the substance of the issue is at most secondary or even nonsense; its utility lies in its potential to securitize Iran, isolating and pressuring it – a goal Tel Aviv* deems sufficiently met as long as this dynamic persists.

The EU, despite being a large and diverse union of over 20 member states, largely follows the lead of France, Germany, and the UK in foreign policy, two of which hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council. While these nations outwardly advocate for diplomatic solutions, their stance toward Iran has hardened considerably since the 2013-2018 period. Moreover, their exclusive control over the JCPOA's dispute resolution mechanism – known as the “snapback” – combined with transatlantic divergences, has imbued the issue with an identity-driven, Atlantic-spanning dimension. Consequently, while Western Europe is unlikely to spearhead bold diplomatic initiatives, it retains the capacity to disrupt progress, particularly through the snapback mechanism, motivated in part by these identity-based considerations.

Russia emerges as another pivotal actor. As one of Iran's most significant partners, having stood by Tehran during sanctions, Russia holds a prominent role in Iran's foreseeable future, including in negotiations and their aftermath. Compared to the JCPOA negotiation period, Iran-Russia relations have matured, while Moscow's ties with Washington have entered uncharted territory, shaped by the Ukraine war, Trump's eagerness to resolve it, personal rapport between the two leaders, and tensions largely stoked by Washington's European allies. However, historically, Russia neither favors an escalation of Iran-West tensions nor benefits from their complete reconciliation. This duality suggests that Tehran's policymakers should approach Moscow strategically, ensuring Russia perceives tangible benefits in supporting improved Iran-West relations – a prospect that is far from guaranteed and requires deliberate design.

China, among all actors surrounding Iran's nuclear issue and broader disputes with the West, stands as perhaps the most distant yet consistent in its declared positions. Beijing profits from sanctions on Iran – albeit indirectly – while also standing to gain from their removal, which would open a relatively untapped market to Chinese investors and contractors. Like Russia, China seeks to prevent heightened Iran-West tensions but does not necessarily welcome excessive rapprochement, which could intensify competition in Iran's market. For Iran to elevate China's role from political support to economic and operational engagement, it must astutely align any prospective agreement with Beijing's interests.

Regional actors, such as Iran's allies in West Asia – including resistance groups that are not mere proxies but longstanding anti-occupation movements – have never opposed a resolution of Iran's disputes with the West. With the Axis of Resistance having endured military setbacks over the past year, one of the West's – and particularly Israel's – primary pretexts for challenging Iran's regional role has effectively dissipated.

Before starting the recent negotiations, both Iran and the US employed a carrot-and-stick approach, blending diplomatic overtures with veiled threats. Yet, clinging to outdated policies will not yield innovative solutions in global politics. Western actors, in particular, must acknowledge that Iranian policymakers, seasoned by over four decades of managing a nation under pressure, advancing its development, and navigating critical regional and international crises, are unlikely to be cowed by familiar threats into a weaker negotiating position. Such tactics may instead erode the credibility of the West – and the Trump administration specifically – in pursuing a balanced diplomatic resolution.

This analysis proposes the following actionable recommendations to ensure enough pragmatism and fruitful talks:

These steps, if pursued with strategic foresight, could pave the way for a sustainable resolution to a decades-long impasse.

WASHINGTON, April 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is probably the only world leader who recognizes the need to address the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS in an interview.

In his words, Trump ""is probably the only leader on Earth, who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation.""

""He said it was a huge mistake to pull Ukraine into NATO, and this was a mistake by the Biden administration, and he wants to rectify this,"" the top Russian diplomat said.

Fragments of the interview were published on Thursday night. The full version will be aired on Sunday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly spoken in favor of settling the conflict in Ukraine, but only if Russia's interests are taken into account and if root causes of the Ukrainian crisis are fixed.

Exit comes after Joe Kasper was implicated as orchestrator of power grab that led to dismissal of three Pentagon officials

Joe Kasper, the controversial chief of staff to the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was central to a dramatic power struggle at the Pentagon, has left his post, in an unexpected departure.

Despite Hegseth's assurances just days ago in a TV appearance on the Fox & Friends show that Kasper would merely transition to “a slightly different role” within the department, Kasper confirmed to Politico in a Thursday interview he will instead return to government relations and consulting, maintaining only limited Pentagon ties as a special government employee.

A senior defense official at the Pentagon confirmed the dramatic title change to the Guardian on Friday, saying Kasper would be “handling special projects at the Department of Defense”

“Secretary Hegseth is thankful for [Kasper's] continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda,” the official said in a statement, referring to Donald Trump's protectionist policy push.

The quick exit comes after Kasper was implicated as the orchestrator of a power grab that led to the dismissal of three senior Pentagon officials – Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick and Colin Carroll – allegedly as part of a leak investigation.

The administration's first hundred days created a troubled tenure for Kasper, with anonymous sources claiming he was frequently late to meetings, failed to follow through on critical tasks, and displayed inappropriate behavior, including berating officials and making crude comments allegedly about his bowel movements during high-level meetings.

“He lacked the focus and organizational skills needed to get things done,” one anonymous insider told Politico.

The leadership shake-up coincides with separate allegations that Hegseth had an unsecured internet connection installed in his Pentagon office, which would bypass government security protocols, to use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer. This “dirty line” arrangement potentially exposes sensitive defense information to surveillance or hacking risks, according to reports from the Associated Press and ABC News.

Kasper previously worked at the Department of Homeland Security, the US navy and the air force during the first Trump administration before becoming a lobbyist.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Rodney Taylor, whose legs were amputated as a toddler, just one of many people with disabilities at risk from detention

In his three months locked up at Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, Rodney Taylor has missed meals and showers, lived with increasing pain in his hips, developed a swollen thumb on his right hand and blisters on the stumps where his two legs were amputated when he was a toddler.

Taylor's mother brought him to the US from Liberia on a medical visa as a small child. He went through 16 operations and is a double amputee. He has two fingers on his right hand. Now 46, he has lived in the US nearly his entire life, works as a barber, is active in promoting cancer awareness in his community, and recently got engaged.

Nonetheless, his immigration status is unresolved, and despite having an application for residence – commonly known as a “green card” – pending, on 15 January Ice agents arrived at his Loganville, Georgia home and took him to Stewart.

The reason, according to his attorney, who shared paperwork from his case with the Guardian: a burglary conviction he received as a teenager and which the state of Georgia pardoned him for in 2010.

His case is one of an untold number of people with disabilities and other serious health issues who are being swept up in the current administration's “mass deportation” efforts. These efforts are carried out in extreme overcrowding at the hundred-plus detention centers like Stewart across the nation.

They also happen without the benefit of two federal offices that formerly provided oversight for healthcare and other issues, and now a situation is unfolding where detainees with disabilities like Taylor are increasingly at risk of life-altering outcomes and even death, experts say.

“It's the perfect storm for abuses to occur – including negligence,” said Joseph Nwadiuko, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who researches the immigration detention system. “Deaths are much more likely … [and] we haven't thought about the healthcare implications of what's developing,” he said.

The immigration detention system was already a precarious, potentially unsafe place for detainees with disabilities, according to experts and a handful of current and former employees with the Department of Homeland Security – Ice's parent agency.

But when the current administration closed the office for civil rights and civil liberties (CRCL) and the office of the immigration detention ombudsman (Oido) last month, detainees such as Taylor were left with less protection than ever – at a time when nearly 48,000 detainees are locked up nationwide, the highest number since October 2019.

“It's all happening in the dark,” said Sarah Owings, Taylor's attorney, speaking of conditions facing her client and others like him.

Taylor spoke to the Guardian from Stewart. When he was detained in front of his house, he was only days away from picking up new prosthetic legs; the ones he was using were too tight. Then the detention center gave him shoes that didn't fit the legs and trying to walk “felt like walking on concrete on my knees”, he said.

In addition, the prosthetic legs have batteries that require eight hours of charging a day. But after being locked up at Stewart, he didn't even see a doctor for three days, and in the ensuing months, the facility has never been able to arrange for eight hours of charging, allowing only several hours at a time. The result: the batteries die and the legs don't bend, creating more pain in Taylor's hips.

Taylor and Owings sought a medical leave, in order to see the doctor who could at least fit him for the new prosthetic legs – and were denied. A second petition is “under review”, he said.

In the meantime, walking to the cafeteria to eat has proved too painful. Other detainees brought him meals for awhile, but often had to argue with guards for permission. A case manager took over the chore, often arriving at least an hour after meals.

Staff also offered Taylor a wheelchair – but he can't push it, as his right hand only has two fingers, and his thumb has swollen and become painful since he was detained.

Taylor's case was one of several featured in a CNN story about people facing possible deportation after decades of living in the US. Afterwards, he said, “the warden came to me and said, ‘Tell me what you need.'” He told him about his legs and thumb. “I haven't heard a response yet,” Taylor said. “It's stressful.”

Taylor told the Guardian he was not the only detainee at Stewart with medical issues. He met another detainee who suffered an infection and couldn't walk; the man had to wait about a month to get crutches.

“Unless you're dying or bleeding out … they're not going to come,” he said a guard told him and several others. “They think, ‘Everybody is getting deported soon … and fixing your issue is not our concern – getting you outta here is our concern. Why spend all this extra money?'” said Taylor.

The situation is the same at other Ice detention facilities, several experts told the Guardian. They mentioned Krome, in Miami, Florida, where at least three detainees have died in recent months and others with conditions such as HIV have gone weeks without medicine.

Amy Zeidan, a professor of emergency medicine at Atlanta's Emory University who has researched healthcare in the immigration detention system, said that increasing overcrowding also worsens a chronic workforce shortage. “They don't have enough qualified people,” she said. “They don't have the people they need to provide appropriate care.”

These conditions “are emblematic of the system” under the current administration, said a DHS staffer who preferred anonymity to avoid retaliation.

Michelle Brané was the ombudsman at the Oido until the office of 100-plus employees was shut down, doing away with inspections of immigration detention facilities – both announced and unannounced; responses to complaints; and policy recommendations for improving such aspects of detention as healthcare. Her office “deescalated situations that are now being exacerbated [by] … increasing detentions”, she said.

The DHS sees things differently.

“These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department's] mission,” said a DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, in March, regarding shuttering the Oido and the CRCL, which handled more in-depth investigations of healthcare and other issues. Ice did not respond to a query from the Guardian.

This attitude, said Brané, shows a “disdain for meeting basic humane conditions”, adding that her office was “created by statute and funded by Congress”.

The former ombudsman is concerned about the situation facing detainees with disabilities and other serious health issues. “Ultimately, I'm worried people will die, or suffer irreparable harm – and dying shouldn't be the point at which we start caring,” she said. “We shouldn't be a country that is willingly mistreating people.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Fernando Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced in 2023 after being convicted for corruption

Brazil's former president, Fernando Collor, has been arrested early and ordered to begin serving a prison sentence stemming from his 2023 conviction for corruption.

Collor was convicted of receiving 20m reais ($3.5m) to facilitate contracts between BR Distribuidora, a fuel distributor formerly controlled by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, and construction firm UTC Engenharia for the construction of fuel distribution bases. In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned.

Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest. He was arrested on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas.

Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the supreme court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals.

The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash, a sweeping corruption investigation that has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America – including the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years.

Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil.

Supreme court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president's arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president's lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals.

The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away.

Collor's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Applications to enter Taiwan for the World Masters Games in Taipei and New Taipei City next month are still being processed, with about half having been approved, Games organizers said on Thursday amid reports that some of the 500 Chinese athletes seeking to take part might withdraw due to difficulties entering the nation.

Some athletes from China have complained that they have seen no progress on their applications to enter Taiwan for the Games, which are to start on May 17, Chinese-language media reported earlier on Thursday.

Chinese athletes are facing difficulties leaving China, as Chinese authorities — who have claimed to be unaware of the event in Taiwan — are obstructing participation, the reports said, adding that some athletes might have to reroute through Hong Kong or Macau to enter Taiwan, a complication that would inconvenience them and might lead to withdrawals.

World Masters Games spokeswoman Kuo Yin-lan (郭音蘭) said that about 25,000 athletes had registered, with athletes from China accounting for about 2 percent.

Entry applications from Chinese athletes must be submitted to the central government for approval and the authorities are processing them, Kuo said.

Chinese seeking to visit Taiwan for tourism purposes are only allowed in if they are studying or residing in a third country, while Chinese authorities have banned individual and group travel from China to Taiwan since the middle of 2019 and early 2020 respectively, she said.

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) late on Thursday confirmed its role in reviewing whether registered athletes from China would be allowed to enter Taiwan.

MAC Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh (梁文傑) said that 555 Chinese had registered for the Games, with about 230 having been issued entry permits to enter Taiwan as of Thursday.

“We have adopted a supportive approach to help individuals from China, who are not part of an official delegation, enter Taiwan,” Liang said, adding that the World Masters Games is not a competition based on national representation, with athletes registering individually.

It is not like other major international events such as the Asian Games or the Universiade, at which participants compete as part of national teams, he added.

However, while the MAC can issue entry permits for Chinese nationals seeking to enter Taiwan, they still need approval from Chinese authorities to leave China, he said.

“This has happened before in other cases — we often approve people [to enter Taiwan], but they end up unable to travel here because the Chinese side does not grant them permission” to leave China, he said.

The MAC has not heard of any specific policies from the Chinese authorities targeting Chinese planning to participate in the Games or suggesting that such participation is considered illegal, he said.

First held in 1985, the World Masters Games is an international multisports event held every four years for athletes aged 30 or above from around the world, with this year's edition marking the first time the event is to be hosted in Taiwan, the International Masters Games Association said.

The three KMT officials led an assembly outside the Taipei City Prosecutors' Office, a restricted area where public assembly is not allowed, protesting the questioning of several KMT staff and searches of KMT headquarters and offices in a recall petition forgery case.

The pavilion features an artificial intelligence (AI)-based art gallery showcasing works of famous Taiwanese artists from the Japanese colonial period using innovative technologies. 
Among its main simulated displays are Eastern gouache paintings by Chen Chin (陳進), Lin Yu-shan (林玉山) and Kuo Hsueh-hu (郭雪湖), who were the three young Taiwanese painters selected for the East Asian Painting exhibition in 1927.

“Of course, we would welcome Honduras if they want to restore diplomatic ties with Taiwan after their elections,” Lin said at a meeting of the legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, when asked to comment on statements made by two of the three Honduran presidential candidates during the presidential campaign in the Central American country.

Kenyan Faith Kipyegon's bid to run a sub-four minute mile has stunned American 2016 400m hurdles Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, who believes this endeavor could redefine the parameters for women in sports.

Triple Olympic and world 1,500m champion Kipyegon is to attempt the first women's unofficial sub-four minute mile in Nike's “Breaking 4” project.

The 31-year-old would attempt the feat on June 26 at Stade Charlety in Paris, where she broke her own 1,500m world record last year.

“I'm just amazed. I'm in awe. I saw that and I heard about it... I want to be there,” said Muhammad, the International Event Ambassador for the TCS World 10K Bengaluru.

“That's just honestly hard for me to even put into words what that means for women in sports... For women to even attempt it, it's just honestly crazy,” Muhammad said. “She's run, I think 4:07, which we were looking at as crazy. I'm just really, truly excited for where the bounds for women can go in the sport and to just hear a woman trying to break four minutes in my lifetime is amazing.”

The 35-year-old Muhammad, who earlier this month announced that she would end her career after this year's season, believes age should not be a barrier for athletes to achieve their goals.

“For myself at 35, I feel almost better than ever. There's no slowing down. We have to do things a little bit differently, but it can get done,” she said. “I think if you have the will and the drive, it's definitely possible. So, at 31, that's amazing for her [Kipyegon].”

World Athletics is soon to introduce genetic testing for women to tighten eligibility rules, but Muhammad expressed concerns about the intrusive nature of the procedures, adding that she needed more knowledge for an opinion.

“After hearing some women's stories like Caster Semenya's, it's just how invasive some of these procedures can be and just how kind of traumatizing it can be,” Muhammad said. “When we talk about gender testing and what that even entails, I'm a little hesitant on it.”

Muhammad, who won gold in the 400m hurdles at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, followed by gold (4x400m relay) and silver (400m hurdles) at the Tokyo Games in 2021, said the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo later this year would likely be her last outing.

Muhammad confirmed that she has no plans of returning to the track at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games and that her compatriot Alexis Holmes, a member of the 4x400m gold-medal winning team in Paris, was someone to look out for in the future in the 400m.

“She's a great relay runner and I think she has the potential to push those boundaries in the sport,” she added.

Tributes to the Argentine pontiff, a lifelong lover of the game, who died on Monday at the age of 88, have been peppered with soccer metaphors in his homeland.
“Francisco.

“We both know that, in this world, the question of what is right only matters between equals. Otherwise, the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”

So spoke a delegation from ancient Athens to the people of Melos, according to Thucydides in his book, “The History of the Peloponnesian War.” Athens, the prototype for democracy, was seeking the submission of the small Aegean island in the 5th-century-B.C. war.

“You should not destroy what protects us both, the privilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and right, and even to profit by arguments that fall a little short of the mark. This is in your interest as much as it is in anyone's,” the Melians reply to the delegation.

This dialogue resembles to some degree the recent White House confrontation between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump and the Athenian delegation share in the conviction that might makes right. Democracy, as long as it values free competition, induces a belief that might is the only political reality. Both Trump and the ancient Athenians apparently want to argue that, in negotiations, the weak countries should always accede to the strong countries. They also seem to maintain that conflicts occur because the weak insist on their territorial rights despite lacking in capabilities.

The Melians patiently explain to the Athenian delegation that when countries share common values, the strong should use their might wisely and show compassion for the weak countries, where many people are less fortunate. However, Trump, who values dealmaking, appears to favor Russian President Vladimir Putin, who believes that strength is justice, over Zelenskyy, even though the Ukrainian leader holds similar values to the United States.

Trump has announced his plan for the United States to “take over” and “own” the war-torn Gaza Strip so as to bring an end to decades of strife and develop the territory into a casino resort. It has also been learned that the U.S. government approached South Sudan and Somalia and considered Albania and Indonesia as potential hosts for the relocation of the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza.

However, Trump's plan to convert Gaza into a resort, which threatens Palestinians' right to self-determination and undermines the dignity of the Arab world, has made Saudi Arabia, the leader of the Arab world, think twice about the U.S.-backed initiative for Riyadh to join hands with Israel to create an axis against Iran.

Trump has thrown out more ideas, saying that he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state; that the United States should purchase Greenland; and that he wants to “take back” the Panama Canal — which the United States formerly controlled through a lease. He seems to be trying to revive 19th-century-style territorial imperialism. But his approach to “making America great again” is unexpectedly peaceful, and is more like a property transaction.

The United States has a history of expanding its territory by cutting treaty-based deals for land. This includes the purchase of the Louisiana territory in 1803 from France for $15 million, and the 1867 purchase of Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million.

If Trump is considering acquiring Greenland and the Gaza Strip through purchases similar to those made in the past for land, it will not be enough to simply ridicule his ideas as the thinking of a real estate mogul.

Trump's approach resembles that of Athenian statesman Alcibiades. The ancient Athenian tended to unsettle the people around him because he ignored and even deviated from customs, in a manner akin to a tyrant.

And yet, Alcibiades still emerged as a darling of Greek democracy as Pericles, a statesman who advanced Athenian democracy, and the philosopher Socrates protected him. Just as Alcibiades boldly made friends with Sparta, the enemy of ancient Athens, as well as with the Persian Empire, Trump does not hesitate to accommodate the demands of Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by ignoring Ukrainians' and Palestinians' right to exist.

When Athens dispatched a military expedition to Sicily, Alcibiades dreamed of a massive Mediterranean campaign in which he would conquer Carthage (present-day Tunisia) and Libya, before laying siege to the Italian and Peloponnese peninsulas. (Sparta was located on the Peloponnese.)

Thucydides characterized Alcibiades' political style as that of an “unprincipled rogue.” Somehow, I'm reminded of Trump. In a 2020 speech, Trump declined to stress such common values as freedom and justice, but instead declared, “We have rejected globalism and embraced patriotism.”

What new kind of international order will emerge should the United States purchase Greenland to keep Russian control of the Arctic in check, take control of the Panama Canal, whose key ports are operated by a Hong Kong-based company, and acquire the Gaza Strip, which has received military aid from Iran? There is no answer for this question. All I can envision is a gloomy sense of nihilism, a world in which there are no shared values or universal norms.

In any case, Trump can hardly be called an authentic conservative. His decision to exempt Russia from his tariff measures but slap China with significant tariffs can be called audaciously destructive and revolutionary. And recall that those who carried out the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol without any hesitation were Trump supporters. Trump's political tactics clearly have some elements of destruction and revolution, which are ill-suited to democracy.

Given Trump's excessive support for Israel, he cannot be considered an isolationist. And given his trust in Putin, he cannot be called anti-communist or neoconservative. (Neoconservatives advocate for democracy.)

One critic has labeled Trump a “sovereignist,” linking him to a group of Republican senators who blocked the United States from joining the League of Nations in 1919.

Indeed, what best symbolizes his political stance is his series of orders withdrawing America from United Nations organizations and multilateral agreements. For example, he has signed an executive order to pull the United States out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, and pause funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), alleging it is a haven for terrorists.

Trump's nihilistic view that might makes right has allowed Netanyahu and Putin to feel increasingly confident in their high-handed policies. In the Gaza Strip, more than 50,000 people have been killed. In Ukraine, people in both urban and rural areas have been killed. The conclusion drawn from these atrocities is that indiscriminate and ruthless tactics are the only effective ones, a typical example of nihilism.

Netanyahu has prioritized military campaigns to destroy Hamas over the release of hostages in order to protect himself, widening divisions in Israel while allowing the deaths of hostages in the Gaza Strip.

Gaza is also growing more divided. Residents there have staged demonstrations five times since late March to protest against Hamas for its continued armed struggle and disregard for the lives of ordinary citizens.

However, once Hamas disappears, there will be no central organization in Gaza to continue resistance to Israel, a situation that will make it easier for Israel to expel Gaza's civilians en masse and reoccupy the territory. This is the paradox that lies at the heart of the tragedy. Even with the death of family members having become an everyday occurrence, Trump is unlikely to abandon his nihilism.

For people in Gaza and Ukraine who have no outlet for their anger or sadness, the following passage from the Maqamat al-Hariri, a collection of Arabic stories, may express something they too have felt:

“If luck of time has not turned its back on me, I wish it would let me and my children leave this bitter world. Should only my children die, leaving me bereaved of them, I would be tormented by pain and remorse and at a loss about where to go and what to do.”

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

A copy of the peace proposal given to the U.S. by Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week includes ""robust security guarantees"" including from Washington, and no talks on territorial concessions until a ""full and unconditional ceasefire in the sky, on land and at sea"" has been implemented, Reuters reported on April 25.

The document, reprinted in full by the news outlet, contains numerous points that show the diverging viewpoints of the U.S. on one side, and Ukraine and its European allies on the other as they seek to end Russia's full-scale invasion.

The Trump administration has so far refused to offer Kyiv any security guarantees, but the Ukrainian proposal calls for an ""Article 5-like agreement"" backed by the U.S. while NATO membership for Kyiv remains off the table.

Earlier this week it was reported the U.S. could give de jure recognition to Russia's control over occupied Crimea, but the Ukrainian and European proposal insists that ""territorial issues will be discussed and resolved after a full and unconditional ceasefire.""

Reuters published details of the U.S. plan, confirming earlier reports and revealing key disagreements with Ukrainian and European positions.

The proposal also demands that sanctions on Russia only be eased after a ""sustainable peace"" has been achieved, a move the White House is reportedly considering implementing even before a peace deal has been agreed on.

Other points call for the ""return (of) all deported and illegally displaced Ukrainian children,"" the implementation of the minerals deal, and that Ukraine ""will be fully reconstructed and compensated financially,"" including through the use of Russia's frozen assets.

Washington's allies have been voicing growing alarm over the Trump administration's proposed framework to end the war in Ukraine, which would allow Russia to retain seized Ukrainian territory.

Multiple diplomatic sources told CNN that officials in Europe and Asia are bracing for the outcome of renewed U.S.-Russia talks and fear the plan sends a dangerous message.

""If one country in Europe is forced to give up parts of its legal territory... no country in Europe or elsewhere can feel safe, NATO or no NATO,"" one diplomat told CNN.

In high-level meetings held in London on April 23, U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials reportedly made progress in narrowing differences.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Search and rescue operations at the site of a Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on April 24 have ended, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said on April 25.

The attack killed 12 people and injured 87 others, including six children, according to the report.

Thirty-one people remain hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a day earlier.

A series of explosions rocked the capital around 1:00 a.m. local time on April 24, Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported. Additional explosions were later heard around 4 a.m. local time.

Russia launched attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles, the Kyiv City Military Administration said.

""We were at home and there were explosions,"" Maria Rumiantseva, a 40-year-old resident of one of the buildings damaged in the attack, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Then I heard the Shahed. We just went out into the corridor, went to open the door, and that was it — an explosion.""

Klitschko added that six children, as well as a pregnant woman, were among the injured.

Fires were reported in residential buildings, Kyiv City Military Administration chief Tymur Tkachenko said, adding that cars and commercial buildings have been impacted as well. 

Fallen debris was found around the city, Tkachenko added, describing the  attack as ""Russian peace in all its glory.""

The mass attack came just hours after the Kremlin demanded Ukraine's full recognition of Russia's claim over four Ukrainian oblasts it partially occupies, neutral status for Ukraine, and an end to all Western military support.

Earlier on April 23, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace in Ukraine.

Later in the night, Russia launched missiles targeting various regions of the country.

Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also targeted in the ""massive combined strike,"" though Kyiv was hit the hardest, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.

In response to the attack, Poland's Air Force scrambled allied fighter jets to protect the country's own airspace from missiles that may stray into Polish territory.

Russia has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure since the onset of its full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022.

The U.S. has been in talks with Ukraine and Russia to negotiate an end to Russia's war against Ukraine.

Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms.

So far, Moscow has refused.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Ukraine may be forced to temporarily give up some territories to Russia, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in an interview with BBC published on April 25, as U.S. pressure mounts for a peace deal with Moscow. 

""Right now (there are) a lot of conversations about a possible solution. One of the scenarios is... to give up territory. It's not fair. But for peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution. Temporary,"" Klitschko said in a released excerpt of the interview.

He added that Ukrainians would ""never accept occupation"" by Russia.

Klitschko's remarks come amid renewed diplomatic activity following a deadly Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv that killed 12 people and injured almost 90 on April 24. The strike took place just a day after the Kremlin reiterated its demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory and that the West end its military aid to Kyiv.

The Trump administration's latest proposal for ending Russia's all-out war against Ukraine reportedly includes U.S. de jure recognition of Moscow's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its partial occupation of other Ukrainian regions — Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

Klitschko appears to be the first senior Ukrainian politician to suggest that Ukraine may need to consider temporary territorial compromises.

Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine has not received any official proposals for territorial concessions as part of potential peace talks with Russia from the U.S. or other partners. He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv won't recognize occupied territories as Russian.

Despite his popularity abroad, Klitschko faces criticism in Ukraine for his handling of the capital. The Kyiv mayor has had a long-standing conflict with Zelensky. He claims ongoing pressure from government authorities.

Asked whether Zelensky had talked to him about any possible war settlement details, the Kyiv mayor said, ""No.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The CHS oil refinery is silhouetted against the setting sun, on Sept. 28, 2024, in McPherson, Kan.Charlie Riedel/The Canadian Press

The Trump administration has terminated federal employees in charge of U.S. global climate policy and climate aid as part of its reorganization of the State Department, four sources familiar with the notification told Reuters.

The career employees in the Office of Global Change, which came under the State Department's Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, played a lead role in U.S. negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Officials from the office also represented the United States at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and their respective shipping and commercial aviation sectors.

The dismissals come after President Donald Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, as well as from IMO negotiations over decarbonization measures to enable the global shipping industry to reach net-zero emissions by “around 2050″.

The United States belongs to the ICAO and had agreed to participate in the UN agency's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Trump administration, though, has recently objected to ICAO's move to boost sustainable aviation fuel.

It is not clear how or if the United States will continue to participate in these international agreements, or whether some office functions will be folded into other bureaus. The Trump administration has been aggressively rolling back existing U.S. climate policy and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The State Department did not respond to requests for comment.

There are also changes afoot at the State's Bureau of Energy Resources, according to internal documents and a separate source familiar with the situation.

When it opened during the administration of former President Barack Obama, the bureau helped gather support from allies and partners for sanctions on Iran's oil exports. In more recent years the bureau, which has about 80 staffers, has focused on developing critical minerals and oil and gas alternatives and weaning countries off of Russian fossil fuels.

Internal documents reviewed by Reuters said the Bureau of Energy Resources would be absorbed into the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs “to ensure a laserlike focus on expanding and exporting American energy.”

A source familiar with the situation said many staffers working on issues other than critical minerals expect to be laid off in coming days.

Now that the two parties with the only chance of forming the next government have finally released costed platforms, it's possible to reach a conclusion about their commitment to spending 2 per cent of gross domestic product on national defence, the current goal set for all NATO members.

The conclusion? Neither intends to reach it. Not over the next four fiscal years, and perhaps not even by 2030, the arbitrary deadline Liberal Leader Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre both set in their platforms.

Worse yet, that 2-per-cent figure is about to rise, which means the next prime minister of Canada is going to look rather ridiculous when he fails to meet a target that is no longer relevant.

NATO heads of state first agreed to the 2-per-cent goal in 2014, after Russia invaded Crimea. Since then, Russia has launched a second and far more deadly invasion of Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to pull out of NATO and mouthing Kremlin talking points about Russia's illegal war, and China has become more aggressive, eyeing Taiwan and sending ships into the Arctic.

NATO officials are now saying that, in a world where the U.S. is no longer an ally, member states will need to spend as much as 3.5 per cent of their GDP on defence – a goal likely to be approved at an alliance summit in June. 

European NATO members are now rapidly increasing their defence spending. Meanwhile, Canada is way down the list at 1.37 per cent of GDP, according to NATO. It is one of a shrinking number of laggard countries, and soon it could even be running dead last in military spending.

Just to get to 2 per cent, Canada would have to double its NATO-eligible defence spending, which in fiscal 2024-25 is set at $40.1-billion, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. The PBO said last year that Ottawa would need to spend $81.9-billion by 2032 to meet the 2-per-cent NATO goal.

The upshot in this election campaign is that Canada's two main parties have set themselves a defence-spending target they know will likely no longer be relevant in a few months time – and even then they can't hit it.

Canada's national interest needs new energy

Of the two, the Liberals have the higher projections in their platform, with additional defence spending of $30.9-billion over the next four fiscal years, ending in 2028-29. Based on the PBO's estimates, that would leave Canada roughly $10-billion short of the mark. 

The Conservatives, per their own costing, would increase defence spending by $17.4-billion over the same period, $23-billion short of the mark.

This paints a picture of a NATO ally that is hardly more dependable than the United States, but that's apparently not a major concern for either party.

Sure, they talk a good game in their platforms – about increasing recruitment in the Canadian Armed Forces, opening new bases in the North and spending billions on equipment and weaponry.

The Conservatives say they would improve procurement, which in the past has been a bureaucratic basket case, by centralizing it in a single secretariat under one minister. 

The Liberals say they'd create an entire new agency to streamline procurement, and would also establish the “Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Science” (BOREALIS – get it?) to develop weapons and surveillance technology.

But they are both far more interested in giving tax breaks to voters than they are in doing Canada's share in the fight for liberal democracy during dangerous times.

Three of the Conservatives' signature tax cuts in their platform will reduce government revenues by more than $50-billion over the next four fiscal years. 

On the Liberal side, two of their key tax cuts will cost the government $32-billion over the same period.

Canada clearly has the money to show more than rhetorical solidarity with its NATO partners, but the next prime minister would rather stick the cash in voters' pockets than oblige them to make sacrifices in the name of peace, security and democracy.

Under either a Liberal or the Conservative government, a laggard Canada is about to fall even farther behind its NATO allies. When it comes to protecting the free world over the next decade, this country won't even be running in the right race.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event to sign executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, on April 23.Leah Millis/Reuters

Jerry Dias is a retired national president of Unifor and helped in the negotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement in 2018. Jordan Brennan is a former chief economist at Unifor.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise the tariffs he has imposed on Canadian cars yet again. It's part of his crusade against free trade, which he blames for a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States.

But if trade liberalization is the main culprit behind deindustrialization in the U.S., we should expect globe-trotting manufacturing giants such as General Motors GM-N to have shed comparatively fewer jobs than the domestic manufacturing sector, as jobs relocated over borders. The data tell a different story.

GM's global headcount mirrors the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. Both rose steadily from the 1950s through the 1980s before plummeting. Since the 1980s, America has shed nearly seven million manufacturing jobs – one in three. GM's global work force shrank a whopping 82 per cent over the same period, though its annual output per worker soared from seven vehicles in the 1980s to 38 by 2023 – an astonishing 500-per-cent-plus increase in productivity.

That's not the result of offshoring, but rather automation. The White House understands this but is putting politics before facts.

This raises an ominous question: Are the tariffs a short-term ploy to win better trade terms or a long-term strategy to repatriate industry, raise revenue and fund tax cuts? We fear the latter. If so, Mr. Trump's tariffs are a predatory, zero-sum policy. America can only “win” if other countries lose. That includes Canada, whose auto industry is caught in the crosshairs.

Our next federal government must make it clear that Canada will not surrender its auto industry. Industry executives are nervous and need assurances that Canada will not forfeit its share of North American auto production without a fight.

We must start with the “soft,” prototypically Canadian approach that is patient diplomacy. On its own, Canada is unable to inflict enough damage on the U.S. to pose a credible threat. We account for less than 2 per cent of new vehicle sales globally, which means the countertariffs imposed by Ottawa will have a minimal impact on the U.S. What's more, countertariffs hurt Canadian consumers and mirror the self-defeating logic of Mr. Trump's approach.

If Canada can offer Mr. Trump a few symbolic “wins,” like paying more into NATO, phasing out supply management and partnering on critical minerals – things we should be doing anyway – we might defuse the situation constructively.

There is a more muscular option in keeping with the Trump playbook, however, which we keep in our pocket but should not be afraid to use: escalation.

To be sure, there is danger in this more aggressive approach. Escalation can spiral out of control, as the tariff war between the U.S. and China has made clear. In teaching the White House about this law, Canada must diligently avoid having its response backfire. 

But in conflict situations, escalation is tactically useful because it pushes the parties toward resolution.

To that end, Canada should form strong alliances with Mexico, the U.K. and Europe, which are also frustrated with Washington's actions.

Part of the strategy targets American public opinion. GM and Ford don't assemble vehicles in Canada because America is “subsidizing” Canada, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed. They do so because it's efficient. Factoring in exchange rates, health insurance costs in the U.S. and productivity, Canada is more competitive than the U.S. If Mr. Trump succeeds in forcing production south, American consumers will be left with the most expensive cars ever built. Do Trump voters want to spend more on their next vehicle?

There's another card to play in this more aggressive plan. The North American auto industry is tightly integrated. If Canada and Mexico seal their borders, restricting the export of critical auto parts, U.S. assembly lines would be instantly crippled. This would yield two results: First, no imports would mean no tariff revenue from auto parts, so no money to fund Mr. Trump's tax cuts; second, the very workers who elected Mr. Trump will be laid off – something they didn't vote for.

Mr. Trump will have inspired a united attack on the U.S. economy, sending his tariff policy into disarray and alienating the very people who delivered the White House to him. This more aggressive approach has the benefit of tacit support from the auto industry, too, which does not want to cede managerial control over production decisions to the White House.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Fact check: Fake videos falsely linked to Turkey earthquake","https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-fake-videos-falsely-linked-to-turkey-earthquake/a-72336047","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 11:18:33 GMT","

Numerous videos purporting to show the moment Istanbul was struck by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake are circulating online. However, many of them are fake. A DW fact check.

Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, was hit by a strong earthquake on Wednesday. Over 150 people were injured when they jumped or attempted to jump from buildings, Istanbul's governor Davut Gul said, adding that ""their injuries were not life-threatening"" and nobody had died in the quake.

Following events like this, images and videos begin to circulate on social media — content creators are eager to gain views and increase their number of followers. However, a study shows that misinformation during and after natural disasters often leads to panic and hinders effective disaster management.

DW's research shows that many videos circulating online following the earthquake in Turkey do not depict the recent event. Here are three examples. 

Claim: This viral TikTok video shows a torn-up street, destroyed buildings and a collapsed bridge. The text in the video reads ""Turkey 6.2,"" while the caption states, ""large earthquake hits off the coast of Turkey."" This suggests the video is related to the latest earthquake on April 23.

DW fact check: Fake 

This video is AI-generated, evident when looking closely at several details. For instance, at the beginning of the video, on the left-hand side, the top of a streetlamp appears and then disappears, while the people at the bottom of the video do not move at all. Seconds later, a man on the left, purportedly standing in front of a collapsed building, can be seen with a blurry arm that vanishes and then reappears.

Additionally, the creator marked the video as being AI-generated, which many viewers overlooked. Comments such as ""Is it real?,"" ""Pray for Turkey,"" and ""Stay strong Turkey"" suggest that users believe the footage to be authentic.

In breaking news situations, such as natural disasters, it's common for AI-generated videos to almost immediately begin circulating online. DW's fact-checking team observed similar patterns after the earthquake in Myanmar and Thailand earlier this year.

Claim: This video allegedly shows the dramatic collapse of a tall building in Istanbul, with many people running away. The caption says it depicts the earthquake in Istanbul, and the video was posted on April 23. Less than 24 hours after the quake, it had garnered over 5 million views. 

DW fact check: False



More than 3,000 people commented on the video, with many believing it depicts the latest earthquake in Istanbul. However, that is not the case. A reverse image search shows that the video dates back to February 6, 2023. Back then, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey and Syria. The epicenter was close to the Syrian border. More than 56,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. 
In the 2023 disaster many buildings crumbled to dust, raising concerns about construction safety standards.

Claim: ""My deepest condolences to the people of Turkey after the devastating earthquake in Istanbul. I stand with all those affected by this tragedy. Sending thoughts and prayers to the families who lost loved ones and to everyone impacted. Stay strong, Turkey,"" a user posted on X, sharing a bird's-eye view photo which shows many collapsed buildings.

DW fact check: False

A reverse image search confirms that the image is not related to the recent earthquake in Istanbul. Instead, it dates back to the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023. The earliest found search result traces the image to February 6, 2023. It shows destroyed buildings in Hatay, a southern Turkish province bordering Syria.

Following the earthquake in Turkey, misleading, fake and outdated content has spread rapidly online. With ongoing aftershocks in Istanbul, further false claims and images are likely to surface.

Owens's departure comes amid a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the company from President Donald Trump.

Bill Owens, the executive producer for CBS News's “60 Minutes” program, announced earlier this week that he would be stepping down from his position as the company moves to encroach on the show's journalistic independence.

Owens — only the third person to hold the role in the show's 57-year history — had been the executive producer of “60 Minutes” since 2019. His departure comes as the company has increasingly overseen the program's editorial decision-making, despite its tradition of being independent of the network. It also comes amid a multi-billion dollar lawsuit by President Donald Trump dubiously alleging that CBS News had wronged him as a candidate by making edits to an interview with then-Democratic candidate for president Kamala Harris. 

Owens announced his resignation to staff in a memo that was obtained by The New York Times, portions of which the newspaper printed. 

“Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,' right for the audience,” Owens said in the memo, adding:

Having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.

Owens also met with staff in an in-person meeting on Tuesday to announce his departure. Tearing up and noting the moves that CBS executives were making to hamper the program's independence, Owens told those who attended that it was “clear the company is done with me.” He then called the company's actions a “slippery slope” toward further capitulation to those who threatened the show's integrity.

In addition to moves relating to Trump's lawsuit against the company — initially a $10 billion suit, now a $20 billion suit that many legal experts have said is not going anywhere — the editorial independence of “60 Minutes” has also been threatened by Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, who is looking to sell the company to Skydance, which is owned by billionaire Larry Ellison. Such a sale would have to garner approval from the Trump administration.

Redstone complained about the editorial direction of the program in January, when it aired a segment that was critical of Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump White House has made clear that it is the policy of the administration to punish individuals and institutions that express opposition to the U.S.'s role in the slaughter. 

Amid this lawsuit and other actions by corporate media to yield to Trump, Truthout's board president and editor-at-large Maya Schenwar, editor-in-chief Negin Owliaei, and executive director Ziggy West Jeffery authored an op-ed calling for movement media to oppose the administration's authoritarianism and uplift voices suppressed by the White House.

“Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit,” the trio wrote in their op-ed, adding:

[Movement media] have a responsibility to remind people of what we have lost, and what we could still win. We highlight any potential footholds that might stabilize us as we move toward a more just world.

“As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations — either through need or greed — rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump's wishes even before his inauguration, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. … Journalism is just one tool in the anti-fascist toolbox,” they continued. “Those of us who create it must take seriously how our responsibilities intersect with and uplift the other tools that will, together, enable people to effectively organize against authoritarianism.”



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Democratic lawmakers are also working to expand the state's sanctuary law to penalize companies for working with ICE.

This story was originally published by ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Connecticut's attorney general has sent his second warning in a month to the low-cost carrier Avelo Airlines, telling the startup it has jeopardized tax breaks and other local support by agreeing to conduct deportation flights for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Democrats in the Connecticut legislature, meanwhile, are working to expand the state's sanctuary law to penalize companies like Avelo for working with federal immigration authorities.

The backlash comes after Texas-based Avelo signed an agreement early this month to dedicate three of its 20 planes to carrying out deportation flights as part of the charter network known as ICE Air. It also follows a report by ProPublica, which Connecticut Attorney General William Tong cited in an April 8 letter to Avelo, revealing flight attendants' unease over the treatment and safety of detainees on such flights. The concerns airline staffers raised included how difficult it could be to evacuate people wearing wrist and ankle shackles.

“Can Avelo confirm that it will never operate flights while non-violent passengers are in shackles, handcuffs, waist chains and/or leg irons?” Tong's April 8 letter asks. “Can Avelo confirm that it will never operate a flight without a safe and timely evacuation strategy for all passengers?”

Tong then issued a public statement on April 15 reiterating his concerns.

In an April 3 email to Avelo employees obtained by ProPublica and other publications, CEO Andrew Levy called the deportation contract “too valuable not to pursue” at a time when his startup was losing money and consumer confidence was declining, leading Americans to take fewer trips. Avelo would close one of its bases, in Sonoma County, California, and move certain flight routes to off-peak days as resources shifted to ICE Air. Deportation flights would be based out of Mesa, Arizona, and would begin in May.

Avelo has a major hub in New Haven, Connecticut, and it recently expanded to Bradley International Airport near Hartford. In 2023, the airline won a two-year fuel-tax moratorium from state lawmakers after extensive lobbying.

Last Thursday, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal was among the nearly 300 attendees at a rally outside the New Haven airport. “Avelo has to change its course,” he said. “To the president of Avelo: You really stepped in it.”

Members of the public are raising objections as well. An online petition calling for a boycott of Avelo unless it drops its new ICE contract has collected almost 35,000 signatures since April 6. And protests are spreading from Connecticut to cities the airline serves across the country, including Eugene, Oregon; Rochester, New York; Burbank, California; and Wilmington, Delaware.

Tong's letter to Avelo demanded that the airline produce a copy of its ICE Air contract. The attorney general also asked if Avelo would deport people in defiance of court orders, pointing to March flights to El Salvador carried out by another charter airline, GlobalX, after a federal judge ordered that the planes be turned back. Neither ICE nor GlobalX responded to ProPublica's requests for comment.

Levy answered Tong with a one-page letter. In it, Levy suggested that if Connecticut wanted more information about Avelo's ICE Air contract, it should file a public records request. (Federal statistics show that such requests to ICE typically take months or years to be answered.)

If the attorney general wanted to know more about the use of shackles on deportation flights, Levy continued, he should ask the Department of Homeland Security. If Tong wanted to know more about evacuation requirements, he should address questions to the Federal Aviation Administration. For Avelo's part, Levy assured Tong, the airline “remains committed to public safety and the rule of law.”

“Regardless of the administration or party affiliation,” an Avelo spokesperson told ProPublica in an emailed statement, “when our country calls our practice is to say yes. We follow all protocols from DHS and FAA.”

A Democrat-sponsored bill to expand Connecticut's sanctuary law has now cleared its House Judiciary Committee in a 29-12, party-line vote, over the strong objections of Republicans, and awaits a full vote on the floor. If it passes, any companies — including airlines — proposing to do business with the state must pledge not to “cooperate or contract with any federal immigration authority for purposes of the detention, holding or transportation of an individual.”

Meanwhile, Avelo's fuel-tax moratorium expires on June 30. So far, no legislation has been introduced to extend it, and activists are urging Connecticut lawmakers to let the tax break die.



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Rejecting Trump's authoritarian “new normal” means preserving the evidence that things weren't always this way.

One of the defining features of Donald Trump's second term is an aggressive drive to control the narrative, in part by burying inconvenient evidence. A key example is his regime's multi-pronged assault on federal data infrastructure and independent institutions that safeguard public knowledge. In just its first hundred days, Trump's regime has laid siege to federal data agencies, eliminated or drastically overhauled key reports, ceased collecting crucial information, and pressured scientists and statisticians to alter findings that conflict with the Trumpian political narrative.

These attacks on government statistics pose a threat to democratic accountability, one that will unmoor demands for change by making it harder for the public to keep track of how much the goalposts have moved and how much damage is currently occurring. Trump's approach is notably distinct from that of previous administrations; while US politicians have long attempted to spin and cherry-pick data to suit their political ends, Trump has sought to erase information that does not fit his agenda. This authoritarian approach to government data is incompatible with a functioning democracy.

The US Census Bureau, already hollowed out by years of underfunding, has faced deeper hiring freezes and staffing cuts under Trump's second term. These cuts threaten to slow field operations, delay key releases, and reduce oversight for data accuracy. Trump officials have also eschewed subject matter expertise by disbanding many of the Census Bureau's outside advisory committees. Even more alarmingly, the Trump regime has brazenly disregarded privacy norms in its attempts to weaponize government data against immigrants. The harmful new precedents jeopardize the efforts of federal surveyors who rely on public trust to maintain adequate response rates.

The Trump regime has further burdened federal statistical agencies with a reality-denying executive order targeting (nebulously defined) diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. The directive is premised on denying the actual diversity of the United States, and requires that products be quickly brought into compliance or scrubbed altogether. In addition to undermining data reliability and veracity, the new restrictions put additional strain on the underfunded and understaffed skeleton crews struggling to keep things afloat. Trump's insistence on restoring something like Jim Crow in federal data products is awful in its own right. Compliance with his directive also diverts time and resources from mission-critical work, further hollowing out the government's capacity to serve the public.

Efforts to comply with the Trump regime's war on “DEI” meant that, for example, parts of the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) — a critical dataset used to track economic and demographic shifts across the US — were temporarily taken offline early in Trump's second term. Codebooks for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a vital longitudinal dataset that tracks how working-class families use public assistance, were also made unavailable. Public access to multiple health datasets was temporarily suspended, along with summary pages that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produces in part to guide medical practitioners. The unannounced purge left researchers scrambling to locate archived copies of datasets, while health care workers struggled to advise patients in the absence of once-reliable sources of information.

Enter the Internet Archive, a nonprofit digital library that has played a critical role in preserving government websites, federal reports, and public communications from previous administrations. Among the Internet Archive's key products is the Wayback Machine, which scrapes and preserves websites in a way that allows users to track site changes and retrieve information that has been removed. The Wayback Machine also accepts user submissions, meaning researchers who had already downloaded missing datasets could make them available to others. Amid the alarming series of dataset removals and alterations early in Trump's second term, the Internet Archive took on renewed importance in preserving data access and institutional memory.

This makes the latest maneuver by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — an Orwellianly named group of government saboteurs — all the more egregious. DOGE has once again supplanted Congress' power of the purse, this time to slash funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), including by rescinding already-awarded grants. Among the casualties is the Internet Archive, which was midway through a $345,960 NEH-funded project to preserve access to historic government publications and web records. DOGE's legally dubious defunding jeopardizes one of the final lines of defense against authoritarian memory-holing. As such, it's hard not to conclude that the Archive is being targeted because its effectiveness makes it an obstacle to the Trump regime's project of strategic erasure. After all, this is the same Trump who has impugned the integrity of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, implying that their standard revisions meant that their US employment estimates were fraudulent.

Deciding what gets measured, and how frequently those measurements are updated, are always political choices – if nothing else then because implementing those decisions uses finite resources. And politicians across the spectrum have presented data in ways that align with their policy goals. During the Biden administration, for example, public health advocates expressed concern when the CDC quietly recalibrated its cutoffs for “high”, “medium”, and “low” levels of COVID-19 in wastewater. Crucially, however, Biden's CDC preserved public access to the underlying data so researchers and watchdogs could still see the full picture, making it possible to challenge the official narrative using a shared set of facts.

Trump's conduct during his second term is different in kind from that of the Biden administration and others before it. Trump's strategy has not been to spin or cherry-pick, but to erase inconvenient facts altogether. To do so, Trump has impugned the neutrality of the data and the integrity of career public servants, and his regime has circumvented Congress to gut public access to public information. Some have noted that the Trump regime's actions are curiously out of sync with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint that appears to be shaping some of Trump's second-term agenda. But viewed through the lens of an insecure authoritarian who doesn't want to take chances with the truth, Donald Trump's behavior makes perfect sense. It's familiar territory for a man who attempted to rewrite the results of the 2020 presidential election — an election he continues to falsely insist he won.

The sabotage of data infrastructure is a form of epistemic control. If there is no record of how things were before, it becomes far easier to accept today's reality as how things have always been. Devoid of context, things like economic contraction, climate disaster, erosion of public health, and ballooning inequality become unpleasant but inexplicable, rather than results of deliberate policy choices. Rejecting Trump's authoritarian new normal means preserving the evidence that things weren't always this way — and continuing to collect the data that makes it possible to track, understand, and challenge what comes next. That means safeguarding the information and the people that this regime is trying to disappear.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

The Department of Government Efficiency said on April 24 that records for millions of recipients aged 120 or older have been updated as part of a “major cleanup” at the Social Security Administration (SSA).

Another 1.4 million records are expected to be updated within two weeks, the post stated. DOGE previously reported on March 18 that 3.2 million records had been marked as deceased.

A chart shared by DOGE on Thursday showed that more than 2.7 million records of people aged 120 to 129 have been removed over the past several weeks. More than 3.4 million accounts belonging to individuals aged 130 to 139 were removed, and more than 3.3 million records of individuals aged 140 to 149 were marked as deceased.

Another 1.3 million accounts of people aged 150 to 159 were also removed this month, the chart showed. In total, 10,926,833 accounts were marked as deceased, according to the chart.

The tech entrepreneur posted on social media platform X a screenshot of a federal database showing that more than 12 million Social Security recipients were listed as older than 120.

Two of the individuals listed on the database were marked as in the age ranges of 240–249 and 360–369. More than a thousand people on the database were listed as being in the age range of 220–229.

“According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to false!” Musk wrote. “Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.”

From 2015 to 2022, SSA paid almost $8.6 trillion in benefits and made approximately $71.8 billion, or 0.84 percent, in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, according to the report.

The report noted that improper payments have been a “longstanding challenge” for the SSA and that, while the agency has taken actions to address this challenge, “there is more it needs to do.”

“Without better access to data, increased automation, systems modernization, and policy or legislative changes, improper payments will continue to be an issue into the future,” the report stated.

According to the survey, since 2020, 24,500 individuals above the age of 115 have claimed a total of $59 million in unemployment benefits, while 28,000 claimants between the ages of 1 and 5 have received $254 million in benefits.

A further 9,700 people with birth dates more than 15 years in the future were paid $69 million in benefits, DOGE stated.

Individuals who fraudulently collect unemployment benefits face a fine of no less than 15 percent of the amount of the fraudulent payment.

Additional penalties under state unemployment insurance laws may also include criminal prosecution with fines and/or incarceration and permanent loss of eligibility for unemployment compensation.

Follow:


            The United States and Iran are set to begin a third round of nuclear talks this weekend, entering what experts describe as a more difficult phase of technical negotiations as Washington lays out its conditions.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the US does not envision Iran enriching its own nuclear material, but rather importing the nuclear fuel – uranium – needed for a civilian energy program. Iran has repeatedly stated that its right to enrich uranium is non-negotiable.
    


            Both the US and Iran have described previous talks as positive, despite President Donald Trump's threat of US and Israeli military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites should Tehran fail to accept a deal.
    


            But Saturday's talks may prove more complex, as they are set to involve negotiations on the details of Iran's nuclear program, an area where Tehran and Washington remain sharply divided.
    


            Here's what we know.
    


            A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US, under which Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy.

            Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 deal allowed Iran to enrich uranium at a level that ensured that its nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful.
    


            That agreement was abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by advancing its uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is needed to make a bomb.
    


            Iran insists its nuclear program remains peaceful.
    


            Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, making it clear that Iran had a two-month deadline to agree to a new deal, a source familiar with the letter's contents told CNN.
    


            The president has said that he wants a “stronger” deal with Iran than the one reached in 2015 under the Obama administration, but US officials have flip-flopped on their demands over the past month.
    


            In its bid to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, it remains unclear whether the US is demanding a full dismantling of its nuclear program – including its civilian energy component – or whether it would allow such a program if Iran abandons domestic uranium enrichment.
    


            This month, Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy to the Iran talks, said there's no need for Iran to enrich uranium beyond what is needed for a nuclear energy program. He stopped short of demanding that Iran stop enriching uranium altogether or dismantle its nuclear program.
    


            He reversed his position a day later in a statement on X in which he said any final deal with Iran would require it to “stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.”
    


            US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meanwhile has called on Tehran to fully dismantle its nuclear program.
    


            Then, in an interview on Wednesday, Rubio said that Iran could have a civilian nuclear program but it would have to import the nuclear fuel needed rather than produce it domestically.
    

""There is a high degree of mistrust and time is too short. So I think it's warranted to have a note of cautiousness, in addition to optimism,” Ali Vaez, Director of Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, tells Becky Anderson on the U.S.-Iran talks.

            “There's a pathway to a civil, peaceful nuclear program if they want one,” Rubio told The Free Press. “But if they insist on enriching (uranium), then they will be the only country in the world that doesn't have a ‘weapons program,' but is enriching. And so, I think that's problematic.”
    


            While most countries that enrich uranium domestically also have a nuclear weapons program, others don't. Brazil, for instance, enriches some uranium domestically for its energy program, according to World Nuclear Association. Meanwhile, the British-German-Dutch nuclear fuel consortium Urenco operates enrichment plants in Germany and The Netherlands, neither of which has nuclear weapons. Those countries, like Iran, are party to the United Nations' Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
    


            Last week, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told The New York Times in Saudi Arabia that Riyadh and Washington were on a “pathway” to reaching an agreement that could see the kingdom enrich uranium.
    


            “The issue is control of sensitive technology. Are there solutions to that that involve enrichment here in Saudi Arabia? Yes,” he said.
    


            Iran has doubled down on its right to enrich uranium and has accused the Trump administration of sending mixed signals.
    


            “Iran's enrichment (program) is a real and genuine matter, and we are ready to build trust regarding potential concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is representing Iran at the nuclear talks, was cited as saying by the state-run Iranian broadcaster Press TV.

            Tehran has laid out its “red lines” in talks, including “threatening language” by the Trump administration and “excessive demands regarding Iran's nuclear program.” The US must also refrain from raising issues relating to Iran's defense industry, Iranian media said, likely referring to its ballistic missile program, which the US' Middle Eastern allies see as a threat to their security.
    


            Meanwhile, Iran's highest leadership has approached the talks with extreme caution. In his first comments on the issue, Khamenei said that Tehran was “neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic” about the negotiations with the US.
    


            The Islamic Republic has also tried to present a potential nuclear deal as beneficial to the US. This week, Araghchi touted the possibility of US companies playing a role in Iran's nuclear energy program, promising “tens of billions of dollars in potential contracts.”
    


            Alongside high-level talks between Araghchi and Witkoff Saturday, technical teams will begin to hammer out the details of a potential agreement.
    


            Michael Anton, the State Department's head of policy planning, will head the technical team from the US side, spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Thursday.
    


            The team will consist of roughly 12 working-level experts from various US government agencies and discuss more granular details about a path to a new nuclear agreement, such as potential sanctions relief and limitations on Iran's nuclear program, a source familiar told CNN.
    


            Technical talks are “challenging” as they will try to address issues that were not pursued in the 2015 deal, said Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Washington DC-based Quincy Institute. “This requires technical expertise to make sure these different ideas actually can become feasible.”
    


            As well as the issue of enrichment, complications may emerge if “poison pills” are introduced, including a demand to fully dismantle Iran's nuclear program, “Libya-style,” as Israel has pushed for, he added.
    


            Libya in 2003 dismantled its nuclear program in the hopes of ushering in a new era of relations with the US after its two-decade oil embargo on Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
    


            After relinquishing its nuclear program, Libya descended into civil war following a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Gadhafi's regime and led to his killing. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be rejected from the outset.

            Another hurdle could surface if the US demands that restrictions on Iran's nuclear program “be in perpetuity,” Parsi said. “Meaning, this would not be like normal arms control agreements, (where) restrictions are time-limited and over time expire.”
    


            The 2015 deal had an expiration date, ending in October 2025 unless otherwise decided by the United Nations Security Council.
    


            When he pulled out of the deal in 2018, Trump lambasted the agreement's 10-year time limit, saying that even “if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time.”
    


            Parsi said there may be an opportunity to extend the timeline. “But anything that pushes toward infinitive and in perpetuity restrictions is very likely going to fail, and perhaps by design.”
    


            Israel has been among the staunchest advocates for Iran to fully dismantle its nuclear program so it can never acquire a nuclear bomb.
    


            Sources familiar with the matter had previously told CNN that news of the US-Iran nuclear talks were “certainly not” to Israel's liking, and it remains unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the negotiations or if he was consulted.
    


            The only deal that Netanyahu would view as acceptable is a Libya-style nuclear deal.
    


The New York Times reported last week that Trump had waved Israel off striking Iran's nuclear sites as soon as next month to let talks with Tehran play out. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office did not deny the veracity of the article, instead asserting that Israel's actions have delayed Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Responding to the report, Trump said: “I wouldn't say waved off,” but “I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death.”

            Pope Francis never returned to his native Argentina after he became head of the Roman Catholic Church. But some of the faithful here believe he sent a final message home, in the unlikeliest but perhaps most appropriate of ways.
    


            Francis was a lifelong soccer fan — and occasional youth goalkeeper — and a card-carrying member of his favorite club, San Lorenzo.
    


            And it's the number on that card that's become the talk of Buenos Aires.
    


            “It has to be destiny,” said Ramiro Rodríguez, who arrived wearing a rosary over his team shirt at a small chapel that's the spiritual birthplace of the club, for a Mass to celebrate the life of Francis.
    


            The number that's causing the stir is assigned to “regular member” Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Pope's birth name: 88235.
    


            And as person after person has pointed out, Francis was 88 when he died, at 2:35 a.m. Argentina time on Easter Monday.
    


            For Rodríguez, it was another otherworldly, even divine, connection.
    


            “I went to the Vatican in 2019 and I wore my San Lorenzo (jersey), of course,” Rodríguez, 23, said. “I didn't see him, but I knew he was there with all his energy and healing the world and that's very significant to me.”
    


            In a preface the late Pope contributed for an upcoming book by Cardinal Angelo Scola, he left an eloquent message about ageing and dying. “Death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something,” he wrote.
    


            Talking to those who knew him well, it seems likely he would also have appreciated the warmth and good nature of the desire to see a meaning in his soccer club membership number.
    


            Omar Abboud knew how quick-witted his friend he still knew as Jorge was and how much he enjoyed a joke, but never at anyone else's expense.
    


            “He has a different kind of humor,” Abboud said of the Pope, “a kind of joke that was with the people, not over the people. He has an intelligent, smart humor.”

            Abboud, a prominent Muslim leader in Argentina, formed The Institute of Interreligious Dialogue with then-Cardinal Bergoglio and Rabbi Daniel Goldman in 2002. They visited each other's communities and regularly held meetings and public exchanges to break down barriers between faith groups.
    


            Abboud said he last visited the Pope in January, when the two spoke of artificial intelligence and how it could be regulated. He said he learned much from his friend Jorge and their discussions about literature and sacred texts. And he's just beginning to talk about him in the past tense.
    


            “He used to be a good friend, we need him. Really, words are not enough,” he said, his voice trailing off.
    


            Francis is on the minds of everyone we meet — from his friends to people who admired him from afar, to those to whom he had ministered.
    


            Flowers and messages are left in tribute at his childhood home, a square where he once played kickabout with other kids, and the church where he heard the call from God to join the priesthood. That church, the Basílica de San José de Flores, has an engraving marking the date when Francis received his vocation, while in the confessional — September 21, 1953.
    


            So many candles have been burned to honor Francis that the steps of the Metropolitan Cathedral are covered with wax.

In pictures: The world reacts to Pope Francis' death



            Seven days of official mourning were declared to honor Francis in Argentina, but they won't all be filled with sadness.
    


            The Mass held at San Lorenzo's chapel ended more as a pep rally and there will be another crowd for the soccer team's next match on Saturday, a few hours after Francis is laid to rest in Rome.
    


            The team will wear commemorative jerseys to honor the late pontiff, and there is talk a new stadium will bear the name “Papa Francisco.” In a sign of his humility, Francis once wrote he didn't much like that idea.
    


            A Swiss Guardsman used to keep Francis updated on match scores and San Lorenzo's progress by leaving notes on his desk; the Pope has said he had not watched television — barring seismic events like 9/11 — since 1990.
    


            Francis said his love for sport was not only for the competition — and San Lorenzo is only one of several teams in soccer-mad Buenos Aires, the capital of soccer-mad Argentina, whose men are the current World Cup champions — but for the participation.
    


            He believed sports, especially team games, get young people away from their screens and shuttered virtual lives and teach them to be out in the world.
    


            The club may have lost Regular Member 88235 but Buenos Aires will remember him.

            A homemade flag at the cathedral linked Francis and San Lorenzo with a simple phrase that seems to apply to Buenos Aires today: “Mis Dos Amores,” my two loves.
    


            Francis reciprocated that love, writing in his book “Hope:” “My homeland, for which I continue to feel just the same great, profound love. The people for whom I pray every day, who formed me, who trained and then offered me to others. My people.”
    


            In Flores, the working-class neighborhood where Francis lived and worked, a woman left a note outside his childhood home.
    


            It read: “You were one of us — an Argentine — and a gift to the world.”

            California has surpassed Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom said, as he warned of the threat posed by President Donald Trump's tariffs to the tech powerhouse's fast-growing wealth.
    


            The Golden State's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) reached $4.1 trillion in 2024, according to preliminary data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, edging past Japan's $4.02 trillion nominal GDP in the same period as recorded by the International Monetary Fund.



            That means only the United States, China and Germany have larger economies than California, which outpaced all three countries with growth of 6% last year, according to the release.
    


            “California isn't just keeping pace with the world — we're setting the pace,” Newsom said in a news release Wednesday. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability and believe in the power of innovation.”
    


            But Newsom also warned that the state's economic prowess is being threatened by “the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.”
    


            “California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected,” he said.
    


            California, America's most populous state with some 40 million people, accounted for 14% of the nation's GDP in 2024, according to government data, driven by Silicon Valley and its real estate and finance sectors.
    


            Last week, Newsom sued Trump over his use of emergency powers to unilaterally enact sweeping global tariffs, which the governor said had hurt Californian families and businesses.
    


            The lawsuit, filed in federal court on April 16, argues that Trump lacks the authority to enact tariffs against Mexico, China and Canada, or a 10% baseline tariff on imports from the rest of the world.
    


            These tariffs, Newsom said in a news release announcing the suit, are creating “immediate and irreparable harm to California, the largest economy, manufacturing, and agriculture state in the nation,” as they “have disrupted supply chains, inflated costs” and “inflicted billions in damages” on the state.
    


            The lawsuit argues that Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to enact tariffs was “unlawful and unprecedented,” and that such expansive action requires approval from Congress.
    


            Through the IEEPA, Congress in 1977 granted the president broad authority to impose sanctions on countries, export controls, regulate financial transactions and freeze foreign assets under national emergency declaration, but it requires the Executive to consult and report to Congress when exercising these powers.
    


            California engaged in nearly $675 billion of two-way trade in 2024, and counts Mexico, Canada and China as its top three trade partners, according to the state. Over 40% of Californian imports came from these countries, accounting for $203 billion of its more than $491 billion in total imports last year.
    


            Twelve more states sued the Trump administration Wednesday for “illegally imposing” tax hikes on Americans through tariffs in a lawsuit the White House called a “witch hunt.”

            The head of the US National Science Foundation, a $9 billion agency charged with advancing discoveries across the scientific spectrum, resigned Thursday amid sweeping changes spearheaded by the current Trump administration.
    


            NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan has led the agency since he was selected by President Donald Trump during his first term and unanimously confirmed by the Senate in June 2020.
    


            “I believe I have done all I can to advance the critical mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan said in parting remarks, which were provided to CNN on Thursday by an agency spokesperson.
    


            The director's departure comes as the National Science Foundation is grappling with demands from the new Trump administration and DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, an effort established in January to slash government spending.
    


            “This is a pivotal moment for our nation in terms of global competitiveness,” Panchanathan said in the statement. “NSF is an extremely important investment to make U.S. scientific dominance a reality. We must not lose our competitive edge.”
    


            The federal agency announced earlier this month that it would cancel hundreds of grants totaling more than $230 million. The terminations included — but were not limited to — research related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and misinformation/disinformation,” according to information released by the NSF.
    


            The Trump administration issued a series of executive orders earlier this year demanding federal agencies cease activities related to promoting DEI.
    


            The canceled grants included those titled with phrases such as “Racial Equity in STEM,” “Antiracist Teacher Leadership” and “Advancing Gender Equity in Computing.”

            But the list also included other topics, such as the “Spread of Unsubstantiated Information” and “Addressing Vaccine Information Integrity.”
    


            In a post about the canceled grants, the NSF said that the misinformation research funding was halted to comply with Trump's January 20 executive order on “restoring freedom of speech.”
    


            The agency said it does “not support research with the goal of combating ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' and ‘malinformation' that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advances a preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.”
    


            The changes have prompted backlash from various research organizations and stakeholders.
    


            In response to the executive orders and other internal changes at NSF, some of which have taken place since DOGE arrived in mid-April, researchers have been asked to ensure funding requests comply with shifting directives.
    


            That guidance has put scientists in the “middle of a political tug-of-war, wasting valuable time and resources,” according to an April 24 statement from the Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences.
    


            “NSF has a tested process for evaluating the intellectual merit and the broader impact of proposed investigations and FABBS encourages NSF to honor it,” the federation's statement reads.

            The National Science Foundation may also face sweeping cuts to its roughly 1,500-person workforce, echoing how DOGE has demanded a reduction in force, or RIF, across numerous federal agencies.
    


            The NSF was established in 1950 and is tasked with evaluating the scientific merit of grant requests and doling out dollars — mostly to universities and other research institutions — to advance scientists' understanding of a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence and the fundamental workings of the cosmos.

Days after his death, the memory of Pope Francis remains vivid in the places he used to visit personally. Some of them—tailors, opticians, and ice cream makers—became acquaintances, almost friends, of the Argentine pontiff after years of loyal service. (AP video shot by Silvia Stellacci)

VATICAN CITY (AP) — In the streets around the Vatican, where Pope Francis used to make impromptu outings, some of the shopkeepers are mourning the man they knew, not as the leader of a church or head of state, but as an ordinary person. They prayed for him while he was hospitalized, and now they miss him dearly.

“He had been our regular customer for more than seven years,” said Sebastian Padrón, an Argentine ice cream maker whose store is located around the corner from Francis' austere hotel room in Vatican City. He recalled how close he and his family felt to Francis, who often gave gifts to his children. 

“The memory is wonderful, which is why it hurts so much,” he told The Associated Press on Thursday. Francis had a notorious sweet tooth, and Padrón's dulce de leche ice cream, a typical Argentine caramel dessert, became the pope's favorite.

When Francis became pope in 2013, he opted to live in the Domus Santa Marta hotel rather than the lavish papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace, overlooking St. Peter's Square. The choice spoke to his aversion to luxury, and an eagerness to mix with the masses. He moved around Rome in an ordinary hatchback and popped into stores to buy shoe insoles, change eyeglass lenses and buy recordings of classical music and tango from his native Argentina. He had lamented his inability to walk about freely as he did in Buenos Aires. 

“I met a man who was full of smiles, very friendly,” said Raniero Mancinelli, a Roman tailor who sold the basic pectoral cross that Francis wore for decades. Mancinelli, who was tailor to the last three popes, said that, unlike his predecessors, Francis wanted everything to be simple, practical and inexpensive. 




Mancinelli said he sold Francis a cardinal's sash before the conclave that eventually elected him pope. He recalled Francis' words upon learning the price of the garment:

“Raniero, you're a bit of a thief, you're a bit expensive.” The rest of his scarlet cardinal's outfit, Francis regularly said, was a hand-me-down from his predecessor as archbishop of Buenos Aires.

Francis caused havoc among tourists and Romans several times when he showed up at an optician's shop in Rome's historic center.

Luca Spiezia, who owns the store with his father, remembered his surprise at the pope introducing himself simply as “Francesco” when they met in 2015. Offered a new pair of glasses, Francis declined, asking only for new lenses in his old frames and insisting on paying for the work.

“He never made you feel that he was a powerful figure in the world, even though he was the head of the church,” Spiezia said. “I hope that this will be continuing with the next pope.”

AP's Julia Frankel explains what's been happening in the West Bank territory.

After the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the devastating war in Gaza, a deadly new reality also took hold for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

With the world's attention focused on Gaza, Israeli military operations in the West Bank grew in size, frequency and intensity. The army launched the stepped-up campaign to counter what it says is a growing militant threat.

Here's a look at where things stand, with data collected by the U.N.'s humanitarian office and Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement tracking group.

Since the war in Gaza erupted, the majority of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank have been shot during military raids in villages and towns.




Israel says the operations are needed to stamp out militancy. Many of the dead were militants killed in clashes, or youths throwing stones or firebombs.

But Palestinians and rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have been caught in the crossfire. Of those killed since the Hamas attack, at least 182 have been children under 18, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, some of whom Israel says were involved in stone-throwing and militancy. Rights groups accuse Israel of using excessive force.




Israel is staging a massive offensive across four major refugee camps in the north of the West Bank. The raids, at their height, pushed 40,000 people from their homes. Many are now sheltering with relatives in neighboring villages, others racking up debt renting apartments while they wait to return.

Israeli officials, meanwhile, have said those displaced will not be allowed to go back for at least a year.




Forces have ripped up roads, destroyed infrastructure and demolished hundreds of homes. Israel says it is dismantling terrorist infrastructure. But civilian homes have also been destroyed.

In another escalation, the military has resumed previously rare tactics, like drone strikes, in these densely populated areas.




Settler attacks causing injury or death to Palestinians surged in the wake of the Hamas attack. For Palestinians living in small Bedouin villages in areas under full Israeli control, the attacks have become a near-daily occurrence as settlers — emboldened by Israel's pro-settler government— build new unauthorized outposts on nearby hilltops.

Israel says it opposes settler violence and blames it all on a small, extremist fringe. Palestinians say that the Israeli army does little to protect them, and that the attacks are part of a systematic attempt to expel them from their land.

Settlers have established about 80 new outposts since the war began. Rights groups say the outposts, often populated by extremist activists, are the main drivers of violence against Palestinians. The tiny unauthorized land grabs are tolerated and even encouraged by Israel, which over the years has converted many outposts into authorized settlements as it cements its hold on the territory and moves to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.




Israel's government, dominated by settler leaders and supporters, has established 13 new settlements since the war began, at least five of which originally sprung up as outposts. That brings the total number of settlements to 140.

Most of the international community considers settlements illegal, though U.S. President Donald Trump has supported them.

Meanwhile, movement between Palestinian towns and cities has only grown more difficult. New checkpoints have further divided the territory and created choke points the Israeli army can shut off on a whim.




Crossings that had been open 24/7 started closing during morning and evening rush hours, disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and turning once-routine commutes into hours-long journeys.

As the war in Gaza continues and the West Bank seethes, Palestinians say life is only growing more difficult.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration is loosening rules to help U.S. automakers like Elon Musk's Tesla develop self-driving cars so they can take on Chinese rivals.

U.S. companies developing self-driving cars will be allowed exemptions from certain federal safety rules for testing purposes, the Transportation Department said Thursday. The department also said it will streamline crash reporting requirements involving self-driving software that Musk has criticized as onerous and will move toward a single set of national rules for the technology to replace a patchwork of state regulations.

“We're in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn't be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard.”

The new exemption procedures will allow U.S. automakers to apply to skip certain safety rules for self-driving vehicles if they are used only for research, demonstrations and other non-commercial purposes. The exemptions were in place previously for foreign, imported vehicles whose home country rules may be different than those in the U.S.

The decision comes a day after Musk confirmed on a conference call with Tesla investors that the electric vehicle maker will begin a rollout of self-driving Tesla taxis in Austin, Texas, in June.

It's not clear how the exemptions from National Traffic Safety Administration rules will affect Tesla specifically. The company has pinned its future on complete automation of its cars, but it is facing stiff competition now from rivals, especially China automaker BYD.




The crash reporting rule being changed has drawn criticism from Musk as too burdensome and unfair. Tesla has reported many of the total crashes under the rule in part because it is the biggest seller of partial self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

Traffic safety watchdogs had feared that the Trump administration would eliminate the reporting rule. The transportation statement Thursday said reporting will be loosened to “remove unnecessary and duplicative” requirements but that the obligation to report crashes will remain.

These days, customers who visit a restaurant to pick up a carryout order, or even a fast-food drive-thru, may be greeted by a prompt on the screen asking how much they'd like to tip.

In some cases, it's just a kiosk making the request, but other times the cashier might be waiting for the customer's response.

""It usually catches me off-guard,"" Chris Nordstrom, a commercial real estate executive in Kansas City, Missouri, told Fox News Digital.

""It's not that I mind tipping in the right context,"" he said. ""It's just that fast food, by nature, has traditionally been a non-tipping experience.""

Just 12% of U.S. adults tip when eating at a ""fast casual restaurant,"" according to a Pew Research Center survey.

About 77% said the quality of the service they receive is a ""major factor"" in deciding whether to tip and how much.

""I don't tip if I pay before I eat,"" wrote one person on Reddit.

""Unless they make less than minimum wage, no need to tip.""

Another user wrote that if there's a tip option at a fast-food restaurant, ""it should be an instant zero … unless they make less than minimum wage, no need to tip.""

Most fast-food restaurants are required to pay the federal minimum wage, and some states have an even higher minimum wage.

Tipped restaurant employees also earn at least their state's minimum wage, according to the National Restaurant Association.

""More often than not, I don't tip at fast-food places unless the staff has gone above and beyond – or if it's a locally-owned spot that I want to support,"" Nordstrom said. ""Tipping is tied to service – not just the act of handing over an order that was pre-prepared.""

""Tipping is tied to service – not just the act of handing over an order that was pre-prepared,"" one customer said. (iStock)

But people who work in the service or retail industry may have a different perspective.

""If the option comes up, I'm always happy to tip,"" Blair Dubinsky, a client advisor at a luxury-brand retail store in New York City, told Fox News Digital. ""Working with the public isn't easy, and if that's the way I can thank them, I don't mind doing it.""

DO YOU SPEND MORE AT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS THAN YOU WANT TO? CONSIDER THIS

The custom of tipping is strictly American, according to Sarah Aynesworth, a Texas-based etiquette consultant who trained at the Protocol School of Washington. 

""'TIP' is an acronym for 'to insure promptness,' which began during Prohibition,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""People would get their alcohol delivered faster if they gave a little bit of extra money.""

Blair Dubinksy, a client advisor at a luxury-brand retail store in New York City, said she's always happy to tip.  (Blair Dubinsky)

Aynesworth said she does not always tip the customary 20% when dining at a casual or fast-food restaurant.

""That's really for more of a seated, served meal, where someone is refilling your water and giving you an experience,"" she said. ""At a fast-food restaurant, you're paying for fast food.""

FAST-FOOD MENU ITEMS THAT CHEFS LIKE TO EAT

For those who do decide to tip, pay attention to the numbers on the screen before tapping, said Aynesworth. 

""Sometimes they are prompting you to pay even more than a normal percentage,"" she said.

If asked to leave a tip, it's important to pay attention to the percentages, an etiquette expert advised. (iStock)

Nordstrom said he has noticed auto-tip options creeping higher, sometimes starting at 25%.

""When I'm being prompted to tip for things like grabbing a water, it seems a bit excessive, especially when the cashier is staring at you,"" he said. ""It feels as if the social guilt aspect has overtaken the spirit of tipping.""

Dubinsky said she often tips fast-food workers – not out of obligation, but simply as a courtesy.

""I don't think people should necessarily feel like they need to tip at a fast-food restaurant … however, people put in the effort to take the order and make the food, so I think it's very polite to tip.""

If picking up takeout food and there's an option to tip, she said she will usually leave one, but not if picking up food from a window, ""because I'm not interacting with anyone.""

""If tipping becomes an expectation everywhere … then its meaning as a reward for above-and-beyond hospitality is lost.""

Nordstrom said he believes it should not always be expected.

""If tipping becomes an expectation everywhere, regardless of the level of service, then its meaning as a reward for above-and-beyond hospitality is lost — and it becomes more of an additional tax.""

Theologian and Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss what's to come in the wake of Pope Francis' death.

Viewership of the movie ""Conclave,"" which depicts the choosing of a new pope, has spiked in the days since Pope Francis died. But how much of the Academy Award winner is accurate to the real event about to take place? 

The Rev. Bryan Pham, a Jesuit priest and associate director for Catholic Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, told Fox News Digital he believes the movie was accurate according to the ""timeline and sequence of events of how to handle the death of a pope, the relaying of information, the gathering of the cardinals, and general procedures of getting the new pope elected.""

Pham, who was a graduate student in Rome during the last conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013, also said the ""side conversations among the cardinals as they try to identify the challenges and the needs of the church when considering the qualities of the next pope"" rang true. 

HOW POPE FRANCIS' EXAMPLE 'SOUNDS A LOT LIKE JESUS'

""Although, in real-life, these conversations happen in what is called ‘general congregation' and is much more formal,"" he said. ""But of course, cardinals are also mere mortals, so gossips and side-conversations do happen.""

""Conclave,"" which came out last year and won the Oscar in March for best adapted screenplay, stars Ralph Fiennes as the cardinal in charge of the conclave after a fictional pope dies. It also stars Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow. 

Pham said the real conclave was an ""extraordinary experience,"" adding that some parts of the movie sensationalized the centuries-old ritual. 

""Where ‘Conclave' was clearly a Hollywood movie that wants to be sensational, create potential scandals for shock value in order to make money and perhaps perpetuate the anti-Catholic sentiment (especially in the United States)"" was ""everything else that played into the negative aspect of the Catholic mystique that perpetuate the Catholic Church as primitive and byzantine,"" he said.

""That said, I thought the movie was done well,"" Pham said. ""There were beautiful imageries, and the cinematography was excellent. The actors were also top-notch. I only wish Isabella Rossellini had a more prominent role (or lines); she is such an accomplished actor to be cast in such a relatively minor role.""

Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, who has personally witnessed three conclaves and is heading back to Rome for this one, said viewership of the movie spiked because it's ""in the zeitgeist. Anytime you have a pope die, you know, the visuals, the rituals of the church and the ceremony that accompanies the election of a pope is fascinating.""

Amazon Prime made ""Conclave"" available for free on its streaming service on Monday after the pope died. 

Arroyo said he thinks a superior movie to ""Conclave"" is 1968's ""The Shoes of the Fisherman,"" starring Anthony Quinn, which also depicts a conclave and is ""more gripping and dramatic and interesting.""

Arroyo agreed with Pham that the movie gets ""some of the details of the ritual, which is evocative and beautiful and fascinating"" right. 

""And frankly, that's the best part of ‘Conclave,' which is otherwise a very boring, draggy movie,"" Arroyo said. 

He noted that ""the writing of the ballot, the going up and swearing before Michelangelo's last judgment,"" raising their ballots and making an oath to the last judgment, placing the ballots in a vessel and having them counted by counters was all accurate.

""Conclave"" won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay. (Alamy)

""They count votes, and then they run a needle and string through them,"" he continued. ""So, all of that is correct. What's wrong is kind of the surrounds of the thing. The politics, the conversations playing out. It was very cartoonish, melodramatic dialogue.""

""None of that happens in that way,"" he said, ""and the intrigue, I wish it were that interesting and fascinating, all the intrigues and people dying, having kids out of wedlock and all that, that's not happening. 

Arroyo said all the potential choices for pope are already vetted.

5 QUOTES FROM CARDINAL ROBERT SARAH, A FAVORITE AMONG CONSERVATIVES TO SUCCEED POPE FRANCIS

""That's one dysfunctional Vatican,"" he joked of the movie. ""That's all I can say on the screen. And the real one is dysfunctional enough. It doesn't need any assistance.""

He said that during the conclave, the cardinals are all housed in a hotel across the street from St. Peter's Basilica. 

""And they would, as depicted in the movie, if memory serves, they get on a bus, and they take them over to the Sistine Chapel, and they go in, and they're locked in for the day. You know they're basically locked in.""

Arroyo said that tradition goes back to one conclave when the cardinals weren't able to elect a pope for a year, ""and the conclave kept dragging on, and they hadn't elected a pope, so they decided to lock them in the place and not give them food or water, pressure them to make a decision.""

He said that while the traditions and ancient rituals ""themselves are beautiful,"" why they're done is ""always more fascinating.""

""I thought the movie ‘Conclave' exploited the church's visuals to drive home a message and a version of the church that just isn't on point,"" he said. ""I mean, when the nuns [were] lecturing all the cardinals while they're eating, that would never happen. I mean it doesn't happen. And look, I know a lot of cardinals. I've interviewed a lot them. I know what happens, before the conclave, during the conclave, after the conclave. This is just not reality.""

He agreed with Pham that the business of meeting with the candidates ""and getting comfortable with the man who might be pope or at least the major candidates"" usually happens at dinners and other events before they are locked in during the conclave.

Arroyo said he will head to Rome during the nine days of mourning for the pope. 

""Those nine days are when all the business of the conclave is really done,"" he explains. ""By the time they go into the conclave, they pretty much have at least a top one and two candidates that they're moving toward."" 

He said the movie clearly had ""great production designers and costumers who tried to match the locations and the places, and they didn't get that wrong. I mean, the Sistine Chapel is the Sistine Chapel.""

But he said they missed ""the heart of"" what it's all about. 

The ""biggest error"" of the film, from Arroyo's perspective, is when Ralph Fiennes' character in the film, who is tasked with running the conclave, preaches that ""doubt is at the heart of faith, that we must have doubt to believe. Well, this is absurd.""

Arroyo said the concept ""runs counter to everything the church has ever taught. You know, Jesus didn't say follow me in doubt. He said follow me and believe. So that's what you're called to do. And no, doubt is not part of that.""

He continued, ""The wonder of miracles is that, you know, they defy reality, they defy natural law. That's the wonder of it: it shatters reality in some ways. But there's no doubt involved in that. It either happened or didn't happen. But if it happens, it wakes a lot of people up, and that's what happened initially. And that's why these people gave their lives for what Jesus said and for Christ himself. They gave their life because he rose again.""

""That idea of doubt being at the heart of faith and at the heart of the church is a stupid one,"" he said, ""and one that people, I think a certain cast of mind, would like the church to pursue that path.""

The movie, he said, ""cast a certain ideological vision that they imagined the church should be, and it was an open, it's basically an open church, cut off from the very traditions that they celebrated and that the movie profits off of.""

""The movie sought to propagate a version of Catholicism cut off from the very traditions and rituals that the movie celebrates, holds up and made a lot of money,"" he said.

Country music singer Jelly Roll isn't afraid to tackle the ""uncomfortable stuff"" in his marriage to TikTok star Bunnie XO up front in order to keep their marriage strong, the ""Son of a Sinner"" musician shared with Fox News Digital.

With his career at an all-time high, Jelly Roll has learned to fully embrace the moments of solitude he finds amid his hectic schedule. 

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the ""Save Me"" crooner — who has recently partnered up with shoe brand HEYDUDE to announce the highly anticipated ""Second Chances"" collaboration restock — opened up about how his farm in Nashville has kept him ""on track"" when it comes to avoiding the pitfalls of fame and success. 

""Of all the things I've done, having cows seems to be one of the most surprising to people,"" Jelly Roll said with a laugh. ""And yes, the Hey Dudes have absolutely been over to the farm. But seriously, I want to say thank you for asking about the farm because it reminds me to bring something up. I think it really does in a real way represent what a second chance can really do. But also the reality of getting to that point, too.""

""I've been honest about how there can still be a real dark corner between my ears at times,"" he continued. ""Ultimately, the farm is someplace that I find a lot of peace in — that space and separation — getting out there and just walking. It's made a big difference for me on a lot of levels. It was a chance to [find] things that keep me on track. And I think it's good when you can share that too.""

Before finding megastardom, the Nashville-born singer, 40, had his share of personal struggles. After first going into juvenile detention at age 13, Jelly Roll was in and out of jail for years to follow. While behind bars, the country star found sobriety and a new understanding and appreciation for his faith. 

""I wouldn't be the man I am today if it wasn't for what I went through. I think it empowered me. I think it gave me my voice,"" he told Fox News Digital at the 2023 CMAs. ""It taught me a lot about overcoming. It taught me a lot about changing and the ability to change.""

""I was a horrible human for decades, and to just be able to turn that around and give a message in the music and help people… and just try to give back as much as I can in every way I can is very indicative of where I came from and how important it is to me to always reach back.""

His collaboration with Hey Dude is just another way for him to give back. 

""Ultimately, the farm is someplace that I find a lot of peace in — that space and separation — getting out there and just walking.""

""I don't think that you can honestly tell my story or look back and talk about where I am now from where I was and not believe in or want to encourage the belief in second chances,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Second chances have a domino effect that impacts not only one person's life but lives but beyond just that one person.""

""It trickles down into their family, friends, communities and beyond,"" he continued. ""My dad always said that change starts in your heart, then goes to your home, then goes out to your street, then your community and beyond that. The ability to believe in that change, often through the chance to do something differently or make amends from before, is all part of that.""

Jelly Roll hopes to continue to inspire others with his outreach and philanthropy. (Amy Sussman/Getty Images for Jelly Roll)

Jelly Roll, who has recently taken on the role of being the first-ever ""Artist in Residence"" on ""American Idol,"" said it's been ""rewarding"" to be in a position to offer advice and guidance to young contestants looking to make a name for themselves. 

JELLY ROLL EMBRACES ROLE IN COUNTRY MUSIC REVOLUTION AFTER OVERCOMING ADDICTION AND PRISON TIME

""Getting to know these kids and be a part of this has been honestly an incredible experience,"" he said. ""And the talent level is just unreal. I think watching it unfold over this season, too, it's been really rewarding to watch each one of them go out there and outperform themselves from the week before, or show a different side of what they can do, really dig in creatively while showing America who they are as artists.""

WATCH: Jelly Roll talks using his platform to inspire positive change

""I am out there cheering every one of them on,"" he continued. ""And I am a really proud parent. I get to see those moments from rehearsals where they are working through something to then, in the show, hitting that note they had to work through in rehearsal or just taking that performance onstage to the next level.""

The country star, who's heading Stagecoach this weekend, said his role on ""Idol"" has been humbling in that he finds himself reliving moments from his own career path.

""It's also made me relive a lot of my own moments career-wise, that you almost don't stop to take in fully as they are happening because of the pace this industry can move,"" he said. ""But when I am sitting there talking about the first time you go onstage or that first live show, it brings back those moments for me, too. Like the first time I performed on an award show stage, or singing that new song for the first time. So that has been an unexpected surprise of being Artist in Residence, but a really welcome one, and one I am super grateful for.""

The Los Angeles Kings hosted the Edmonton Oilers Monday for a first-round Stanley Cup playoff game, and a pregame performance became a topic of conversation.

Members of the Korea Town Senior & Community Center performed ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" prior to the puck drop at Crypto.com Arena. The group used harmonicas instead of singing the American national anthem.

The majority of the crowd in attendance appeared to approve of the rendition as thousands remained standing to applaud the performers.

But some observers took to social media to voice their displeasure. 

""Whoever thought this was a good idea should probably not have a job,"" an X user wrote.

Country star Billy Ray Cyrus discusses his love of troops and the future of America on 'Hannity.'

Elizabeth Hurley reached out to Billy Ray Cyrus while he was in a difficult place after his divorce from singer Firerose.

The former co-stars, who recently went Instagram official with a kissing snap shared on Easter Sunday, reconnected over text, with Hurley making the first move nearly two years after they worked on the 2022 film ""Christmas in Paradise.""

Cyrus, who will debut his new song ""Ask (Honor Song)"" Friday, told ""The Ty Bentli Show"" their blossoming relationship is a gift from God, and he's the happiest he's been with his new romance.

""It's been a long time since I've been this happy.""

Hurley, 59, smiled widely as the ""Achy Breaky Heart"" singer kissed her on the cheek while wearing a festive pair of green bunny ears in a photo shared with both of their millions of social media followers on Easter.

""It's been a long time since I've been this happy.""

""I've obviously, I know all about her life and career and me, a kid from Flatwoods, Kentucky, going to sit and pretend I'm an actor with Elizabeth Hurley knowing that, wait, how did this happen? And the oddest part was first how much we laughed.

""Second, I figured we were so different, but in some very strange way, we had way more in common than we had different. And then we did our couple scenes, and I left the island. And we didn't speak for two years, and the pandemic continued on. That was in 2022.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Kash Patel announces arrest of Milwaukee judge","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3391443/fbi-arrests-milwaukee-judge-hannah-dugan-obstructing-ice-operations/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:38:43 GMT","

FBI Director Kash Patel announced the arrest of Wisconsin judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges after she allegedly misdirected Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to help an illegal immigrant evade arrest.

Dugan was arrested on obstruction charges after she allegedly interfered with a federal immigration arrest inside her courtroom. “Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction,” Patel posted to X.

Dugan made an initial appearance Friday in Milwaukee federal court, where U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries ordered her release after prosecutors said they were not seeking her detention, according to her federal court docket. She is accused of obstructing a proceeding and concealing an undocumented immigrant, Mexico native Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, to prevent his arrest. She faces up to six years in prison.

Dugan was arrested by the FBI and is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, a spokesperson for USMS told the Washington Examiner. The official added that Dugan was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. local time near the Milwaukee County Courthouse. She was then transferred to the custody of the U.S. Marshals.

Her charges stem from an incident on April 18, in which ICE agents came to the courthouse with a warrant for the arrest of an illegal immigrant, and the FBI opened an investigation into whether Dugan helped the illegal immigrant avoid arrest, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported earlier this week. 

Dugan's alleged conduct allowed the undocumented migrant to leave the courthouse for about 22 minutes, prompting a “foot chase” by immigration officials. Patel added that the suspect was eventually captured but warned the judge's actions “created increased danger to the public.”

Dugan allegedly directed officers away from Flores-Ruiz and then personally escorted him out a back door typically reserved for jurors and in-custody defendants, according to a 13-page criminal complaint released Friday.

The complaint states Dugan “became visibly angry” upon learning agents were waiting to arrest Flores-Ruiz and told them to report to the chief judge, claiming they needed a judicial warrant.

While officers complied, Dugan allegedly expedited Flores-Ruiz's hearing and led him and his attorney through a nonpublic corridor to evade detention. He was later spotted near the courthouse and taken into custody after a foot chase.

After learning Flores-Ruiz had left the courtroom, federal agents “scrambled to locate” him near the Milwaukee County Courthouse, according to the filing. 

Agents spotted him by the flagpole outside and “identified themselves as law enforcement,” prompting Flores-Ruiz to “turn around and sprint down the street.” 

A foot chase ensued, with agents pursuing him “for the entire length of the courthouse” before he was ultimately apprehended near W. State Street and 10th Street and “handcuffed and detained.”

Patel deleted his initial 10:11 a.m. Eastern post on X and reposted the same announcement at 12:11 p.m. on Friday. Before it was reposted, Attorney General Pam Bondi, as well as spokespeople for various divisions of the Justice Department, confirmed the arrest took place.

While it's unclear why his post was temporarily removed, the latter announcement was identical and maintained that Dugan “intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested … allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest.” 

More information will be forthcoming about Dugan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","David Hogg's future could include first male host of The View: Joe Concha","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/entertainment/3391148/david-hogg-future-could-include-first-male-host-the-view-joe-concha/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:13:27 GMT","

The Washington Examiner's Joe Concha suggested the days of David Hogg serving as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee are numbered, adding possible new ventures could include being the first male host of The View.

Hogg was elected earlier this year to his DNC leadership role following 2024 election losses that saw President Donald Trump enter the White House for a second time and Republicans take control of both houses of Congress. 

As vice chairman, Hogg has been outspoken regarding his plan to launch a primary initiative that would spend $20 million on electing younger politicians through his organization, Leaders We Deserve. The initiative, which would seek to unseat current Democratic lawmakers, has created division within the party's leadership and talk that Hogg could be removed from his role. DNC Chairman Ken Martin, however, told the Washington Examiner that he has no “intention” of forcing out Hogg.

“You would think that if you're No. 2 at the DNC, your job is kind of to defeat Republicans and not just upset the apple cart like that,” Concha told Fox Business Network's Kudlow on Thursday. “So, he's on his way out. I'll give him a week, maybe two at this point.”

Concha has noted that Hogg's left-wing views have created a greater fracture within the Democratic Party, making progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) “look centrist.” His comments come as the party is experiencing record-low polling figures.

“This is a party that needs to go towards the center again, like Bill Clinton did in 1994. Instead they are going so far to the left. It's like Thelma and Louise — off the cliff at the end,” Concha said. “This is not somebody that you want to be the face [of the Democratic Party]. He's on TV a lot.”

Concha argued that Hogg does not have the political maturity to change course regarding his views. When asked what might come next for Hogg, should he be ousted from his DNC role, Concha suggested he could “get a job at MSNBC or be the first male host of The View.”

The senior writer for the Washington Examiner also said he believes Trump will win his current trade battle that has found his administration in negotiations with several countries after issuing new tariffs. However, Concha noted that if Trump is not successful with his tariffs, or if the economy does not improve, the Democrats' current disarray may have an opportunity to right itself.

“If he wins that,” Concha said regarding Trump's current economic and trade war, “then Democrats will be in Sherwood Forest as far as the political wilderness for a very long time. If that goes the other way, then Democrats have an opportunity because Donald Trump's failure is their gain.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former President Joe Biden, the nation's second Catholic president, will attend Pope Francis‘s funeral this weekend in Rome.

“President Biden and Dr. Biden will attend Pope Francis's funeral,” a Biden spokesperson confirmed to the Washington Examiner.

Biden did not attend the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2023, which occurred during his presidency. Benedict served as pope from 2005 through 2013, when he took the unusual step of becoming pope emeritus at 85.

Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush will not attend the funeral.

Bush spokesman Freddy Ford said the 43rd president “did not have the privilege of knowing Pope Francis” and therefore was unlikely to attend. During his presidency, Bush attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.

Obama will also not attend, though he and his wife, Michelle Obama, released a statement in honor of the pope.

“Pope Francis was the rare leader who made us want to be better people,” the Obamas said. “In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound — embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners — he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another.”

It is unclear whether former President Bill Clinton will attend, and his office didn't respond to a request for comment. The former Democratic president released a statement saying Francis “made it clear that he would endeavor to embrace the entire world, including those of other faiths, those whom the church hadn't always welcomed, and anyone whose daily struggles reflected the enduring truth of our common humanity.”

President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that he will attend the funeral, which will be held Saturday in Rome at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern), six days after the pope's death.

“Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We look forward to being there!”

Biden and Trump were last seen together in public on Jan. 20 during Trump's inauguration.

Trump's presence has invited speculation on whether he will meet with European leaders during the trip, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hoping to speak with him in person. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal was at the White House Wednesday, the Washington Examiner reported.

Vance calls it a ‘blessing' to visit Pope Francis shortly before death

Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, will not attend the funeral, a spokesman confirmed. Vance visited Francis on Easter Sunday, less than 24 hours before his death, during a seven-day trip to Europe and India that included the vice president's entire nuclear family.

On Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced that his deputy, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), will lead a bipartisan delegation of 10 House lawmakers to the funeral, a list that includes former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used a “dirty line,” which refers to an unsecured internet connection, to connect to the Signal app on a personal computer in his office, multiple outlets reported.

A Pentagon spokesperson denied that Hegseth used an unsecured connection in a statement to the Associated Press. 

“Use of communications systems and channels is classified,” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told the Washington Examiner. “However, we can confirm that the secretary has never used and does not currently use Signal on his government computer.”

Hegseth's alleged use of the line comes after several Signal chats that may have contained classified information were revealed.

The Pentagon chief's job has been in doubt recently. NPR published a Tuesday report titled “The White House is looking to replace Pete Hegseth as defense secretary,” detailing that Hegseth's job may be in danger after it was revealed that he shared classified information in a group chat with his wife, brother and lawyer.

The report prompted a strong denial from the White House.

“This ⁦@NPR⁩ story is total FAKE NEWS based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about. As the President said this morning, he stands strongly behind ⁦@SecDef⁩,” Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X.

Hegseth setting up an unsecured line to his office may bolster cries to oust him over his handling of classified information. While other Pentagon offices use unsecure lines, it exposes the user to hacking and surveillance.

The defense secretary initially went to the back of his office, where he could access Wi-Fi to use his personal devices, the Associated Press reported. He later requested a line at his desk so he could use his own computer there. That computer was located next to one used for classified material and another for sensitive defense information. Staff are instructed to leave personal devices outside the secretary's office to avoid possible exposure of sensitive data.

The Pentagon's acting inspector general announced earlier this month that he would review Hegseth's disclosure of strikes in Yemen on Signal.

TRUMP'S BUDGET CHIEF SHOWS ‘TOTAL' COMMITMENT TO SHRINKING GOVERNMENT

Hegseth also drew fire this week for reportedly ordering a makeup studio to be installed next to the Pentagon press briefing room. He denied the report and said the “news media” would have liked if he installed “tampon machines in every men's bathroom at DoD instead.”

Americans greeted Pope St. John Paul II with open arms during his seven visits to the United States. Pundits often said he received a rockstar welcome, but perhaps only the Beatles in 1964 were met with greater adulation than the Polish pontiff. 

Pope Francis received a more tepid response during his lone visit to America in 2015, perhaps because we had grown accustomed to papal visits. But perhaps it was the Argentine pope's subtle, and sometimes overt, disdain for the U.S., its wealth, influence, and ever-increasing embrace of traditional Catholicism.

Or it could be that Francis viewed himself not only as a priest, pastor, and pope but also as a politician.

Here are just a few examples.

In 2016, Francis challenged President Donald Trump's policy of securing the U.S.-Mexico border by celebrating Mass, which drew 200,000 people, in the border city of Ciudad Juárez. 

“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” he said aboard the papal plane hours later when a reporter asked about Trump's policies. 

The pope heightened that rhetoric a few months ago in a letter to American bishops, criticizing Trump's treatment of migrants and claiming that deportations violate the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families.”

The pope's letter essentially told people that they are obligated to allow migrants to cross their borders with impunity as long as they weren't violent criminals. These politically minded statements from the pope did not do much to endear him to many devout Catholics in the U.S.

By contrast, John Paul II used his visits to the U.S. not to scold or lecture people but to challenge them to live up to our founders' high ideals. 

“America has opened her heart to me,” he said on his arrival in Boston during his first visit to the U.S. as pope in 1979. “I come as one who already knows you and loves you, as one who wishes you to fulfill completely your noble destiny of service to the world.”

Eight years later, during his farewell address in Detroit, he challenged, “The best traditions of your land presume respect for those who cannot defend themselves. If you want equal justice for all, and true freedom and lasting peace, then, America, defend life!”

American Catholics embraced the Polish pope's challenges by growing the pro-life movement and embracing his “New Evangelization.” 

Francis, meanwhile, stood alongside President Barack Obama on the South Lawn of the White House in 2015 and told the president that “American Catholics are committed to building a society which is truly tolerant and inclusive” and ending “climate change.” 

It was statements such as that one that gave the impression that Francis was hyperfocused on migration, diversity, accompaniment, inclusivity, and climate change. As such, many Americans labeled him a liberal pope. But was he? The answer is not so simple. 

In American political parlance, a conservative is pro-life and embraces the Constitution, personal liberty, patriotism, and limited government. A liberal is someone who embraces none of those ideals.  

Francis was a mixed bag who did not fit neatly into either camp. 

He was unabashedly pro-life. In 2018, he compared having an abortion to “hiring a hitman to solve a problem.” Not once during his 12-year pontificate did he suggest that abortion might be appropriate under any circumstances. He was in lockstep with his papal predecessors. He told reporters in 2021 that “abortion is more than an ‘issue.' Abortion is murder.”

He was equally blunt when talking about surrogacy, which has become de rigueur among the wealthy elite, including homosexual couples. 

Last year, he blasted the idea of carrying a baby to term for another person or couple as “deplorable.” He called for a global ban on the practice, which is already illegal in Italy and several other European nations. 

An unborn child must not be “turned into an object of trafficking,” Francis said. “I consider despicable the practice of so-called surrogate motherhood, which represents a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child, based on the exploitation of situations of the mother's material needs.”

When it comes to LGBT issues, most Americans consider Francis to be liberal.

His famous “who am I to judge?” quip in 2013 led to a flood of praise from American liberals and disdain and confusion from faithful Catholics. The pope's ambiguity led to significant confusion among Catholics worldwide. 

“If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has goodwill, then who am I to judge him?” he said. Seven years later, he openly endorsed same-sex legal unions in a documentary interview. “Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God. You can't kick someone out of a family, nor make their life miserable for this,” he said.

Then, in late 2023, Francis set off a firestorm by allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, emboldening LGBT activist priests such as the Rev. James Martin, S.J., who took the new rule as a carte blanche endorsement of homosexuality. 

But less than a year ago, the pope reportedly used a slur twice in private meetings while condemning homosexuality among the priesthood and the Vatican curia.

Francis also drew the ire of American Catholics in 2021 when he imposed restrictions on the Traditional Latin Mass, often referred to as the TLM, contrasting sharply with Pope Benedict XVI, who had loosened restrictions during his pontificate. It was perplexing to many because the TLM attracted young Catholics and represented a growing segment of the church worldwide. 

The pope of the peripheries was not one to take criticism lying down. In 2021, he quipped that EWTN was “the work of the devil” after some of its news reports challenged him on his liberal and often unorthodox statements.

For some U.S. Catholics, Francis pushed his power too far in 2023 when he removed Bishop Joseph Strickland from leadership of the Tyler, Texas, diocese, and when he laicized Father Frank Pavone from the Florida-based Priests for Life a year earlier. The pope also evicted American Cardinal Raymond Burke from his apartment in Rome with little explanation.

I have to agree with my friend, Paul Kengor, who wrote in the American Spectator a few days ago that “it has been all chaos and arguing since Francis took over the papacy in 2013. No pope in modern times has sowed this much confusion in the Chair of St. Peter. Both liberals and conservatives alike should concede that.”

VATICAN RELEASES FIRST PICTURES OF POPE FRANCIS IN OPEN COFFIN AS FUNERAL RITES BEGIN

Despite being the first pope from the Americas, the first to address a joint session of Congress, and the first pope to canonize a new saint on American soil, Francis leaves the Chair of Peter with faithful American Catholics anticipating a return to orthodoxy. The liberal pope leaves many more liberal-minded Catholics praying for a successor who will continue the Latin American pope's legacy of moral and theological ambiguity.

Catholics from all political and social backgrounds should start by asking the Lord Jesus to welcome the late pope into heaven. They should also urgently pray that the 135 cardinals (80% of whom were appointed by Francis) entering the conclave next week will heed the Holy Spirit, who will guide them to all truth and a worthy successor to St. Peter, if they only give their assent. Surely, that's something we can all agree on.

Should the star podcaster take any responsibility for how he uses his power?

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Recently, I felt a great disturbance in the world of podcasts, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in horror and were suddenly silenced. Someone had been on Joe Rogan's show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge. Rogan fans were appalled at this disrespect.

The culprit was the British writer Douglas Murray, who confronted Rogan earlier this month over the podcaster's decision to platform a series of guests with, shall we say, minority views on the Second World War. The obvious example is Darryl Cooper, a “storyteller” who has lately taken a sharp turn into Nazi apologism. “I'm just interested in your selection of guests, because you're, like, the world's number-one podcast,” Murray told Rogan. This kind of direct challenge is quite simply not how things are done in the anti-woke sphere, which is brutally hierarchical. Free-speech absolutism does not include lèse-majesté. “Principleless hacks,” the libertarian podcaster Clint Russell posted on X afterward, referring to Murray and those who support him. “And that's assuming this is genuine and not a paid op, which would be even worse—disreputable mercenaries.”

Read: The dangerous rise of podcast historians

Murray's pointed criticism of Rogan's approach, made right to his face, has prompted other aftershocks across the Roganverse, that loose collection of comics and podcasters who dominate the podcast market. Afterward, Murray discussed the interview with the New Atheist Sam Harris, the television host Bill Maher, and the Canadian marketing professor Gad Saad. Rogan discussed it with the comic Tim Dillon and the lobster-obsessed mystic Jordan Peterson.

The immense fallout from this mild back-and-forth demonstrates that nothing splinters a movement like victory. When the Roganverse could paddle in the safe waters of pronouns, Joe Biden jokes, and COVID conspiracy theories, everyone got along just fine. Life was easier for them when Donald Trump was merely the punkish challenger to the presidency. Now Trump is in the White House, the former upstart independents of the Roganverse are the new establishment, and their desire for power without responsibility is being challenged.

Murray has the kind of English accent that—I'm afraid to say, having experienced something similar myself—instantly makes Americans think you're smart. He was on The Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, On Democracies and Death Cults, which strongly supports Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war against Hamas in Gaza. Later in the episode, Murray also clashed with the comedian Dave Smith, whom Rogan had invited along as a kind of emotional-support podcaster. Smith has been a strong critic of Israel's policies and military actions, and the pair had a memorable exchange that culminated in Murray asking, incredulously, if Smith had visited the region. “You've never been?” he said, with an intonation halfway between Oscar Wilde's Lady Bracknell and Chandler from Friends.

Murray is hardly a neutral observer of the war; last year, he accepted a medal from Israeli politicians for being their “steadfast ally in countless international press interviews.” But he has spent significant time reporting from the Middle East. And he is right about the shortcomings of Rogan's guest-booking policy. Over the past few years, Rogan has invited on a horde of crackpots who see themselves as a lone Galileo standing up to Big Pharma or the “deep state.” Nevertheless, his reach, popularity, and patronage powers are so great that few guests want to challenge him; others might reasonably claim that Rogan gets quite enough criticism from the liberal mainstream.

From the October 2024 issue: How Joe Rogan remade Austin

The split between Murray and Rogan over Israel also reveals a deeper fissure across the American right. Murray believes that the United States has a duty to safeguard freedom and democracy abroad through military action, including support for its allies. Rogan, like Vice President J. D. Vance, is skeptical of this principle in general, and (unlike Vance) unconvinced by its particular application in Gaza.

This crack runs right down the anti-woke sphere, which includes other members of what was once called the “intellectual dark web.” The conservative Substacker Andrew Sullivan has repeatedly criticized The Free Press, founded by Bari Weiss, for what he sees as its reluctance to stand up for the free-speech rights of anti-Israel activists. Two of the most influential voices in tech, the investor Paul Graham and the podcaster turned Trump crypto czar David Sacks, have also publicly clashed over the issue.

Rogan's show might be a better forum for discussing Israeli-Palestinian affairs if Rogan weren't so keen on hosting people such as Darryl Cooper—who has argued elsewhere that Winston Churchill, not Adolf Hitler, was the “chief villain” of World War II—and Ian Carroll, who has claimed on X that “Israel did 9/11.”

This is the crux of the argument between Murray and Rogan: Does the latter's huge success and influence confer any responsibility or duty on him to patrol the borders of allowable discourse on his show? Rogan says no—he's just a regular guy who never asked for any of this. His critics retort that his commitment to provocative conversations and dangerous ideas has made him reflexively anti-mainstream, pushing him toward conspiracism.

Instead of making the eminently supportable accusation that the media and the scientific establishment both make mistakes from time to time, Rogan now disparages expertise as a concept. In the episode, Murray admitted that he has struggled to listen to Cooper's podcasts, because “it's pretty hard to listen to somebody who says: I don't know what I'm talking about, but now I'm going to talk.” He then attacked Dave Smith, saying that Smith does the same thing: “Dave's a comedian, but he's now mainly talking about Israel.”

Again, this is heresy in the Rogansphere. Expertise is for liberals and cucks and NPCs. Or rather—expertise on politics and history and science is suspicious. Rogan's guests are allowed to know about sports, for example, from firsthand experience or detailed research. “When it comes to mixed martial arts, his interview guests are the best of the best—the dazzling array of UFC champions, top MMA coaches, respected trainers and other experts does not appear to include comedian Dave Smith,” Rogan's fellow podcaster and former guest Konstantin Kisin wrote recently. “There is a popular clip on the JRE Youtube channel in which Smith ‘breaks down' why Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. I was unable to find one of him breaking down BJJ”—Brazilian jiu-jitsu—“moves, despite Smith possessing a similar level of expertise on both subjects.”

The encounter with Murray, then, exposes the limits of Rogan's just-asking-questions pose, as well as the problem with delegating foreign-policy discussions to comedians such as Smith, a co-host of Legion of Skanks (tagline: “The most offensive podcast on Earth”). The podcast circuit likes to portray wokeness as decadent—a pursuit of college students, affluent feminists, and activists with no real problems—but this exchange reveals something even darker about its approach. Beyond decadence, this is nihilism: The Roganverse's “lol, nothing matters” approach to life is possible only for people living comfortable lives in a prosperous democracy, where the worst possible crime is to be a buzzkill.

“I don't think that the world is a studio in Texas, and we just riff endlessly and things don't have much meaning,” Murray said afterward, adding: “I think there are things that very much matter, and if they matter, then you put in the work.”

Ever since, the podcast world has experienced levels of sniping that make the Real Housewives franchise look like the Bretton Woods Conference. Nine days and five shows later, Rogan hosted Tim Dillon, another anti-woke comic, and together they impersonated Murray's voice like middle schoolers at a sleepover. (“You haven't beeeeen?”) Here's an obvious difference between the legacy media and independents like Rogan: You don't see Anderson Cooper doing mean impressions of his guests the following week. What was the point of Murray traveling to the front lines, Dillon argued, if he just came back with the same opinion as when he'd left?

“How is he in all these wars?” Dillon asked of Murray. “Can I just go to wars?” Yes, Tim Dillon, you can. That's what all of those people on your television with war reporter written under their name have been doing. In the olden days, we had a tradition where people who wanted to find out stuff spoke directly with people who had firsthand information. You guys laughed at it and said that it was dumb and elitist. Dave Smith, meanwhile, has adopted the fact he's “neva beeeeeeeeen” as a badge of honor.

From the January 2025 issue: The ‘mainstream media' has already lost

The whole episode has revealed a major break between the members of the Roganverse who still have an attachment to journalism—such as Murray, who is an associate editor of The Spectator, a conservative magazine—and those who regard all information sources as basically equal. “The incentive structures and thought patterns we would typically associate with the entertainment business are not the same as those we would expect to see in journalism or academia,” Kisin wrote in his perceptive post on the controversy. In other words, don't get your opinions on Israel, or anything else, entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and men named Dave.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

How Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.

by  Constance Grady

President Donald Trump has never had any trouble finding women to enthusiastically embrace his agenda. In the electorate, 45 percent of women voted for him; non-college-educated white women and white evangelical women are among his most loyal supporters. At the White House, women stand at his side as he speaks from the podium, sporting what has come to be known as “Republican” makeup and Mar-a-Lago face. 

That's despite the fact that both Trump and the MAGA movement are characterized by a vindictive, nostalgic, unapologetic misogyny. Some Trump supporters openly fantasize about how his improbable promise of bringing manufacturing jobs to the US might drive women out of the workplace and force them to become solely wives and mothers, while Trump himself has been found civilly liable for sexual assault.

This time around, the most visible women of Trump's administration are Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Noem has made a meal out of the spectacle of the Trump administration's spree of lawless deportations, shooting video after video dressed in full military gear and full makeup as she warns migrants that she plans to personally hunt them down and lock them up. Meanwhile, Leavitt, who at 27 is the youngest press secretary ever appointed, presents a softer look, with her blonde waves and form-fitting suits, even as she berates the press from her podium and bars unfriendly outlets from the pool as if she's disciplining insolent teenagers.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

The dichotomy Leavitt and Noem are building speaks to a familiar problem among conservative women in politics. As Rebecca Traister put it in 2024, “The questions facing the women of the American right are tricky. Are they supposed to be cutthroat or cute? Cold enough to kill a dog or warm enough to bake an apple pie?”

Leavitt and Noem are currently embodying two very different visions of MAGA femininity, each having selected a different path to the same goal: figure out how to wield power on behalf of and stay in the good graces of Donald Trump. They're each walking a perilous tightrope, staking their careers and reputations on furthering the political goals of a man and movement that implicitly promises to send them straight back into the kitchen. Whether they manage to succeed and make it through four years of the Trump administration remains to be seen. 

In the meantime, we'll see their images broadcast endlessly in videos and photographs, showing us their best guesses at how a MAGA woman should present herself.

Noem has spent much of her young term as Secretary of Homeland Defense in front of the camera, often to disturbing effect. 

In March, Noem posted to X a video of herself touring CECOT, the infamous and human rights-violating El Salvador prison to which the Trump administration has been sending deportees in defiance of court orders. In it, Noem stands, somber and polished, before a cell crowded with silent, shirtless prisoners. The men are crammed into the frame behind her like living props, as she warns, “Know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.” 

The casual dehumanization of the prisoners behind her is as characteristic of the particular aesthetic Noem is cultivating as her glossy blowout. On her social media feeds, she poses next to ICE agents on raids in uniform and full glam, as she refers to the migrants she says should be deported as “dirtbags” and “the worst of the worst.” 

Similarly, in a series of TV ads that ran both domestically and internationally earlier this year (paid for by the Department of Homeland Security with a $200 million budget), Noem stands all made up in a power suit in front of a line of American flags, thanking Trump for securing the country's borders and once again warning undocumented immigrants against entering the US. 

The image she's presenting is a sort of glamazon sheriff, ready to protect the old West from marauders by any means necessary, the lawbook be damned. 

In other iconography, she nods to her previous career as a rancher, posing with a cowboy hat and a fixed glare at the horizon line. The image she's presenting is a sort of glamazon sheriff, ready to protect the old West from marauders by any means necessary, the lawbook be damned. 

Noem has relied on elaborate costume work before. In 2024, as governor of South Dakota — and rumored frontrunner for Trump's VP slot — Noem released a series of ads promoting open jobs in South Dakota. One after another, she donned the uniform of a highway patrol officer, nurse, and welder, explaining with a playful wink to the camera that she was just filling in. “Freedom works here” was the tagline. 

It's one of the ways Noem signals that she is a politician in the same mode as Trump: one who governs by spectacle as much as by policy. 

Frankfurt school philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote that fascism transforms politics into aesthetics. Rather than change the structures that oppress the masses, Benjamin writes, the fascist merely offers the masses a spectacle that gives them the impression that their desires have been met. Noem's flashy performance of security theater tells her followers that she is keeping them safe, even as she strips migrants, selected nearly at random, of due process and condemns them to a lifetime trapped in an El Salvador prison. 

Noem did not always look like this, exactly: Her shifting aesthetic has been well documented in the political press. When she first took national office in 2011 as South Dakota's representative, she looked like what she was: a strikingly pretty Midwestern mom, with a Rachel haircut and hoop earrings. She kept cutting her hair shorter over the next few years, as many women politicians do — up until Trump took office in 2016. 

Then, abruptly, Noem's hair became dramatically longer, sun-kissed with blonde highlights and curled into TV-friendly barrel ringlets. Her face seemed to reshape itself, taking on the high cheekbones and frozen forehead characteristic of Fox News hosts. 

One of the most telling aspects of Noem's makeover was also one of the most infamous. In March 2024, Noem posted a lengthy infomercial-like video to Twitter thanking a Texas-based dentist's office for adjusting her teeth. The whole thing so much resembled an advertisement that Noem was sued by a consumer advocacy group, although the case was later dismissed. 

“I want, when people look at me, [for them] to hear the words that I say, and not be distracted by something that I'm wearing or how I look, or even my appearance,” Noem said in the video, by way of explanation for why she wanted to “fix” her smile so badly. “I want them to focus on my thoughts and ideas.” 

Noem seems to believe that in order to make her appearance less disruptive — and her gender less disqualifying — her femininity must actually be amplified. Fitting into Trump's favored aesthetic is a baseline requirement. By disciplining her face and body and teeth and hair to meet a near-parodic standard, Noem appears to be attempting to be so good at being a woman that she is granted the chance to hang like one of the boys — to inhabit the masculine archetype of the sheriff at least some of the time because she looks so feminine doing it. 

Notably, Noem has critics on the right who don't appear to think she's fully pulled it off. 

“Just stop trying to glamorize the mission and put yourself in the middle of it as you cosplay ICE agent, which you're not,” said Megyn Kelly in April. Kelly continued: “She is an administrative policy person appointed by Trump because she was very loyal to him. Fine, but stop with the glam.”

“Conservatives need a distinct aesthetic, but this one isn't it,” mused the right-wing culture warrior Christopher Rufo in April. “Agency head shouldn't pretend to be an operator, feels fake. The message is persuasive — arresting criminal aliens — but the aesthetic draws all the attention away from the content. The subtext here is that Noem does not want you to notice what she is doing, but to notice *her.* This doesn't advance the policy. It's vanity.” 

Noem's spectacle, in Kelly and Rufo's formulation, is too much of a spectacle, too ham-handed, so false as to give itself away. Her over-the-top glamour makes it so feminine as to be unserious, even for those who approve of her message.

Nonetheless, Noem appears to be nailing the brief for her most important audience. “You're not allowed to say she's beautiful,” announced Trump of Noem approvingly last summer, “so I'm not going to say it.”

When Christopher Rufo decried Noem's ICE photo op, he outlined what he thought the correct aesthetic for the moment should be. “A successful American aesthetic would be ticker tape, brass bands, jets spraying the red, white, and blue,” Rufo wrote. “It's a feeling of bright optimism.” 

The woman in the Trump administration currently playing that brass band is press secretary Karoline Leavitt. 

Leavitt has not, as Noem has, needed to redevelop a whole extant political and aesthetic style to fit the Trumpist mold. She spent her college years writing pro-Trump editorials for her school's newspaper, and her first internship after graduating was at the Trump White House press office during his first administration. She built her public persona in the service of Trump, and he rewarded her with a very high-profile position in response. 

If the frisson of Noem's self-presentation comes from her military machismo played against her glamorous good looks, Leavitt's comes from the authoritativeness she adopts on the press podium played against her palpable youth. Her voice still retains the flavor of a young woman's uncertainty, no matter how stridently she addresses the press corps or how flagrantly she lies. She seems more comfortable filming TikTok-style videos for the White House social media accounts, addressing the camera with an influencer's cheerful “Hey, guys!”

“Trump's newest press secretary is radiant, blond and apple-cheeked — as if one of Leonardo da Vinci's Madonnas had been styled for a Fox News hit,” wrote the Washington Post of Leavitt in January. “Her delivery is righteous, if a bit smug. God gives everyone gifts, Leavitt believes; hers is public speaking. And for roughly a half hour, once or twice a week, she delivers Trump's word to a room filled with professional skeptics.”

Leavitt's rapport with the press may be combative, but within the media-hostile landscape of the Trump White House, she's still the good cop, which is perhaps to say, the nice girl. The Washington Post notes that her office door is open to reporters and that she peppers her emails with “friendly exclamation points.” Still, “good cop” sometimes plays as junior partner. The large, luxurious office that traditionally goes to the White House press secretary is, in the current administration, occupied by (male) deputy chief of staff for communications Taylor Budowich. Leavitt's office, down the hall, is less than half the size, an issue of which she has never complained in public. If the snub hurts her ambition, she does not show it. 

One frequently-told anecdote about Leavitt sums up the classic conservative persona she's playing with. Last summer, she went on maternity leave from her role as Trump's campaign press secretary. Three days after giving birth, holding her son in her arms, she turned on the television in time to see an assassin's bullet narrowly miss Trump's head. 

“I looked at my husband and said, ‘Looks like I'm going back to work,'” Leavitt told the right-wing blog Conservateur last fall. (The husband in question is 32 years older than her.) The publication dubbed her a “Wonder Woman” for her decision to return to the office just four days post-partum. 

The heroic young (white) mother is a classic Republican trope, and Leavitt's blonde hair and blue eyes equip her to embody it to the fullest. Leavitt's motherhood feminizes her work in the same way that Noem's makeover feminizes hers, making her unthreatening to an ideology that aims to undo the advances that allowed women to work in the first place. But where Noem's glamour carries troubling notes of vanity for her critics, Leavitt's motherhood can be positioned as selfless, traditional, Americana. 

Strikingly, though, what keeps coming up in profiles of both Leavitt and Noem is the idea of “sacrifice,” as though their different modes of femininity offer each woman the chance to showcase her submission to Trump. Leavitt gave up recuperation and time at home alone with her young child to serve as Trump's press secretary. Noem remolded her body in the image of the women with whom Trump surrounds himself. If they are each trying to play out a right-wing archetype, they do so before Trump on bended knee.

What should a MAGA woman be? Overtly feminine, certainly. Ambitious, perhaps, but submissive, too. What is most important, always, is an unfailing loyalty to Trump.

That, in the end, is the heart of the spectacle of Noem's militaristic videos and Leavitt's scolding and lies. What they are selling is whatever they think that Trump thinks a woman should be.

DJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.

by  Alex Abad-Santos

Clubs are, first and foremost, for dancing. One could theoretically do other things there — drink, meet strangers, conduct important and possibly illicit business deals, anything really — but likely everything but dancing could probably be done more efficiently somewhere else. At the same time, while no one's stopping anyone from dancing in other places that are more accessible and less expensive to shake and shimmy, from the gym to the bar to your own home, there isn't a better place to dance to loud music than a club. 

But what happens if the dancing stops?

According to DJs, nightclub owners, frequent club-goers, and a number of front-facing camera complaints over social media, a growing frustration at the dancery is a growing number of people not dancing. These nondancers are threatening to turn the club — a place where jumpin' jumpin', dancin' dancin', and maybe even love have all been promised — into one of those other places where no one dances. 

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

On the surface, the divide seems split between movers and non-shakers (with a little sprinkle of generational warfare), but it speaks to the very tenets of nightlife. The puzzling act of not dancing at a place designated for dancing is one of those mysteries that raises questions, if not calls for a full-blown investigation. Why did people stop dancing? What are they doing at the club if they're not dancing? Who's sitting out and who can we blame? Who's complaining? 

And perhaps most importantly: Is this really happening? 

The complaint, found at nightclubs all over, is simple: Instead of dancing on dance floors at nightclubs, people are doing everything but. They're standing around. They're trying to talk to everyone else. Worst of all, they're on their phones, scrolling or taking selfies.

“The killer is when I see someone scrolling through Facebook or Instagram,” says Ru Bhatt, who has been a professional club DJ for over a decade. “Really? This is the time that you want to engage with the most vapid version of social media?”

Bhatt understands when someone is quickly texting their friends, possibly to tell them that they've arrived or where they are on the dance floor. He acknowledges that people get nervous — understandable if you're at a function by yourself — and that a phone can feel like a bit of a security blanket. But when someone's actively disengaging with the people around them and the DJ that's playing, he says it's soul-crushing to see. 

“To be honest, I'm a stickler for not using your phone in a lot of places,” Bhatt says, explaining that some of his distaste for phones comes from feeling protective of the space — as a millennial, he's part of the last generation to experience what clubs were like before the rapid acceleration of the smartphone. 

“Presumably, if you're at the club, you want to connect with others, right?” Bhatt says. “I consider dancing with someone else a form of communication whether it's flirtatious or fun. It's a way we can connect physically.”

The concern that some people see nightclubs as places to be experienced phone-first, is strikingly similar to the post-pandemic grievances about people pulling their phones out at movie theaters or at concerts. Through a smartphone camera lens, everything becomes content to post rather than an experience to be had, and it's more important to look cool and be seen than actively participate in what's happening around you.

“It also seems like people tend to discover electronic music or events through Instagram and TikTok now, so we do have a generation of new attendees who saw a 15 second clip and it looks cool to them,” says Z, the moderator for the Reddit forum r/avesnyc, a subreddit dedicated to nightclubs, DJs, raves, and dance culture — which has over 70,000 members. “But that [clip] doesn't really capture the experience of going out all night and dancing for eight hours straight.”

 Z, who asked to go by their nickname to speak more frankly about nightlife and rave culture, said that crowd complaints often surface on the forum, but noted that people are more likely to post when they have a bad night rather than a good one, hence the seemingly oversized number of gripes. 

That said, Z doesn't solely blame phones or social media for the drop off in dancing. He suggests factors like the shift toward large-scale nightlife venues mimicking festival culture, where DJs are treated more like a concert; the lack of space at venues in denser cities, which may make club-goers more hesitant or sensitive; or the problem that those experienced in nightlife aren't keen on sharing their favorite parties or clubs with newbies, essentially gatekeeping the good parties from dance-floor duds. Other experts I spoke to also noted that participation varies from club to club, and that dance parties catering to the LGBTQ community tend to see more movement. 

The other thing to consider? This might not be new at all. 

“There's also just a reality that tons of people in the US who go to clubs, are not necessarily there to dance,” Z says. “Lots of people go to socialize with their friends, or to drink or do drugs, or to hook up with other people. Even on good dance floors, people who really have a passion for music and dancing tend to be a minority in my perception.” 

Jean's, a restaurant with an exclusive club space in downtown Manhattan, has never had a problem with people on their phones. 

“We famously have poor cell service downstairs,” general manager Carlos Cansados says. “It's kind of a joke, but we've never seen an issue with people on their phones because our reception is so bad.” 

Clubs without bad cell situations like Jean's have had to figure out their own solution. Some have soft suggestions about how the dance floor is strictly for dancing, and others have implemented a rigid no cell rule.

Though he respects the dance-first vibe that's been created in those spaces, that isn't necessarily the direction that Eli Escobar, a DJ and club co-owner, wants to take. 

Because so many clubs around the world struggled financially post-pandemic and shut down, it created a lack of diversity of the kinds of clubs that exist.

“I don't want to have to micromanage the way people are having fun,” Escobar says. “Nightlife is supposed to be a little bit wild. Micro-managing is not wild.” 

Back in December, Escobar and his partners opened Gabriela, a nightclub in another club-heavy neighborhood of New York City. Gabriela has a separate lounge and dance area. Escobar hopes that it's a little more self-evident that you should step off the dance floor if you want to get on your phone, that yapping is for the lounge, and that if you show up, you aren't there to stand around. 

“We were really intentional about our club,” Escobar says. “You can go upstairs and talk or text, or you can sit out front, but when you're on the dance floor, you don't need to do all of those things, and you hopefully just won't want to.”

That intentionality has also led to Escobar's current challenge at Gabriela: figuring out the door policy, which could mean turning away people based on a completely subjective vibe. By trying to ensure that everyone who's there wants to be there, it cuts down on the number of people ruining the vibe — aka people who don't dance. It enhances the experience for everyone (who gets in). 

At the same time, having a tougher door introduces rejection, which can feel at odds with being a place where everyone who wants to dance can find joy. Exclusivity can also make some places more desirable to people who are chasing the feeling of being let in while keeping someone else out. It's all in the balance when trying to create the right mood. 

“It's basically like, if your intentions are just to go out drinking for a night, then you don't need to come to Gabriela,” Escobar says. He added that there are so many bars in the city where people can just drink. What he wants to see at Gabriela are people who are there to hear good music, vibe, and dance, all while respecting the people around them. 

Escobar also posited a theory about why there's often people showing up to places that they may not enjoy, to listen to music that does not move them to dance. Because so many clubs around the world struggled financially post-pandemic and shut down, it created a lack of diversity of the kinds of clubs that exist. There aren't many places that, for example, play top 40 pop music — so the people looking for that music don't have a place to go. Yet, they still want to party, so they may end up going to a different kind of club that they see on social media — one that they may not enjoy. 

“I don't want to put, like, any bad energy out there,” Escobar says. “I don't want anyone to feel unwelcome if they legitimately were coming for the right reasons. We're still figuring it out, because we're still new, and we're still having talks like, ‘How can we do this differently? How could we have made that a bit of a friendlier interaction?'”

There's a door policy at Jean's too. 

Casados, the general manager, says having a door at Jean's is integral to the experience that they want to create there: People having the time of their lives underneath a disco ball. The door, the acts they're booking, the design of the space, and the lighting — Casados says it's all thoughtfully put together so no one (who gets in) has complaints about vibe-snuffers at the end of the night. 

“The challenge is that people get mad,” Casados says. “Pro tip: Bring your mom. You'll skip the line.” Just make sure she wants to dance. 

As long as clubs exist, there will always be a generation of people saying other, often younger people are ruining it. 

“I call it ‘back-in-the-day-ism,'” Escobar says. “I've gone through this cycle already a few times with older people complaining about the way younger people do things.” 

Escobar, who is Gen X, said that “back in the day,” older people complained about then-younger people facing the DJ booth — i.e., the concertification of a DJ that Z called out. This backlash also stemmed from a belief that some club-goers weren't properly engaging with one another, and were ruining the evening. 

“Old heads will be like, ‘These kids will never know about Limelight.' And I'm like, ‘Yeah, but Limelight wasn't that great,'” Escobar says, adding that there were grievances about nightlife — doormen, pretentious venues, bottle service — before the great “facing the DJ” controversy. There will be new gripes, he says, long after your, mine, and everyone's knees have all forced a retirement from clubbing. 

Escobar said that the key to having a great night out is to be seasoned enough to develop your own metrics of which parties, nights, and venues match your energy. It also means having the experience to know (and accept!) that every night isn't going to be a perfect night out. Inevitably there will be some times the vibes are just off — whether people are on their phones or not.

Swole of body, swole of mind.

by  Dylan Scott

Creatine — yes, the favorite of gym rats everywhere, a supplement many of us have taken ourselves — is a naturally occurring compound that is already found inside each person. Scientists have been studying creatine since the 1830s and, for more than a century, we have known that it was pivotal for producing energy in our muscles. 

That, as anybody who was alive in the '90s may remember, is how creatine first exploded as a consumer product. Swedish researchers published influential research in 1992 demonstrating creatine supplementation's effectiveness in improving stamina and recovery during the short bursts of physical exercise. It didn't take long after that for creatine supplements to hit the shelves of drugstores and workout gyms nationwide. And it was popular. Not only was it cheap — a 10-ounce jar of creatine costs $17 on Amazon — but it was also an easy way for bodybuilders and exercise enthusiasts to improve their performance. Today, as many as one in four adults say they have used creatine; $400 million worth of it is sold in the US every year.

And this was a supplement that really worked: A 2018 meta-analysis of the available research concluded that creatine is “the most effective nutritional supplement available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.” Across years of studies, no dangerous side effects have been detected. 

But the most surprising use of creatine supplements is in a setting that could not be further from the image of jacked-up bodybuilders pumping iron: treating depression.

In the early 2000s, scientists established creatine's importance not only for muscle use but also for brain function. The compound helps your brain to convert nutrients into energy and scientists concluded that poor metabolism could help to explain various psychiatric disorders, including depression. In layman's terms, if your brain wasn't processing energy efficiently, it could have these negative side effects. 

If that were true, it would follow that more creatine could improve a person's brain metabolism and thereby ease their depression. 

A decade ago, the first clinical trials began testing whether creatine supplements improved depression among people who were also receiving antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. The results have been impressive: A 2024 meta-review concluded that creatine had proven its effectiveness in supplementing those other treatments, leading people to feel better more quickly and be less likely to experience depression again.

Now comes a new study, out of India, suggesting creatine could be helpful in treating depression without antidepressants being involved — a preliminary but potentially important finding as we search for cheaper and easier ways to provide help to more people who need it.

The study, published earlier this year, was tiny and flew under the radar: 100 participants, in Dehradun, a city of 800,000 in India's far north. Lead researcher Nima Norbu Sherpa of Glasgow Caledonian University received a grant from an India-based charity, the Universal Human Rights and Social Development Association, to run the experiment.

The setting is telling: Part of creatine's appeal in mental health treatment is not only its potential efficacy but also that it's cheap and doesn't require a professional clinician; patients can take it on their own. That made Dehradun, a developing city with a lot of low-income patients and relatively few mental health clinicians, a logical place to test whether creatine could improve people's well-being without antidepressants, said Riccardo De Giorgi, a clinical lecturer in psychiatry at Oxford and co-author of the paper.

The 100 participants, recruited from the city and small surrounding villages, were split into two groups. Both groups took part in talk therapy sessions. One group also received 5 milligrams of creatine every day, while the other got a placebo.

After eight weeks, both groups were improving — cognitive behavioral therapy itself is, of course, a well-attested treatment for depression. But the patients who took creatine on top of their therapy were doing better still.

The participants answered a nine-question survey at the beginning of the study, which provided a one-number score of the severity of their depression symptoms. People in both groups started a little below 18 on average, indicating moderately severe depression. At the end of the study, the patients taking creatine reported a score of 5 on average, while the control group registered at 11. Eleven people who were taking creatine throughout the study reported going into remission, meaning they could effectively return to normal life; only five people taking placebos said the same. 

Both groups had about 20 people discontinue their treatment — not uncommon for people with depression, the authors noted. The reported side effects for people taking creatine were mild.

It is an eye-catching result, even as De Giorgi emphasized repeatedly that the findings were “incremental and preliminary.” The inevitably sensational nature of the finding — a bodybuilder supplement can help with depression? — warrants being clear and cautious in how we interpret the findings.

“Previous sensationalist messages in this research area, e.g., creatine, physical exercise, keto diet, have caused more harm to the science than benefit,'” De Giorgi told me over email.

For one, the high dropout rate is reason for skepticism about the precise size of creatine's effect. More research that replicates the same results is needed before we can be confident that creatine plus therapy is a winning combination.

But it's an area of research worth watching. Peter Attia, a physician who writes about longevity and health enhancement and was not involved with the study, wrote in covering the study's findings that “since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes.” Its affordability and ubiquity could also make it appealing for people with fewer resources, like those who participated in the India study.

He did, however, also caution that more evidence would be necessary before we can figure out whether and how creatine fits into “the therapeutic toolbox.”

As we grapple with a global mental health crisis, we need all of the tools we can find. More than two-thirds of the world's population can't get access to conventional mental health treatments. If we really have an alternative as cheap and available as creatine, it could make a real difference.

3 theories for Gen Z's return to God and faith.

by  Christian Paz

For most of the last 30 years, the story of religion in America has been a pretty steady one: a constant, and consistent, drop in religious affiliation every year. 

Starting in the 1990s, the share of Americans who identified as Christian, or identified with any religion at all, began to drop precipitously. At the same time, those with no religious affiliation — nicknamed “nones” — began to spike. 

Americans have been steadily losing their religion entirely. They haven't been converting to other religions, or getting religion later in life.

That trend might be ending. Over the last five years, the share of Americans who are “nones” has stabilized at roughly 30 percent, across multiple tracking surveys — largely because of one group: zoomers.

Sometime around or after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, young Americans began to find, or at least retain, religious belief at higher rates than previous generations. The numbers tell this story quite cleanly. While the share of “nones” jumped by about 40 percent from 2008 to 2013, the rise began to slow between 2013 and 2018.

Then, in 2020, it stagnated. 

According to associate professor of political science and data analyst Ryan Burge, who has been tracking this trend over the last few years, that stagnation can largely be traced to younger generations now losing their religion at slower rates than older generations. 

“From a pure statistical standpoint, I don't know if we can say with any certainty whether there's a larger share of nones in the United States today than there was in 2019,” he wrote in 2024.

Gen Z seems to be the key. Recently, The Economist analyzed findings from the General Social Survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center, and found that zoomers are the only generation not losing their religious affiliation. Why? There's no unifying explanation for this trend, but it extends beyond the United States. And that suggests that there might be some structural reasons Gen Z is rediscovering faith. Something about post-Covid seems to be bringing youth back to Christianity, specifically, but also to religion in general.

There are three potential explanations:

That Gen Z, and younger Americans in general, feels more lonely and isolated from each other and society in general is one of the defining stories of the 2020s. Anywhere from two-thirds to three-quarters of Gen Z reports feeling isolated, alone, or disconnected from the world, a dynamic that has bled into the way they socialize, date, get married, or find community in general.

Some have attributed this dynamic to the rise of social media, and of smartphones, in the pandemic lockdown period that defined the adolescence of so much of Gen Z, and a resulting “mental health crisis” in response. 

Just how unique these are to Gen Z (as opposed to how any generation might have felt during these tumultuous years of life), is up for debate still, but it still follows that some members of this generation who do feel isolated or lost might be finding community and friendship in organized religion.

This social aspect to religion, and the idea of a third space or community created through churches, is an oft-repeated explanation in the reporting and surveying of zoomers who are returning to church. Church offers “solace,” and young newcomers report attending services “to feel less ‘lost'.” As one Massachusetts zoomer told The Economist, though friends and family may come and go, “people in church don't get to reject you.”

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Relatedly, religiosity and spirituality becoming less taboo among Gen Z might be a part of a countercultural, counter-status quo, anti-incumbency energy that has swept many Western democracies since the pandemic's outbreak. It might seem odd to think of religion as countercultural, but at least for many of the youngest Americans, growing religious disaffiliation has been the popular narrative and posturing of their elders.

In that way, it makes sense that religious unaffiliation might have hit a ceiling at the start of the Covid-era, as Western societies — and particularly younger people — began to question orthodoxies, political and secular institutions, and conventional political parties and leaders.

Some young respondents to surveys and journalists report that atheism, agnosticism, and indifference to religion became a kind of status-quo, mainstream opinion, boosted in particular by the quick religious dissociation of the millennial generation — the cohort of Americans who seem to have had the strongest liberal and secular bend. At least in the United Kingdom and in the United States, some degree of Gen Z's slowing religious dissociation is related to an increase in anti-mainstream, anti-status quo religious fervor: In the United Kingdom, for example, where Anglicanism has long been the mainstream, Catholicism has recently fueled the the rise in religious identification. In the United States, where various types of Protestantism used to be associated with elite culture, Catholicism has risen on the right, while various evangelical, and both Catholicism more tolerant nondenominational Christian churches, have grown, as opposed to more popular atheism or agnosticism.

There's a sharp gender divide in who is driving the Gen Z religious shift. Young Gen Z men are becoming much more religious, while young women keeping a religious affiliation are shifting to more politically liberal and tolerant faith traditions, particularly in the US.

This gender divide is quite dramatic: Gen Z men are significantly more likely to attend religious services than Gen Z women, a reversal from what the norm was in the US. And young women are leaving American churches en masse, largely because of political and ideological cross-pressures on what these churches teach about gender norms, sexual identity, and gender equality, as well as the roles they offer women in religious institutions and the political leanings of some churches, according to research from the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life.

One Survey Center study, for example, found that about two-thirds of young women believe “most churches and religious congregations” don't treat men and women equally, while the Public Religion Research Institute has consistently found that the “negative treatment of gay and lesbian people” has been key driver of young women away from organized religions. That might be amplified by the fact that high rates of Gen Z women, some three in 10, now identify as LGBTQ.

At the same time, the subtle integration of religious traits into the teachings and preachings of some alt-right, manosphere-adjacent content creators who have a particular reach with young men, might be amplifying this tension. The result is a generation of men finding community and belonging in religion, that reinforces their existing political preferences, and causes a further rightward lurch (as was seen in the 2024 election).

Whether these trends continue doesn't seem guaranteed. If anything the data suggests we may have reached a temporary equilibrium in religious affiliation and belief that might change as older, more religious Americans, continue to pass away. The strongest social research suggests that biggest driver and predictor of continued religious identification is how religious your parents were — so if a more religious and faithful Gen Z ends up keeping that faith, and raising their children with the same norms, what looked like an inevitable and endless decline in American religiosity may have been less drastic than it appeared.

Canary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.

by  Zack Beauchamp

About nine years ago, a new organization called Canary Mission released a YouTube video describing their mission: maintaining a blacklist of anti-Israel college students.

American campuses, the video warns, had become hotbeds of anti-Israel extremism: safe spaces for students to attend “Jew-hating conferences and anti-American rallies.” To fight this, Canary Mission would build an extensive database of students and professors who engaged in anti-Israel activity. The primary intent, per the video, is to ensure that anti-Israel students cannot find gainful employment after graduation.

“These individuals are applying for jobs within your company,” the Canary Mission video warns. “It is your duty to ensure that today's radicals are not tomorrow's employees.”

Over the course of the next decade, Canary Mission — which takes its name from the expression “canary in the coal mine” — delivered on its promise. 

Its database now contains mini-profiles of thousands of students and professors, and has expanded to include professionals like doctors and nurses. People listed in the database have been harassed, disciplined, and even fired. Israeli intelligence has used Canary Mission profiles as justification for detaining listed visitors at the border.

And since the second Trump administration began, Canary Mission's targets have started to be deported from the United States.

After plainclothes officers arrested Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk on the streets of Boston in late March, Öztürk's attorneys claimed the sole reason for her arrest was her Canary Mission profile. While the Trump administration claims she had engaged in activity “in support of Hamas,” the private Homeland Security memo justifying her detention only cited an op-ed she had written in support of boycotting Israel, using language very similar to her Canary Mission page. 

The organization, for its part, is happy to take the credit (though it did not respond to my request for comment). After Öztürk's arrest, Canary Mission's X account posted a celebratory tweet claiming “sources point to her Canary Mission profile as the primary cause.” It currently maintains a list of seven other students and professors who it believes should be targeted for deportation. Two of these, Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, are currently in ICE custody. Mahdawi was arrested after his name appeared on this list (Khalil was arrested before it was published).

Canary Mission's rise is not really a story about one organization, or even the toxic climate of America's Israel-Palestine debate. Rather, it is a case study in how civil society organizations — normally seen as pillars of liberal democratic life — can become agents of illiberalism. And when such groups can align themselves with a friendly government, the danger rises exponentially.

There are many pro-Israel activist in groups in the United States, and many that focus on college campuses specifically. But Canary Mission is unusual in two respects: its opaque structure and extremely aggressive tactics.

Canary Mission's website does not list a president, board, or a staff directory. On paper, its headquarters are in Israel — specifically Beit Shemesh, a medium-sized city near Jerusalem. Yet the address listed on its paperwork is in a padlocked, seemingly abandoned building.

Over the years, reporters have identified some of the Canary Mission's revenue streams — including significant donations from some prominent American Jewish philanthropies. But much of the Canary Mission's funding remains anonymous due to its use of a pass-through group, called Central Fund of Israel (CFI). 

Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them.

American donors can give to CFI without having to disclose whether the money is earmarked for Canary Mission, and CFI can disburse funds to Canary without noting their original source. It's an unusual setup that effectively allows Canary Mission to keep its funding sources fully anonymous.

“It really stands out when you look at other similar organizations in the same ecosystem,” says Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Israel-Palestine program at the Arab Center think tank in DC. “I can't think of another one that hides their funding like this.”

The obvious irony — that an organization dedicated to naming and shaming is itself so opaque — is palpable. But it is necessary, in part, because Canary Mission has been a lightning rod for controversy even within the pro-Israel community.

No matter what you think about pro-Israel groups' views of American college campuses, they clearly have the right to express their views and organize around them. And many of these groups engage in political activity — like documenting Jewish students' concerns about campus antisemitism or creating new right-leaning Middle East studies journals — that are within the confines of legitimate debate and activism in a democratic society.

But Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. 

Lila Corwin Berman, a historian of Jewish philanthropy at New York University, dates this approach to roughly the early 2000s. During that time, pro-Israel organizations like Campus Watch and the David Project began publicly targeting professors and students that they believed had engaged in unacceptable speech. 

These efforts were haphazard at the outset, publishing specific attacks on allegedly problematic scholars rather than maintaining a full-on blacklist. Canary Mission's database, first unveiled in 2014, represented a qualitative escalation — one explicitly aimed at creating professional problems for anti-Israel activists.

This was highly controversial. In 2018, pro-Israel campus groups at five major universities published a joint op-ed calling on the movement to repudiate Canary Mission.

“We are compelled to speak out against this website because it uses intimidation tactics, is antithetical to our democratic and Jewish values, is counterproductive to our efforts and is morally reprehensible,” they wrote.

This internal criticism did not do much to stop the Canary Mission's growth, fueled as it was by unaccountable backers. Today, Canary Mission's searchable database is vast — containing entries for over 2,000 individuals across 38 states, DC, and five Canadian provinces. 

To understand why Canary Mission is so controversial, start by looking at how its blacklist works.

Each individual listing contains both a dossier documenting the target's alleged offenses and their contact information, including direct links to their social media accounts that can facilitate targeted harassment campaigns. The only official way to get an entry deleted is to release a public apology with evidence of new pro-Israel beliefs; these testimonials are then posted on the “ex-Canary” segment of the Mission's website.

Some Canary Mission targets have said or done something that many would find offensive, such as endorsing the October 7, 2023, massacre. But the vast majority of profiles I could find were individuals who either attended a pro-Palestinian rally or wrote something critical about Israel's policies towards the Palestinians.

Canary Mission will describe this banal activity in threatening terms, like “attending a pro-Hamas rally.” But the speech in question is more than just legally protected: It is exactly the sort of political activity that people in a democracy are supposed to use as a vehicle for expressing their opinion. The Mission's database isn't primarily about identifying examples of extreme anti-Israel speech or political violence — it is about trying to silence any criticism of Israel by labeling it antisemitic or pro-terrorist.

Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student facing deportation, is a case in point.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

The Canary Mission profile that reportedly led to her ICE arrest listed a single offense — an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper calling on the university to (among other things) “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Agree or disagree with these positions, advocating for them is clearly legitimate political speech. There is no plausible case that people like Öztürk constitute any kind of threat to Jews on campus. That she is listed by Canary Mission — and that the organization publicly cheered her arrest — reveals its primary interest in policing speech critical of Israel by any means necessary.

This can also be seen by the sheer number of Jewish students and professors on the Canary Mission's database.

The American Jewish community is fairly left-wing; roughly two-thirds disapprove of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government. While a strong majority supports Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, large numbers of American Jews believe its occupation of Palestinian territory is both strategically unwise and morally indefensible. There is also a minority of anti-Zionist American Jews, more prominent in younger generations, who support the dissolution of Israel and its replacement with a binational state.

If you scan the Canary Mission database, Jewish students and scholars make up many of the entries. Reading their dossiers, like the profile of eminent Holocaust historian Omer Bartov, their alleged offenses include everything from criticizing the Netanyahu government's approach to judicial reform to attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration.

If Canary Mission were truly about protecting Jews' rights to participate freely in campus life, then it wouldn't include them on a database explicitly designed to hurt their career prospects.

We don't know for a fact that the Trump administration is using Canary Mission's database to identify deportation targets. There is suggestive evidence: The wording in the State Department memo justifying Öztürk's deportation, for example, is very similar to what appeared on her Canary profile). But so far, there is no direct proof of a link.

The depressing thing is that it makes all the sense in the world.

Yet regardless of whether Canary Mission entries are currently directing policy, it's clear they wish to be seen as doing so. They do this not only by maintaining their list of seven people they wish were deported, but also posting messages in support for actual deportations with slogans like “pro-Hamas extremism has consequences” and “no more safe havens for terror supporters.”

These messages demonstrate an undeniable hostility to basic liberal values. Canary Mission has graduated from “merely” advocating professional consequences for pro-Palestinian voices to endorsing outright state repression against them. They are sliding down a slippery slope at a rapid clip.

The depressing thing is that it makes all the sense in the world. 

The idea of trying to silence political opponents rather than debate them is dangerous. There are certainly cases where speech merits consequences: If a professor says discriminatory things about Jewish students, for example, or an activist advocates violence against her peers. But these are generally seen as exceptions rather than rules in free societies: the “boundary cases” where toleration for political expression runs up against other important values.

Canary Mission was founded on the opposite principle: that an entire category of speech, pro-Palestinian advocacy, should be treated as presumptively illegitimate. They believe the cause of defending Israel is best served not by engaging in rigorous debate and advocacy, but by making a giant list of people who believe the “wrong” things and ensuring they suffer consequences for those beliefs. 

This is illiberalism as practiced by civil society — and is, necessarily, less dangerous than illiberalism enforced by the state. But when illiberalism takes root in an influential sector of society, such as pro-Israel activism, it becomes a potential ally for an illiberal regime. 

No elected leader can turn a democracy into an authoritarian regime on their own. They need partners, influential people and organizations that can operate to weaken resistance to democratic backsliding and help create a climate of fear in which anti-government activity is perceived as costly.

The go-to examples are usually people with physical power and money — generals, police chiefs, and the wealthy elite. But there's a growing recognition that other social groups, even ones that seemingly lack soldiers or billions, can assist in undermining democracy's foundations.

In 2001, the political theorists Simone Chambers and Jeffrey Kopstein warned of a phenomenon they termed “bad civil society.” This is a phenomenon that they describe as “civic participation that weakens liberal democracy” — weaponizing the tools of organizing and activism to oppose the very democratic principles that allow them in the first place. 

At the time, it appeared that “illiberal forces are small, marginalized, and contained” in the United States. However, Chambers and Kopstein warned, this doesn't mean they'll always be irrelevant. 

Even if “illiberal forces cannot destabilize the state,” the authors write, “they can still “contribute to an insidious erosion of values that leaves liberalism vulnerable to all sorts of threat.”

Canary Mission's behavior in the past 10 years shows that this warning was prescient. The organization isn't just cheering Trump on from the sidelines; they have put together a public list of potential deportation targets. They are gleefully reveling in the fact that their longtime mission of suppressing speech is now backed by force of law.

Gwyneth Paltrow, 52, is ditching her strict paleo diet.

On the Tuesday episode of her ""Goop"" podcast, Paltrow spoke about how her relationship with food has changed over the years.

""I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time. That was an interesting chapter where I got kind of obsessed with eating very, very healthily,"" Paltrow said.

Part of it was because of her dad's health, she said: ""I think that I was really trying to heal my dad by proxy, and he just didn't really want anything to do with it."" Her father died in 2002 after battling throat cancer.

The Goop founder started thinking more critically about the types of food she was putting into her body.

""But the beauty of it, for me, was that I really deepened my connection with food and this whole philosophy around macrobiotics, which is essentially just how they eat in the mountains of Japan,"" Paltrow said. ""So, very local, very seasonal, lots of fish and vegetables, rice, no dairy, no sugar, et cetera.""

Although the ""Shakespeare in Love"" star says that she ""might have gotten a little didactic about it,"" all she wanted to do was share her eating philosophy with everyone she knew.

""I think I was just so amazed that, you know, we had this power in our hands that if we treated ourselves well, hydrated, and ate whole foods, we could just feel so much better,"" Paltrow said.

She added that she was ""intoxicated"" by that idea, and still feels the same to this day.

""But it's the reason Brad and I became paleo a few years ago now, although I'm a little sick of it, if I'm honest, and getting back into eating some sourdough bread and some cheese,"" Paltrow said. ""There, I said it. A little pasta, after being strict with it for so long.""

""But again, I think it's a good sort of template, right? Eating foods that are kind of as whole and fresh as possible,"" she added.

A paleo diet is supposed to be based on the way ancient human ancestors ate and includes foods such as lean meats, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. It emphasizes eating unprocessed foods, and grains and dairy are off limits.

Paltrow's comments come months after her company, Goop, told Women's Wear Daily that it was restructuring. 

The company was moving away from wellness, home, and travel and focusing on beauty, fashion, and food instead. It will double down on its Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop beauty brands, its G. Label clothing line, and Goop Kitchen.

Paltrow has previously detailed her strict diet and wellness routine during an interview for ""The Art of Being Well"" podcast in 2023.

Her restrictive diet, which drew widespread criticism from internet users and dietitians, included coffee in the mornings, bone broth for lunch, and a paleo diet for dinner.

A representative for Paltrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Anti-Elon Musk and anti-Tesla protesters are celebrating a win after the automaker's earnings miss on Tuesday.

""Today's earnings report sends a very clear message,"" the Tesla Takedown organization wrote in an email on Tuesday. ""The Tesla Takedown grassroots pressure is beginning to hit Tesla where it hurts — the company's bottom line.""

Tesla's first-quarter earnings report showed that the automaker fell short on revenue and earnings per share. In the follow-up call, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that vandalism and anti-Tesla hostility ""had an impact in certain markets."" Musk also announced during the call that he plans to take a significant step back from his role with DOGE starting next month.

The apparent impact of the protests seems to have spurred more interest in organizing efforts.

Tesla Takedown told Business Insider that its post-earnings email announcement had an open rate of over 53%, an increase from the roughly 30% average open rate it had in its four previous emails. The organization also said that more than 30 new protests were added to its Action Network page within about 24 hours of the earnings release. During the same period, it said its follower count on Bluesky rose by 10% to 15%, compared to its typical weekly growth on social media of less than 5%.

The group, which has organized hundreds of protests in the past few months against Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, also said in a press release that ""the movement to hold Musk accountable for attacks"" on public services will move beyond Tesla.

""Tesla Takedown has already started laying the groundwork to expand Tesla Takedown efforts to target other Musk businesses including SpaceX, Starlink, X and xAI,"" the organization said in the statement.

Other similar protest movements against Musk show little sign of slowing down. Just a day after Tesla's earnings release, climate activists staged a demonstration at a San Francisco dealership, accusing the company of ""greenwashing"" and calling for Musk's removal as CEO. Some of the protesters were arrested.

A representative for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

His comments came as the US leader rushes to end the war with the 100-day mark in his presidency approaching. Trump has ramped up pressure on Zelenskiy to accept a peace deal that critics fear will favor Moscow.

Trump and the EU are increasingly clashing over the latter's role as the world's chief digital rulemaker, and the President has lambasted the bloc's tech regulations and fines as unfairly targeting US companies.

US President Donald Trump's administration is putting pressure on Europe to ditch a rulebook that would compel developers of advanced artificial intelligence to follow stricter standards of transparency, risk-mitigation and copyright rules.

The US government's Mission to the EU reached out to the European Commission to push back against the AI code of practice in the last few weeks. The letter argues against the adoption of the code in its current form, and also went out to several European governments, people familiar with the matter said.

For centuries, gold has been the go-to haven asset in times of political and economic uncertainty. Its status as a reliably high-value commodity that can be transported easily and sold anywhere offers a sense of safety when everything else is in turmoil.

Not everyone's a fan.

President Donald Trump misjudged Beijing by calculating that it would cave into economic pressure, leaving the US unprepared to handle the current tariff standoff, according to an adviser to China's Foreign Ministry.

“The mainstream narrative within the Trump team is that because the Chinese economy is bad, if the US plays the tariff card, then China will have no choice but to surrender,” said Wu Xinbo, director at Fudan University's Center for American Studies in Shanghai, who last year led a group of experts in the ministry to meet politicians and business executives in the US.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge on Friday after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced in an X post that Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstruction for allegedly assisting Eduardo Flores-Ruiz in avoiding arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week.

A U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman confirmed to CNBC that Dugan was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. local time on courthouse property.

The arrest of a judge marks a sharp escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S.

Dugan was released on bond after making her initial appearance Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee before Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries, according to her case docket. Dugan's ""arraignment and plea"" proceeding is set for May 15, the docket shows.

Milwaukee County Circuit Court Chief Judge Carl Ashley told NBC that the judicial code of conduct restricts him from commenting on the matter, but said Dugan's court calendar ""will be covered by another judge as needed.""

Patel in his tweet wrote that the FBI believes Dugan ""intentionally misdirected federal agents away"" from Flores-Ruiz as agents were attempting to arrest him at her courthouse.

""Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public,"" Patel said in the post.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Tuesday that the FBI was looking into Dugan's conduct surrounding an attempted arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at her courthouse on April 18.

On that day, Dugan ""became visibly angry"" after learning that ICE agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Flores-Ruiz after a hearing in his criminal battery case, according to a sworn affidavit unsealed Friday.

Dugan and another judge entered the hallway and confronted the arrest team, telling one deportation officer that he needed a judicial warrant to make an arrest instead of an ""administrative warrant."" Dugan then ordered them to the chief judge's office, the affidavit alleged.

After returning to her courtroom, Dugan ""escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel"" through a jury door, which leads to a nonpublic area of the building, the affidavit stated, citing ""multiple witnesses.""

Flores-Ruiz and his attorney then returned to the hallway and took an elevator down to leave the building, the special agent alleged. After being told that Flores-Ruiz was in front of the courthouse, agents ran toward him and identified themselves as law enforcement officers.

""Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued,"" according to the affidavit. 

""The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained,"" it alleged.

Dugan's criminal complaint shows she has been charged with concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, and obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a federal department or agency.

ICE agents have previously arrested people in the courthouse hallways in March and April, according to the Journal Sentinel.

ICE did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A person who answered a call to Dugan's chambers declined to comment.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC, ""The days of actively aiding and abetting illegal aliens invading our country are over.""

""The Trump administration will never waver on putting Americans and America First with a no-nonsense approach to immigration enforcement. In this administration, anyone who commits crimes exposes themselves to criminal liability,"" Desai said.

In this article

Novo Nordisk scored a huge legal victory that largely restricts compounding pharmacies from marketing or selling cheaper, unapproved versions of the drugmaker's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. 

A federal judge in Texas late Thursday rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to keep making copies of Ozempic and Wegovy while a legal challenge over the shortage of those drugs unfolds. That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shorter in the U.S.

Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments. 

During FDA-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. Many telehealth companies, such as Hims & Hers, also offered those copycats. But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs. 

""We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage"" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement. 

""Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working,"" he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states. 

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide. 

That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient.

Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA.

Those pharmacies make compounded drugs according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient and are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA.

The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies. 

The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide.

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the last two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight loss and diabetes drugs.

Eli Lilly has gone through a similar legal process with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug. 

In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound. The compounding group has appealed.

President Donald Trump denied that a strong bond market sell-off influenced his decision earlier this month to hold off on aggressive ""reciprocal"" tariffs against U.S. trading partners.

""I wasn't worried,"" Trump said in a Time magazine interview during which he was asked about financial market tumult after his April 2 ""Liberation Day"" announcement.

In the decree, Trump slapped 10% across-the-board duties against all U.S. imports and released a list of tariffs against dozens of other nations. The extra levies were based on trade deficits the U.S. had against the respective countries and raised fears about inflation, a potential recession and disruption of long-held trade agreements.

Markets recoiled following the release. Treasury yields initially headed lower but quickly snapped higher. The 10-year yield rose half a percentage point in just a few days, one of its quickest moves ever, as investors also ditched stocks and the U.S. dollar.

Ultimately, Trump issued a 90-day stay on the reciprocal tariffs to allow time for negotiation. But he said it wasn't because of the market tumult.

""No, it wasn't for that reason,"" Trump told Time in the interview from Tuesday that was published Friday. ""I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don't even want them to come in.""

Yields have since moved lower, with the 10-year most recently around 4.28%, about a quarter percentage point higher than its recent low. Trump had said when he made the decision to hold off that the bond market had gotten the ""yips.""

""The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn't. Because I know what we have,"" he said. ""I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running — it was running as a free spirit. This was — this was the most incompetent president in history.""

Though negotiations over tariffs are ongoing, Trump added that he would consider it a ""total victory"" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now.

BEIJING — China plans to help struggling businesses with targeted measures in the face of ""increased external shocks,"" according to a readout of a meeting chaired Friday by President Xi Jinping.

The meeting of the Politburo, the second most powerful political body in China, comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated this month with new tit-for-tat tariffs of more than 100%. Major Wall Street banks have cut their China GDP forecasts for the year as a result, while the country still strives to achieve its lofty goal of ""around 5%"" growth set in March.

Authorities called for ""multiple measures to help businesses in difficulty,"" such as financial support, according to the Chinese-language readout, translated by CNBC.

The Politburo also called for ""timely reduction” of interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio — the amount of cash banks need to have on hand.

Policymakers are sticking with their stance from earlier this year, while indicating flexibility for targeted measures, said Zong Liang, chief researcher at Bank of China. For mitigating the impact of tariffs, he expects China will do more research on specific businesses, and consider how to support them.

In a rare move, China in March raised its deficit target to 4% of GDP. Finance Minister Lan Fo'an indicated at the time that China had more room to act on fiscal policy.

Since the escalation in U.S. trade tensions this month, local Chinese governments and major businesses have announced efforts to help exporters redirect their products to the domestic market for sale.

The Politburo meeting readout emphasized the need to increase the income of middle and lower-income groups, and boost services consumption. The leaders also called for further tech development, including the integration of artificial intelligence.

""The press release shows the government is ready to launch new policies when the economy is affected by the external shock,"" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.

""It seems Beijing is not in a rush to launch a large stimulus at this stage,"" he said. ""It takes time to monitor and evaluate the timing and the size of the trade shock.""

The CSI 300 briefly turned lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index trimmed gains after the meeting statement was released.

China's Politburo, composed of high-level members of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, tends to lay out broad policy directives.

The latest meeting reaffirmed policies from the State Council — the top executive body — and government ministries, ""underscoring high-level commitment and collaboration,"" said Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School.

""While they may not offer many unexpected and ground breaking surprises, these measures equip policymakers with tools to navigate external uncertainties,"" he said, adding he expects a forthcoming private sector law to further improve the business environment.

The standing committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, is scheduled to meet from Sunday to Wednesday, and review a new law to support the private sector.

Emerging markets have found themselves between a rock and a hard place amid an escalating trade war, seemingly forced to choose between China and the U.S. But there's another way: they're backing themselves.

""Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia, have to negotiate with the U.S. to come up with some sort of a soft-landing spot,"" Ong Kian Ming, Malaysia's former deputy minister of international trade and industry, told CNBC. ""But at the same time, it doesn't prevent us from working with other countries — not to screw the U.S., but to benefit ourselves.""

Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable to an escalating global trade war. Goldman Sachs has cut its growth forecasts for Asian emerging markets, saying smaller export-oriented economies are the most exposed to the tariff turmoil. 

The bank's 2025 GDP forecast for Vietnam is now 5.3% — significantly lower than consensus estimates of 6.5% cited by Goldman. The bank expects Malaysia to grow by 3.8% (compared to 4.7%) next year, and Thailand to expand by 1.5% (compared to 2.7%).

Southeast Asian nations were among the hardest hit on U.S. President Donald Trump's self-declared ""Liberation Day."" They're due to be hit with tariffs of up to 49% after a 90-day temporary reduction to 10% on all countries (bar China) is lifted.

It means the region faces a difficult balancing act as the U.S. is not its only strategic partner — China also plays a crucial role for medium-term growth and development objectives for many emerging Asian economies, according to Lavanya Venkateswaran, senior ASEAN economist at the OCBC Bank. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia earlier this month in an effort to promote Beijing as a pillar of stability and boost ties within the region. He also called on the Global South ""to uphold the common interests of developing countries.""

And it appears to be happening.

UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan told CNBC's Squawk Box this month that intra-regional trade is growing.

""One interesting indicator that we have from the last year, in this century, is that South-South trade has already been growing faster than North-North trade,"" she said. ""So the acceleration of South-South trade, I think, will take a new dynamism because of the new trade policy of the U.S.""

Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysian prime minister and current rotating chair of ASEAN, echoed this sentiment, calling for more trade and greater economic integration within the region in a keynote speech at the ASEAN Investment Summit in early April.

While there are no ""easy solutions,"" emerging economies are expected to try different approaches in a bid to mitigate the impact of U.S. tariffs, according to Lavanya Venkateswaran, an economist at OCBC.

""In the near-term, the authorities will have to tap fiscal and monetary policy tools to provide counter-cyclical support to affected sectors of the economy. For the medium-term, the authorities understand the need to diversify trade and investment partners,"" she said.

 It helps that the so-called ""China+1"" strategy still holds in the medium-term, she added. Many export-oriented Southeast Asia economies were big beneficiaries of the strategy during the first Trump administration, receiving economic boosts as companies shifted production away from China to their shores. 

In Cambodia, for instance, according to data from the World Bank, Cambodia's exports of goods and services made up 55.5% of its gross domestic product in 2018, before Trump imposed his first China tariffs — by 2023, this figure had risen to 66.9%.

Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed, saying that these emerging markets are more attractive than China as export manufacturing hubs in the long term.

""It's also worth bearing in mind that these tariffs do nothing to eliminate the labor cost competitiveness of EM Asia ex-China economies (versus China), which will remain a big selling point over the long term to multinationals,"" he told CNBC by email. ""New supply chains won't be created overnight.""

For 10 years, Aaron Cordovez has been selling kitchen appliances on Amazon. Now he's in a bind, because most of his products are manufactured in China.

Cordovez, co-founder of Zulay Kitchen, said his company is moving ""as fast as we can"" to move production to India, Mexico and other markets, where tariffs are increasing under President Donald Trump, but are mild compared with the levies imposed on goods from China. That process will likely take at least a year or two to complete, he said.

""We're making our inventory last as long as we can,"" Cordovez said in an email.

Zulay is also temporarily raising the price of some of its milk frothers, smores roasting sticks and other products. The company's popular kitchen strainer now costs $12.99, up from $9.99 before Trump announced his sweeping tariff proposal earlier this month.

Amazon merchants are hiking prices for everything from diaper bags and refrigerator magnets to charm necklaces and other top-selling items as they confront higher import costs. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29% in categories, including clothing, jewelry, household items, office supplies, electronics and toys.

In a statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson called the claim ""sensationalized"" and said the research covers ""a tiny fraction of items in our store."" Amazon said that, based on its view of the research, fewer than 1% ""of the items studied saw an increase in price.""

""We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon,"" the statement said. ""And we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items."" 

The trade war with China has threatened to upend sellers on Amazon's third-party marketplace, which accounts for about 60% of the company's online sales. Many merchants are based in China or rely on the world's second-largest economy to source and assemble their products.

Sellers are now faced with the conundrum of raising prices or eating the extra costs associated with Trump's new tariffs. It's an existential threat for many sellers, who subsist on razor-thin margins and have, for the last several years, dealt with rising costs on Amazon tied to storage, fulfillment, shipping and advertising fees along with pricing pressure from increased competition.

CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC earlier this month that the company was ""going to try and do everything we can"" to keep prices low for shoppers, including renegotiating terms with some of its suppliers. But he acknowledged some third-party sellers will ""need to pass that cost"" of tariffs on to consumers.

Amazon's stock price is down 15% so far this year, sliding along with the broader market. The company reports first-quarter earnings next week.

Goods imported from China now face import duties of 145%, though Trump said Wednesday his administration is ""actively"" talking with China about a potential deal to lower tariffs. Chinese officials on Thursday denied that trade talks are taking place.

About 25% of the price increases observed by SmartScout were initiated by sellers based in China, said Scott Needham, the company's CEO. Last week, stainless steel jewelry maker Ursteel hiked prices on four of its products by $6.50, while apparel brand Chouyatou raised the price of some of its dresses by $2. Both businesses are based in China's Zhejiang province.

Anker, a Chinese electronics brand and one of Amazon's largest sellers, has raised prices on one-fifth of its products sold in the U.S., including a portable power bank, which went up to $135 from $110, SmartScout data shows.

Representatives from Anker, Ursteel and Chouyatou didn't respond to requests for comment.

Zulay, headquartered in Florida, is one of many U.S.-based sellers raising prices. The company is also cutting costs. Cordovez said he's been forced to lay off 19% of his workforce and slash online ad spending by 85%.

Desert Cactus, based in Illinois, is also taking action. Joe Stefani, the company's president, has been looking to move production of some of his brand's college-themed merchandise out of China and into Mexico, India and Vietnam. About half of Desert Cactus' goods come from China, while the rest are made in the U.S., Stefani said.

One of the company's top products is a customizable license plate frame that's manufactured in China. At the start of Trump's first term in 2016, Stefani's company paid import and shipping fees of 4% on the license plates. That rate has since skyrocketed to 170%, he said.

""The tariffs can't stay this high,"" Stefani said. ""There's so many people that just aren't going to make it.""

Stefani said he expects Desert Cactus will end up raising prices on some products, though he's worried shoppers might be put off by sticker shock.

""Will someone be willing to pay $50 for a hat on Amazon?"" Stefani said. ""You know it's going to be expensive at the ballpark, but on Amazon we don't know.""

Dave Dama, co-founder of health and beauty business Pure Daily Care, said the price to manufacture one of his skin-care products in China jumped to $25 from $10. Most Amazon sellers will have no choice but to raise prices, he said.

""If you were selling something for $40 and making a $7 or $8 profit at the end of the day, with these tariffs, those days are gone,"" Dama said. ""You can't do that anymore. It's unsustainable.""

Pure Daily Care plans to stagger price increases over several weeks, and only on products ""we absolutely need to,"" to keep Amazon's algorithms from ranking it lower in search results or losing the valuable buy box, he said. The buy box determines which listing pops up first when a shopper clicks on a particular product, and the one that gets purchased when they tap ""Add to Cart.""

An Amazon spokesperson said the company's pricing policies continue to apply.

""As always, sellers set their own prices, and we regularly monitor how we highlight great prices as Featured Offers to provide customers with low prices across a wide selection,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

Dama said his company has enough inventory for some products to last up to six months, which it aims to ""stretch as long as possible"" in the hope that China and the U.S. can reach a trade deal. The company is also forgoing some sales promotions and discounts, while pausing spend on some display and video ads.

Regarding his inventory, Dama said, ""We can try to stretch that seven, eight, nine months, which buys us a lot more time for this thing to work out, hopefully.""

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia markets rose after Wall Street gained for a third straight day as tech stocks rallied, with investors assessing the trade climate as the U.S. tones down tariff rhetoric and China reportedly mulls suspending tariffs.

China may waive its 125% tariff on certain U.S. goods, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the matter. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.24% higher, closing at 21,963.09 while mainland China's CSI 300 traded flat to close at 3,786.99.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.9% to close at 35,705.74 and the Topix added 1.37% to end the trading day at 2,628.03. South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.95% to close at 2,546.3 while the small-cap Kosdaq rose 0.5% to close at 729.69 as South Korea also reportedly inches closer to striking a trade deal with the U.S.

Australian markets are closed for a holiday.

Futures linked to the S&P 500 were 0.3% higher, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered around the flatline.

Overnight stateside, the three major averages closed higher thanks to strong gains in megacap tech names, as investors continued to look for signs of progress on the global trade front.

The S&P 500 ended up 2.03% at 5,484.77, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 2.74% to finish at 17,166.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two indexes, weighed down by a 6.6% drop in IBM, but still added 486.83 points, or 1.23%, at 40,093.40. 

Shares of Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Microsoft all closed higher, propelling the major averages to their third day of gains in a row

""Investors are becoming more comfortable with the uncertainties of tariffs as earnings roll in,"" said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates. ""The market seems to be positioning itself for a near-term reduction in the current sky-high China tariffs,"" he added.

— CNBC's Lisa Kailai Han and Pia Singh contributed to this report.

Asia has the ""room to ease monetary policy,"" said Krishna Srinivasan, Head of Asia & Pacific Department at the International Monetary Fund, as inflation in many countries in the region is at or below target.

In the case of Japan, the IMF forecasts that the country will reach its 2% inflation target by 2027, Srinivasan added.

— Diane Jorolan, Neha Hegde

India markets fell Friday amid a broader rise in the region as tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad rise following a deadly attack in Kashmir that reportedly killed 26 tourists.

The Nifty 50 fell 1.27%, while the BSE Sensex was down 1.35%.

India downgraded its ties with Pakistan following the attack and suspended a water-sharing treaty with the neighboring country. It has reportedly pointed the finger toward Pakistan, which has denied involvement in the attack.

— Lee Ying Shan

South Korea has asked for ""calm"" and ""orderly"" discussions with the U.S. on trade issues, as Asia's fourth largest economy reportedly seeks to work out a deal with the U.S. by July to avoid tariffs.

In the so-called ""2+2"" talks in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Ahn Dukgeun met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

According to South Korean media outlet Yonhap, Choi told reporters that further talks will focus on four categories: tariff-and non-tariff measures; economic security; investment cooperation; and monetary policies.

A readout from South Korea's Ministry of Finance said Choi proposed to seek mutually beneficial solutions for both countries, as well as communicated South Korea's concerns about tariffs, according to a CNBC translation.

China is mulling the suspension of its 125% tariff on certain U.S. goods, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the matter.

The government is considering scrapping the extra duties on items including medical equipment and industrial chemicals such as ethane. Authorities are also reportedly debating scrapping the tariff on aircraft leases.

The offshore yuan strengthened slightly to 7.284 against the greenback.

—Lee Ying Shan

Most Chinese consumers remain pragmatic in their spending decisions amid U.S.-China trade tensions, Goldman Sachs wrote in an April 24 note. 

""There appears to be limited direct correlation between Chinese consumer sentiment towards U.S. brands and the U.S.' tariff policy"", the investment bank's team said. The report added that based off sales data from select categories like automobiles, mobile phones and sportswear, U.S. brands did not ""meaningfully deteriorate.""

Boycott news or search volumes initiated by consumers have been far below previous accounts of geopolitical strife, Goldman also observed.

""We believe brand momentum/product cycle play a relatively more important role in market share shift patterns,"" the economists wrote, adding that brands with higher pricing and lack of innovation tend to be more vulnerable.

—Lee Ying Shan

China is expected to post its April PMI figures next week, which will be the first available factory activity data from the country to evaluate the U.S. tariff shock.

ANZ economists said in a report published Friday that they expect manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs to dip to 49.5 and 50.5 respectively. This would compare against March's official purchasing managers' index which came in at 50.5 in March, while non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, was at 50.8.

""The first order impact brought by the U.S. tariff will likely be on the new export orders, not the broad domestic demand and production,"" wrote ANZ.

—Lee Ying Shan

Shares of South Korea's shipbuilders rose after the Asian country and the U.S. have agreed to work on a trade package.

HD Hyundai Heavy Industries was up 5.32% after earlier surging over 7% to a record high. Hanhwa Ocean, which has a shipyard in Philadelphia, rose 6.06%, while HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering climbed more than 4%.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described Thursday's meeting between the U.S. and South Korea as ""very successful.""

According to a South Korean news outlet Newsis, a Korean minister said that a consensus on shipbuilding cooperation between South Korea and the U.S. has been reached.

—Lee Ying Shan

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and Topix led gains in Asian markets on Friday, climbing 1.73% and 1.43% respectively.

This follows Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's unveiling of a package of emergency economic measures to counter the adverse effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, according to Japanese media outlet Kyodo News. Kyodo said the package included measures such as corporate financing support and ways to increase domestic consumption. The government also pledged to reduce fuel prices and increase subsidies for energy bills.

Separately, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reportedly said on Thursday that the BOJ will continue to raise interest rates if underlying inflation approaches its 2% inflation target.

The BOJ will also see how the potential economic fallout from higher U.S. tariffs could affect the likelihood of achieving its price goals, which are a prerequisite for further interest rate hikes.

— Lim Hui Jie

Tokyo's core CPI rose 3.4% in April from a year earlier, marking the first time since 2023 that its core CPI, which strips out volatile fresh food costs, rose over 3%.

The reading outpaced Reuters' expectations of a 3.2% climb, and compares against 2.4% in March.

Just last week, Japan's inflation rate in January climbed to 4%, hitting its highest level since January 2023.

The figures were released just before the Bank of Japan's policy meeting scheduled for April 30 to May 1.

—Lee Ying Shan

Stocks rallied on Thursday, notching their third day of gains in a row.

The S&P 500 rallied 2.03%, closing at 5,484.77. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.74% to settle at 17,166.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 486.83 points, or 1.23%, finishing at 40,093.40.

— Lisa Kailai Han

In a Thursday note, UBS strategist Sean Simonds wrote that the U.S. is increasingly approaching a recessionary regime.

""Markets pricing rapidly in a 'recessionary' direction,"" he wrote.

Simonds added that tariff-sensitive stocks are being ""aggressively repriced"" and are now down 20% relative to the market.

Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks could take an even bigger hit going forward.

""Consumer discretionary stocks are typically sensitive to growth slowdowns/recessions and have underperformed recently as the market pushes quickly in this direction. Earnings expectations have also been rapidly revised lower and hedge fund positioning has adjusted significantly,"" Simonds said. ""Our models suggest more consumer discretionary downside momentum (eg. Kohls) and relative outperformance coming from communication services and utilities (eg. Live Nation and Ameren).""

— Lisa Kailai Han

The International Monetary Fund lowered its Asia economic growth forecast to 3.9% in 2025 from a 4.6% forecast made last year.

Uncertainty surrounding trade policy is a major headwind for the region, Krishna Srinivasan, the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department director, told reporters Thursday.

However, Srinivasan noted the central banks in the region have some scope to ease monetary policy that can help protect against some of the damage from trade policy.

Major U.S. tech names reported their first-quarter results Thursday, offering markets something more to chew on besides all the tariff-related news. 

U.S. stock indexes rallied: the Dow regained the 40,000 level, and the S&P500 and Nasdaq posted gains of over 2%.

While tech appears to be at the forefront of investors' mind for now, tariffs and trade tensions still lurk in the shadows, with Intel CFO David Zinsner warning that tariffs and retaliation from other countries has increased the likelihood of a recession.

Also, the optimism that both the U.S. and China were going to de-escalate the trade war has been watered down by China saying there were no ongoing trade talks with the U.S. 

U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly refuted China's claims, saying that trade talks were underway, but declined to reveal any details on the nature of the talks, adding to the uncertainty around trade.

Oh well, seems like it's a case of he said, she said — only at the highest levels of diplomacy between the world's largest economies. That's got to keep markets on tenterhooks.

Alphabet shares climb after better than expected resultsAlphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth Thursday after the bell. Alphabet's search and advertising units are still showing strong growth despite AI competition heating up, according to its first-quarter earnings report. The company's overall revenue grew 12% year over year, higher than the 10% Wall Street expected. Shares rose more than 5% in after-hours trading. 

Intel also posts results beat, but warns of tariff impactIntel reported first-quarter results Thursday that beat analysts' estimates, but also issued disappointing guidance. Second-quarter revenue will come in below estimates due to elevated uncertainty driven by the macro environment, the company warned. Separately, Intel CFO David Zinsner said President Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliation from other countries had increased the likelihood of a recession.

Retail shortages from trade war will hit U.S. consumers in stagesWarnings of empty store shelves have been making headlines as multiple press reports indicate that CEOs of America's top retail stores told President Trump that a prolonged trade war would lead to shortages. Already, a decline in manufacturing orders from China, and a drop in Chinese freight vessel bookings and sailings to the U.S. are edging the national supply chain closer to a tipping point. 

Meta lays off VR employees in Reality Labs divisionMeta has laid off employees in its Reality Labs division that is tasked with developing virtual reality, augmented reality and related wearable devices. The cuts affected an unspecified number of employees working in the division's Oculus Studios unit, which develops VR and AR games and content for Meta's Quest VR headsets, a company spokesperson told CNBC. Employees working on the Supernatural VR workout app were impacted, the spokesperson said.

Tech gains power markets Stocks popped Thursday thanks to strong gains in megacap tech names. The S&P 500 ended up 2.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 2.74%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two indexes but still added 1.23%, and retook the 40,000 mark for the first time since April 15. Over in Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally ended up 0.38%, with most sectors in the green.

[PRO] The Mag 7 isn't so mighty anymoreThe market's leading tech stocks don't hold the same sway they once did, and that may change the ingredients needed for a Wall Street rally. The Roundhill Magnificent 7 ETF (MAGS) — which holds shares of the Mag 7 in roughly equal measure — is now down 17% for the year. That's more than double the drop of almost 7% in the S&P 500.

China denies tariff talks are underwayChina on Thursday said that there were no ongoing discussions with the U.S. on tariffs, despite indications from the White House this week that there would be some easing in tensions with Beijing.

""At present there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,"" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He added that ""all sayings"" regarding progress on bilateral talks should be dismissed.

ARK Invest raised its decade-end bitcoin (BTC) price target to as high as $2.4 million apiece after revising its assumptions on active supply, which excludes lost or long-held coins. The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading around $94,000.

The bull-projection figure, 60% more than its January 2024 estimate, reflects a 72% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from last December through the end of 2030. The base case estimates a BTC price of $1.2 million — a 53% CAGR — while the bear case projects $500,000, equating to a 32% CAGR. 

David Puell, an analyst at the Cathie Wood-led investment company, used a model based on total addressable market and projected market penetration across several sectors. These include institutional investment, bitcoin's role as ""digital gold,"" its use as a haven in emerging markets, adoption for nation-state and corporate treasury holdings and on-chain financial services built on the bitcoin network.

In November last year, Puell targeted $104,000-$124,000 by year-end. Bitcoin ended December at $93,440 en route to hitting a record high of $109,000 in January before slumping to lows around $74,500 earlier this month.

The rally since then is partly driven by declining exchange balances, which indicate that more BTC is being withdrawn into private wallets, a sign of long-term holding behavior. According to Glassnode data, exchange-held BTC has fallen from approximately 3 million in November 2024 to 2.6 million, reinforcing the growing bullish sentiment around the cryptocurrency.

White House plans for a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve fired up optimism among the world's crypto enthusiasts. But until this past week, the currency itself barely flickered as recent trade war and tariff news whipsawed markets. Industry experts project a vast, eventual impact on the bitcoin price and the cryptocurrency industry. This week's action may underscore those expectations. Bitcoin prices…

The founder of the smart contract platform Cardano (ADA), Charles Hoskinson, is warning that the future of Ethereum (ETH) could be in question.

In an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on his YouTube channel, Hoskinson says he doesn't “think Ethereum will survive more than 10 to 15 years.”

According to Hoskinson, Ethereum faces existential threats both from within its ecosystem and externally.

“The [Ethereum] layer-2s will continue to suckle out all of the alpha and people will start fighting and it will get harder and harder for [Ethereum co-founder] Vitalik [Buterin] to be able to hold it together through sheer force of will.

And users will gradually migrate to other places and then they're going to get eclipsed by Bitcoin DeFi (decentralized finance). Because once that turns on, the TVL (total value locked) will be larger than Ethereum and a lot of people will start migrating in that particular direction…

…and the other thing is they're being eaten alive by Solana and Sui and these other things.

So, brilliant project. It's just a victim of its own success. Like MySpace [social network] or any of these other things that have a lot of network effect and momentum. BlackBerry [smartphone] is another example. But people have fundamentally different paradigms that over the long term are intrinsically superior. And they creep up on you.”

The Cardano creator says that Ethereum's problems can be traced to three mistakes made by the founders and developers.

“The number one problem Ethereum has is that they took an easy road out where they did three things wrong.

So first off, wrong protocols. They have the wrong accounting model, they have the wrong virtual machine and they have the wrong consensus model.

All of these were self-inflicted wounds. People told them not to do it, they did it and they got where they needed to go.

Second, what they chose to do to solve these problems is put in all these weird slashing economics and layer-twos and other things and now they're living with all of the consequences of these types of things.

And third, they really don't have a good on-chain governance system

So really what needs to happen is you need a parallel track with solving all those three things.”

Ethereum's price has recently mirrored broader trends in the cryptocurrency market, rising to above $1,800 before retracing as part of a wider market correction.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,754, showing a 3.3% decrease in the past 24 hours, while the total crypto market cap slipped by 3.6% during the same period.

Although short-term price movements reflect shifting momentum, on-chain metrics signal deeper changes that may have broader implications for Ethereum's network health and investor sentiment.

Ethereum Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Inflows Hit Multi-Year Highs

Recent data from CryptoQuant reveals that long-term Ethereum holders are increasing their activity. These wallets, known for never selling their ETH, have seen one of their highest inflows in recent years.

This coincides with rising network activity, including a notable uptick in active addresses and transactional volume. Together, these developments suggest that behind the surface-level volatility, there may be a quiet phase of accumulation and user engagement building within the Ethereum ecosystem.

CryptoQuant contributor OnChainSchool reports a significant development among Ethereum's long-term holding addresses. In the last 48 hours, over 640,000 ETH flowed into wallets that have maintained a strict accumulation pattern without any recorded selling behavior.

This marks the largest inflow to such wallets since 2018, suggesting that entities with a long-term outlook are increasing their exposure during the current price range.

The behavior of these accumulation-only wallets is often viewed as a proxy for investor conviction, particularly among participants who are not influenced by short-term volatility.

According to OnChainSchool, this activity during a period of price drawdown may reflect strategic positioning ahead of potential future developments.

It's also notable that these inflows come at a time when Ethereum fundamentals such as its transition to proof-of-stake, L2 adoption, and evolving staking mechanisms continue to advance. If sustained, this trend could help establish a support zone around current price levels.

Network Activity Rises as Active Addresses See Double-Digit Growth

Complementing the rise in long-term holder activity is a surge in Ethereum network usage. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Carmelo Alemán, highlights that the number of active Ethereum addresses grew by nearly 10% between April 20 and April 22, jumping from around 306,000 to over 336,000.

This metric counts unique wallet addresses that were involved in transactions as either senders or receivers over a given period. While active addresses alone do not capture the full picture, Alemán notes that the metric should be viewed alongside others such as exchange volume, gas fees, transaction count, and Layer 2 activity.

The rise in address activity, especially when paired with a simultaneous price increase, is often taken as a sign of broader user engagement and growing application-layer demand.

Will crypto banking soon be just like fiat banking?

Or better yet, will there soon be no difference at all?

That sets up the entire crypto sector, from Bitcoin to the best altcoins altcoins and meme coins, for ever-greater success.

Here's what the latest developments mean.

Back in 2023, after the epic FTX collapse, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency all required banks and financial institutions to give prior notice to regulators before undertaking crypto activities.

‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0,' as crypto folks call it, served to limit collaborations.

But now, with the Trump administration changing the crypto landscape, that restriction has been removed. It adds another level of legitimacy and enhances the accessibility of crypto.

Importantly, the change of rules doesn't give crypto-focused banks access to so-called ‘master accounts,' required for Fed members to access the central bank's services.

So far, the Fed has refused to give any crypto bank master account access. Will the abolition of the chokepoint be a first step towards that goal?

It feels like PayPal might somehow be flying under the radar, but the company still managed to generate nearly $32B in profit in 2024, when $1.6T was spent on the platform.

Now, Coinbase is partnering with PayPal to give $PYUSD a bit of a boost. The centralized exchange will waive purchase fees for $PYUSD and make it easier for users to swap the stablecoin 1:1 for USD; that could make the stablecoin an attractive on- and off-ramp option for crypto-to-fiat moves.

If Coinbase and PayPal can help to make stablecoins mainstream, that could in turn boost broader adoption. Some analysts see stablecoins as on the verge of a ‘ChatGPT moment,' ready to move from fringe use cases to an integral part of everyday life.

There's already been considerable growth in recent months.



Continued growth could send the stablecoin market cap – currently $211M – skyrocketing to new levels.

Even their low-end estimate sees stablecoins reaching $1.6T.

With stablecoins growing and the Federal Reserve moving further towards crypto approval, are the scales tilting back towards altcoins again?

The market is certainly more favorable for non-Bitcoin cryptos than it used to be. Here are three of the best altcoins to keep your eyes on.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) brings the blockchain to the content creator economy. Relationships between creators and fans are vital for the success of content creators, and $SUBBD token brings increased clarity and ease of access to the growing SUBBD platform.

Token benefits include:

There's a flat 20% APY on $SUBBD tokens for the first year, after which staking moves towards a platform benefits model. The more you stake, the more XP multipliers you'll receive on the SUBBD platform.



Content creation is an established market sector worth over $85B; $SUBBD token could transform it entirely. The platform provides a suite of AI tools for better content management for creators and gives fans access to exclusive content such as behind-the-scenes and live streams.

Learn how to buy $SUBBD token, and see why we think the token price – currently $0.05525 – could reach $0.301 by the end of the year. The presale is heating up; the project has raised over $255M already.

Visit the $SUBBD presale page today.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers a next-gen crypto wallet with an intuitive interface and features tailored for beginners and power users alike.

The wallet allows users to quickly and easily buy, sell, and swap crypto. It's built to be the only wallet you'll ever need, and comes loaded with features to find the next big thing in crypto – such as the Upcoming Tokens section.

$BEST token holders also gain:



All told, $BEST supercharges an already powerful Best Wallet app ecosystem. Early investors can increase their earnings even further by staking $BEST during the presale at 127% APY; learn how to buy Best Wallet tokens in our guide.

Our analysis shows the potential for $BEST to reach $0.072 in 2025 on the back of a successful presale, which has already raised $11.8M.

Visit the presale page today.

Ondo Finance ($ONDO) is bridging TradFi and DeFi by offering tokenized exposure to real-world assets. Aimed at institutional investors, Ondo provides exposure to short-term US Treasuries with $OUSG and yield from stablecoins with $USDY.

Those are institution-only products, but everyday investors can snag $ONDO for indirect exposure.



The altcoin is up nearly 21% in the past week, making big gains on the back of better and better news for the broader crypto regulatory landscape. As institutions increasingly look for compliant crypto exposure, Ondo is positioning itself as a go-to platform.

The project made the news recently for meetings between its CEO Nathan Allman and officials from the SEC. The discussions focused on tokenizing publicly traded US securities, offering yet another investment vehicle for major financial institutions.

The best altcoins are gaining steam, as investors look for projects that offer unique ways to get in early and potentially ride the next wave of gains.

As always, do your own research – none of this is financial advice. Crypto remains volatile, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose.

But each of these best altcoins brings major upside potential in a market looking for ways to expand crypto adoption and take advantage of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment.

Share this article

American fund manager Bitwise Asset Management has registered a trust entity named Bitwise NEAR ETF in Delaware — a move that typically precedes a formal filing with the SEC for an exchange-traded product that would track NEAR, the native asset of the NEAR Protocol.

If successful, Bitwise's proposed fund would be the first US-based ETF tied to the layer 1 blockchain focused on scalability and developer accessibility.

Prior to Bitwise's move, other asset managers such as 21Shares and Grayscale had already introduced NEAR-related investment products. 21Shares offers the 21Shares NEAR Protocol Staking ETP, providing exposure to NEAR tokens along with staking rewards.

Meanwhile, Grayscale operates the Grayscale NEAR Trust, a private placement vehicle that gives accredited investors access to NEAR, though it is not structured as an ETF.

A US-listed NEAR ETF would expand institutional access to the token as it offers a regulated, exchange-traded vehicle. The ETF structure enables institutions to gain exposure to NEAR without the complexities of managing private keys, custody arrangements, or wallet infrastructure.

Plus, by tracking the spot price of the underlying asset and disclosing holdings daily, the ETF provides real-time price transparency and a closer alignment with market value—features critical for portfolio management and compliance.

Bitwise, a pioneer in crypto asset investment products, had over $5 billion in assets under management as of October 2024, marking a 400% increase in that year, the firm said in a statement.

The company manages a wide range of investment products, including crypto index funds, thematic equity ETFs, spot crypto ETPs, multi-strategy alpha solutions, separately managed accounts, and private funds.

Bitwise's spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which launched in January 2024, has grown to $3.6 billion in assets under management, according to the latest data. Despite being on the market for just over a year, BITB ranks among the top-performing Bitcoin funds, with steady growth and strong investor demand.

In addition to NEAR, Bitwise is aiming for ETFs related to other leading crypto assets, such as XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana, to name a few.

The new registration is part of Bitwise's ongoing effort to expand its digital asset offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, as institutional appetite for altcoin exposure gains momentum.

Bitwise, as well as other fund managers, anticipate that a crypto-friendly environment in the Trump era will help accelerate the approval and adoption of crypto investment products.

Earlier this week, Trump Media and Crypto.com finalized a deal to launch America-first ETFs, including ones tied to Cronos. The parties said they aimed to benefit from pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration.

Whether the growing lineup of proposed crypto funds will ultimately reach the market depends on the securities regulator. Newly sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins, along with other Commissioners, is expected to review and rule on several pending ETF applications in the coming months.

A recent study by Swan, a Bitcoin financial services company, has revealed that most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experience rapid and systemic depreciation when measured against Bitcoin (BTC). 

The findings highlight Bitcoin's role as a more stable asset for capital preservation in the fluctuating cryptocurrency market.

Swan shared its insights in a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter). 

“Altcoins don't just underperform Bitcoin. They collapse against it,” the post read.

The analysis examined the performance of the top 300 altcoins over five years. It focused on the time it takes for these assets to lose 90% of their value relative to Bitcoin after reaching their all-time highs (ATH).

“The median altcoin reached a -90% drawdown in just 10–20 months,” Swan revealed.

Moreover, according to Swan's data, Terra (LUNA1), Ontology Gas (ONG), and Bitgert (BRISE) collapsed the fastest, hitting the 90% drawdown mark in under two months. Larger, more established altcoins were not immune to this trend. 

For instance, Cardano (ADA) and XRP (XRP) took 36 months to depreciate 90% from their record peak. Meanwhile, Litecoin (LTC) experienced a gradual decline, taking 69 months. Monero (XMR) saw the slowest drop, taking six years to reach a -90% drop.

Swan's analysis extends to 45 altcoins that have not yet experienced the 90% decline. While they have not yet “collapsed,” the data suggests they are merely delaying their inevitable losses. 

The average drawdown for these altcoins is 76% from their peak value. Even the best-performing altcoin among them is still down by 43% compared to BTC.

“Bitcoin remains the benchmark for capital preservation. These assets don't hedge Bitcoin — they bleed against it,” Swan added.

The findings point to a systemic issue within the altcoin space. The data suggests that altcoins, often marketed as alternatives to Bitcoin, fail to deliver sustained value over time compared to the leading cryptocurrency.

Swan also stressed that long-term outperformance by altcoins is exceptionally rare. Furthermore, the firm believes survivorship bias — the tendency to focus on successful projects — has hidden the widespread decay across the broader market.

“With performance like this, it's astonishing that altcoins continue to exist. Then again, humans love gambling,” Swan executive John Haar remarked.

The growing saturation in the altcoin market adds to the concerns. According to CoinMarketCap (CMC) data, over 1.8 million tokens have been created in just the past month. 

However, the vast majority of these tokens fail to deliver. BeInCrypto recently reported that 89% of tokens listed on Binance in 2025 are in the red. Thus, newer altcoins' value is driven more by short-term trading and hype rather than any lasting fundamentals.

In addition, this surge in the number of tokens has fragmented market liquidity. These factors have even delayed the long-anticipated “altcoin season.” Yet, some analysts even argue that the traditional altcoin season may never return. 

This shift is largely due to Bitcoin's increasing dominance in the market, bolstered by institutional adoption and growing regulatory attention. While Bitcoin solidifies its position as the dominant digital asset, the same cannot be said for altcoins, which struggle to maintain relevance and investor interest in the face of Bitcoin's continued rise.

Solana has successfully reclaimed the $150 mark, and Cardano is approaching $1, but smart investors are eyeing bigger returns on other altcoins.

At press time, Solana is trading at $154.5, resulting from a 5.2% gain today and a 14.3% gain this week. It currently trades at its highest price since early March.

Cardano trades at $0.72, up 6.3% today and 16.7% this week. Like Solana, Cardano is trading around its highest prices since March.

Crypto investors are regaining optimism after a deep selloff that began in January. For seasoned traders who navigate the market correctly, there's an opportunity for huge gains right now.

To help traders identify these opportunities, we've compiled a list of the best altcoins to buy now. Read on to find our top picks.

Ondo is a real-world assets protocol that allows users to buy tokenized assets such as stocks, bonds, and commodities on-chain. It also features a yield-bearing stablecoin, USDY, which is backed by US treasuries.

Thanks to a shifting regulatory environment, financial institutions are racing to adopt cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. With a focus on asset tokenization, Ondo is one of the projects set to benefit the most as institutions enter the industry.

It's one of the top-performing cryptos today with a 17% gain. However, it remains 52% below its all-time high (ATH) from four months ago, leaving plenty of room for growth.

Some of Ondo's benefits include support for 10 blockchains, $1 billion total value locked (TVL), and an 80% market share in the yield coin sector.

Solaxy is building the world's first Solana layer 2 blockchain. The Solana ecosystem is thriving right now, with on-chain activity reaching new heights and prices soaring.

While the $SOL price is up 14% this week, many of its ecosystem tokens, including ai16z, AI Rig Complex, and Zerebro, are up over 100%.

Solana's main battle right now is maintaining network health. That's because it often faces congestion issues during peak activity periods, like the one it's heading into now. As such, Solaxy will provide a much-needed helping hand.

Its layer 2 blockchain will process transactions in bundles, making it cheaper, faster, and more reliable than the Solana layer 1 chain.

Solaxy is undergoing a presale and has raised over $31 million so far.

The early strength of the $SOLX presale indicates that the token could continue to be a top performer once it hits exchanges.

Sui is experiencing immense levels of adoption right now, with over a 30% increase in TVL and DEX volume this week.

But beyond retail user interest, institutions have also begun to eye the project. Asset manager Canary Capital filed a Staked SEI ETF in Delaware on 24 April, which, if approved, would make Sei one of the few crypto assets to have a regulated staking product.

The move signifies institutional interest, which is a driving force behind the current market-wide crypto bullish sentiment.

And factoring in that on-chain metrics point to growth, Sei's fundamentals are stacked for continued bullish momentum in the coming months. Moreover, it's currently the best-performing top 100 crypto, gaining 23% today.

Raydium

Raydium is the leading decentralized exchange on the Solana network. However, the platform has recently expanded its operations and created a meme coin launchpad, which allows anyone to start a new crypto project in seconds.

Raydium's LaunchLab will be a direct competitor to Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin casino which cashed out hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue during the last leg of the meme coin season.

But unlike Pump.fun, which doesn't have a token, investors can directly speculate on LaunchLab's performance through $RAY.

Given Pump.fun's lucrative revenue stats, we could well see strong demand for $RAY in the months ahead.

It currently trades at $2.7 and has gained 11% today and 23% this week, well outpacing the market average.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain needs regulation, scalability to close AI hiring gap","https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-regulation-scalability-crypto-ai-hiring-gap","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:13:51 GMT","

 Blockchain job growth could exceed 1 million roles by 2030 amid regulatory clarity, scalability and AI integration, according to Bitget Research insights. 

The emerging blockchain industry lags behind the artificial intelligence sector in terms of job creation, but this hiring gap may narrow by 2030.

Blockchain remains one of the smallest sectors in the tech industry, with about 300,000 global jobs, compared to 1.5 million in AI and machine learning and 25 million in software development, according to a new Bitget Research report shared with Cointelegraph.

The blockchain sector added around 20,000 new jobs in 2024, according to job listings aggregated from platforms like LinkedIn, Web3 Jobs and Crypto Job List.

While blockchain-based jobs had an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45%, outpacing most traditional tech sectors, it trails the AI industry's 57% CAGR, according to the report.

The AI industry's maturity and larger share of venture capital investment are the main reasons behind the hiring discrepancy, Vugar Usi Zade, chief operating officer of Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph:

“Venture investors put more than $100 billion into AI startups in 2024, with AI-centric titles topping a million vacancies worldwide,” Usi Zade said. “Blockchain companies, meanwhile, advertise barely 20,000 openings and drew only about $5.4 billion in new funding during the same period.”

Related: Crypto firms moving into Wall Street territory amid ‘growing synergy'

AI-related job listings have risen between 75% and 100% year-over-year, while blockchain job growth remains around the 45% to 60% growth range.

Blockchain could exceed 1 million jobs by 2030 if it manages to scale at the same rate as AI-based roles, the report said.

More regulatory clarity from laws such as Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) may encourage blockchain firms to increase their hiring efforts, Zade said:

“Second comes enterprise-grade performance: Ethereum's Dencun upgrade cut typical layer-2 fees by more than 95%, signaling that blockchains can now handle corporate traffic at an acceptable cost,” he added.

While blockchain-based jobs are poised for growth, “AI will naturally garner more talent in the next decade,” Jawad Ashraf, CEO of Vanar Chain, told Cointelegraph.

“This is because AI's market integration has been faster than any other modern technology we can remember,” he said. “If you look at blockchain, we're still very much focused on integrating with TradFi and broader Web3 markets like gaming, real-world tokenization, etc.”

He added: “Blockchain still hasn't penetrated the more conventional consumer-oriented markets. It will, in the near future, but we are not there yet.”

“AI and blockchain aren't competing for talent; they're working together to create new opportunities,” Yakov Lebedev, chief business development officer at 3Commas, a trading automation solution, told Cointelegraph.

Combining the two technologies enables “sophisticated financial tools accessible for everyone, not just big institutions, he said, adding:

Lebedev added that the integration of blockchain with AI is driving steady job growth in both fields, as financial and tech firms move integrated solutions from pilot programs into core operations.

Thanks to the synergistic benefits of the two technologies, blockchain job growth may start mirroring the AI industry, according to Adi Ben-Ari, founder and CEO at Applied Blockchain, an AI-powered blockchain development firm.

AI technology is “probabilistic and introduces uncertainty,” which creates more demand for blockchain and cryptographic technologies, he told Cointelegraph.

“AI produces outcomes that are not always accurate, can be fake, and can sometimes be incorrect,” he said. “This new uncertainty needs to be countered by a technology that brings absolute certainty, and this is where blockchain and cryptography come in.”

Ben-Ari added that blockchain's ability to secure sensitive information through cryptography would become increasingly important as AI consumes larger amounts of personal data.  

AI agents are already using cryptocurrency for autonomous transactions. On Dec. 16, 2024, Luna, an AI agent on Virtuals Protocol, paid another AI agent from STIX Protocol, in exchange for its image generation services — sending $1.77 worth of Virtual (VIRTUAL) tokens, onchain data shows.

The crypto scene could have marked a historic turning point. A partnership between Nvidia and a blockchain network, an official recognition of crypto by a chip giant. Yet, as usual, hope turned into a mirage. A few hours before the announcement, Nvidia withdrew its support, leaving the project in limbo. A scenario that summarizes a tumultuous relationship: despite the technological advances of blockchain, the Californian company holds a clear line. Crypto remains persona non grata in its ecosystem.

The recent episode of the Layer 2 Blockchain, dropped at the last moment from Nvidia's Ignition AI Accelerator program, is not an accident. It is the symptom of deep-rooted distrust. The exclusion criteria for crypto-related projects in flagship programs like Inception are unequivocal. A tacit but inflexible rule of the game.

This is not a sudden breakup, but rather a logical continuation. In 2018, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, was already talking about the hangovers caused by the crypto crash.

Unsold GPU stocks, regulatory fines… The legacy is heavy. More recently, in 2023, CTO Michael Kagan dismissed the social utility of crypto with a wave of the hand: “It brings nothing useful to humanity,” he asserts, preferring to praise the promises of AI.

Yet, the bridges are not completely cut. In March 2024, at the Graphics Technology Conference, Jensen Huang shared the stage with Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol… without ever mentioning blockchain.

The message is subtle but clear: Nvidia tolerates hybrid players, provided they focus on AI. Crypto? A topic to avoid, or to mention only with evasive metaphors.

But why this persistent distrust? The answer lies in two letters: AI. Nvidia has chosen its side. Between blockchains, seen as volatile, and artificial intelligence, a rapidly growing sector, the calculation is quick.

Partnerships with figures like Polosukhin, whose work on Transformers has revolutionized AI, illustrate this strategy. Infrastructure credits, mentoring, resources: everything is channeled towards machine learning.

Resources are not infinite. In 2023, the demand for GPUs for AI created global shortages. In this context, integrating crypto would mean diluting already colossal efforts. A risk Nvidia refuses to take. Even when Huang speaks of “programmable money“, at a conference, the reference remains theoretical. No roadmap, no commitment.

One question remains: does crypto really need Nvidia? Some blockchain projects have built decentralized ecosystems without relying on tech giants. A philosophy aligned with the peer-to-peer spirit of the origins.

For Nvidia, ignoring crypto could even become an advantage: by avoiding controversies related to mining or speculation, the company preserves its image with traditional businesses.

The missed rendezvous between Nvidia and crypto is no surprise. It is the result of a strategic choice, assumed for years. Between the promises of AI and the uncertainties of blockchain, the Californian giant has decided.

For crypto actors, the lesson is clear: no need to chase Nvidia's favor, better to carve one's own path. After all, true innovation often arises off the beaten path. And this in no way challenges the prophecy of a close associate of Satoshi, who already sees bitcoin crossing the one million mark.

Metrics details

Tracing sources and assessing intervention effectiveness are crucial for controlling atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution. Isotopic techniques enable precise top-down tracing, but the absence of long-term, global-scale multi-compound isotopic data limits comprehensive analysis. Here, we establish a blockchain-based isotopic database, compiling 34,815 isotopic fingerprints of global PM and its emissions from 1,890 pollution events across 66 countries. This allows retrospective analysis and predictions, revealing that PM sources are distinct, dynamically changing over time, and often asynchronous with interventions. Additionally, we estimate source contributions to PM2.5 and its compounds, highlighting the increasing impact of biomass burning. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2100, PM levels may decline to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m³ in the Americas and 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m³ in Asia under climate mitigation scenarios but will still exceed WHO guidelines without further controls on natural emissions. Guiding future interventions with isotopic big data is essential for addressing air pollution challenges.

Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts Earth's radiation budget1, global climate2, and public health3,4. Exposure to ambient PM, even at low concentrations, harms human health5. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the recommended annual PM2.5 (PM ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) exposure limit to 5 μg/m3 in 20216. However, recent global estimates indicate that 99.82% of the land area and 99.99% of the population are still exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding this limit6. This underscores PM pollution as a pressing global challenge, necessitating effective interventions.

Precisely tracing PM emissions and evaluating the effectiveness of past pollution interventions are essential for designing future PM strategies. However, it is difficult because PM composition is complex, including both local emissions and regional transport7. The pollution levels exhibit a complex nonlinear relationship with emissions. This introduces uncertainties in previous bottom-up emission inventories and molecular-/element-based top-down tracing methods8. Recently, isotopic techniques have provided high-precision fingerprints for top-down tracing of PM emissions9. Isotope ratios tend to show distinct signatures (i.e., fingerprints) among various sources due to different formation processes10. Importantly, these isotopic fingerprints are preserved through complex atmospheric processes11. To date, 14 elemental isotopes, carbon (fM-14C for radioactive; δ13C for stable), nitrogen (δ15N), oxygen (δ18O), silicon (δ30Si), sulfur (δ34S), iron (δ56Fe), nickel (δ60Ni), copper (δ65Cu), zinc (δ66Zn), strontium (δ87Sr), neodymium (δ144Nd), hafnium (δ177Hf), lead (207Pb/206Pb), and mercury (δ202Hg), have been utilized for source tracing of PM species12,13,14,15. Nevertheless, these applications mainly concentrate on short-term PM pollution events on a local scale. Only two global long-term nitrogen isotope studies have focused on nitrates and ammonium12,16, which is inadequate for assessing overall PM. Therefore, a global long-term analysis of PM and their emissions' isotopic big data is particularly important for tracing PM sources and interventions.

To achieve global isotopic big data analysis, we developed the Isotopic Database for Global Atmospheric Research (IDGAR). A blockchain architecture was integrated into IDGAR to ensure the accuracy and traceability of isotopic big data. Based on IDGAR, we created a comprehensive global isotopic map of 1890 pollution events across 66 countries from 1957–2023, revealing the regional-specific source-end isotopic values for PM tracing. Moreover, we identified main emissions and assessed their specific effective intervention durations for different PM species by analyzing the trends and change rates of isotopic big data. Relying on these comprehensions, we estimated the source composition of PM2.5 and its critical components, and characterize the spatiotemporal variations of these source composition. We reveal the rising impact of biomass burning and liquid fossil fuels combustion. Furthermore, we project future PM2.5 trends in scenarios aimed at meeting climate goals of 1.5 °C and 2 °C by 2100. The blockchain-based isotopic big data directly connects PM, sources, and interventions, providing important guidance for future atmospheric research.

We developed the IDGAR database (http://idgar.org/) by compiling 34,815 non-redundant global isotopic observations, including 7,053 source and 27,762 PM isotopic data published between 1957 and 2024 (Supplementary Fig. 1)17. These observations include 14 elements across 1,890 PM pollution events and isotopes such as fM-14C, δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, δ30Si, δ34S, δ56Fe, δ60Ni, δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ87Sr, δ144Nd, δ177Hf, 207Pb/206Pb, and δ202Hg (Supplementary Fig. 1). For light elements (e.g., C, N, S), the isotopic characteristics of different compounds, including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and sulfate (SO42-), have been thoroughly compiled. Moreover, we integrated a blockchain architecture into IDGAR's data management system, ensuring that the isotopic-driven tracing process is immutable and traceable.

Specifically, the curated isotopic data and their details (e.g., sampling date, site location, reference), along with user operations (including authentication information, downloads, and uploads), are transformed into unique 64-character hexadecimal strings using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA256, a cryptographic function) and stored as a block in IDGAR (Supplementary Fig. 1)18,19,20. The SHA256 function is one-way and unbreakable, making the transformed isotopic data tamper-proof. Moreover, each future user action or data update is digitally recorded with timestamps, which are input into the SHA256 function along with the previous block's string to generate a new block string. Through this iterative hashing pattern, each block is closely linked to all preceding blocks in chronological order, thereby systematically growing the blockchain. Even a minor alteration results in distinct changes in subsequent blocks, enabling precise identification of affected blocks and files by tracing back to the initial block that experienced a hash change. By ensuring data tamper-proofing and increasing trust, IDGAR facilitates the accurate and sustainable application of publicly shared atmospheric isotopic big data for researchers worldwide.

To obtain complete and definitive source-end isotopic values for accurately explaining PM origins, we developed the global isotopic map of PM sources based on IDGAR. This map includes the source isotopic fingerprints of various PM species, e.g., EC, OC, NO3-, NH4+, SO42-, and metals, across diverse global regions (from 75.10° S to 83.20° N) between 1957–2023 (Figs. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1, different PM species tend to show different source information. For instance, EC has sources such as coal combustion, C3 plants burning emissions, C4 plants burning emissions, and vehicle exhaust, while OC is not entirely the same, as it also includes emissions from liquefied petroleum gas. Therefore, PM source tracing require multi-species isotopic fingerprints. Notably, most isotopic fingerprints showed notable variations among these sectors for different species (P < 0.05), indicating their potential for PM source distinction (Fig. 1b-m and Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, a closer examination revealed regional heterogeneity in source isotopic fingerprints of certain individual species, e.g., Pb, across Asia, Europe, and the Americas (P < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1 & 2). This variability may be attributed to the diverse industrial structures and lifestyles in these regions. However, formal bootstrap testing indicated no statistical dependence of isotopic fingerprints on latitude and longitude within these regions (P > 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 1). These blockchain-based continent-specific source isotopic values enable to provide accurate reference for tracing PM and their species sources.

The labels VE, CC, BB, BBC4, BBC3, LFF, WM, LE, VF, MicP, VEdiesel, VEgasoline, OE, NS, IOC, NEE, NEERP, NEET, NEEBP, and WI in (b–m) represent vehicle exhausts, coal combustion, biomass burning, C4 plants burning, C3 plants burning, liquid fossil fuels combustion, waste materials, livestock emissions, volatilized fertilizer, microbial processes, diesel vehicle emissions, gasoline vehicle emissions, ore-related emissions, natural soil, industrial oil combustion, non-exhaust emissions, non-exhaust emissions-road paint, non-exhaust emissions-tire, non-exhaust emissions-brake pad and waste incinerator. The isotopic composition of ammonium (NH4⁺) and nitrate (NO3⁻) sources is conventionally expressed in terms of their precursor compounds, namely the isotopic composition of NH3 and NOx, respectively47,48. The box extends from the 25% to the 75%, the center line represents the median, and the whiskers indicate the 5% and 95% of the data points. Significance levels are indicated as follows: ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. Note: the isotopic compositions of Zn (j) and Pb (m) from different sources show significant differences (P < 0.05), but there are too many statistical results to be clearly labeled in the figure. Therefore, all the data are provided in the Source Data file. Additionally, details on the number of isotopic data points in each window (b–m) are also provided in the Source Data file.

IDGAR provides an unprecedented opportunity for long-term analyzes of global PM isotopic fingerprints, enabling the identification of shifts and intervention effectiveness on main sources of PM species. The isotopic fingerprints of PM species represent a linear mixture of different sources. By analyzing their temporal trends and comparing them with the aforementioned isotopic fingerprints, the main sources during a corresponding period can be identified. If the rates of change in PM isotopic fingerprints (i.e., the slope between isotopic fingerprints and year) show a continuous decline but do not reverse direction, it indicates that the main sources' contributions are increasing, but the growth rate is slowing down. This suggests that the intervention targeting the main sources has begun to take effect. Perhaps this scenario is suspected to be due to the increase in contributions from sources with opposite isotopic compositions. However, if this is the case, the isotopic fingerprints of PM will show opposite trend changes and the corresponding change rates will also reverse direction. Therefore, analyzing the temporal trends and change rates of isotopic big data can identify the main sources of PM species, and evaluate the effectiveness and timing of interventions on these main sources.

Considering the temporal trends and magnitudes may be influenced by the selection of the start and end years, we performed formal bootstrap testing procedures and moving subset window analysis. We found that global fM-14C, δ15N, 207Pb/206Pb, δ18O, δ30Si, δ34S, δ56Fe, δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ87Sr and δ202 Hg of PM species show varying temporal dynamics, including different trend breaks, tendencies, and change rates (Fig. 2a–h, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6). The robustness of the statistical results was verified using the Theil–Sen estimator (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). This indicates that different PM components have distinct main sources and interventions during different periods. For instance, the global fM-14C of EC in PM increased significantly before 2014, then declined (Fig. 2a), indicating that their main emissions shift from non-fossil fuel source (i.e., biomass burning, fM-14C = 1) to fossil fuel combustion (coal or oil, fM-14C = 0)21,22 in 2014. By analyzing the EC δ13C trend and source isotopic values, we further identified whether biomass burning before 2014 was dominated by C4 or C3 plants. Specifically, the rise in EC δ13C during 2001–2008 and 2012–2014 suggests C4 plants burning (δ13C-EC = −15.4 ± 2.73‰) was the main source, while the decline from 2009–2011 points to C3 plants burning (δ13C-EC = -27.5 ± 2.69‰). Notably, the rate of increase in fM-14C slowed continuously during 2005–2007, and 2012–2014 (Fig. 2b), suggests effective interventions targeting C4 plants emissions during these periods (Supplementary Fig. 9).

a, c, e, g Temporal trends of fM-14C for EC (a) and OC (c) δ15N for NH4+ (e) and NO3− (g) were analyzed using formal bootstrap testing procedures. The abbreviations EC, OC, NH4+, and NO3- represent elemental carbon, organic carbon, ammonium, and nitrate, respectively. The different-colored lines in (a, c, e) and g represent liner fits for different periods, with the corresponding shading indicating their 95% confidence intervals. b, d, f, h Moving subset window analysis of the temporal change trends of fM-14C-EC (b), fM-14C-OC (d) δ15N-NH4+ (f) and δ15N-NO3− (h) over 5-year periods. The analysis step was 1 year. The bars represent isotopic change rates (k) every 5 years. Details on the amount of isotopic data in each plot are provided in the Source Data file. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. Statistical robustness was verified using the Theil–Sen estimator (Supplementary Figs. 6 & 7). The color scale of the bars correspond to temporal trends, without specific indication. i Global distribution of atmospheric particulate matter isotopic observations and pollution levels. The global atmospheric particulate matter pollution levels are represented by the annual average concentrations of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for 2022. Isotopic observations are primarily concentrated in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The map was generated with Natural Earth, which provides free vector and raster map data available at naturalearthdata.com. j The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) map shows global atmospheric particulate matter isotopic affinities within the IDGAR. Most isotopic data form distinct clusters rather than random distributions.

In contrast to EC, global fM-14C of OC in PM dropped sharply before 2015, then rose (Fig. 2c), indicating fossil fuel combustion (oil or coal) dominated pre-2015, while biomass burning (fM-14C = 1) became dominant afterward. The OC δ13C has steadily increased, surpassing the isotopic end-member value for oil (Supplementary Figs. 5a and Fig. 1c), pointing to coal combustion as the main source before 2015, with a shift to C4 plants emissions thereafter. The slower decline in fM-14C of OC from 2009 to 2011 (Fig. 2d) suggests effective interventions on coal combustion during this period (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Moreover, global δ15N of ammonium salts in PM decreased from 2001 to 2013, then rose from 2014 to 2020 (Fig. 2e), indicating a shift in main sources of ammonium salts from isotope-depleted to isotope-enriched ones, e.g., vehicle exhaust. Notably, during 2017–2020, the rate of δ15N-NH4+ increase slowed continuously (Fig. 2f), suggesting effective interventions targeting vehicle-derived NH4+-bearing PM (Supplementary Fig. 9). In contrast, δ15N of NO3− increased from −12.0 ± 15.9‰ to 6.1 ± 6.5‰ between 2001 and 2018, suggesting coal combustion as the main source. Afterward, δ15N-NO3− declined, pointing to non-coal sources, e.g., gasoline combustion, microbial processes, or biomass burning (Fig. 2g). The rate of δ15N-NO3− increase slowed between 2013 and 2018 (Fig. 2h), indicating effective measures against coal-related NO3− in PM (Supplementary Fig. 9). Similarly, δ34S in sulfate generally declined, with a brief increase from 2015 to 2016 (Supplementary Fig. 5g). The rate of decline slowed during 2010–2012 and after 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 5h). Based on source δ34S values, we suggest that before 2015, coal or biomass combustion was the main source of sulfate, effectively controlled between 2010 and 2012. After 2020, isotopic values fell below 2‰, indicating that biomass burning (δ34S = 1.84 ± 5.41‰) became the dominant source and has been progressively managed.

In addition to these high-abundance components, a detailed discussion on the main sources of other components and the effectiveness of their interventions is provided in the Supplementary Note 2. Overall, effective interventions were only observed for the main sources of PM components, e.g., EC, OC, NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, Pb, Sr, and Hg, and their effectiveness was limited to specific periods rather than the entire study duration (Supplementary Fig. 9). These results indicate that the main sources and corresponding interventions are not synchronized. The heterogeneity of different PM species underscores the importance of considering multi-species isotopes in tracing overall PM source and interventions.

To further characterize the relationships among multi-species isotopic, we performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis on the isotopic fingerprints from 1890 global PM pollution events. Despite being distributed across various global regions (from 69.37° S to 85.64° N, Fig. 2i) and potentially subject to different interventions at different times, isotopes of the same components tend to cluster into unique groups rather than distribute randomly (Fig. 2j). This highlights the independent indicative capacities of these isotopes and the importance of considering multidimensional isotopes in PM source tracing.

Using the isotopic big data, the Bayesian stable isotope mixing model implemented in the R package (MixSIAR), the mass concentrations of various PM2.5 components, we conducted source tracing analyzes for individual PM2.5 compounds. By aggregating the emissions of different components, we estimated the contribution of each subdivided source to PM2.5. The uncertainty of source apportionment results was derived from MixSIAR model analysis and error propagation formula (see “Methods” for details). Noteworthy, although the isotopic fractionation correction of certain components, such as NH4+ and NO3-, during the conversion process has been accounted for in the MixSIAR model (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 3 for details), future in-depth studies on the isotopic fractionation mechanisms of specific transformation reactions under real-world environmental conditions will further improve the accuracy of source apportionment results. Furthermore, the robustness of MixSIAR performance was verified using the other Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, i.e., MixSIR and Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals (FRUITS) (Supplementary Note 4).

Significant variations were observed in the contributions of different sources to PM2.5 and its components (Fig. 3). Globally, biomass burning and coal combustion are the main sources of PM2.5, and the main component affected by these sources is most likely OC (Fig. 3a). Additionally, biomass burning and vehicle exhaust are the leading contributors to EC in PM2.5, accounting for 2.17 ± 0.09% and 2.23 ± 0.09% of the total mass of PM2.5, respectively, through EC emissions. Natural soil and coal combustion are the major sources of Si in PM2.5, with Si emissions from these sources contributing 1.99 ± 0.08 % and 1.22 ± 0.06%, respectively, to the overall PM2.5 mass. Additionally, some subdivided sources also affect PM2.5 pollution levels by emitting specific components. For instance, the combustion of liquid fossil fuels and industrial fuel oil primarily impacts PM2.5 levels by altering concentrations of OC and sulfates. Non-exhaust emissions are a key source of metal elements in PM2.5, especially Fe and Zn, with Fe and Zn emissions contributing 0.26 ± 0.02% and 0.15 ± 0.01% to the total mass of PM2.5, respectively. Waste materials, livestock waste, and volatilized fertilizer influence PM2.5 pollution levels through the NH3 emission. These refined source apportionment results are essential for the precise implementation of PM2.5 source control measures.

a, b, c, d The source composition of PM2.5 and its components in the worldwide (a) Asia (b) the Americas (c) and Europe (d). The labels CC, BB, VE, LFF, IOC, NS, BP, WM, NEE, LE, VF, and WI are abbreviations for coal combustion, biomass burning, vehicle exhausts, liquid fossil fuels combustion, industrial oil combustion, natural soil, biological process, waste materials, non-exhaust emissions, livestock emissions, volatilized fertilizer, and waste incinerator, respectively. Biological processes include plant debris, fungal bacteria, pollen, particulate matter generated by the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, microbial processes. The uncertainties for these results are provided in the Source Data file. For the specific calculation process, see the “Methods” section. Note: in the isotopic source tracing analysis of OC in PM2.5, the liquid fossil fuels combustion is classified as a subdivided source, while OC emissions from vehicle exhaust are not double-counted. Due to the absence of the δ¹⁵N values for ammonia from biomass burning in the Americas and Europe, the global source apportionment study relied on the δ¹⁵N values for ammonia from Asian biomass burning to estimate global values.

Regionally, a closer characterization revealed heterogeneity in the source composition of PM2.5 and its components across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. From 2001 to 2023, coal combustion is the dominant source of PM2.5 emissions in Asia, whereas biomass burning serves as the primary contributor to PM2.5 emissions in Europe and the Americas (Fig. 3b–d). This finding aligns with high coal consumption in Asia23. Moreover, the same type of sources, such as biomass burning, show varying contributions to PM2.5 components across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. For instance, biomass burning in Asia contributes ~1.29 ± 0.82% of PM2.5 through EC emissions, which is lower than its contribution in the Americas (6.12 ± 1.70%) and Europe (5.06 ± 4.30%). This result may be attributed to the higher frequency of wildfire emissions in Europe and the Americas24. Noteworthy, some subdivided sources show regional differences in PM2.5 components and contributions. For instance, industrial oil combustion contributes substantially more sulfate to PM2.5 in Asia than in Europe and the Americas. These differences may be attributed to the industrial structures in different regions.

We further analyzed the temporal changes of PM2.5 source composition across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. In Asia, the contribution of coal combustion has gradually decreased since 2013, probably due to interventions targeting OC emissions (Supplementary Figs. 10a–f). Since 2004, the contribution of biomass burning to PM2.5 has remained stable. Yet, vehicle exhaust emissions have improved significantly since 2018, likely due to the rapid development of new energy vehicles25. Notably, contributions from some subdivided sources—such as liquid fossil fuel combustion, industrial fuel oil combustion, and waste incineration—declined significantly after 2013–2015 but have stabilized since 2016. These results might reflect the effective implementation of targeted regional emission reduction measures. In the Americas and Europe, the contribution of most sources, e.g., coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, and livestock waste, to PM2.5 has shown a gradual downward trend (Supplementary Fig. 10g–l). In contrast, contributions from biomass burning and liquid fossil fuel combustion have either remained stable or increased, suggesting these sources necessitate greater attention and further intervention. Notably, current source-tracing analysis mainly relies on the critical components of PM2.5, where isotope fingerprints can be obtained. As more component isotopic fingerprints become available, e.g., NH4+ in the Americas and Europe, the accuracy and precision of source tracing will further improve.

In addition to current interventions, global climate actions aimed at controlling warming will lead to systemic change in PM2.5 emissions, e.g., fossil fuels26,27,28. To better plan future PM2.5 interventions, we projected the trends of PM2.5 pollution levels (Fig. 4) and isotopic fingerprints (Supplementary Fig. 11) in the Americas and Asia in climate mitigation scenarios to the year 2100. This simulation was conducted by integrating the IDGAR database, the global change assessment model (GCAM), and the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry analysis (WRF-Chem). For further details see “Method” section. In both the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1–1.9 (1.5 °C temperature control target) and SSP1–2.6 (2 °C goal temperature control target) scenarios, PM2.5 pollution levels in Asia and the Americas are projected to continuously decline. By 2100, with anthropogenic sources expected to have achieve net zero emissions (Supplementary Fig. 12), the PM2.5 concentrations in the Americas in the SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6 scenarios are projected to decrease to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m3 and 5.43 ± 0.15 μg/m3, respectively. These results are close to the WHO guideline limit of 5 μg/m3 but do not quite achieve it. In Asia, the projected PM2.5 concentrations for 2100 are 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m3 and 14.2 ± 1.82 μg/m3 in the SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 scenarios, respectively. These PM2.5 levels are comparable to current levels in the Americas and fall short of the WHO recommended limits. Compared to that in the SSP1–2.6 scenario, the PM2.5 concentration decreases more in the SSP1–1.9 scenario, but the difference is relatively small. Hence, we propose that, in addition to implementing stricter climate targets, designing targeted interventions remains crucial for controlling PM2.5 pollution, particularly for Asia.

Specifically, (a) the Americas, (b) Asia. Simulations were conducted with the global change assessment model (GCAM), IDGAR database, and the stable isotope analysis in R model (SIAR). The scenarios, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, combine Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which correspond to future radiative forcing and their climate impacts. Specifically, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 aim to limit global warming to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively. Error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3). For more details about the scenario settings in the PM pollution simulations, see the “Methods” section. These projected results by 2100 are close to the WHO guideline limit of 5 μg/m3, but have not yet been achieved.

Addressing the current limitations of isotope-based PM2.5 driver tracing, which primarily focused on local-scale, short-term pollution events involving single component, we constructed the global atmospheric isotopic database, IDGAR. Through global long-term temporal dynamic analyzes of isotopic big data, we identified the main sources and corresponding interventions for different PM2.5 species over the past two decades. Moreover, we achieved the source constraints on PM and its components based on IDGAR's multi-species isotopic fingerprints. However, projections indicate that WHO's recommended PM2.5 limit of 5 μg/m3 will not be met by 2100 under the current climate targets, need additional effective interventions, particularly in natural emissions.

Blockchain technology is critical for the accuracy and sustainability of IDGAR isotopic big data. It ensures each isotopic data point is unique, immutable, and traceable, thereby enhancing the accuracy of PM source tracing and intervention assessments. Given that isotopic analysis requires a high level of analytical capability and considerable time, the amount of isotopic data from a single laboratory is very limited, necessitating global trusted collaboration. Blockchain's tamper-proof and traceability features make IDGAR a trustworthy platform, encouraging researchers to enrich and utilize its isotopic data. Moreover, unlike traditional administrator-based databases, blockchain-based IDGAR implements a decentralized data management model, ensuring equal data management rights for all users.

Retrospective analysis of isotopic big data reveals remarkable intervention effects on C4 plants burning, coal combustion, or vehicle exhaust, particularly for EC, OC, NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, Pb-bearing PM. Our study have identified the main sources of most curated element species but not all, e.g., Fe-bearing PM, Zn-bearing PM, which require targeted interventions. In contrast to previous measure-specific intervention assessments based on bottom-up emission inventories29, our study provides a complementary top-down, component-level assessment, mitigating the impact of the nonlinear relationship between emissions and PM concentrations. Notably, hardly any PM species has been effectively intervened continuously in the past 20 years. This probably because the main sources of the target components have changed, but the intervention designs have not yet to respond. The asynchronous changes in the main sources and intervention effectiveness suggest that future intervention designs should be dynamically adjusted for different PM species. An ideal approach would be to develop an isotopic-guided intelligent system for designing interventions for different PM species within the IDGAR framework.

Source tracing utilizing isotopic big data reveals the specific emissions of critical PM2.5 components, which is essential for implementing precise source control. While the temporal changes in source composition highlight notable intervention effects on coal combustion, resulting in reductions of OC-bearing PM emissions in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Additionally, we further reveal the increasing impact of biomass burning and liquid fossil fuels combustion on PM2.5 levels in these three regions. Projections of PM2.5 trends under scenarios aimed at achieving climate goals of 1.5 °C and 2 °C also underscore the importance of implementing interventions on biomass burning to meet the WHO's annual PM2.5 guideline of 5 μg/m3. This is consistent with prior projections indicating that climate-driven natural emissions, e.g., wildfire smoke, will worsen PM2.5 exposure30,31.

In the Americas, satellite observations and global climate model projections show that biomass burning, e.g., wildfire smoke, will increasingly impact PM pollution24, intensifying with ongoing climate warming32,33. Therefore, developing interventions targeting wildfire may be effective for reaching WHO recommended threshold in the Americas. However, managing wildfires requires specialized interventions distinct from those employed for regional anthropogenic emission, which are not adequately covered by current air pollution regulations34. In Asia, the projected lowest PM2.5 levels will still be 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m3 in 2100, comparable to current levels in the Americas. In addition to wildfires, the notable increase in biomass burning emissions in Asia is largely due to extensive agricultural activities, particularly in rural South Asia8,22,35,36,37. Moreover, soil-related dust is another important driver of PM pollution, especially in Central and East Asia38. Therefore, simultaneous and intensive interventions targeting agricultural biomass burning, wildfires, and dust are necessary in Asia to achieve WHO guidelines.

In summary, we have launched the blockchain-based isotopic database for global atmospheric research. This database provides region-specific source-end isotopic values for PM tracing. Our analysis of long-term trends and change rates of isotopic big data reveals varying main sources and asynchronous interventions for different PM species. Predictions under climate mitigation scenarios indicate that controlling natural sources, e.g., biomass burning, is essential to meet WHO guidelines. Isotopic big data are critical for atmospheric research, extending beyond PM and emission tracing. The data can be used to quantify PM transport ranges and estimate deposition fluxes. Moreover, integrating isotopic big data with public health or policy factor datasets could contribute to source-specific health effect assessments and intelligent policy making.

The database developed in this study includes 34,815 non-redundant isotopic data points related to PM species and corresponding emissions, as recorded up to March 31, 2024. This database includes isotopic fingerprints for compounds and elements such as OC, EC, nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate, Si, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb, and Hg; different types of PM, e.g., PM2.5, PM10, and total suspended particulate matter (TSP); different PM sources, such as e.g., biomass burning, coal combustion, vehicle exhausts, waste materials, volatilized fertilizer, livestock emissions, microbial processes, industrial oil combustion, natural soil; and additional details such as specific components, sampling methods, locations, time periods, and analytical methods/measurement techniques. For detailed information, please refer to Supplementary Table 3–5. Briefly, the sampling of NH3 from sources is categorized into active and passive sampling. For source apportionment applications, data correction for passive sampling is performed by adding 15.4‰, following commonly used methods in the literature39. Source emissions of NOX are collected through active sampling using the standard solution absorption method40. Similarly, almost source emissions of SO2 are also collected via active sampling with solution absorption. Since only one study used passive sampling for SO2, we excluded its reported values from S source tracing to ensure data standardization and the reliability of the research findings41. Aside from NH3, NOx, and SO2, other PM components (such as OC, EC, Si, and metals) included in the database are not sampled individually but are collected through active sampling of source emissions, followed by the analysis of the specific isotopic fingerprint characteristics of the different components within the particulate matter. Additionally, different components may be analyzed using various methods. For instance, the nitrogen isotope measurement is conducted using both chemical conversion and bacterial conversion methods; for Strontium (Sr) isotopic measurement might be performed using thermal-ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), both of which undergo strict quality control. The isotopic results from different analytical methods are reported with reference to international standard reference materials, ensuring consistency and standardization. Regarding different standard reference materials, such as Zn, the Zn isotopic composition is typically expressed in per mil (‰) relative to the “zero point” of the isotopic standard reference material, IRMM-3702. Notably, some publications report the Zn isotopic composition relative to JMC 3-0749 L Lyon (another reference material). The Zn isotopic composition of JMC 3-0749 L Lyon is +0.32‰ relative to IRMM-3702. For clarity, the Zn isotopic signatures presented here have been converted to be relative to IRMM-3702. Notably, given the importance of data standardization and the emergence of more precise cross-validation methods, the data in this database needs to be standardized and updated.

The data were extracted from 804 publications (including peer-reviewed papers, conference papers.) using Web Plot Digitizer (version 4.2, San Francisco, California, USA). The publications were identified through manual searches on Web of Science (http://isiknowledge.com), Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com), and Baidu Scholar (http://xueshu.baidu.com). The specific keywords, number of samples, type of data, and specific reference are provided in Supplementary Table 3 and “References” in Supplementary Information. These information can also be found in IDGAR database (http://idgar.org/). ArcGIS Pro (ESRI; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) was used to visualize the specific geographic locations of these isotopic data. The base map was downloaded from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/.

In addition to radiocarbon (14C) and Pb, the isotopic fingerprints of other elements are reported as delta values (δ) relative to an isotopic standard reference material (SRM) using the following formula:

where E represents a selected element and x and y describe the mass numbers of the isotopes of element E.

Notably, the isotope analysis methods used for an element may vary among publications. This expression, relative to an SRM with a “zero point”, makes it feasible to perform comprehensive analyzes based on multiple isotopes. The specific SRMs (Supplementary Table 3) and analytical accuracy of these isotopic analyzes are collected in the developed database.

Isotopic fingerprints for radiocarbon (14C) are reported as the fraction of modern carbon (fM-14C) as follows:

where the standard reference material is the oxalic acid II 4990 C from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA21,42.

Due to the lack of a unified standard reference material, Pb isotopic signatures are reported as 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb.

Additionally, the data of PM concentrations in 2021 were sourced from the public dataset of ground-level PM2.5, measured at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° from 1998 to 2022 (V5.GL.04), calculated by the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group43.

A web portal for the IDGAR including PM data and the corresponding emissions was established using blockchain technology. The IDGAR website was developed using the Spring Boot framework with the MVC architecture pattern, and MariaDB was utilized for data storage. The website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is publicly available at http://idgar.org/. Moreover, blockchain technology is used to secure the database against data tampering and to support operations across multiple nodes. The SHA256 hashing function is used to process data: user registration details are hashed, generating a 64-character hexadecimal string. This hash string is then stored across various database nodes for security. Each user's information hash string forms a block, and the blocks are connected in chronological order to create a blockchain. The IDGAR includes a data validation procedure, in which the hash strings are continuously recalculated in real time (every 5 minutes). If any discrepancies in the hash strings are detected, we can precisely identify the affected block and tracing the origins for non-compliance.

Newly uploaded data undergo real-time hash string validation and are rigorously compared with existing strings in the database. If a conflict occurs, the system automatically assigns incremental version numbers to subsequent file versions. The irreversible nature of blockchain prohibits direct editing of uploaded data in the IDGAR. If a user makes an honest error and needs to correct the uploaded content, they can submit the corrected data with a clear statement, automatically generating incremented version numbers for the file. The old data remain intact in the blockchain at all times.

Moreover, an early warning system activates promptly if a node is attacked, transferring all the data once the network virus is eradicated. This decentralized management fosters equitable data sharing. Notably, unpublished data are not decentralized but rather controlled by the uploader using password-based key derivation encryption. Users who receive the shared key from the uploader can access it. With the development of the IDGAR, unpublished data can be uploaded with clear statements to foster academic collaboration.

One-way analyzes and Pearson correlation analyzes were carried out by using SigmaPlot version 12.5 (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the Origin 2016 statistical package (OriginLab Corporation, USA). The remaining statistical analyzes were conducted in R version 4.1.3 using the “stats” package, unless stated otherwise. Briefly, the temporal trends of the PM isotopic fingerprints were analyzed via bootstrap procedures. The method of formal testing was used to identify the breakpoints from all years. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Theil-Sen estimator was employed to test the robustness of the results. Moreover, a one-dimensional moving subset window analysis was employed to estimate the temporal trends in the PM isotopic composition from 2001 to 2022, including dependencies on longitude and latitude for source isotopic changes. For each isotope, the data were segmented into several subsets based on sampling times or locations, with each subset encompassing several consecutive years, longitudes, or latitudes. The initial subset was established as the starting point. Subsequent subsets were formed by excluding data from the earliest year or site of the previous subset and incorporating an additional step. The slope and P value of the linear regression between the isotopic composition and year or site information in each subset indicate the rate (k) of change of the isotopic composition and its significance over the respective period or geographic range.

To visualize the relationships among all the data, all the isotopic data, along with the PM type, concentration, sampling time, latitude, and longitude, are presented in a 2D figure. Briefly, all of the data are uniformly transformed into corresponding 64-dimensional vectors through a shallow neural network based on a given corpus. This process was carried out in Python version 4.1 with the “gensim” package. Then, dimensionality reduction was performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction of multivariate statistical data26, after preprocessing with principal component analysis (PCA), which was carried out in R version 4.1.3 with the “tsne” package.

The relative proportions of the selected species (e.g., compounds, metals) in PM from diverse emissions are quantitatively estimated by the Bayesian MixSIAR model. This model was performed in R version 4.1.3 with the “MixSIAR” package. Considering increasing the data volume and the number of simulations can effectively improve the reliability of the analysis, we conducted source tracing analysis of PM components using IDGAR isotopic big data rather than relying on a few scattered data points. Moreover, we set the number of iterations to 1,000,000 with a burn-in of 500,000 in our MixSIAR simulation. Furthermore, the Isospace plots and Markov chain Monte Carlo diagnostic tests (including Gelman-Rubin and Geweke) have been incorporated into the MixSIAR package to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. The MixSIAR method can identify the most reasonable source composition of a mixture based on isotope mass balance5.

Moreover, the fractionation effect of some isotopes (e.g., NH4+) and the variabilities in isotopic fingerprints of measurements and sampling can be incorporated into this model (see Supplementary Note 3 for details)6. For OC, we first determined the contributions of fossil and non-fossil fuel combustion using fM14C-OC, followed by a detailed analysis of specific fossil and non-fossil fuel contributions using the isotopic chemical mass balance of δ13C44. The overall calculation principle of source tracing can be expressed as follows:

where δxEPM represents the isotopic fingerprint of the PM, δxEi is the isotopic composition of potential sources. The fi values describe the relative contributions of the emissions to the selected species in the PM.

Afterward, using the fi value multiply the mass concentration (%) of the selected compound or element (e.g., EC) in PM, we can estimate the weight of this component emitted from each source to PM2.5. The detailed mass concentrations of the curated species in PM2.5 are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2a. The calculation processes can be expressed as follows:

where F represents the relative contributions of sources to PM2.5 by emitting the selected component. The f values are source contributions to the selected component. C (%) reflects the mass concentrations of the selected components in the PM2.5.

The uncertainty in source apportionment was derived from the MixSIAR model analysis and the error propagation formula. The detailed calculation process is as follows:

where σSsum represents the standard deviation of the total contributions from source ‘S' to PM2.5. XE denotes the mass concentration of component ‘E' in PM2.5, and CES represents the relative contribution of source ‘S' to component ‘E' in PM2.5, as calculated by MixSIAR. Additionally, σXE indicates the uncertainty in the mass concentration of component ‘E' in PM2.5, while σCES reflects the uncertainty in the CES values derived from MixSIAR.

To further validate this method, we used fM-14C to evaluate the δ13C-based source tracing results of EC in PM2.5. Specifically, we calculated the fM-14C isotopic compositions of EC in PM2.5 based on the fM-14C of primary sources and δ13C-based relative contributions, and compared them with the observed values. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 13, the calculated fM-14C isotopic compositions of EC were consistent with the observed values. The largest net difference between the calculated values and observed data was 0.05, which was smaller than the observed uncertainty of 0.0745. This supported the robustness of the δ13C-based source tracing results. Furthermore, the comparison of model performance among MixSIAR, MixSIR, and FRUITS confirms the robustness of the source apportionment results in this study (see Supplementary Note 4 for details).

The framework for PM2.5 pollution simulation in the Americas and Asia comprises two sub-sections, i.e., emission projection and air quality modeling. The future emission changes of diverse sectors under climate mitigation scenarios towards 2100 were performed with the global change assessment model (GCAM). Specifically, we selected two scenarios, SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6, which integrate different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). SSPs show the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation, capturing key socioeconomic factors. RCPs reflect the levels of ambition in climate policies. The scenarios SSP1–1.9 (SSP1 + RCP1.9) and SSP1–2.6 (SSP1 + RCP2.6) align with global climate goals of limiting warming to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively. These scenarios represent the most likely patterns of global development in the future. Using updated emission data, we further estimated the trends in PM2.5 pollution and their isotopic composition through the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry analysis (WRF-Chem) and the SIAR model. It is worth noting that, due to noticeable uncertainty in emission inventories, the predicted PM2.5 pollution levels usually require optimization and correction. Isotopic-based source tracing results can refine the inventory from a top-down perspective, enhancing the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions (Supplementary Fig. 14).

 NFT sales volumes reached $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 61% decline from the same period in 2024. 

Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea regained its position as the leading platform for digital collectible trading, even as overall market activity declined.

Data tracker NFTScan shows that OpenSea has held the top spot in NFT marketplace trading volume for the last 30 days. According to the data, OpenSea holds more than 40% of the market's trading volume, while Blur, its largest competitor, is at 23%. NFT platform Magic Eden has a 7.69% market share, while OKX NFTs have a 5% market share. 

The data tracker also shows that in the last month, almost 70% of the wallets transacting with NFTs engaged with OpenSea. More than 610,000 wallets used OpenSea. In the last three months, OpenSea had over 2.1 million wallets engaging with its platform. 

By comparison, wallets engaging with Magic Eden, Blur and OKX NFT reached a combined market share of 17%, about 103,000 wallets. In the last three months, the platforms had a total of 380,000 wallets trading NFTs on their platforms. 

In the last quarter of 2024, OpenSea promoted the launch of its new platform OS2. OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer said they would “reimagine everything,” and that a new version would come in December.  

On Feb. 13, OpenSea launched the open beta for OS2, allowing the public to finally use its platform after a period of reserved access for private beta users. The NFT marketplace also teased the launch of the project's official token, SEA. 

Apart from launching a revamped NFT marketplace, the project ventured into crypto token trading. 

On April 19, the platform announced that it had opened its Solana trading access for all its users, skipping a scheduled closed beta phase limited to 50,000 users. The new feature allows OpenSea users to trade Solana tokens, including popular memecoins like Bonk and Ai16z. 

In addition to platform developments, the NFT marketplace had also been freed from regulatory scrutiny. On Feb. 22, Finzer said the US Securities and Exchange Commission had dropped its investigation into the digital collectible marketplace.

OpenSea is regaining its market dominance amid a slowdown in NFT sales volumes. CryptoSlam data shows that in Q1 2025, NFT sales volumes reached $1.5 billion. This represented a 61% decline compared to the $4.1 billion volume in the same period in 2024. 

Despite declining sales volumes, some metrics show that NFTs are still interesting to many traders. CryptoSlam shows over 359,000 NFT buyers in the last seven days, a 52% increase compared to the previous week. 

Furthermore, despite the volume slowdown, some collections have shown signs of life. In the last seven days, CryptoPunks surged 82% in sales. In the last 30 days, the collection reached almost $20 million in sales volumes.

Art linked to tens of thousands of NFTs from the CloneX and Animus collections suddenly disappeared on Thursday leaving owners blindsided. 

The cause? A bug with Cloudflare, the service provider creator RTFKT used to host the images for the two collections. 

RTFKT is a digital fashion company known for creating virtual sneakers and NFTs. It was acquired by sportswear giant Nike in 2021.

The problem began when Cloudflare moved RTFKT to its free plan before the end of its contract, triggering a bug that cut off the images tied to the NFTs, Samuel Cardillo, RTFKT's head of technology, said on X. 

“Nobody likes to see their content lost, especially due to a mistake made by a cloud provider, and especially when it's 30,000 plus NFT images,” Phil Mataras, CEO of decentralised cloud network ar.io, which is working with RTFKT to upload the files to its cloud network, told DL News.

The situation was quickly remedied, and the NFT images are back after an hours-long absence.

But it's something NFT collectors continue to fear.

While NFTs are able to live forever on blockchains, the images associated with them are often just stored on centralised servers. If something happens to the servers, or those who created the NFTs stop paying the hosting fees, the NFT images disappear, defeating the whole purpose of the digital collectibles. 

CloneX and Animus aren't the first time the pictures associated with NFTs have disappeared, but they're certainly the most high profile case.

The situation is also similar to that at Rally, a once-popular creator platform where influencers, celebrities, and artists issued tokens and NFTs which came with fan perks like exclusive access to music.

Rally shut down in 2023, telling users that the NFTs on the platform would no longer be accessible.

In late 2021, RTFKT launched CloneX, a collection of 20,000 NFT avatars in collaboration with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.

CloneX NFTs soared in value during the bull market in late 2021 and early 2022. The cheapest NFTs in the collection sold for over $63,000 each at their peak, while rarer examples frequently fetched over a million dollars.

But CloneX, along with much of the NFT market, has been trapped in a drawn-out bear market in recent years.

Animus, a follow up to CloneX, launched in 2022 to limited success.

In December, RTFKT announced it planned to wind down operations. CloneX NFTs now sell for around $300 each. 

Not all NFTs could potentially disappear like the ones created by RTFKT briefly did.

Some, like the 2017 pixel-art collection CryptoPunks, have all the image data stored with the NFTs onchain. This is possible because the CryptoPunks images consist of small amounts of data — they're just a 24 by 24 grid of pixels using a limited palette of colours. 

NFTs with more detailed images are usually stored on centralised servers, or via decentralised file storage systems like Arweave, which RTFKT chose to move the CloneX and Animus NFT images to after the Cloudflare debacle.

“We acted quickly to prioritise this as the community was frantic,” ar.io's Mataras said. 

Arweave is designed to store data permanently with a one-time payment, using a decentralised network and open ledger system to store data.

“Once uploaded, these images will stay put, forever,” Mataras said.

DraftKings, the popular sports betting and fantasy sports company, has agreed to a $10 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning its now-defunct non-fungible token (NFT) platform, DK Marketplace. The lawsuit alleged that DraftKings sold unregistered securities in the form of NFTs, leaving many buyers at financial risk.

The class-action lawsuit was filed in March 2023 by lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who argued that DraftKings' Reignmakers NFTs qualified as investment contracts under U.S. securities law, specifically based on the Howey Test. This legal standard is used by courts to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security.

You can learn more about the Howey Test from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) here:🔗 https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets

In July 2024, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper denied DraftKings' motion to dismiss the case. The judge applied the Howey Test and found that the NFTs could reasonably be treated as securities, giving the lawsuit significant legal weight.

Following this decision, DraftKings shut down its NFT platform, leaving thousands of users with illiquid assets that dropped drastically in value.

The $10 million class-action settlement was preliminarily approved on February 28, 2025. According to court filings, the money will be distributed among individuals who bought, sold, or held DraftKings NFTs between August 11, 2021, and the final judgment date.

This could involve more than 175,000 investors, according to reports from Cointelegraph and SBC Americas.

After deducting legal fees and administrative expenses, the settlement funds will be shared proportionally among eligible class members. Lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe is also expected to receive a $50,000 service award for representing the class.

DraftKings cited “recent legal developments” as the reason for shutting down its NFT marketplace, a move that left Reignmakers NFTs illiquid and virtually worthless. With no platform for resale or trade, users who had invested in the NFTs were left with little recourse.

This closure also came shortly after DraftKings reached a separate undisclosed settlement in January 2025 with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), which had sued the company for using NFL player likenesses in Reignmakers without paying royalties.

More about the NFLPA can be found at their official site: 🔗 https://www.nflpa.com/

If you are a U.S. resident who purchased, sold, or held a DraftKings NFT through DK Marketplace during the defined class period, you may be eligible to claim part of the settlement.

Claimants should keep an eye on official notifications or updates via legal settlement portals. Details about claim submission deadlines and methods will be published following final settlement approval by the court.

This case adds to a growing list of legal actions targeting crypto and NFT platforms over alleged securities violations. It underscores increasing regulatory scrutiny of digital assets and reinforces the need for consumer protection in evolving financial markets.

DraftKings' $10 million payout marks a significant moment in the legal landscape surrounding NFTs and digital assets. 

While the company has not admitted wrongdoing, the settlement offers partial financial redress to affected users and sets a precedent for how courts may treat NFT-based products in the future.

As digital finance continues to evolve, this case serves as a strong reminder to investors: do your due diligence, understand the risks, and follow regulatory developments closely.

As NFT adoption expands across digital markets, the blending of collectible culture, gamified incentives, and blockchain-based utility continues to deepen. This fusion is especially noticeable in platforms that rank among the highest rated casinos, where mechanics like digital ownership, scarcity-driven value, and interactive rewards closely reflect those found in many NFT ecosystems. Understanding how these systems intersect can offer NFT enthusiasts new perspectives on utility, interactivity, and value in decentralized environments.

NFTs have transcended their origins as mere digital collectibles. Today's landscape of NFTs revolves around stakeable assets, dynamic smart contracts, and real-time utility in metaverse platforms and play-to-earn ecosystems. Projects such as Sorare and Axie Infinity have set a new standard with their NFTs that allow for aesthetic ownership as well as earning, trading, and participating in a wider economic system.

Additionally, this active engagement model mirrors strategies of many high-performing digital platforms. To retain users, these platforms entice repeat participation by creating incrementally rewarding systems, tiered perks, and gamified value roll-up schemes. The passive and value-driven interactions that both industries emphasize were the innovative system that allowed for fresh methods to participate in the engagement.

NFT platforms have a wide range of features, and the most sophisticated digital casinos all have one thing in common: the loyalty program and engagement-centered recreation promote off-activity association toward predefined NFT or tokenomic value targets they need to achieve or milestones they unlock through participation. Earned, spent, or redeemable tokens propel engagement forward.

Loyalty points are allocated for every interaction; users are automatically placed in levels that can be infinitely progressed. Even more sophisticated systems allow for custom point scoring that can be set by the users themselves. Achievements are literally unlimited. The challenge comes from crafting fair engagement models that earn users' earned social capital through posted interactions and incentivize user engagement at sustainable levels while maintaining verifiably transparent token economics.

Minting events commonly use random number generators to create exciting surprises through NFT drops and listing events. Generative art and gaming equipment creation are great examples. Projects such as Capsule House and Art Blocks thrive on this mechanic, introducing unprecedented freedom into partnered user experiences.

The same aspect of likelihood determines the defining characteristics of interactive digital entertainment ecosystems. Interactive digital platforms often implement RNG to ensure fairness and uniqueness; some are even audited under regulatory scrutiny. The connected industry applies RNG in similar ways, depicting how both industries are attempting to blend randomness with value, wherein the outcome is both pleasantly unexpected and extremely desirable.

NFT platforms operate on the basis of community building. Users can participate in DAOs, vote on roadmap decisions, or create assets—all these activities contribute to shaping NFT ecosystems. It is striking to point out that leading NFT projects have focused on transparency and usefulness of value over time, which explains why they sustain community engagement.

There are examples that illustrate this participatory model: those centered around user innovation. Take, for instance, the most popular casinos and countless other platforms that use a sharpened focus on engagement. Responsibly driven engagement tools make users devoted to the brand, along with transparent communication. Such platforms often foster stronger communities and experience growth over time as opposed to those that view users as passive pieces of hardware. Success, in both spaces, relies on the amount of funding and outreach incentive provided to communities.

With the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital assets are becoming a means of personal expression. From NFT profile picture collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club to avatar skins in metaverse games, NFTs offer status and functionality to their owners. These assets can be used across various platforms and are not limited to gaming, branding, or social networking; they serve multiple purposes.

This cross-platform use comes hand-in-hand with other engagement trends, such as loyalty programs that reward user interaction in the highest-rated casinos. In every form, users are more than just players or holders: They actively participate in ecosystems where their contributions and assets matter continually.

The NFT space continuously incorporates parts from established digital sectors, creating an ever-expanding digital environment. The broader application of fundamental principles like RNG, tokenomics, gamified advancement, and participatory governance underscores the emerging innovation nexus between NFTs and other decentralized ecosystems. Studying how the highest-rated casinos engage users with transparent, fair, and value-driven policies can help the NFT domain define sustainable growth strategies.

The advancement of NFT platforms with a focus on user experience, engagement, and openness will mark industry leaders. The future does not rest in the separation of industries but rather in recognizing the cross-sections of blockchain technologies and their proven ecosystems and determining how to synergistically grow.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a joint stipulation with Dragonchain that it wants to drop its lawsuit, citing the work of its Crypto Task Force. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to drop its unregistered securities lawsuit against  blockchain firm Dragonchain in the agency's latest crypto-related backdown. 

In a joint stipulation filed with Dragonchain on April 24 in a Seattle federal court, the SEC said it “believes the dismissal of this case is appropriate,” citing the work of the agency's Crypto Task Force in helping “develop the regulatory framework for crypto assets.”

“The Commission and the Defendants stipulate that this Litigation be dismissed with prejudice [...] and without costs or fees to either party,” the filing reads.

The SEC sued Dragonchain, Inc.; its backer, the Dragonchain Foundation; The Dragon Company; and Dragonchain's founder, Joseph Roets, in August 2024, claiming they raised $16.5 million through a crypto token that was an unregistered securities offering.

According to the SEC, the Dragonchain (DRGN) tokens raised $14 million in an August 2017 presale and an initial coin offering (ICO) that ran in October and November of that year. At the time, it said the company needed to register as the tokens were investment contracts under securities laws. 

The SEC said a further $2.5 million worth of DRGN was sold between 2019 and 2022, which it alleged was used to cover business expenses and develop the firm's tech. 

The suit was stayed in October after Dragonchain made a settlement offer to the SEC, which was extended in January after the agency said the case should remain paused due to US President Donald Trump's sweeping executive order earlier that month calling for the country's “leadership in digital assets.”

Meanwhile, the DRGN token has jumped 95% over the past day to over 8.5 cents on news of the SEC's planned dismissal, but it's still down around 98.5% from its $5.46 peak in January 2018, according to CoinGecko.

It's the latest case involving crypto that the SEC has abandoned under the Trump administration.

The SEC spun up a Crypto Task Force in January, the day after Trump re-entered the White House, to lead the regulator's engagement with the crypto industry.

An agency memo shows its task force met with Dragonchain representatives on March 24 to discuss how the SEC should approach handling crypto.

The SEC has also dismissed some of its most high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms, including its actions against Coinbase, Ripple and Kraken.

It's also dropped investigations into other crypto firms, including OpenSea, Crypto.com and Immutable, with no further action planned.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has agreed to drop its lawsuit against blockchain firm Dragonchain, ending a long-running case over the sale of crypto tokens.

In a joint court filing made on April 24 in a federal court in Seattle, the SEC said the dismissal was “appropriate,” pointing to the work of its newly formed Crypto Task Force and a shift in its approach to digital assets. 

The court filing confirmed that the case would be dismissed “with prejudice,” meaning it cannot be brought back in the future. “The Commission and the Defendants stipulate that this Litigation be dismissed with prejudice […] and without costs or fees to either party,” the document stated.

The lawsuit was originally filed in August 2022 and accused Dragonchain of offering unregistered securities. 

According to the SEC, the company raised $14 million during a 2017 presale and ICO of its DRGN token. The agency also claimed Dragonchain made another $2.5 million from 2019 to 2022 to cover company expenses and build technology.

The SEC said Dragonchain should have registered the offering because it was considered an investment contract under U.S. law. The case was put on hold in October 2024 after Dragonchain made a settlement offer. 

In January 2025, the pause was extended after President Donald Trump signed an executive order pushing federal agencies to support leadership in digital assets.

The SEC launched its Crypto Task Force a day after the executive order. A memo shows SEC officials met with Dragonchain representatives on March 24. The meeting was led by Dragonchain founder Joe Roets, who argued that blockchain technology should not be seen only as a financial tool.

In the meeting, Roets explained how the platform could be used for fraud prevention, identity checks, and secure data storage.

Dragonchain was created by Disney in 2014 and later became an independent project. It allows companies to build secure applications using blockchain without sharing all data publicly. The company uses smart contracts written in everyday programming languages like Java and Python.

Following news of the dismissal, Dragonchain's DRGN token jumped 128% in 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. It's still far below its all-time high of $5.46 in 2018, but the spike broke a months-long slump.

BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has just blasted through the $5 million mark in its ICO. 

This Bitcoin-linked meme coin is generating serious buzz by promising actual BTC airdrops when Bitcoin hits milestone prices.

And with one top analyst predicting “huge” returns post-listing, BTCBULL is quickly becoming a hot topic.

BTC Bull Token's setup is drawing lots of attention.

Think of it as your ticket to Bitcoin's next bull run – without needing to shell out $90K+ for a whole coin.

Here's how it works: When Bitcoin hits key price milestones (starting at $150K and moving up in $50K chunks), BTCBULL holders get actual Bitcoin airdropped to their wallets.

If you get involved in the ICO, you're first in line for these payouts.

BTCBULL's team also burns tokens at various Bitcoin price points ($125K, $175K, and $225K), permanently removing them from circulation.

Some bulls just want to watch fiat burn. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/FJKHkAumUq

— BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) April 23, 2025



This approach helps create scarcity, which tends to push prices up over time. 

And then there's the staking rewards on offer. 

Early stakers can generate an annual yield of 82%, although this yield will decrease gradually as more people get involved.

However, that hasn't stopped investors from locking up over 1.2 billion BTCBULL tokens already.

The project's Telegram channel members see BTCBULL as a way to bet on Bitcoin's price action while receiving a sort of “dividend” along the way. 

With BTCBULL's ICO price sitting at $0.00248, investors have less than 48 hours before the next price hike kicks in.

The ICO has been gaining serious momentum, with options to buy using crypto, bank cards, or directly through the Best Wallet app – making it accessible to new traders.

BTCBULL's team has also set aside 10% of the supply for initial liquidity.

Popular analyst Crypto ZEUS, who has a sizable following on YouTube, released a video about BTC Bull Token last week.



ZEUS is extremely bullish on BTCBULL's unique milestone system, believing it could create massive wealth for holders if Bitcoin goes on another bull run.

He also pointed out the lack of bull-themed meme coins in today's market.

Most meme coins focus on dogs, cats, or frogs, yet BTCBULL takes an entirely different approach that could help it stand out. 

All in all, Crypto ZEUS is optimistic, predicting BTCBULL could have a “huge 2025.”

So, what does the future hold for BTCBULL? 

If you invest in BTCBULL, you're essentially making a bet on Bitcoin's future – with some interesting twists. 

Bitcoin hitting $125K, $150K, or even $200K this year isn't some crazy fantasy. 

With institutional money still flowing in and supply getting squeezed, these milestones could happen faster than most people expect.

And that's where BTCBULL could prove lucrative.

The first time Bitcoin crosses these thresholds, tokens will be burned (reducing supply) or holders will receive airdrops (increasing demand).

It's a double-whammy that could boost gains far beyond what holding Bitcoin alone would give you.

When Bitcoin runs, investors tend to look for higher beta plays. 

BTCBULL positions itself as one of these plays, and given the size of its X (Twitter) community, it's already building the kind of momentum that could translate into serious FOMO once exchange listings are announced. 

The $5 million milestone might be just the beginning of what could become one of 2025's most talked-about token launches if Bitcoin continues to rise.

China's digital yuan remains the benchmark for a major economy's central bank digital currency (CBDC), and the Asian nation has been working with some of its allies to expand it beyond its borders. In the past week, some reports have indicated that the Chinese government has linked the e-CNY to over a dozen countries in Asia and the Middle East.

Elsewhere, Pakistan is accelerating its digital asset push, and this time, its top security agency has proposed a regulatory framework that seeks to stamp out money laundering and other crimes from the sector.

China's CBDC expansion reports draw scrutiny

Over the past week, a few reports, which all seem to have originated in China, claimed that the People's Bank of China (PBoC) had announced new partners for its CBDC. The partnerships revolve around integrating the digital yuan into over a dozen countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

The reports, many of which have been taken down, claimed that the integration includes 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and 6 Middle Eastern countries. However, none of the reports point to any official announcement by the PBoC or the corresponding central banks.

The specific countries were not mentioned. However, if the reports were true, Hong Kong, Thailand, the UAE and Saudi Arabia would presumably be the first to integrate the CBDC. These four states are members of mBridge, a cross-border initiative that seeks to ease funds transfer using CBDCs.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) was also a primary member of the project but pulled out last November. BIS cited the project's maturity as its reason for exiting, but insiders revealed concerns about the subversion of mBridge into a BRICS system, potentially making the heavily-sanctioned Russia a primary member.

mBridge also has over 30 observers, ranging from international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank to central banks from Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain. However, these have no direct involvement in the project. Most have yet to make notable strides in their CBDC development, a primary qualifier for mBridge.

While the new integrations may have been misreported, they point to a growing concern in the West over the potential of the digital yuan. Some have described it as “the largest threat to the West in the past 30 to 40 years.” Others have sounded a warning that China could use the CBDC to challenge the role of the U.S. dollar in global trade.

However, China continues to dismiss the claims. PBoC leaders have reiterated that the country is just preparing for a digitalized future and wants to ease payments for its people.

The former deputy governor of the PBoC, Li Bo, is among those who have dismissed the digital yuan's threat.










“For the internationalization of the renminbi, we have said many times that it's a natural process, and our goal is not to replace the U.S. dollar or other international currencies,” he stated four years ago.

Pakistan proposes FATF-aligned regulatory framework

In Pakistan, the country's lead security and counter-intelligence agency has proposed a new regulatory framework for the country's digital assets sector.

The framework is aligned with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and extends to digital assets and the platforms that handle them, from exchanges to wallets, a local outlet report.

Developed by a special task force under the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), it focuses on compliance, from curbing money laundering and terrorism financing to prudential requirements and consumer protection.

The Pakistani government has invited feedback on the proposal from industry stakeholders and the general public. It will then table the framework in parliament, and if it sails through, it's to be implemented in phases starting next year.

“This is a paradigm shift in how Pakistan views digital finance. The policy proposal seeks to strike a historic balance between technological advancement and national security imperatives,” commented FIA Director Sumera Azam.

Pakistan has a thriving Web3 ecosystem, with some local experts claiming the country has at least 15 million digital asset holders. However, it still lacks a comprehensive framework, which the Pakistan Crypto Council says has held the industry back. The Council, formed last year to spur adoption, has called for enabling regulations to allow local VASPs to compete with their offshore rivals.

The guidance withdrawals “ensure the Board's expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system,” the Federal Reserve said Thursday.

The Federal Reserve withdrew three pieces of Biden-era guidance Thursday related to banks' engagement in cryptocurrency.

The Fed withdrew two supervisory letters dictating that banks should seek prior approval from regulators before dabbling in cryptocurrency or stablecoin ventures.

It also joined the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in withdrawing a 2023 joint statement warning banks of “key risks” associated with the novel asset class.

The Fed said it will no longer expect banks to provide notification of crypto or stablecoin activities and will instead monitor such activities through the normal supervisory process.

The changes “ensure the Board's expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system,” the Fed said in a statement alongside the withdrawals.

Biden-era financial regulators were seen by the crypto world as unamenable to digital assets, and it was alleged that regulators conducted a concerted effort, known as Operation Choke Point 2.0, to keep crypto out of the traditional financial sector. Gary Gensler, then head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in 2023 that the industry was full of “hucksters, fraudsters, scam artists, [and] Ponzi schemes.”

Regulators under Trump 2.0, however, have positioned themselves as pro-crypto by walking back old guidance, abandoning legal cases against crypto firms and, in the case of the SEC, creating a task force with the express purpose of regulatory framework development.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-WY, however, took to social media site X Friday to call the Fed's guidance withdrawals “just noise, not real progress.”

“We are NOT fooled. The Fed assassinated companies within the industry and hurt American interests by stifling innovation and shuttering businesses. This fight is far from over,” she wrote.

Lummis has long been a proponent of digital assets, and three years ago introduced a bill that aimed to give the industry a regulatory framework. She was recently named chair of the Senate's first-ever panel on digital assets.

A Fed spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story' is less about crypto and more about being human","https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-an-ethereum-story-less-crypto-more-human","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 08:53:56 GMT","

 Documentary directors Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple reveal how their film's mere existence is a use case for crypto in filmmaking. 

When Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple had the idea to make the documentary film Vitalik: An Ethereum Story, they were actually filming another documentary, and over the course of their filmmaking journey, they ended up capturing both a deeper, human look at the world of crypto and an end product that serves as a use case for the future of crypto filmmaking.

When crafting a documentary, filmmakers will typically start with a vision of what they'd like to explore, a vision often saddled with a set of assumptions, only to shatter that vision once filming begins, creating an entirely new direction for the project.

It's a creative evolution that filmmakers Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple also experienced while making the documentary feature This Is Not Financial Advice, during which they realized they had an entirely different film on their hands.

“While we were making that film, we wanted to interview Vitalik Buterin,” Ingrasci said to me during a recent interview. “We got connected to him, but as soon as we met him, we were really inspired by his unique form of tech optimism and how he broke stereotypes we'd had of the crypto space. He was a billionaire but very humble, funny, quirky and truly committed to his values of decentralization. That was very inspiring for us — so much so, we thought we should make a piece about Vitalik or about the Ethereum community at large.”



But Ingrasci and Temple weren't crypto-native filmmakers — rather, they were individuals interested in technology and communities using technology in new ways, and Vitalik and Ethereum just happened to check both of those boxes.

Ingrasci and Temple then went out and launched a non-fungible token (NFT) crowdfunding campaign, raising almost $2 million in 50 hours, allowing them to get started quickly in the summer of 2021 during the height of the NFT boom.

“It allowed us to own the film without being beholden to any stakeholder, platform or middleman who would otherwise be directing the content of the film,” Temple said. “It was an amazing opportunity to spend over two years following Vitalik — a global nomad — all around the world.”

Temple and Ingrasci followed Buterin to Ukraine, Montenegro, Toronto and Colombia, trying to understand the man behind the technology. They even spent time with Buterin's father and his family members, diving into the history of his family emigrating from Russia to Canada.

“We wanted to understand how Vitalik's upbringing had affected his values,” Temple said. “We spent time talking with folks in the Ethereum community, with Vitalik's friends and others, trying to paint this deeper picture and understand how the creators of crypto technologies affect the end product. How are they coding their values, blindspots and interests into the end result?”

From the beginning, Temple and Ingrasci's main goal was to create a piece that would be accessible to a mainstream audience, one that could help translate some of the values and interesting things they were seeing in the Ethereum community in a way that a non-crypto native person could understand.

But they didn't really know what that meant or what it would lead to initially since they were following different stories and different people within the Ethereum ecosystem. As they were editing the documentary together, they started testing it with people who knew nothing about crypto, who, as expected, were very confused.

“It's so difficult to create a documentary that's accessible and entertaining for people who know nothing about the crypto space, but we saw very clearly in the feedback from these early screenings that when people could connect to someone — especially Vitalik, who is so likeable and inspiring — it creates an entry point to then get into these more abstract concepts,” Ingrasci said.

“We did not set out to make the film only about Vitalik, and I don't think the film is only about Vitalik,” Ingrasci told Cointelegraph.

“Vitalik is our human hook, our human story about someone who is going to surprise you, break your stereotypes about crypto, and leave you a little more excited than you thought you would be after watching this film.”

According to Ingrasci, Buterin's favorite scenes in the film were when he was drinking tea or making breakfast — being his normal, quirky, funny self.

“That's what makes this film entertaining, watchable and human,” Ingrasci said. “When someone is willing to be natural on camera with us as filmmakers, it creates a much more human story rather than this very intellectual version of Vitalik that we were already very aware of.”

During the filming of Vitalik, Buterin's father talked to the filmmakers about how, growing up, Buterin's favorite toy was the computer, and his favorite thing was to play with Excel. 

“When he was seven years old, he actually built a 100-page manifesto that was an imaginary world for bunnies,” Temple said. “It had their financial systems, energy systems and was full of graphs and tables — an amazing creation for a seven-year-old's mind. I think to so many of the people we shared this with, it helps people connect to the world of Ethereum as a new world being built. If you can imagine Vitalik as a seven-year-old building this whole new imaginary world, that's what he's trying to build again with Ethereum.”

It's all part of Buterin's hope for Ethereum creating real utility in the world, something Ingrasci felt was epitomized when Buterin visited Ukraine.

“When he went to Ukraine, he was talking to the vice prime minister, Fedorov, and it quickly became apparent that the banking system at the beginning of the war was in shambles,” Ingrasci said. “Without crypto, thousands of lives in the military would have been lost because crypto was able to get money very quickly to the front lines and was able to mobilize across borders, raising over $130 million for Ukraine to resist this invasion. When Vitalik was there visiting Kyiv during the war, he got to see this thing he helped create being used in this incredibly important way, and that's where that world-building came into reality. It was an emotional moment to witness just how powerful it was.”

In many ways it's because Buterin is simply a child at play, tapping into his inner youthful creativity, only now with an adult mind and body and the relationships and resources to execute on his ideas.

“Vitalik has said he's a builder and a thinker first and foremost,” Temple said. “An interesting tension for him during filming was how people looked to him to be something more, to be this leader and representative of the entire crypto movement. Throughout the film, he wrestles with how much to use his voice, how much to become a leader and how much to speak out against things he doesn't always agree with. He eventually does decide to speak out against speculation and say that he doesn't think Ethereum was designed to trade million-dollar monkeys and that there's a lot more we can do to fix systems and help people.”

It's a humanizing element of a pedestaled tech founder, epitomizing how at times we all struggle with speaking up on our values — especially when those values are different or run counter to the dynamics of our own social circles and society at large.

And that's the power of Vitalik. The film is not just about crypto; it's about the human stories that can resonate beyond the immediate environment the film is in — crypto just happens to be the backdrop.

Quite a bold story to tell by a couple of “non-native” crypto filmmakers.

“We've actually used crypto for a lot of elements in the distribution process for this film, which is exciting because the documentary space is broken,” Ingrasci said. “For an independent documentary to happen, it's just so difficult these days. A lot of streamers have a lot of control over the film you ultimately make, but because we were able to crypto-crowdfund in the beginning on Mirror, we were able to have creative control over the film.”

Ingrasci and Temple executed a movie trailer drop through Zora and an early onchain release of the film this past September on Bonfire, both powered by Web3, which helped raise the funds the duo is currently using to market the documentary to mainstream audiences.

“A lot of independent filmmakers have zero marketing budget; there's very little money in documentaries. But instead [because of our crypto-crowdfunding], we're able to really make sure the trailer, the message and the film gets out there.”

In this way, Ingrasci and Temple have created a sub-narrative around the making of a film using crypto-native tools, providing a real-world use case for other filmmakers on how they, too, might find success by utilizing blockchain platforms for the creation of their own film projects.

“I think there's so much potential for these tools to have a big impact on filmmakers, though we're still at the beginning,” said Ingrasci. “It's still difficult to understand, and the complexities are not abstracted away enough. The short initial onchain release of the film — while a testament — was very difficult for people who were not in crypto to access it.”

But ultimately, the decentralized theatrical release of the film occurred in 24 countries and 30 cities all around the world, all on the same night.

“At the premiere in New York where we were, somebody came up to me and was, like, ‘I feel like I can share this with someone, and they'll finally understand what I do for a living and why I do it,'” Temple said. “Those kinds of reactions — the ‘I feel seen' and ‘I feel understood as a technologist' — as a filmmaker, hearing those reactions from people who are trying to build new systems is the dream.”



For Ingrasci and Temple, the dream continues to evolve, with their film now available all around the world on mainstream platforms such as Apple and Prime Video.

“If the goal is to be able to make a film you can send to your mom — while she might not understand what Ethereum is, she'll understand why you're interested in this thing — so I think we did that,” Ingrasci said.

“Vitalik believes technology can be used to make our lives better, especially today when there's a lot of polarization and cynicism surrounding blockchain tech and questions around if it's worth it. If we use these technologies in good ways and invest the energy into finding real use cases for them, it can make our lives better, and Vitalik showed us these are questions worth asking.”

Silent Push reveals a complex scheme where North Korean hackers posed as crypto companies, using AI and fake job interviews to distribute malware. Protect yourself from these deceptive tactics. 

Cybersecurity firm Silent Push has uncovered a clever operation run by a North Korean hacker group, known as Contagious Interview, which has a link to the notorious Lazarus Group. 

Reportedly, Contagious Interview has been tricking people looking for jobs in the crypto world through three different fake cryptocurrency companies: BlockNovas LLC, Angeloper Agency, and SoftGlide LLC. Their goal? To lure job aspirants into downloading harmful software onto their computers.

According to Silent Push's investigation, shared exclusively with Hackread.com, these fake companies use job postings on various websites, including well-known platforms like CryptoJobsList, CryptoTask, and Upwork, to attract applicants. 

Once someone applies, the hackers send them what looks like legitimate interview-related files. However, these files contain malware. Researchers have observed several types of malware being used in this campaign, including BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie.

To make the scam seem real, Contagious Interview uses images created by artificial intelligence (AI) tools for employee profiles. Specifically, they used Remaker AI to generate some of these fake faces. Also, they use real online platforms like GitHub and job websites to appear more trustworthy.

Silent Push's investigation revealed that Contagious Interview has a history of carrying out complex cyberattacks. In this new scheme, they use fake job offers and these three front companies to spread their malware. Once a victim's computer is infected, the hackers can potentially access it remotely and steal sensitive data. They even try to hide their online activity using tools like VPNs.

The analysts successfully tracked the malware back to specific websites and internet addresses used by the hackers, including lianxinxiaocom, and even found a hidden online “dashboard” on a BlockNovas subdomain (mailblocknovascom) where the hackers were monitoring their fake websites and other tools. This “significant OPSEC failure” helped them identify the different fake companies and the malware being used.

Further investigation revealed many red flags. For example, the profile picture of a Backend Developer named Mehmet Demir linked to all three fake companies is AI-generated. This person is linked to three fake companies and has a history of suspicious online activity under the alias Bigrocks918. Another user, thegoodearth918, shared the same numerical suffix ‘918,' used the same email and was linked to SoftGlide.

One user, “hades255,” identified as CTO of BlockNovas Gabriel Lima has an AI-generated photo and suspicious resume.  Other employee profiles also show signs of being fake, with AI-generated photos and other inconsistencies in their digital footprints. Even the recruiter for BlockNovas, Alexander Nolan, is using the image of a real person who has no connection to the company.

Analysis of files from the fake job application websites revealed hidden links leading to more malicious software, including FrostyFerret, and an unusual control panel named Kryptoneer, likely targeting the relatively newer crypto technology, Sui blockchain.

Silent Push researchers warn job seekers to be wary of unusual interview processes, requests to run unfamiliar code, and employee profiles that seem too good to be true or use generic-looking photos. These North Korean hackers are using increasingly sophisticated methods to trick unsuspecting individuals, and awareness is the best defence, researchers concluded.

The Fed has urged banks to be vigilant around crypto-related risks

US banking regulators announced on Thursday they were pulling back several documents that urge banks to show caution when dabbling in cryptocurrency and related activities.

The Federal Reserve said it was withdrawing a pair of supervisory letters stipulating that banks should seek advance approval from regulators before engaging in crypto-asset and stablecoin activities.

In addition, the Fed joined the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in withdrawing a pair of 2023 statements urging banks to be vigilant around crypto-related risks.

Under the prior guidance, regulators warned banks to be wary of volatility, legal uncertainty and liquidity risks when considering whether to provide crypto-related services or take on crypto companies as clients.

Scrapping that guidance marks the latest move by the Trump administration to strike a more crypto-friendly stance. In its statement announcing the changes, the Fed said regulators would be looking into whether new guidance to ""support innovation, including crypto-asset activities, is appropriate.""

In March, the OCC was the first US regulator to move to make it easier for banks to engage in crypto activities, similarly moving to scrap guidance adopted under the previous administration urging banks to be cautious in the space.

Bitcoin's (BTC) recent uptrend has likely set the stage for a six-figure price mark, catalyzing increased trading activity in the memecoin sector, where DOGE and SHIB are seeing bullish activity.

BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, briefly topped $95,000 soon before press time, the highest since March 2, CoinDesk data show. The move comes three days after prices crossed above the Ichimoku cloud momentum indicator, signaling a bullish shift in the market trend.

Supporting the constructive outlook are the consecutive daily candles with long tails (marked by box), suggestive of buy the dip mentality, and the upward-sloping five- and 10-day simple moving averages (SMA). Additionally, the daily chart MACD histogram prints higher bars above the zero line to suggest strengthening upward momentum.

In other words, the path of least resistance is likely on the higher side, hinting at a continued move higher to $100,000, which is also the most popular call option strike on Deribit. The bullish outlook risks negation below $88,800, the former resistance-turned-support.

Amid this bullish backdrop for bitcoin, the CoinDesk AI market insight bot has identified a breakout in SHIB, the world's second-largest meme coin, suggesting increased risk-taking in the broader crypto market.

""Bitcoin's rise above $92K has triggered increased memecoin trading, with SHIB breaking out of a year-to-date falling channel and showing bullish technical indicators, "" the bot said. ""SHIB has demonstrated exceptional volatility with a 15.6% price fluctuation, establishing strong support at 0.00001225 after bottoming on April 21.""

The chart shows that SHIB has topped the trendline, characterizing the year-to-date downtrend and is looking to establish a foothold above the Ichimoku cloud, following BTC's lead. That would confirm the trend reversal higher.

Meanwhile, DOGE, the world's leading cryptocurrency by market value, could soon follow suit, with the AI bot pointing to investor accumulation at around 18 cents.

""Recent price action shows consolidation above 0.180 with decreasing volatility, suggesting accumulation before [bullish] continuation,"" the bot said.

DOGE has risen over 35% since probing lows under 13 cents on April 7.

Nasdaq, the operator of one of the premier U.S. stock exchanges and a crypto index, is advising the U.S. regulators to carefully focus on defining digital assets in four buckets that will clearly determine which agency acts as referee, according to a 23-page letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto task force.



""While a stock by any other word would still be a stock, the existing market ecosystem can readily absorb digital assets by establishing the proper taxonomy and calibrating certain rules to reflect what is truly new and novel about digital assets,"" the letter argued in response to the invitation issued by the task force's chief, Commissioner Hester Peirce, to weigh in on future regulations.



The four future categories of digital assets, in Nasdaq's view, should be:





The securities categories belong in the hands of the SEC, which will be working with its cousin agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, that will handle the commodities. Those agencies — presumably directed at some point by a new crypto law hatched by Congress — will figure out the precise border between their jurisdictions.

The letter, signed by John Zecca, the company's chief regulator executive, argued that ""digital assets that constitute financial securities must trade as they do today.""

Nasdaq also suggested that the two agencies should formulate a kind of crossover trading designation for platforms that can handle digital asset investment contracts, commodities and other types of assets under one roof.



In the letter, Nasdaq underlined its digital-asset credibility, saying its ""trading and clearing services, market and trading surveillance, and central securities depository technology support digital assets platforms on six continents."" It contended that the regulators should consider imposing safety measures or further constraints on firms that want to handle investors' activity from top to bottom, which is the common approach of existing crypto firms.

The price of bitcoin (BTC) price has recovered to $94,000 since hitting lows under $75,000 early this month. The surge is characterized by crypto whales, large investors with substantial capital, snapping up coins from the market, in activity seen as confirming the rally.

The renewed demand from whales is evident in Glassnode's proprietary Accumulation Trend Score, which reflects the relative size of entities actively soaking up new coins on-chain. A score of 1 indicates that, on aggregate, the entities are accumulating, while a value close to zero suggests otherwise.

As of Thursday, wallets holding over 10,000 BTC had an accumulation score of 0.90, and those with 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC scored 0.7. Smaller wallets were pivoting to accumulation with a trend score 0.5.

""So far, large players have been buying into this rally,"" Glassnode noted on X.

Meanwhile, data from CryptoQuant revealed the highest BTC outflow from centralized exchanges in two years when analyzed using the 100-day moving average.

""A review of historical patterns suggests that this could imply re-accumulation of assets by investors,"" commentators at CryptoQuant said.

Outflows from centralized exchanges are taken to represent investor preference for direct custody of their coins, a sign of long-term holding strategy.

North Korean hackers posing as American tech entrepreneurs quietly registered companies in New York and New Mexico as part of a campaign to compromise developers in the crypto industry, security firm Silent Push said Thursday.

Two businesses, Blocknovas and Softglide, were created using fictitious identities and addresses. The operation is tied to a subgroup within the Lazarus Group.

The North Korean-backed hacking unit has stolen billions worth of crypto in the past years using sophisticated techniques and strategies that target unsuspecting individuals or companies.

“This is a rare example of North Korean hackers actually managing to set up legal corporate entities in the US in order to create corporate fronts used to attack unsuspecting job applicants,” said Kasey Best, director of threat intelligence at Silent Push.

The hackers' playbook is as manipulative as it is effective: use fake LinkedIn-style profiles and job postings to lure crypto developers into interviews. Then, during the recruitment process, they are tricked into downloading malware disguised as job application tools.

Silent Push identified multiple victims of the operation, especially those contacted through Blocknovas, which researchers say was the most active of the three front companies. The firm's listed address in South Carolina appears to be an empty lot, while Softglide was registered through a tax office in Buffalo, New York.

The firm added that the malware used in the campaign includes at least three virus strains previously tied to North Korean cyber units. These programs can steal data, provide remote access to infected systems, and serve as entry points for additional spyware or ransomware.

The FBI has seized the Blocknovas domain, per Reuters. A notice posted to the site states it was taken down “as part of a law enforcement action against North Korean cyber actors who utilised this domain to deceive individuals with fake job postings and distribute malware.”

 Blockchain job growth could exceed 1 million roles by 2030 amid regulatory clarity, scalability and AI integration, according to Bitget Research insights. 

The emerging blockchain industry lags behind the artificial intelligence sector in terms of job creation, but this hiring gap may narrow by 2030.

Blockchain remains one of the smallest sectors in the tech industry, with about 300,000 global jobs, compared to 1.5 million in AI and machine learning and 25 million in software development, according to a new Bitget Research report shared with Cointelegraph.

The blockchain sector added around 20,000 new jobs in 2024, according to job listings aggregated from platforms like LinkedIn, Web3 Jobs and Crypto Job List.

While blockchain-based jobs had an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45%, outpacing most traditional tech sectors, it trails the AI industry's 57% CAGR, according to the report.

The AI industry's maturity and larger share of venture capital investment are the main reasons behind the hiring discrepancy, Vugar Usi Zade, chief operating officer of Bitget exchange, told Cointelegraph:

“Venture investors put more than $100 billion into AI startups in 2024, with AI-centric titles topping a million vacancies worldwide,” Usi Zade said. “Blockchain companies, meanwhile, advertise barely 20,000 openings and drew only about $5.4 billion in new funding during the same period.”

AI-related job listings have risen between 75% and 100% year-over-year, while blockchain job growth remains around the 45% to 60% growth range.

Blockchain could exceed 1 million jobs by 2030 if it manages to scale at the same rate as AI-based roles, the report said.

More regulatory clarity from laws such as Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) may encourage blockchain firms to increase their hiring efforts, Zade said:

“Second comes enterprise-grade performance: Ethereum's Dencun upgrade cut typical layer-2 fees by more than 95%, signaling that blockchains can now handle corporate traffic at an acceptable cost,” he added.

While blockchain-based jobs are poised for growth, “AI will naturally garner more talent in the next decade,” Jawad Ashraf, CEO of Vanar Chain, told Cointelegraph.

“This is because AI's market integration has been faster than any other modern technology we can remember,” he said. “If you look at blockchain, we're still very much focused on integrating with TradFi and broader Web3 markets like gaming, real-world tokenization, etc.”

He added: “Blockchain still hasn't penetrated the more conventional consumer-oriented markets. It will, in the near future, but we are not there yet.”

“AI and blockchain aren't competing for talent; they're working together to create new opportunities,” Yakov Lebedev, chief business development officer at 3Commas, a trading automation solution, told Cointelegraph.

Combining the two technologies enables “sophisticated financial tools accessible for everyone, not just big institutions, he said, adding:

Lebedev added that the integration of blockchain with AI is driving steady job growth in both fields, as financial and tech firms move integrated solutions from pilot programs into core operations.

Thanks to the synergistic benefits of the two technologies, blockchain job growth may start mirroring the AI industry, according to Adi Ben-Ari, founder and CEO at Applied Blockchain, an AI-powered blockchain development firm.

AI technology is “probabilistic and introduces uncertainty,” which creates more demand for blockchain and cryptographic technologies, he told Cointelegraph.

“AI produces outcomes that are not always accurate, can be fake, and can sometimes be incorrect,” he said. “This new uncertainty needs to be countered by a technology that brings absolute certainty, and this is where blockchain and cryptography come in.”

Ben-Ari added that blockchain's ability to secure sensitive information through cryptography would become increasingly important as AI consumes larger amounts of personal data.  

AI agents are already using cryptocurrency for autonomous transactions. On Dec. 16, 2024, Luna, an AI agent on Virtuals Protocol, paid another AI agent from STIX Protocol, in exchange for its image generation services — sending $1.77 worth of Virtual (VIRTUAL) tokens, onchain data shows.

 Bitcoin adoption may accelerate after the US Federal Reserve eased restrictions on banks engaging in crypto activities, opening the door for institutional participation. 

Bitcoin adoption among United States financial institutions could see a major boost after the US Federal Reserve withdrew its guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency.

On April 24, the Fed withdrew its 2022 supervisory letter that served as guidance to deter banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities. The withdrawal spurred a notable uplift in Bitcoin (BTC) investor sentiment.

The 2022 guidance initially warned that crypto may pose risks to investors and the stability of the US financial system.

The Fed's move means that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin,” said Michael Saylor, co-founder of the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holding firm, Strategy, in an April 25 X post.

The Fed's decision “is a significant development, as it will simplify the path to institutional adoption,” according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum.

“The withdrawal of this particular guidance ensures that crypto assets will be overseen through standard supervisory processes,” she told Cointelegraph, adding:

The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, passed the US House Financial Services Committee with a 32–17 vote on April 2. The bill aims to create clear regulatory guidelines for dollar-denominated stablecoins.

The GENIUS Act, short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18–6 on March 13.

The Federal Reserve's decision may be a “meaningful turning point” for Bitcoin's institutional adoption in the US, according to Eneko Knörr, co-founder and CEO of Stabolut, a yield-bearing stablecoin project.

“Up until now, US regulatory hostility made it virtually impossible for traditional financial institutions to participate in this space,” Knörr told Cointelegraph.

“With the recent shift in the Fed's guidance, the door is finally open. This unlocks an enormous opportunity for banks — one that until now has been dominated by players like Coinbase and other crypto-native firms,” Knörr added. 

Knörr added that banks are now likely to move quickly to meet client demand and retain market share previously captured by crypto-native firms like Coinbase.

Bitcoin adoption among financial institutions is also lagging in Europe, with less than 20% of European banks offering crypto services, despite the rising investor demand and regulatory clarity in the region.

 Bitcoin's growing decoupling from US equities is fueling its appeal as a safe-haven asset alongside gold, BlackRock's Jay Jacobs told CNBC. 

Central banks, particularly China, may start to shift away from US Treasurys, exploring alternatives such as gold and Bitcoin, according to Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of thematics and active ETFs.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Jacobs said that geopolitical tensions and rising global uncertainty are accelerating diversification strategies among central banks.

He pointed to a long-term trend where countries have been reducing their reliance on dollar-based reserves in favor of assets like gold and, increasingly, Bitcoin (BTC).

“This whole diversification away from traditional assets and into things like gold and also crypto [...] probably began three, four years ago,” Jacobs explained.

He said that recent geopolitical fragmentation has intensified the push toward alternative stores of value.

Jacobs referenced growing concerns about the freezing of $300 billion in Russian central bank assets following its invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that such events have prompted countries like China to rethink their reserve strategies.

During the interview, Jacobs said BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has identified geopolitical fragmentation as a defining force for global markets over the coming decades:

He noted that this environment is fueling demand for uncorrelated assets, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed alongside gold as a safe-haven asset.

“We've seen significant inflows into gold ETFs. We've seen significant inflows into Bitcoin. And this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently,” Jacobs said.

Notably, Jacobs is not alone in stressing Bitcoin's declining correlation with US equities. Several analysts have also observed that Bitcoin is beginning to decouple from the US stock market.

On April 22, Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of the Nansen crypto intelligence platform, said Bitcoin's price is showcasing its growing maturity as a global asset, becoming “less Nasdaq — more gold.”

He added that Bitcoin was “surprisingly resilient” amid the trade war compared to altcoins and indexes like the S&P 500, but remains vulnerable to economic recession concerns.

Echoing this sentiment, QCP Capital said in an April 21 Telegram note that Bitcoin seemed to be sharing some of gold's limelight as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

“With equities finishing last week in the red and extending an April drawdown, the narrative of BTC as a safe haven or inflation hedge is once again gaining traction. Should this dynamic hold, it could provide a fresh tailwind for institutional BTC allocation,” it wrote.

 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has returned to flash “Greed” as Bitcoin has remained steady above $90,000 over the past two days. 

Key takeaways:

Crypto market sentiment hit a two-month high with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index returning to “Greed” territory on April 23. 

Despite Bitcoin's price hold, the sentiment score is gradually declining, and analysts are expressing doubt over the rally's sustainability.

The crypto market remains Bitcoin-heavy, with its dominance above 64%, strong ETF inflows and a low altcoin season score.

Bitcoin's several-day surge above $90,000 pushed crypto market sentiment to its highest point in more than two months on April 23, but it's gradually tapering off again as analysts air concerns about the sustainability of Bitcoin's rally.

On April 23, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index clocked a score of 72 out of 100, putting it in the “Greed” zone as Bitcoin (BTC) returned above the $90,000 level. However, as of April 25, the score has fallen to 60 despite the relatively stable price. 

The last time the index hit this score was on Feb. 4,  around the same time US President Donald Trump introduced tariffs and Bitcoin fell below $100,000. Bitcoin has since reclaimed the $90,000 price level for the first time since March 6. 

However, despite Bitcoin trading between $91,800 and $94,304 over the past two days, sentiment within the “Greed” territory has been gradually cooling off, with the index falling to April 24 and 60 on April 25.

The slight pullback follows warnings from several crypto analysts who remain cautious about the Bitcoin rally, including 10x Research's head of research, Markus Thielen, who isn't yet convinced of a rally.

“Given that our stablecoin minting indicator has yet to return to high-activity levels, we remain cautious about the sustainability of the current Bitcoin rally,” Thielen said on April 23.

Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts said on April 24 that while Bitcoin's relative strength against US equities “appears real,” it is yet to be confirmed as structural.

However, others are more bullish. MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said on April 24 that “buyers are likely going to step in, and then we'll be continuing our path toward a new [all-time high].”

CoinMarketCap's altcoin season index indicates that the market is still heavily favoring Bitcoin over altcoins, with the altcoin season score sitting at a lowly 17 out of 100. It comes as Bitcoin Dominance is sitting at 64.39%, according to TradingView data.

Bitcoin sentiment has gained momentum since it touched the mid-$80,000 price range. On April 17, crypto analytics firm Santiment pointed out that the tone of Bitcoin-related social media posts has flipped to bullish.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Trader T pointed out in an April 25 X post that US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have, so far to April 24, seen their third-best week of inflows since launching in January 2024. Over the past four trading days, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $2.6 billion in net inflows.

Can There Be Sound in Space?

It seems contrary to common knowledge, but sound can travel through some parts of space quite well

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

Sound—in the form of shock waves—helps sculpt the beautiful, delicate structures of some supernova remnants, such as those seen here in a Hubble Space Telescope image of the Veil Nebula.

“In space no one can hear you scream.”

That now classic tagline (from Alien, one of the greatest science-fiction horror movies ever made) hinges on a big assumption that most of us broadly make: space is empty. And it is—mostly. But there is stuff out there between the stars, and in some cases there's enough of it to make a little noise over.

So maybe we should amend that line. In space no one can hear you scream—unless, that is, you scream loudly enough and in the right place.

What we think of as “sound” is really just a vibration that travels through some sort of material (what scientists call a medium). The music I'm listening to right now as I write these words is just such a vibration, created by electricity pulsing through magnets inside my computer's speakers. The magnets drive a membrane that rapidly wiggles back and forth, pushing on the surrounding air. This creates waves—usually called sound waves but more technically known as acoustic waves—of slightly compressed and decompressed air that travel to my ears. And finally, within my inner ear, another membrane vibrates in response and sends signals to my brain, which interprets them as music.

Acoustic waves travel through a medium by causing the atoms or molecules in it to successively bump into each other. For my music, that medium is air, but you can also hear sounds underwater—or through solid matter if you put your ear to it. The waves travel through these materials a bit differently than they do through air because of differences in composition and density, but the principle is the same.

If space were truly empty—an utter vacuum, devoid of any matter—then yes, the Alien slogan would be unquestionably correct. And in general it's true; by human standards, space pretty much lives up to its reputation.

Human standards are not a great basis for comparison, though. Understanding why requires some basic order-of-magnitude numerical thinking about the varying amounts of sound-sustaining stuff in space. Let's just use the word “particle” as a generic term for this material; it can refer to any sort of individual unit of matter—an atom, a molecule, a subatomic particle, whatever.

With that in mind, let's ask: How empty is empty? A laboratory vacuum chamber, for example, might contain a trillion particles per cubic centimeter, or cm3 (a volume of about one fourth of a typical six-sided die). That may seem like a lot, but it's a particle density tens of millions of times less than that of the air you're breathing, which has tens of quintillions of molecules per cm3.

Yet as relatively empty as that lab vacuum may be, space makes it look like soup. Interplanetary space is far more rarefied, with just a few dozen particles in each cubic centimeter. That thin gruel can reach up to more than a million particles per cm3 if the sun blasts out a solar storm, but even then it's less substantial than all but a handful of ultrahigh vacuums achieved on Earth.

And the space between stars—the interstellar medium—is even thinner, with as little as 100 particles per cubic meter (m3), or, on average, 0.0001 per cm3. Intergalactic space, the truly deep space between galaxies, has an average of one—one!—particle per m3. Scream all you want; no one will hear you through that.

By now you probably appreciate that not all space is evacuated equal. In nebulas and other celestial regions, matter is thicker. A typical density for a brilliantly illuminated gas cloud like the Orion Nebula is around 10,000 particles per cm3. The density in other locations can be quite a bit higher, however. Barnard 68, for example, is a small, cold, dense molecular cloud that has roughly a million particles per cm3. That's much lower than in a lab-grade vacuum, yet across vast expanses of space, even very low particle densities can add up, so Barnard 68's tenuous material is still enough to absorb essentially all the light that would otherwise just pass through. Some giant molecular clouds can have dense cores that can spike to a billion particles per cm3.

Even then, your shout wouldn't get far. There just aren't enough particles to bump into each other to transport the acoustic wave. If you want sound to move through space, you need a much louder source that operates over vast volumes.

An exploding star, for example, blasts out huge quantities of material into space at exceedingly high speed. That ejecta slams into so much of the interstellar medium so hard that sufficient numbers of particles strike each other to make an acoustic wave.

The speed of that wave depends on the density of the medium, but in a typical nebula, it's about 10 kilometers per second (km/s). That's much faster than the less than 1 km/s speed of sound in Earth's air, so it's speedy for us Earthlings. But the material from an exploding star leaves that in the dust (so to speak)—it plows into the surrounding gas at literally supersonic speeds. This generates shock waves, much like a fighter jet emitting a sonic boom. The ambient material around the exploding star is compressed by the shock waves, creating the lovely filaments and ribbons of gas commonly seen in a supernova's expanding cloud of debris.

Somewhat surprisingly, the speed of sound in a nebula isn't just a matter of arcane astrophysics—it turns out to be important to our very existence here on Earth. When a dense clump of gas and dust in a molecular cloud collapses, it flattens and shapes itself into a disk around the newly forming star. A very rough estimate of a typical density for such a disk is tens to hundreds of trillions of particles per cm3, denser than a lab vacuum but extremely diluted compared with, say, air. I'd say that qualifies as “space,” but it's still enough to sustain sound waves, which is critical. If the material is dense enough, it becomes viscous and even turbulent, allowing clumps of material to gradually grow into planets. Those conditions depend on the speed of sound within the disk, and without them, the particles there would tend to orbit the star without giving rise to planets at all.

In other words, without sound in space, we probably wouldn't be here to talk about sound in space. That may go against conventional wisdom, but I'm willing to shout loudly enough to make my voice heard about it.

Ancient DNA Reveals Phoenicians' Surprising Ancestry

Phoenician civilization spread its culture and alphabet across the Mediterranean but not, evidently, its DNA

An ancient Middle Eastern civilization that developed an early alphabet spread its culture far and wide—but not its DNA, finds a 23 April Nature study of hundreds of ancient human genomes.

Phoenician civilization emerged more than 3,000 years ago, centred around what is now Lebanon, before expanding across the Mediterranean Sea. Middle Eastern Phoenician city-states eventually fell to other groups, but the culture thrived farther west—most notably in Carthage, in what is now Tunisia, until its destruction in 146 BC.

Phoenician city-states shared languages—recorded with an alphabet that was a precursor to Greek and Latin letters—religious practices and maritime trading economies. Many researchers have presumed that their inhabitants also shared ancestries connected to the culture's Middle Eastern origins.

To study this history, population geneticist Harald Ringbauer at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and his colleagues analysed the DNA from the remains of around 200 people from Phoenician archaeological sites in the Middle East, Europe and North Africa.

To Ringbauer's surprise, people from Mediterranean outposts of Phoenician culture—also known as Punic people—shared no ancestry with ancient Middle Easterners, even those from sites linked to Phoenicians and their forebears the Canaanites.

But neither did Punic people's genomes always resemble those of people from other local populations, such as those in Sardinia and Ibiza. Instead, Punic people shared an ancestry profile resembling those of ancient inhabitants of Greece and Sicily. Over time, North African ancestry entered the mix—reflecting the rise of Carthage after 500 BC.

This unique mixture of ancestries is probably the result of a regular influx of diverse people connected by a “Mediterranean highway” maintained by trade between Phoenician outposts, says Ringbauer. The study identified related individuals found at distant archaeological sites, including a pair of possible second cousins, one from North Africa and one from Sicily.

After the fall of Phoenician city-states in the Middle East, people with ancestry from this region might have been cut off from the Mediterranean highway, says Ringbauer.

The absence of Middle Eastern ancestry in Punic people doesn't surprise Pierre Zalloua, a geneticist at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. “The Phoenicians were a culture of integration and assimilation,” he says. “They settled where they sailed.”

Ringbauer would like to know why diverse Mediterranean people adopted Phoenician culture, instead of sticking to their existing practices. “How can there be such a disconnect?” he wonders. “Does this mean Phoenician culture was like a franchise that others could adopt? That's one for the archaeologists.”

It Is in Our Nature to Need Stories



By Jag Bhalla 

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

This article was published in Scientific American's former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American

It is in our nature to need stories. They are our earliest sciences, a kind of people-physics. Their logic is how we naturally think. They configure our biology, and how we feel, in ways long essential for our survival.

Like our language instinct, a story drive—an inborn hunger for story hearing and story making—emerges untutored universally in healthy children. Every culture bathes their children in stories to explain how the world works and to engage and educate their emotions. Perhaps story patterns could be considered another higher layer of language. A sort of meta-grammar shaped by and shaping conventions of character types, plots, and social-rule dilemmas prevalent in our culture.

“Stories the world over are almost always about people with problems,” writes Jonathan Gottschall. They display “a deep pattern of heroes confronting trouble and struggling to overcome.” So a possible formula for a story = character(s) + predicament(s) + attempted extrication(s). This pattern transmits social rules and norms, describing what counts as violations and approved reactions. Stories offer “feelings we don't have to pay [full cost] for.” They are simulated experiments in people-physics, freeing us from the limits of our own direct experience.

The ""human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor,"" says Jonathan Haidt. Certainly we use logic inside stories better than we do outside. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby have shown that the Wason Selection Test can be solved by fewer than 10% as a logic puzzle, but by 70-90% when presented as a story involving detection of social-rule cheating. Such social-rule monitoring was evolutionarily crucial because as Alison Gopnik notes “other people are the most important part of our environment.” In our ultra-social species, social acceptance matters as much as food. Indeed violating social rules can exclude you from group benefits, including shared food.

Darwin understood how our biology is fitted to the stories in our social environments, noting, “Many a Hindoo...has been stirred to the bottom of his soul by having partaken of unclean food.” The same thing eaten unknowingly would cause no reaction, so the story of the food, not the food itself, causes the “the soul shaking feeling of remorse.” Stories configure contextual triggers and the expected emotional reactions of our culture—perhaps defining a sort of emotional grammar.

Any story we tell of our species, any science of human nature, that leaves out much of what and how we feel is false. Nature shaped us to be ultra-social, and hence to be sharply attentive to character and plot. We are adapted to physiologically interact with stories. They are a key way in which our ruly culture configures our nature.

Found in a mudflat off the coast of Oregon, this organism's electricity-conducting abilities could make it ideal for bioelectric devices.

Today, human society is powered by the artificial electricity generated by turbines, nuclear reactors, and photovoltaics. But the very first investigations into the wonders of electricity were biological in origin. Thales of Miletus (considered to be the first scientist in the Western world) pondered on the cause of static electricity, and the electric prowess of eels inspired Alessandro Volta to invent the first battery. You and I are alive today because of the bioelectric field that permeates our cells. 

Although we've evolved from Volta's first fish-inspired battery, the world of bioelectricty still has a lot to offer us. That couldn't be more apparent than in a new study, published this week in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, which details the discovery of a new cable bacteria—built from rod-shaped cells attached end to end—on the central Oregon coast. Named Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis in honor of the Yaqo'n people on whose ancestral lands the discovery was made, this bacteria is particularly adept at conducting electricity.

Because of their rod-shaped bodies, these cells create filaments that can stretch up to several centimeters in length. A rare feature among bacteria, Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis's conductivity likely arises from it's optimization of metabolic processes in their environment. 

“This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,” Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University and co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.”

In other words, it's a bioelectric bacteria on steroids. This could make the bacteria particularly effective in a variety of fields, including medicine, industry, and environmental monitoring. However, its most exciting capability is its use as a tool for pollutant remediation. 

“These bacteria can transfer electrons to clean up pollutants, so they could be used to remove harmful substances from sediments,” Li said. “Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics.”

Remediation can be one of the most time-consuming and costly aspects of infrastructure projects—particularly if a former brownfield site hopes to be reclaimed as a park or another public space. Having bacteria that can actively clean up the soil thanks to its electric biology could be a huge boon for environmental efforts. 

Our understanding of electricity has come along way since Ancient Greece, but the biological world still has more than few electrifying tricks to teach us.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Lucid Dreaming Isn't Sleep or Wakefulness—It's a New State of Consciousness, Scientists Find","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a64563688/lucid-dreaming-consciousness/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

And it gets even trippier.

Have you ever had a dream in which you realized you were dreaming? 

When you become conscious of the fact that you are dreaming, you can take advantage of that knowledge and manipulate the dream. If you want to do something that is physically impossible in the real world, such as flying, you can leap into the air and  take flight. Someone who realizes they are trapped in a nightmare can convince themselves to wake up.

The state known as lucid dreaming is an unquestionably surreal one, and it just got even more so. A team of researchers—led by Çağatay Demirel from the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands—has discovered that lucid dreaming has now been found to be a state of consciousness separate from both wakefulness and REM sleep (the state usually associated with dreams), and is in fact associated with its own unique type of brain activity. They published a study on their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience.

“This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself,” Demirel said in a press release.

To identify what sets lucid dreaming apart from the rest of sleep, he and his team pulled previous studies—in which brain activity was measured with EEG sensors—together into what is now the most extensive dataset in this field of sleep research. The researchers then compared brain activity patterns for wakefulness, REM sleep, and lucid dreaming to find that that the eerie self-awareness experienced in lucid dreams has a connection to the electrical rhythms in neurons known as brain waves. 

Perception and memory processing in the lucid dreaming state were found to be different from non-lucid REM sleep. The consciousness of existing in a dream was associated with with beta waves in the right central lobe (which controls spatial awareness and nonverbal memory) and parietal lobe (which controls the sense of touch and spatial awareness). Beta waves are a type of high-frequency electromagnetic activity in the brain involved in conscious thought processes like solving problems or making decisions. Our consciousness is dominated by beta waves when we are awake.

This might explain why there is so much cognitive control in lucid dreams. Dreamers deep in REM sleep have no sense of control over factors like thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but those in lucid dreaming states do.

Demirel also linked gamma waves with lucid dreaming. These are the fastest brain waves, which become visible on an EEG at times when the brain is especially alert and focusing on something. When lucid dreaming begins, gamma waves increase in the right precuneus, which is involved in self-referential thinking—thoughts about ourselves and our lives. When we are awake, we often drift into this type of thinking when our minds wander. 

Maybe the most mind-bending thing about lucid dreams is that they are, according to the study, similar in the brain to the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. These types of psychedelic experiences are also associated with the precuneus, whose activity is modified when waking imagery is seen despite having closed eyes (something usually only experienced with psychedelics). Interestingly, however, lucid dreams may even go a few experiential steps past psychedelics. “While psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and decreased self-referential processing […] lucid dreams may actually harness elements of self-awareness and control,” Demirel and his team said in the study.

So if you're capable of lucid dreaming, you're in for an awesome trip.

Metrics details

A rift has occurred within the scientific community between two formerly close-knit fields: condensed matter physics and electronic device engineering. What started as a union to understand the fundamental optical and electrical properties of semiconductors has been split by divergent interests. While the partnership has produced revolutionary changes in the way that information is processed and consumed by an increasingly interconnected society, now the two disciplines rarely speak to one another. As the years have passed, condensed matter physics has become enamored with delicate electronic effects in increasingly complex materials and geometries to the detriment of realistic applications. Meanwhile, device engineering has remained steadfastly focused on room-temperature performance and overall efficiency, prizing incremental improvement over potential disruptive advances using alternative materials and physics. Recent advances in topological electronic systems—in particular those exploiting Chern insulators—while elegant, prompt a necessary reexamination of the device engineering needs and the associated metrics with the goal of establishing a commonality within the blooming field of topological electronics. The purpose of this Comment is to initiate such a reexamination in the hopes that, with a better understanding of future device needs, perhaps the two areas may reunite to usher in the next electronic revolution via the use of topological phenomena.

An uncontroversial observation concerning the trajectory of topological condensed matter research, is that the bifurcation into fundamental and applied categories has been accelerating1,2. The previous acknowledgment of applications in publications has been a slight reference to a specific use case at the end of the abstract and a second time in the concluding statements. This has been replaced by detailed and precise demonstrations of topological phenomena, with the specific intention of investigating the potential role of topological matter in future device technologies. Perhaps one of the most recent and elegant demonstrations of such applied topological research comes in the form of Chern networks3,4,5,6. Generally speaking, a Chern network, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, refers to the electrical and/or magnetic control of dissipation-free 1D chiral edge state propagation between non-local electrical contacts within a heterogeneous device design. To be clear, the definition of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a state in which the longitudinal resistivity disappears, ρxx = 0, while at the same time the Hall resistivity becomes exactly quantized as ρxy = h/e2 in the absence of a net magnetic flux penetrating the device structure7,8. By controlling the sign of the applied perpendicular magnetic field, or ultimately an applied electric field as illustrated in Fig. 1(A), the chirality of the edge state may be controlled. The roots of 1D chiral edge transport in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry may be traced directly back to the foundational work by Haldane9. Nevertheless, the functional physical principle behind Chern networks is the successful exploitation of the bulk–boundary correspondence between fabricated device regions that possess any discrepancy between regional (first) Chern numbers. Therefore, the idea of being able to use applied electromagnetic fields to alter the direction and destination of dissipationless edge current flow provokes images of a clear topological means to guide the transmission of information within interconnected and arbitrarily complex device geometries, as shown in Fig. 1B. In a short amount of time, the evolutionary arc that connects the early efforts in the fabrication of a Chern network using antiferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 layers grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) immersed within a strong, but non-quantizing, magnetic field3 to the most recent use of magnetically-doped topological insulators created via an in-situ MBE mask that function without the need for continuous application of an external magnetic field6, it is clear that continued refinement of Chern networks will produce quantized topological transmission of current between non-locally connected contacts. While the continued improvement of Chern networks may be a forgone conclusion, the more pertinent questions, asked from a more applied perspective, are two-fold: (1) what device need is being addressed? (2) how does the successful implementation of the Chern network compare with other proposed device engineering solutions? Questions about the form of future electronic device technologies have been a topic of heavy debate for many years. To be more specific, the most quoted proposed solution that Chern networks are cited to address is the issue of power consumption. Currently, traditional electronic information processing is accomplished using highly interconnected complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device technologies. It is well-known that within CMOS, most of the power input to a chip is consumed when the state of the device is being altered either from the “off"" state to “on"" state or vice versa. Given the sheer number of power dissipating transistors that comprise current microelectronic chip designs—134 billion in the Apple M2 Ultra10—it is unsurprising that even the most energy efficient device solutions will dissipate a significant amount of energy in the course of normal operation. To this end, the semiconductor industry, and device engineers more broadly, are keenly aware of the power dissipation issue and have actively sought alternative “Beyond CMOS"" device technologies using new physical principles and materials. If, indeed, the Chern network or another forthcoming solution proposes a device for practical consideration then there exist well-established device metrics that may be found in the International Roadmap of Devices and Systems (IDRS) against which these proposed devices must be benchmarked11,12,13. In this Comment, I point to some of the issues related to size, temperature, and performance that may hinder Chern networks as a viable technological solution by device engineers, and I ask questions that require the attention of both physics and engineering researchers. In doing so, my goal is to take one step towards normalizing and applying the relevant figures of merit, where appropriate, to prod the nascent dialog between condensed matter physics and device engineering towards joint solutions that address real-life performance needs.

A Illustration of an electrostatically tunable Chern insulator, otherwise known as the quantum anomalous Hall insulator, shown as evolving from a Chern number of C = −2 to C = + 2 as tuned by an external gate voltage, VGATE. As the value of the Chern number changes, the number and chirality of the edge states propagating about the periphery of the system, as shown by the associated directional arrows. B An illustration of a Chern network where multiple externally tunable Chern insulators, each containing regions of distinct Chern number, are brought into close proximity to one another. The interactions change the overall direction of the flow of information in an externally controllable manner allowing for potentially complex designs. Current is input into the system and, given the pattern of Chern numbers in the network, the propagating current is directed into different remotely located voltage probes before exiting the network.

In the quest to find stronger overlap between device engineering and condensed matter physics through applied topological electronics, it is legitimate to ask to what extent the work done in applied topology originating in condensed matter addresses an identified need within device engineering. In an attempt to resolve the question with regards to the Chern network, consider first the basic building block of the Chern network—the QAH insulator—from an engineering perspective. From the perspective of condensed matter physics, one of the features of the QAH insulator is the fact that the conduction is performed completely at the interface between two regions of differing Chern numbers. From the device engineering perspective, one of the largest faults of the QAH insulator is that the conduction is performed only along a thin section of the system. To have such a wide area of the 2D bulk between the counter-propagating edge states of potential chip space left unused is unacceptable in high-performance circuit design. On the other hand, it is impossible to have only one single chiral edge state without the associated 2D bulk to support the 1D holographic edge state. Therefore, the edge state topology is only protected while there is sufficient separation between the counter-propagating edge states so as to forbid the scattering of quasiparticles from one chiral edge into the anti-chiral partner localized on an opposing edge within the device structure. The application related question of minimum device size becomes a vital one that condensed matter has started to address. To this point, in recent work, the confinement of the QAH insulator edge state has been examined in MBE grown topological insulator (TI) devices comprised of 3 quintuple layers (QLs) of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 with 4 intervening QLs of undoped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. Quantum transport measurements on these layers have been systematically conducted as a function of applied magnetic fields and gate voltages over a wide range of QAH insulator widths from w = 300 nm to w = 10 μm with a minimum width of wmin = 72 nm14. The results illustrate how the penetration of the edge state into the bulk, perhaps aided by the presence of bulk disorder, limits the width to be w ≈ 72 nm given a decay length of the edge state into the bulk of Ledge ≈ 36 nm. For comparative purposes, using the IRDS 2022 edition, the width of center-to-center distance for the first metal interconnect line, or pitch, in production year 2022 CMOS-based logic devices was already at 24 nm. Additionally, the CMOS logic technology is based on FinFET architecture, in which a nanoribbon of semiconductor is contacted on three sides to form conducting channels, that may then be stacked to form the eventual multi-billion transistor application. Put in this perspective, Chern networks would need to be scaled in size to well below currently accessible dimensions to be competitive either as logic or interconnect implementations. Furthermore, in the context of multi-billion device applications, the presence of a comparably large resistance of Rchern = 25.8 kΩ per Chern device is noteworthy. The fundamental resistance implies that significant, compared to CMOS, energy will be dissipated in Chern networks not just during switching events, but during steady-state operation. Such limitations portend questions about the overall power efficiency of large multi-device Chern networks as they are scaled by number and not only size.

From an engineering perspective, temperature is a vital quantity. Naturally, if the intended application is to be within the context of, for example, superconducting electronics15, then the energy scales of the system are expected to be small and, therefore, a path to functionality at room temperature, here defined to be TRT = 300 K, need not exist. However, if conventional computing, memory or spintronic applications are the goal, then there must necessarily be a path—regardless of the circuitry—that ends with room-temperature operation. To date, there are two separate paths that have been explored as a means to implement the QAH effect within topological materials. The first and most successful approach is to use magnetic dopants to fabricate compounds such as Cr-doped (BiSb)2Te3 or V-doped (BiSb)2Te36,16,17. Indeed, such material systems have demonstrated the QAH effect, albeit with two caveats. First, the observation of the QAH effect is at very low temperatures, typically below T ≤ 200 mK despite observed Curie temperatures that are on the order of TC ≈ 20K17. The second caveat is that the longitudinal resistance ρxx ≈ 0 only at the lowest system temperatures and in the presence of the smallest excitation currents. The difficulty in obtaining quantized transport in magnetically doped topological materials indicates that the magnetic exchange gap, ΔEX, that is opened by the ferromagnetic orientation of the dopant ions is very small compared to the system thermal energy18,19. Furthermore, the non-quantized transport at the edge of the system dictates that the system is not topological and indicates the existence of an alternative conduction path via the bulk16,17.

Nevertheless, opportunities exist to make progress towards greater thermal stability in Chern networks. Rather than appealing to an overall ferromagnetic state mediated by magnetic dopants, an alternative that may lead to higher resilience to thermal effects may be proximity-induced magnetism. From a naive perspective, the existence of a multitude of magnetic materials boasting Curie temperatures that are greater than TRT and topological materials that host topological phases at temperatures greater than TRT accommodates the possibility of engineering a high-temperature QAH insulator phase20,21. To this end, there have been a number of significant studies that have paired magnetic materials with high Curie temperatures and topological materials21,22,23,24. At this time, however, while there are clear signatures of induced magnetism in the target topological material, there is no clear evidence of a Chern insulator produced via proximity coupling of disparate magnetic and topological materials. Yet one of the most compelling implications resulting from the experimental and subsequent theoretical work25 is that the presence of an overall long-range magnetic phase—either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic—may be irrelevant to the ability to instill high-temperature proximity-coupled phases within an adjacent topological material. In this context, if high-temperature operation is to be optimized, then the choice of magnetic materials should not be predicated on the energy scale associated with TC but rather based on two criteria: (1) the median physical distance between the magnetic atoms within the host magnetic material and the surface of the topological material, and (2) the magnitude of the magnetic moment associated with the magnetic atoms in the host magnetic material.

When considering applied topology from both the condensed matter and device engineering perspectives, there is no larger separation between the disciplines as when considering the performance expectation gap between condensed matter perception and device engineering reality. Within condensed matter physics literature, the Chern network is a virtual panacea that is poised to cure the real engineering problems surrounding the reduced performance enhancements obtained by the inexorable shrinking of CMOS implementations of semiconductor logic devices. However, the performance degradation obtained with device scaling is well understood by the device engineering community and routinely updates the metrics by which they measure the performance of semiconductor logic and the constituent devices12. Furthermore, device engineering has recognized the need to find disruptive technologies that will enhance the performance of key components of digital information processing11. Thus, any proffered solution must be benchmarked against current CMOS on these key figures of merit (FoM). For instance, the use of topological materials, and even Chern networks, has long been proposed as a methodology to overcome the rise in the resistance of copper interconnects with continued scaling due to grain boundary and surface scattering12. Benchmarking the use of topological materials as interconnects has, indeed, shown benefits over copper with the caveat being that such topological benefits only become appreciable when the interconnect diameters are scaled below 6nm in width and ignores the question of how one would integrate these interconnects into the CMOS fabrication process to replace Cu26. In light of this, we apply basic benchmarking to the Chern network to determine where, as of now, this scientific development sits amongst other current and proposed technologies on two key FoM: subthreshold slope and drive current. Thus, to make a comparison between the Chern network performance and the 2022 generation, or 3nm-node logic device specifications, we use an analogy with the edge channel current to represent the drain current, IDS, with the backgate voltage being the same as the gate-to-source voltage, VGS.

We begin with the subthreshold slope (Ssub), which is a FoM that quantifies the amount of power that is required to change the current flow by one order of magnitude:

Subthreshold slope is one of the primary measures for overall comparison of effectiveness of current modulation via an external applied electric field. For a standard CMOS transistor, the subthreshold slope is limited by thermionic emission of carriers over the potential barrier that separates the origin of carriers within a transistor, i.e., the source, from the point where the injected carriers are extracted, i.e., the drain. The fundamental limit for CMOS transistors is Ssub = 60 mV/dec and state of the art transistors operate very close to this fundamental limit at between Ssub = 75 – 82 mV/dec in the 2022 production line12.

A simple calculation using published data indicates that the Chern network, currently, has a subthreshold slope of Ssub = 333.45 mV/dec5. While the calculated Ssub may be improved over successive iterations, the major difficulty is that these measurements are carried out at 20 mK and not at room temperature. Further, the voltages that are applied to the gate to modulate the conduction are several orders of magnitude larger than in the state-of-the-art CMOS transistor. However, the expressly low temperature operation may be advantageous in certain applications due to the inability of CMOS devices to operate at low temperatures due to dopant freeze-out—or the state where the thermal energy imparted to the dopant atoms is insufficient for them to become ionized. Therefore, Chern networks may find utilization in applications such as superconducting spintronics for alternative forms of low-temperature logic27,28.

The reality of the highly interconnected architecture of CMOS is that the successful operation of one isolated device is of questionable value. While such singular demonstrations are important as a means of determining basic proof of concept, it is crucial to ensure that a path exists for one singular device concept to be capable of producing sufficient current to drive subsequent stages of device architecture. In logic core devices produced for the 2022 3 nm technology node, the main MOS architecture is the FinFET, which consists of a thin Si nanoribbon that is surrounded on three sides by a metal gate12. Therefore, when the device is turned on by inverting the surface beneath the gate, three conductive channels are produced resulting in an on-state current of between Ion = 65 – 88 μA per device with a corresponding off-state current of Ioff = 0.1 – 10 nA/μm12. Given the topological nature of the current flow in the Chern network, it is natural to expect the Hall current to be quantized. Using the same topological argument, the longitudinal current may flow without dissipation, however, there is an associated active device resistance that is fundamentally limited to h/e2. For comparative purposes, consider the drive current density within a Chern network, \({J}_{on}^{CN}={e}^{2}{V}_{on}/h{L}_{edge}\), with Von being the drive voltage. Chern networks are currently incapable of approaching the current density in a CMOS transistor, \({J}_{on}^{CMOS}=874\,\mu A/\mu m\). However, additional iterations of Chern networks using different magnetic and/or topological materials may show increased current density by increasing the topological gap size, ΔEX in the Chern network. Increases in ΔEX effectively reduce the size of Ledge, thereby, increasing the resultant current density in a Chern network.

Nonetheless, the consequences of such low current flow within the device structure may best be understood by considering the device concepts of static and dynamic fan-out. Fan-out is defined as the number of logic-gate inputs that may be driven by the output of a given logic gate without degradation of the logical state. While the static—or resistive DC component—of fan-out may be improved by better mitigation of contact resistances in Chern networks, the dynamic—or AC capacitive component—is more pernicious. The speed at which a signal moves through logic gates is limited by the charging time of the inherent capacitance of the logic gates, leading to propagation delays. Propagation delays may be, in part, overcome by using higher input currents to charge the next logic gate, via

In Eq. (2), Iinput is the input current fed into the logic element from a previous logic stage, Clogic is the capacitance and Vlogic is the voltage of the current logic gate, respectively. Eq. (2) indicates that by increasing the current fed into subsequent logic stages from previous stages, the voltage across the current logic stage increases faster thereby increasing the speed of signal propagation. Cast in this light, the small output current from the Chern network will produce significant delays in signal propagation if integrated within a CMOS framework.

The advances put forth in the recent series of Chern network experiments represent a glimpse of the functionality and the variability of topological materials and responses. Given the difficulties discussed, namely scaling, temperature and performance, it is unlikely that such systems will find a home in next-generation CMOS technologies. However, while the specific expression of topological behavior may not impact the device architecture landscape, the important lessons learned within these impressive works must serve as the basis for continued exploration of topological materials from the applied or device perspective.

To me, the overarching question germane to both perspectives is “Does the presence of topology matter for enabling new technologies?"". Nevertheless, many open questions remain from both the fundamental and applied perspectives. From the applied perspective, questions remain around fundamental device properties, such as understanding the electrostatic and transport properties of deposited metals on topological materials, as this relates directly to the device contact resistance—a crucial parameter in any application15,29. From the fundamental perspective, an intriguing question surrounds the importance of crystallinity to device performance. Put another way: is it necessary to have perfectly crystalline topological materials to be able to exploit topological functionality? When considering time-reversal invariant topological materials, like (Bi,Sb)2Se3, the topological nature is protected by the inversion of band ordering that is brought about by the strength of the spin–orbit interaction. However, amorphous materials, characterized by randomized hopping strengths and positions of atoms within a material possessing neither long-range or short-range order, constructed from atoms with strong spin–orbit interactions, have been shown to possess the same topological features30,31. Therefore, perhaps the consideration of a cheaper quasi-crystalline topological system may be able to produce similar behavior at lower cost and effort32, if the presence of a topological surface state is the critical requirement for device implementations.

Regardless, my perspective remains that the goal of topological technologies should be to replace functionality at the system level rather than at the level of individual devices. As we begin to look towards bringing the areas of condensed matter physics and device engineering closer, I believe that by starting the dialogue by examining some of the recent condensed matter successes and open device engineering questions to be addressed, we may collectively move towards a viable topological technology.

A replication drive focused on results that lean on three methods commonly used in biomedical research in Brazil. Credit: Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty 

In an unprecedented effort, a coalition of more than 50 research teams has surveyed a swathe of Brazilian biomedical studies to double-check their findings — with dismaying results.

The teams were able to replicate the results of less than half of the tested experiments1. That rate is in keeping with that found by other large-scale attempts to reproduce scientific findings. But the latest work is unique in focusing on papers that use specific methods and in examining the research output of a specific country, according to the research teams.

The results provide an impetus to strengthen the country's science, the study's authors say. “We now have the material to start making changes from within — whether through public policies or within universities,” says Mariana Boechat de Abreu, a metascience researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in Brazil and one of the coordinators of the project.

The work was posted on 8 April to the bioRxiv preprint server and has not yet been peer reviewed.

The massive experiment was coordinated by the Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative, a collaborative effort launched in 2019 by researchers at the UFRJ. The scientists wanted to assess publications “based on methods, rather than research area, perceived importance or citation counts”, de Abreu says. And they wanted to do so on a large scale. Ultimately, 213 scientists at 56 laboratories in Brazil were involved in the work.

The project unfolded during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought numerous logistical challenges. And teams disagreed about how closely to follow the tested protocols. “It was like trying to turn dozens of garage bands, each with its own way of playing, into an orchestra,” says project coordinator Olavo Bohrer Amaral, a physician at the UFRJ.

Reproducibility trial: 246 biologists get different results from same data sets

The authors began by reviewing a random sample of life-sciences articles to determine the most common biomedical research methods used in Brazil, ensuring that any biomedical lab interested in joining the project would be capable of reproducing the experiments.

They ended up selecting three of these methods: an assay of cell metabolism, a technique for amplifying genetic material and a type of maze test for rodents. Then the authors randomly selected biomedical papers that relied on those methods and were published from 1998 to 2017 by research teams in which at least half the contributors had a Brazilian affiliation.

The collaborators initially chose a subset of 60 papers for replication, guided by factors such as whether a paper included certain statistical information. Three labs tested each experiment, and an independent committee judged which of those tests was a valid replication. The coalition performed 97 valid replication attempts of 47 experiments.

The authors judged a paper's replicability by five criteria, including whether at least half of the replication attempts had statistically significant results in the same direction as the original paper. Only 21% of the experiments were replicable using at least half of the applicable criteria.

The authors also found that the effect size — the magnitude of the observed impact in the experiments — was, on average, 60% larger in the original papers than in the experimental follow-ups, indicating that published results tend to overestimate the effects of the interventions tested.

Metrics details

Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.

Quantum phase transitions emerge as quintessential manifestations of the interplay among quantum many-body phenomena1,2. They are characterized by the universal description across microscopically different systems, which has been central to our understanding of quantum matters. Nevertheless, precisely detecting these transitions in equilibrium systems poses significant challenges both theoretically and experimentally. This has led recent investigations to focus on nonequilibrium dynamics, which is inherently related to quantum phase transitions through dynamical quantum critical phenomena. Indeed, nonequilibrium signatures of quantum phase transitions have been identified in a diverse range of systems, spanning integrable, nonintegrable, and topological systems3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. A prevalent strategy in these explorations involves a global quantum quench, wherein the entire system is initially configured in a designated state and subsequently undergoes time evolution under a specific Hamiltonian. Recent experimental advancements in isolating and manipulating quantum systems have facilitated such sophisticated control in various platforms, including trapped ions18,19,20,21, ultracold atoms22,23,24,25, Rydberg atoms26,27,28,29, and nitrogen-vacancy centers30.

A pertinent question then emerges regarding the feasibility of dynamically detecting equilibrium quantum phase transitions through local quantum quenches. Given that the local quench operation, in contrast to its global counterpart, selectively influences nontrivial excitations or quasiparticles in specific regions characteristic of each quantum phase31,32,33,34, the resulting dynamics may potentially unveil signatures of quantum phase transitions. However, the complexity lies in isolating and analyzing the response dynamics directly ascribed to the local quench operation. Since the dynamics is influenced by both the local quantum quench, and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system itself, the latter obscures the former, thereby diminishing the potential benefit of local quenches in facilitating access to localized physics.

In this paper, we reveal that signatures of quantum phase transitions manifest themselves in out-of-equilibrium local observables subsequent to local quantum quenches. To this end, we develop the methodology of “quantum reservoir probing"" (QRP)35, which selectively extracts the effects of the local quantum quench from the dynamics influenced by multiple factors. Through the lens of the QRP, we observe that the local quench exerts varied influences on a single-site operator, depending on the inherent characteristics of quantum phases. Moreover, at the quantum critical points, these influences are notably suppressed due to the enhanced quantum fluctuations. Capitalizing on these phenomena, the QRP demonstrates the robust capability to detect quantum phase transitions, as exemplified in both integrable and nonintegrable models herein. Furthermore, notwithstanding the use of local quenches and single-site operators, we demonstrate that the QRP can identify topological quantum phase transitions, which are typically distinguished by the absence of local order parameters beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. The broad applicability and design flexibility of our QRP establishes it as a versatile tool for probing a variety of quantum phenomena, opening the door to further understanding of quantum many-body physics.

Before going to the QRP, we provide an overview of a brain-inspired machine-learning framework called reservoir computing36,37,38. In this paradigm, information is nonlinearly processed by networks of artificial neurons, termed the “reservoir”. A distinguishing feature is that all weight parameters within the reservoir part remain fixed, while only the output weight, which transforms the reservoir state into the final output, is trained utilizing a simple linear regression scheme. Consequently, optimization costs are markedly reduced compared to alternative schemes where the entire network weights are optimized. Importantly, due to this fixed nature, a physical system can embody the reservoir part; quantum reservoir computing (QRC) harnesses a quantum system as the reservoir (Fig. 1a)39. The quantum reservoir system evolves under the influence of the input data, and a read-out vector, constructed through repeated measurements on various degrees of freedom, undergoes linear transformation to yield the final output.

The quantum state of the reservoir reflects the provided input information, and the final output is obtained by linearly transforming a read-out vector constructed through multiple measurements on various degrees of freedom. b Schematic representation of the QRP, which investigates the quantum system from the perspective of information processing capabilities.

The gray spin undergoes the local quantum quench induced by the yellow needle, while the remaining spins are initialized in the designated state \(\left\vert \Phi \right\rangle\), illustrated here as the all-up state. d Diagrammatic representation of the initial quantum state [Eq. (1)]. The central spin is locally manipulated contingent upon the input value sk for each case (three instances are depicted). This local quench induces varied dynamics in the local operator Oi(t), which is reflective of the corresponding input values. e Dynamics of 〈Oi(t)〉 summarized across three cases depicted in (d). f Schematic illustration of the determination coefficient \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) derived from 〈Oi(t)〉. An almost unity \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) signifies a precise estimation of the input value, indicating the pronounced influence of the local quench on the observed 〈Oi(t)〉 [Eq. (4)]. Conversely, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) approaches zero when 〈Oi(t)〉 exhibits similar values that do not reflect each input, as exemplified by intersections of 〈Oi(t)〉.

The QRP is an inverse extension of the QRC, wherein the quantum system employed as the reservoir part is investigated by linking physical phenomena with information processing (Fig. 1b). As introduced below, the input is provided via the local quantum quench, and the output is computed from a local observable; the objective of the calculation is to estimate the original input value. Given that information is provided solely through this local quench, the estimation succeeds when the local quench exerts an influence on the observed degree of freedom. By systematically scanning local observation operators, the QRP selectively probes the impacts of the local quench on the quantum system through the input estimation performance.

The central feature underlying the QRP is the manipulation of a local degree of freedom, parametrized by a random input value sk. Our focus is on a local operator O defined at spatial position i and time t, denoted as Oi(t), with particular attention to the variations induced by the input variable sk. In the statistical analysis across various instances with different inputs subscripted by k, the expectation value \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) may display diverse characteristics that closely reflect the corresponding input values. In such cases, the value of sk can be precisely deduced from \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) through straightforward calculations. Hence, the successful estimation of the original input value sk provides evidence that the local manipulation exerts an influence on the operator Oi(t) at that particular spatiotemporal coordinate. In contrast, when the operator \({O}_{j}({t}^{{\prime} })\) at a different spatiotemporal point demonstrates consistent behavior across all instances, it is predominantly governed by the inherent characteristics of the quantum system independent of the local quench. Therefore, the dependency of the operator Oi(t) on the input value sk explores how the local quantum quench influences the operator while isolating it from other intrinsic phenomena. Remarkably, this linkage is highly sensitive to the Hamiltonian governing the quantum system. The operator's dependency on the local quench operation thus serves as a witness to the properties of the quantum system, shedding light on the underlying quantum processes at play.

Here, we explain the specific procedures of the QRP on the one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems. The protocol consists of four steps: (i) the preparation of the initial state (Fig. 1c), (ii) the local quench on the central spin, parameterized by the input value sk (Fig. 1c, d), (iii) the observation of the dynamics of a local operator 〈Oi(t)〉 under the Hamiltonian \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}\) (Fig. 1d, e), and (iv) the statistical evaluation of the performance in estimating the input value sk from the observed dynamics, quantified by the determination coefficient \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) (Fig. 1f). We provide a comprehensive description of each step in the following.

First, the system is prepared in a designated initial state in step (i); for simplicity, a product state is assumed here (e.g., the all-up state in Fig. 1c). Subsequently, in step (ii), a specific spin undergoes a local quench manipulation based on the input value sk. The resultant state is expressed as

where \(\vert \psi ({s}_{k})\rangle\) represents the state of the locally manipulated spin, while \(\vert \Phi \rangle\) denotes the prepared initial state for the remaining subsystem (Fig. 1d). The input value sk is randomly sampled from a uniform distribution, specifically sk ∈ [0, 1]. For instance, we consider the initial state as

where \(\vert \pm \rangle=\left(\vert \uparrow \rangle \pm \vert \downarrow \rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}\). This state can be prepared by applying a single-gate pulse or a local magnetic field \({{{\bf{h}}}}\propto (2{s}_{k}-1,0,-2\sqrt{{s}_{k}(1-{s}_{k})})\).

We then let the system evolve under the Hamiltonian \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}\) in step (iii), resulting in the state \(\vert {\Psi }_{k}(t)\rangle={e}^{-i{{{\mathcal{H}}}}t}\vert {\Psi }_{k}^{{{{\rm{in}}}}}\rangle\) (see Methods section). The expectation value of a local operator Oi(t) is calculated as \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}=\langle {\Psi }_{k}(t)| {O}_{i}| {\Psi }_{k}(t)\rangle\); we omit the subscript k unless necessary. By iterating this procedure across various instances with different sk, we generate multiple time series of the dynamics, as illustrated in Fig. 1e.

Finally, in step (iv), we assess the influence of the local quantum quench on the local operator. As a criterion, we employ precision in estimating the input value sk through the linear transformation of \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\), following the standard methodology used in reservoir computing paradigm35,36,37,38,39. For a given instance k, the output of this linear transformation is derived as

where wi,O(t) and wi,c(t) represent the k-independent coefficients. These weights are finely tuned for training instances so that the output yi,k(t) approximates the original input value sk as closely as possible over all k, based on the least squares method. Subsequently, in the testing phase, the estimation performance for unknown instances is quantified by the determination coefficient

where cov and σ2 represent covariance and variance, respectively; see Methods section for more details. The value of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) ranges between 0 and 1, with an approach towards 1 indicating that the outputs {yi,k(t)} closely reproduce the inputs {sk} for all testing instances.

Figure 1e, f visually elucidate the relationship between the dynamics of \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) and the corresponding \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). A high \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) value suggests that \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) varies systematically in response to the input value sk. In contrast, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) close to 0 indicates that \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) is largely independent of sk, such as at the crossing points resulting from intrinsic oscillations in the quantum system. Therefore, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) serves as an indicator of the extent to which Oi(t) is influenced by the local quench operation. Under different parameters of the Hamiltonian \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}\), the local quench operation exerts varying influences on the resultant dynamics, hence the behavior of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) is instrumental in examining the unique properties of each quantum phase. It is worth noting that, although the input in Eq. (2) includes a nonlinear contribution from sk, our analysis concentrates on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the linear component in accordance with the QRC framework. Any additional complexity beyond linear regression could impede interpretability, as the output is influenced by the extraneous characteristics of the transformation itself.

Let us first apply our QRP protocol to the paradigmatic 1D Ising model with a transverse magnetic field under the open boundary condition. The Hamiltonian is given by

where \({\sigma }_{i}^{x}\) and \({\sigma }_{i}^{z}\) are the x and z Pauli matrices at site i, respectively. g signifies the magnitude of the transverse magnetic field, and J > 0 denotes the strength of the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction; we set J = 1 as our energy scale. This model manifests a quantum phase transition at the quantum critical point gc = 1 in the thermodynamic limit, which separates a ferromagnetically ordered phase for g < 1 from a quantum disordered phase for g > 11,40. Notably, the model is solvable through the Jordan-Wigner transformation and the subsequent Bogoliubov transformation, where the spin system is mapped to the free quasiparticle picture1.

In step (i), the system is initialized in the all-up state, and after the local quantum quench at the central spin in step (ii), the resultant state \(\vert {\Psi }_{k}^{{{{\rm{in}}}}}\rangle\) in Eq. (1) is explicitly expressed as

using \(\vert \psi ({s}_{k})\rangle\) defined in Eq. (2). In step (iii), we monitor the dynamics of the local spin \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) at each site i under the Hamiltonian \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}={{{\mathcal{H}}}}(g)\). Repeating the procedure for many instances with varying sk, the estimation performance \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) in Eq. (4) is methodically evaluated in step (iv).

Figure 2 encapsulates the results of the QRP under various magnetic fields g. In Fig. 2a, we show the spatiotemporal representation of the estimation performance \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\), which reveals a discernible light-cone structure emanating from the quenched central site. The broad distribution of nonzero \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) suggests that the local spin operator \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) across diverse spatial locations and temporal moments adequately reflects the impact of the local quantum quench. In the quantum disordered phase, where the ground state exhibits spins aligned along the x direction, the effects of the local quench along the x axis in spin space propagate akin to a spin wave, characterized by pronounced wavefronts of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). In contrast, in the ferromagnetically ordered phase, the local quenching effects are preserved predominantly within the quasiparticles, manifesting as alterations in phase and amplitude. This influence is evidenced by the ripple-like patterns of the nonzero \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). An exception occurs near the quantum critical point at gc = 1, characterized by maximized fluctuations that lead to an effective breakdown of the quasiparticle picture. Here, the effects of the local quench are passed on to the intrinsic fluctuations of the system, though such influences rapidly diminish as indicated by the noticeably small \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) after the passage of the wavefront. This observation highlights an anomalous suppression of the local quenching effects at the quantum critical point, which is distinct from those in other non-critical phases.

The upper band represents the schematic phase diagram regarding \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}(g)\), where the quantum critical point separating the ferromagnetically ordered phase and the quantum disordered phase exists at gc = 1. The system size is N = 49, and the time evolution is calculated using a bond dimension χ = 256; the result is quantitatively the same for χ = 128. b The early-time spin dynamics at the nearest neighbor site from the central one under three different input values. c The estimation performance \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) utilizing \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) at the same site as (b). d The average \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) over spatiotemporal indices (i, t) ∈ Λ × {0 < t ≤ 7}, with Λ encompassing the central nine sites. The blue and pink lines represent the results for system sizes N = 49 and N = 37, respectively, exhibiting analogous behavior. The quantum critical point is denoted by the gray dashed line.

In Fig. 2b, the early-time dynamics of \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) at the nearest-neighbor spin from the central one is depicted for three distinct input values sk at different magnetic fields g. At g = 0.5 and 1.5, periodic spin oscillations are induced, with their phase and amplitude dependent on the input sk. In contrast, at g = 1.0, the dynamics of \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) exhibits significant variation when the wavefronts pass at approximately t ≃ 1, thereafter stabilizing into a featureless pattern with diminished influence from the quench operation. Figure 2c displays the corresponding estimation performance at the same site (a vertical cross-section of the color map in Fig. 2a). Over broad temporal spans at g = 0.5 and 1.5, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) becomes close to 1, which statistically underscores the input dependency of the phase and amplitude of the spin oscillations. In contrast, their frequency is governed not by the local quench on the initial state, but rather by the intrinsic characteristics of the quasiparticles themselves. This is evidenced by \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) periodically approaching zero (Fig. 2c) at points where oscillations of \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) intersect for different inputs (Fig. 2b). Notably, at g = 1.0, while \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) nears 1 around t ≃ 1 where the wavefronts induce variations in the spin dynamics, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\simeq 0\) in other temporal regions signifies the reduced influence of the local quench due to the intrinsic fluctuations enhanced near the quantum critical point.

As described above, the effects of the local quantum quench on the resultant dynamics of local operators manifest qualitatively different characteristics across various phases (Fig. 2a). The distribution of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) thus serves as a marker for identifying the quantum phase transition. To enhance the clarity of the results, in Fig. 2d, we display the mean value of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) over a specific subset of spatiotemporal indices {(i, t)}, denoted as \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\). This analysis focuses on (i, t) within the central nine sites during the time interval 0 < t ≤ 7; selecting different subsets does not qualitatively alter the results (see the Supplementary Information). We note that \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) represents a simple average of local quantities, and therefore, does not include nonlocal quantum effects. As g approaches gc = 1 from the ferromagnetically ordered state, the fluctuations progressively intensify and interfere with the estimation of the original input, resulting in a decrease in \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\). At the quantum critical point, \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) reaches its minimum, which corresponds to the emergence of a dark region between the wavefronts observed in Fig. 2a for g = 1.0. Upon further augmentation of g into the quantum disordered phase, the fluctuations weaken again and the effects of the quench operation become dominant, leading to an increase in \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\). The pronounced dip in Fig. 2d is, therefore, a definitive indicator of the quantum phase transition occurring at g = gc. Consequently, by focusing on the effects of the local quantum quench, our QRP successfully detects the quantum phase transition only by measurements of single-site spin dynamics.

To illustrate the applicability of our QRP framework to nonintegrable systems, we extend the model to the anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) chain41,42,43,44. The Hamiltonian is given by

where J and κ represent the strengths of the nearest-neighbor and the next-nearest-neighbor interactions, respectively; we take J = 1. The latter term makes the system nonintegrable by introducing the four-body interactions for the quasiparticles derived by the Jordan-Wigner transformation. This model hosts a rich phase diagram in the κ-g plane45. Our investigation focuses on the case of κ = 0.5, where the quantum phase transition occurs at g = gc with the Ising universality, separating ferromagnetically ordered (g < gc) and quantum disordered (g > gc) phases. In our finite-size system with open boundary conditions, we determined gc ≃ 1.7 utilizing the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. The initial state is prepared in the same manner as Eq. (6).

Figure 3a displays the spatiotemporal representation of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) obtained from \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\), revealing a scenario similar to the transverse-field Ising model. For the majority of sites and times, the local spin \(\langle {\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\rangle\) mirrors the input value sk employed in the local quantum quench, as evidenced by the nonzero values of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). Above the critical field at gc ≃ 1.7, particularly for g = 2.6 in the right panel, the effects of the local manipulation propagate primarily through the excitation wavefronts, while the local spin oscillations exhibit weaker dependence on the local quench with small \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). Conversely, below the critical point, the opposite behavior is noted in the left panel for g = 1.0. Furthermore, in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, the influence of the local quench manifests itself predominantly along the wavefronts, while in the other regions it is suppressed by the enhanced quantum fluctuations, as demonstrated by the emergence of a discernible dark zone between the wavefronts. These fundamental dependencies of the local spin operators on the local quench retain a similarity to those observed in the integrable model presented in Fig. 2a.

The upper band represents the schematic phase diagram, where the ferromagnetically ordered and quantum disordered phases are separated by the quantum critical point at approximately gc ≃ 1.7.

In Fig. 3b, we present the mean value \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\), calculated over the indices (i, t) corresponding to the central seven sites within the time frame 0 < t ≤ 5 (see the Supplementary Information for other subsets). Analogous to the observation in Fig. 2d, \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) demonstrates a pronounced decrease around the quantum critical point at gc ≃ 1.7, precisely locating the boundary between the different spatiotemporal distribution patterns of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) in the ferromagnetically ordered phase and the quantum disordered phase. This observation confirms that, even in nonintegrable quantum systems, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) functions as an effective marker for detecting quantum phase transitions.

The preceding sections have demonstrated the effectiveness of our QRP in identifying quantum phase transitions, particularly between conventional phases where the internal physics is well-characterized and understood within the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory. Building on this foundation, we now aim to broaden our exploration to more complex quantum phenomena. In particular, we apply the QRP framework to the detection of topological quantum phase transitions, which lack local order parameters that can distinguish adjacent phases. This raises the question of whether the QRP framework, which solely utilizes a single-site spin operator, can still be effective in identifying these transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm.

Here, we study the cluster model with open boundaries46,47,48, which is defined by

where Jzz and Jzxz denote the Ising and cluster interaction strengths, respectively; we set Jzz = 1. This model is renowned for hosting a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, known as the cluster state, which emerges for Jzz < Jzxz. The SPT phase is distinguished by its protection under a \({{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}\times {{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}^{T}\) symmetry, and is characterized by nonlocal string order parameters49,50,51,52,53. As the strength of the cluster interaction diminishes, the quantum phase transition occurs from the SPT phase to the topologically trivial, ferromagnetically ordered phase at the quantum critical point Jzxz = 1. We aim to detect this transition through the dynamical signature in the QRP, by preparing the initial state in Eq. (6) and monitoring the dynamics of the local spin \({\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\).

In Fig. 4a, we present the estimation performance \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) under the Hamiltonian \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}\) for three different strengths of the cluster interaction: Jzxz = 0.6 in the ferromagnetically ordered phase, Jzxz = 1.4 in the SPT phase, and Jzxz = 1.0 at the quantum critical point. Consistent with the previous topologically trivial models, the spread of nonzero \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) values indicates that the operator \({\sigma }_{i}^{x}(t)\) is reflective of the local quantum quench at various spatiotemporal points. Importantly, at the quantum critical point, a notable trend is observed wherein \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) is suppressed following the passage of the wavefronts. This precisely mirrors the trend observed at the quantum critical point in conventional quantum phase transitions (Figs. 2d and 3b).

The time evolution is calculated with a bond dimension of χ = 256. b The average \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) over a subset (i, t) ∈ Λ × {0 < t ≤ 6.5}, where Λ represents the central eleven spins. The upper bar illustrates the phase diagram.

Figure 4b presents the mean value \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\), which effectively distinguishes these three distinct distributions of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) is computed as the average of \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) for the central eleven spins within the time interval 0 < t ≤ 6.5. A key observation in Fig. 4b is the pronounced dip at \({{J}_{zxz}}=1.0\), signifying the suppression of the impact of local quantum quench. This dip thus marks the quantum critical point characterized by enhanced quantum fluctuations, clearly delineating the boundary between the SPT phase and the trivial ordered phase. Therefore, despite the absence of local order parameters in the topological phase, our QRP, based on the local quench and local observables, demonstrates itself as a potent instrument for detecting the topological quantum phase transition.

Finally, we extend the cluster model in Eq. (8) by introducing a transverse magnetic field:

The interplay among these three terms gives rise to a complex phase diagram54,55,56,57: the SPT phase is stabilized when the cluster interaction term dominates with a large Jzxz, while topologically trivial phases emerge in the ferromagnetically ordered state under strong Ising interaction or in the disordered state under a strong magnetic field. Here, we fix Jzz = 0.1 and vary Jzxz = (1 − Jzz)α and hx = (1 − Jzz)(1 − α), with a tuning parameter α adjusting the balance between the cluster and magnetic field terms. At the critical value αc = 0.5, the topological quantum phase transition occurs, delineating the SPT phase (α > αc) from the disordered phase (α < αc)57. Importantly, these phases are devoid of local orderings on both sides of the quantum critical point, unlike the transition examined in Fig. 4, which exhibits the local ferromagnetic order on one side. We initialize the system as

where \(\vert {\psi }^{{\prime} }({s}_{k})\rangle=\sqrt{1-{s}_{k}}\vert {+}_{y}\rangle+\sqrt{{s}_{k}}\vert {-}_{y}\rangle\) and \(\vert {\pm }_{y}\rangle=\left(\vert \uparrow \rangle \pm i\vert \downarrow \rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}\). \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) is subsequently evaluated from the dynamics of \({\sigma }_{i}^{x}\). These are chosen to clearly demonstrate the QRP by leveraging the flexibility of both the input and output.

Figure 5a illustrates the estimation performance \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) under the Hamiltonian \({{{\mathcal{H}}}}\) for three different values of α. In all scenarios, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) acquires nonzero values propagating from the central site throughout the system, where the distinctions between the phases become evident. Notably, at the quantum critical point (α = αc), \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) is markedly suppressed, displaying a discernibly dark spatiotemporal region in Fig. 5a. This behavior contrasts with the SPT phase at α = 0.7 and the trivial disordered phase at α = 0.3, both of which exhibits more complicated pattern with widely spread nonzero \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\). To quantitatively assess these differences, we illustrate the α dependence of \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) in Fig. 5b, which is defined by averaging \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) over the central 13 sites within the time frame 0 < t ≤ 7. Consistent with the previous models, \(\overline{{R}^{2}}\) exhibits a pronounced dip at the quantum critical point, which precisely delineates the boundary between the trivial and topological phases. Indeed, the quantum fluctuations are consistently amplified near the critical point, irrespective of the system's topological nature or the existence of local orderings. Therefore, even purely topological quantum phase transitions can be detected via the QRP, using these fluctuations in the post-local quench dynamics as witnesses.

To summarize, we have proposed the QRP as a versatile tool for identifying the quantum phase transitions in a variety of quantum systems, including integrable, nonintegrable, and topological systems. The QRP selectively evaluates the effects of the local quench in a manner similar to the pump-probe paradigm. Here, the parametrized local quantum quench, acting as the “pump”, injects random disturbance into the dynamics. The estimation performance of this random input parameter, through the linear transformation of the single-site operator, serves as the “probe”. This pump-probe-like process informationally discerns the underlying relationship between the local quench and the resultant dynamics of the operators. Through the QRP, we have observed that the local quench operation exerts varied influence depending on the nature of the quantum phases. At the quantum critical points, the introduced disturbance becomes subordinate to the maximally enhanced quantum fluctuations. A noticeable decline in the estimation performance observed therein serves as a marker for the transition between distinct quantum phases. These findings have established that local, nonequilibrium excitations bear the signatures of quantum phase transitions concerning global, equilibrium many-body ground states. The crux of our methodology lies in the suppression of local quenching effects on local dynamics due to amplified quantum fluctuations, the rigorous justification of which is left for future study.

Our investigations have focused on 1D quantum spin systems; however, the QRP methodology is applicable to a broader range of quantum systems in more than one dimension as well. Indeed, the conformal field theories governing quantum phase transitions in two- and higher-dimensional systems exhibit significant differences from their 1D counterparts58. These differences manifest themselves as changes in the nature of excitations, intrinsic dynamics, and critical behaviors near quantum critical points, all of which would be detectable through the QRP. Moreover, geometric frustrations in high-dimensional quantum spin systems, coupled with the inherent quantum fluctuations, give rise to a plethora of topological quantum phase transitions in a variety of systems. For instance, in certain systems, such transitions are associated with the emergence of anyons, which have promising potential for applications in topological quantum computing59. The examination of how anyons respond to local quantum operations through the QRP holds significant importance in light of the aforementioned applications. We leave the high-dimensional applications of the QRP for future investigations.

Finally, let us remark on the design flexibility of the QRP. A fundamental advantage of employing local quantum quenches, in contrast to global ones, lies in their capability to access and elucidate quantum phenomena induced by local operations, such as specific types of excitations. When one possesses prior knowledge regarding the physics of the targeted system, especially for discerning partially understood phenomena, the optimal selections for the initial state, local operation, and read-out operators in the QRP become intuitively evident. In contrast, the true value of the QRP framework becomes markedly pronounced in the exploration of completely unknown quantum systems. Therein, the underlying physics remains undisclosed, rendering the interpretation of the complex dynamics observed a formidable task. Our QRP provides a systematic approach to this complexity, categorizing operators by meticulously investigating their dependence on various local operations through a scan of the aforementioned conditions of the QRP. Furthermore, the experimental simplicity of the QRP is noteworthy, as it requires solely single-site measurements during the early stages of the dynamics, without the need for complex quantum correlations or long-time evolutions. Consequently, we believe that the QRP presents a promising methodology for eliciting novel insights into a broad spectrum of exotic quantum many-body phenomena, extending beyond quantum phase transitions.

To construct the initial state, we define \({{{{\mathcal{H}}}}}_{{{{\rm{DMRG}}}}}\) that yields \(\vert {\Psi }_{k}^{{{{\rm{in}}}}}\rangle\) as its ground state obtained from the DMRG method60,61,62. The Hamiltonian \({{{{\mathcal{H}}}}}_{{{{\rm{DMRG}}}}}\) comprises the local magnetic fields, aligned with the product state specified in Eqs. (6) and (10), as well as the input magnetic field applied to the central spin to prepare it in the sk-dependent state. The initial state is then obtained as the ground state of \({{{{\mathcal{H}}}}}_{{{{\rm{DMRG}}}}}\) using the DMRG method, expressed as a matrix product state with a bond dimension χ. For the time evolution \({e}^{-i{{{\mathcal{H}}}}t}\vert {\Psi }_{k}^{{{{\rm{in}}}}}\rangle\), we employ the time-dependent variational principle63,64,65 with a bond dimension χ and a time step Δt = 0.005. To maintain computational accuracy, the time evolution is conducted only up to the point before any anomalous behavior in the entanglement entropy is observed (refer to the Supplementary Information). The tensor network calculations are implemented using the Julia version of the ITensor library66,67.

From a uniform distribution [0, 1], a set of 256 input values {sk} is sampled. Each input sk produces a distinct initial state \(\vert {\Psi }_{k}^{{{{\rm{in}}}}}\rangle\), and the dynamics of operator \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) is subsequently calculated. Among them, \({l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}=128\) instances are designated for training, while the remaining l ts = 128 instances are reserved for testing. Using a 2D vector \({{{{\bf{x}}}}}_{i,k}(t)=\left({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k},1\right)\), the linear transformation for estimating sk is expressed as yi,k(t) = xi,k(t)wi(t), where the weight vector is defined by \({{{{\bf{w}}}}}_{i}(t)={({w}_{i,O}(t),{w}_{i,c}(t))}^{\top }\).

In the training phase, an (\({l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}\times 2\))-dimensional matrix \({{{{\rm{X}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}(t)={\{{{{{\bf{x}}}}}_{i,k}(t)\}}_{k=1}^{{l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}}\) is constructed by summing up the observed dynamics. The output, represented as an \({l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}\)-dimensional vector \({{{{\bf{y}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}(t)={\{{y}_{i,k}\}}_{k=1}^{{l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}}\), is calculated as \({{{{\bf{y}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}(t)={{{{\rm{X}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}(t){{{{\bf{w}}}}}_{i}(t)\). The weight vector is trained to closely match the output \({{{{\bf{y}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}(t)\) with the original input \({{{{\bf{s}}}}}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}={\{{s}_{k}\}}_{k=1}^{{l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}}\). The optimal solution, which minimizes the least squared error between these vectors, is given by

where \({{{{\rm{X}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}{(t)}^{+}\) denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse-matrix of \({{{{\rm{X}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}(t)\).

In the testing phase, an (lts × 2)-dimensional matrix \({{{{\rm{X}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{ts}}}}}(t)={\{{{{{\bf{x}}}}}_{i,k}(t)\}}_{k={l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}+1}^{{l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}+{l}^{{{{\rm{ts}}}}}}\) is similarly composed, yielding the output \({{{{\bf{y}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{ts}}}}}(t)={{{{\rm{X}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\rm{ts}}}}}(t){{{{\bf{w}}}}}_{i}(t)\) using the trained weights. The estimation performance is assessed by comparing this testing output with the corresponding input \({{{{\bf{s}}}}}^{{{{\rm{ts}}}}}={\{{s}_{k}\}}_{k={l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}+1}^{{l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}+{l}^{{{{\rm{ts}}}}}}\) using the determination coefficient

Here, cov and σ2 denote covariance and variance, respectively. The coefficient \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) statistically assesses the extent to which Oi(t) is influenced by the local quantum quench parameterized by sk. We have verified that a smaller dataset with \({l}^{{{{\rm{tr}}}}}=100\) and lts = 100 produces quantitatively similar results.

As explained above, the QRP analyzes the variation of dynamics under different sk values. \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) should ideally be zero when no systematic variations dependent on the input sk are observed. However, in numerical simulations, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) might accidentally exhibit nonzero values, sensitively reflecting the small deviations in \({\langle {O}_{i}(t)\rangle }_{k}\) comparable to numerical errors. To avoid this numerical artifact, we introduce a threshold Δth for the deviation of the operator across different instances. We employ the average absolute deviation Δi(t), defined as

When Δi(t) is negligibly small, \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)\) calculated from the above 〈Oi(t)〉 should approach zero. We thus manually set \({R}_{i}^{2}(t)=0\) when Δi(t) < Δth; we utilize Δth = 10−5, and Δth dependency is presented in the Supplementary Information. This procedure does not qualitatively alter our methodology and is experimentally feasible.

Metrics details

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, represent highly effective treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, enabling effective control of glucose and weight loss, while reducing cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The success of these medicines has spurred development of next-generation GLP-1-based drugs, promising greater weight loss, improved tolerability and additional options for the route and frequency of dosing. This Review profiles established and emerging GLP-1-based medicines, discussing optimization of pharmacokinetics and tolerability, engagement of new therapeutically useful pathways and safety aspects. Structurally unique GLP-1-based medicines that achieve substantially greater and rapid weight loss may impact musculoskeletal health, providing a rationale for therapeutics that more selectively target adipose tissue loss while preserving muscle mass and strength. Ongoing clinical trials in peripheral vascular disease, neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders, metabolic liver disease, arthritis, hypertension and neurodegenerative disorders may broaden indications for GLP-1-based therapeutics.

Metrics details

Functional specialization of brain areas and subregions, as well as their integration into large-scale networks, are key principles in neuroscience. Consolidating both local and global perspectives on cortical organization, however, remains challenging. Here, we present an approach to integrate inter- and intra-areal similarities of microstructure, structural connectivity, and functional interactions. Using high-field in-vivo 7 tesla (7 T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and a probabilistic post-mortem atlas of cortical cytoarchitecture, we derive multimodal gradients that capture cortex-wide organization. Inter-areal similarities follow a canonical sensory-fugal gradient, linking cortical integration with functional diversity across tasks. However, intra-areal heterogeneity does not follow this pattern, with greater variability in association cortices. Findings are replicated in an independent 7 T dataset and a 100-subject 3 tesla (3 T) cohort. These results highlight a robust coupling between local arealization and global cortical motifs, advancing our understanding of how specialization and integration shape human brain function.

Understanding how the spatial organization of the human brain gives rise to cognitive functions is a challenging, yet fundamental goal for human neuroscience1. Complex brain networks at multiple scales arise from overlapping variations in cortical microstructure, function, and connectivity2,3. This network involves both the global integration and local specialization of cortical regions, giving rise to distributed functional communities that enable complex computations4,5,6,7. Global integration prominently manifests within higher-order systems, notably the transmodal association cortex, which engages in increasingly abstract and self-generated cognition8,9,10,11,12,13,14. In contrast, local functional specialization is more frequent in sensory and motor regions that interact more closely with the here and now6,8,15,16. The interplay between contrasting local and global motifs contributes to the hierarchical organization of the brain, underpinning segregated and integrative information processing across different cognitive functions.

Mapping structural and functional descriptors to define discrete brain areas is essential for understanding hierarchical brain organization at macroscale. Constructing precise maps of cortical areas has been a long-standing objective in neuroanatomy, as it reduces complexity and bias when studying brain regions and inter-regional relationships3,17,18,19. Cytoarchitecture, encompassing the arrangement, distribution, composition, and layering of cells, has emerged as a gold standard to define areas20. Microstructural insight from this post-mortem approach enhances our understanding of connectivity patterns and can illuminate the role of a region in cortical functioning. However, the microstructural patterns in the human brain and their relation to cortical function remain challenging to address in a systematic manner due to the constraints of invasive techniques. Recently, a 3D probabilistic atlas of human brain cytoarchitecture19 has been made available, offering valuable opportunities for examining both the micro- and macro-organization of the human brain, and for contrasting local specialization with global integration. It can, thus, help to guide investigations of structure-function association across the cortical manifold within defined areal subunits.

Gradual changes in cortical organization at macroscale have been described as well, even in early work21. While atlases of cortical areas discretize the brain into non-overlapping constituents, recent advances emphasize a potential complementary utility of using dimensional descriptions of the cortex. Such a perspective can help to account for cytoarchitectonic changes within an area (e.g., ocular dominance columns, border tuft and fringe area in the visual cortex), as well as changes occurring at macroscale between different cortical areas20. Recent work in computational anatomy has confirmed that such complementary descriptions of macroscale cortical organization can be derived from eigenvector decomposition of cortex-wide similarities in neural patterns (commonly known as cortical gradients22,23,24). These gradients differentiate cortical systems in an ordered and continuous manner, and can be applied to different types of neural data, both based on in vivo neuroimaging as well as post-mortem histology. Notably, converging hierarchical trends, spanning from sensory to transmodal regions, were observed across microstructural7,23,25,26,27 and functional gradients22,28. These multiple dimensions can effectively capture nuanced patterns of cortical organization26, and may provide synergy in understanding subregional heterogeneity and functional multiplicity of different cortical areas29. More broadly, gradient mapping techniques have robustly differentiated transmodal association cortices from primary sensory/motor systems, mirroring their hierarchical contributions to cognition. In effect, such gradients have been found to align with functionally relevant properties, including disproportionate expansion during primate evolution30,31,32, reduced heritability and increased experience-dependent plasticity27,33, increased network idiosyncrasy34, and the balance of internal vs. externally oriented processing35,36,37. Moreover, gradients may help to potentially account for recent findings showing that functional activation patterns, as well as functional connectivity, can shift across different contexts and individuals38,39,40.

Local vs. global organization can be interrogated at the level of microstructure (e.g., cytoarchitecture), connectivity, and function. In this context, MRI serves as an ideal technique to bridge structure and function across varying spatial scales41,42. T1 relaxometry is sensitive to cortical microstructure and myelination43,44, diffusion MRI tractography approximates structural connectivity45,46, and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has delineated macroscopic functional networks4,47,48. Notably, while conventional MRI acquisitions at field strengths of 3 T and below may have limitations in terms of resolution and signal, recent in vivo studies that have moved to high fields of 7 T and above have benefitted from enhanced resolution, sensitivity, and biological specificity49,50,51. In addition, imaging paradigms that combine multiple MRI datasets acquired across different scanning sessions in a given individual have been shown to further increase precision for the analysis of microstructure52, connectivity53,54, and function53,55. Several of such “precision neuroimaging” datasets have already led to an advanced characterization of functional systems56,57 or fostered enhanced microstructural modeling, but previous precision imaging datasets were either prioritizing functional or structural imaging acquisitions, and rarely both in the same subjects. Moreover, prior precision imaging investigations were mainly carried out at 3 T. In this study, we expand this work by leveraging a recently introduced precision neuroimaging (PNI) dataset58, which combines repeated high-resolution structural and functional acquisitions at 7 T, offering an opportunity to interrogate cortical organization in the living human brain with high sensitivity and specificity.

The current work examined the interplay of local cortical arealization and global integration. Leveraging probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the recently disseminated Julich-Brain atlas19, we subdivided the cortex into 228 areas. In those, we profiled microstructural, structural, and functional gradients derived from repeated 7 T MRI scans. We then examined how multimodal gradient profiles differed across areas. As local-global cortical organization is presumably tied to cognitive functional architecture, we cross-referenced our maps to multiple fMRI tasks conducted in the same participants, and in particular studied the relation between inter-areal gradient profiles and functional diversity across different tasks acquired in the same subjects. The main analyzes were replicated using different parcellation atlases and datasets to validate the robustness and reliability of our findings. By integrating measures of cortical cytoarchitecture with multimodal high-definition MRI, our work sheds light on local-global cortical organization and advances our understanding of cortical structure-function relationships.

We constructed high-resolution cortex-wide connectomes, encompassing microstructural profile covariance (MPC)23, structural connectivity (SC)59, and functional connectivity (FC)22,60, in 10 healthy adults who underwent three repeated multimodal MRI scans at 7 T (Fig. 1A). We estimated connectome eigenvectors that characterized spatial gradients of MPC, SC, and FC, focusing on the first five gradients in each modality, which explained most of the variance (MPC: 31%; SC: 18%; FC: 25%). In line with prior work23, the principal MPC gradient was anchored on one end by primary sensory areas and on the other end by paralimbic regions. The principal SC gradient exhibited anterior-posterior axis, clearly dividing the cortex into two parts bounded by sensorimotor areas, as reported previously61. The first FC gradient differentiated sensory and motor cortices from the default mode network, recapitulating earlier work22,60. Other gradients were also in keeping with prior reports (Fig. 1A)23,59,60,61. To ensure equal contribution from each modality, we normalized the gradients within each modality and then averaged them in areas derived from the Julich-Brain atlas (Fig. 1B). The Julich-Brain atlas enables the investigation of structure-function association within cytoarchitectonically defined cortical subunits, though it does not cover the full cortex (please see the replication analyzes, where a cortex-wise parcellation was used). This process generated an area-wise gradient profile matrix. This matrix captures most of the information in multimodal connectomes, making it an ideal measure for investigating inter-areal differences and similarities.

A Cortex-wide connectomes were constructed from microstructural profile covariance (MPC)23, structural connectivity (SC)59,61, and functional connectivity (FC)22,60 at a vertex-level based on repeated 7 T MRI. We applied non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques129 to each connectome and aggregated the first five eigenvectors/gradients. B Probabilistic area definitions were derived from the Julich-Brain atlas19, a post-mortem cytoarchitectonic atlas based on the mapping of areas of ten postmortem brains, and their superimposition in MNI space. Please note that this probabilistic atlas does not cover the entire cortex. C We averaged vertex-wise gradients in each of the 228 areas, producing area-specific multimodal gradient profiles. These gradient profiles were reordered according to their principal component to assess inter-areal similarity. Left panel: the reordered gradient profiles located in the middle and at the two ends of the main axis were visualized in spider plots. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Middle panel: the reordered multimodal gradient profiles. Right panel: the first principal component from the original multimodal gradient profiles. Abbreviation: PCA principal component analysis, WM white matter.

We examined the similarity and differences of gradient profiles between different areas. To this end, we first conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) on the multimodal gradient profiles. These gradient profiles were reordered based on their principal component (which explained 29.6% of the variation), following a sensory-fugal axis anchored on prefrontal/cingulate regions on the one end and central/occipital regions on the other (Fig. 1C). This approach integrates salient features of its constituents (i.e., the individual MPC, SC, and FC gradients) in a synoptic manner, suggesting an overarching principle of cortical organization across multiple modalities. The reordered gradient profiles located in the middle and at the two ends of the main axis were examined and showed diverse patterns (Fig. 1C). Specifically, we observed that the bottom region of the PCA axis, corresponding to sensorimotor areas, exhibited lower gradient z-scores for MPCG1 and FCG1 and higher scores for SCG1 and SCG2. This pattern suggests that the sensorimotor network represents one end of the hierarchy across all modalities. At the opposite end of the PCA axis, regions in the inferior frontal sulcus showed the reverse pattern, representing the other extreme of the hierarchy. In contrast, the middle region displayed a relatively uniform z-score distribution, suggesting its role in linking higher-order and lower-order regions for multimodal information processing.

To further quantify area-to-area differences, we computed an inter-areal cosine distance matrix based on the original multimodal gradient profiles (Fig. 2A). The mean value of each row in this matrix indicates the overall dissimilarity of a given area from all other areas in terms of the multimodal gradient profiles. To identify cortical areas with significantly higher/lower dissimilarity compared to all other areas, we conducted spatial permutation tests (1000 permutations) that randomly rotated the Julich-Brain atlas on a sphere62. We found significant and highest inter-areal dissimilarity in sensorimotor regions (pspin < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) correction; Fig. 2A), indicating that these areas are the most unique across the cortex in terms of their multidimensional gradient profiles. Conversely, we observed the lowest dissimilarity in insular and fronto-temporal regions after spatial permutation tests (pspin < 0.05, FDR correction). This suggests that sensorimotor areas are most segregated within the overall cortical hierarchy, supporting functional specialization. Although inter-areal dissimilarity was found to correlate with temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) map (r = 0.66, pspin < 0.001; Supplementary Table 1), no significant correlations were observed with other technical imaging metrics, including the B1+ field map (r = −0.05, pspin = 0.22), the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) map from T1 scans (r = 0.12, pspin = 0.28), or the SNR map from diffusion scans (r = −0.11, pspin = 0.34). To investigate functional integration patterns, we estimated the participation coefficient (PC)63 and global FC strength. Positive, but non-significant, correlations were observed between these metrics and inter-areal dissimilarity (PC: rho = 0.13, pspin > 0.05; global FC strength: rho = 0.32, pspin > 0.05). Similar findings were observed when calculating these metrics based on group-level resting-state FC (PC: rho = 0.13, pspin > 0.05; global FC strength: rho = 0.36, pspin > 0.05).

A We calculated the cosine distance between each pair of cortical areas and computed the mean value for each area. To identify cortical areas with the highest and lowest inter-areal dissimilarity, we conducted 1000 permutation tests62. Regions with significantly higher inter-areal dissimilarity compared to other areas after applying FDR correction were highlighted using black boundaries (p < 0.05). B The left panel illustrates the distribution of inter-areal dissimilarity across four cortical hierarchies. To examine differences between each cortical hierarchical level, two-sided two-sample t-tests were conducted with FDR correction (correlations with *: pFDR < 0.05; correlations with **: pFDR < 0.001). Sample sizes: Paralim (45), Hetero (75), Uni (79), and Idio (29); all are technical replicates. Box plots display the median (center line), interquartile range (box bounds =  25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). Bars are color-coded as follows: blue for paralimbic, orange for heteromodal, green for unimodal, and red for idiotypic. To explore associations with the histological gradient, two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficients were computed (p = 0.001), and p values corrected using spin permutation tests62. C The gradient profile of parcel i was calculated by averaging the gradients across all vertices belonging to parcel i. The intra-areal dissimilarity of parcel i was then determined by calculating cosine distance between vertex-wise gradients and gradient profile of parcel i. By repeating this procedure for all parcels, we generated a map illustrating the distribution of intra-areal dissimilarity across the cortex. Regions with significantly higher intra-areal dissimilarity compared to other areas after applying FDR correction were highlighted using black boundaries (p < 0.05). D The distribution of vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity in four cortical hierarchies is shown in the left panel. To assess differences between each cortical hierarchy, two-sided two-sample t-tests were performed with FDR correction (correlations with *: pFDR < 0.05). Sample sizes: Paralim (789), Hetero (2,342), Uni (2,403), and Idio (1779); all are technical replicates. Box plots display the median (center line), interquartile range (box bounds  = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the IQR. To explore associations with the histological gradient, two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed with FDR correction. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Abbreviation: Paralim Paralimbic, Hetero Heteromodal, Uni Unimodal, Idio Idiotypic.

To gain a deeper understanding of these patterns, we investigated the distribution of inter-areal dissimilarity across four cortical hierarchical levels derived from a prior taxonomy of the primate brain proposed by Mesulam64. Using a two-sample t-test, we compared overall inter-areal dissimilarity between each pair of cortical hierarchical levels (i.e., paralimbic, heteromodal, unimodal, and idiotypic). The results revealed that the idiotypic system had the highest inter-areal dissimilarity compared to other systems (e.g., Unimodal vs Idiotypic: t = −4.73, pspin = 0.001, Cohen's d = −0.99, 95% CI = [−0.068, −0.028], FDR correction, Fig. 2B). In contrast, paralimbic systems showed lowest inter-areal dissimilarity (e.g., Paralimbic-vs-Heteromodal: t = −9.16, pspin = 0.001, Cohen's d = −1.46, 95% CI = [−0.089, −0.058], FDR correction), aligning with prior findings. To further explore associations between inter-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructure, we generated a MPC matrix of histological data obtained from the BigBrain dataset65, a 3D reconstruction of post-mortem human brain histology, and estimated its principal gradient. This gradient has previously been shown to closely recapitulate Mesulam's taxonomy of cortical hierarchical organization. In effect, we also observed a significant correlation between the histological gradient and inter-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.61, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.706, −0.552]), supporting a close association between regional cytoarchitecture and macroscale organization.

To examine inter-areal similarities using an alternative approach, we performed hierarchical clustering on cortical similarity matrices and found equivalent results, providing four robust clusters recapitulating sensory-fugal hierarchies (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We furthermore explored the layout within each parcel to better understand local organization. Here, we calculated the cosine distance between the gradient profile of each cortical vertex and the mean gradient profile of the area to which it belongs, as a measure of intra-areal dissimilarity (Fig. 2C). We found that intra-areal dissimilarity was considerably lower compared to inter-areal dissimilarity (which also confirms the utility of the used parcellation). The medial supplementary motor areas exhibited highest intra-areal dissimilarity (pspin < 0.05, spatial permutation tests, FDR correction), while the medial orbitofrontal cortex showed the lowest values under the same statistical threshold. Additionally, we found that intra-areal dissimilarity was positively correlated with parcel size (rho = 0.44, pspin = 0.001). Comparing vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity across hierarchical levels, we did not observe the same relationship between different levels as for inter-areal dissimilarity. In fact, there was a trend indicating that intra-areal dissimilarity was higher in heteromodal and unimodal association systems compared to idiotypic and paralimbic regions, though this difference was only marginally significant (Paralimbic vs Heteromodal: t = −6.03, pspin = 0.042, Cohen's d = −0.25, 95% CI = [−0.019, −0.010]; Paralimbic vs Unimodal: t = −6.54, pspin = 0.045, Cohen's d = −0.26, 95% CI = [−0.021, −0.011], FDR correction; Fig. 2D). Moreover, there was no significant association to the histological gradient derived from BigBrain (rho = −0.17, pspin = 0.12, 95% CI = [−0.280, −0.035]).

The cortical layout is intricately linked to cognition23,66. To investigate how functional connectivity patterns change across diverse cognitive states, we administered nine different fMRI tasks, including episodic memory encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, mnemonic similarity task (MST), and four passive movie watching paradigms in the same participants at 7 T. Functional connectivity for all cognitive states was constructed by cross-correlating the vertex-wise timeseries. We then calculated the cosine distance between the corresponding whole brain functional connectivity matrices to estimate cross-task diversity for each area (Supplementary Fig. 2). Focusing on overall diversity, we calculated the average of values across all tasks to generate the cross-task diversity map (Fig. 3A). We observed highest functional diversity in the medial temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex, while lower diversity in the medial frontal lobe and primary sensory cortex (Fig. 3B). To further explore how this functional diversity relates to cortical organization, we assessed associations between the cross-task diversity map and inter-areal dissimilarity. This was done by computing Spearman's correlation coefficient and correcting p values using 1000 spin permutation tests. Notably, we identified a marked correlation between cross-task diversity and inter-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.738, −0.583]; Fig. 3B). To control for potential influences from image quality, we performed partial correlation analyzes. The results remained consistent when controlling for tSNR (rho = −0.46, pspin = 0.001), B1+ field map (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001), CNR from the T1 data (rho = −0.70, pspin = 0.001), and SNR from the diffusion data (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001). The results were consistent when we excluded regions with lowest tSNR (rho = −0.70, pspin = 0.001). As expected, paralimbic areas exhibited more variable connectivity across different tasks, suggesting a more flexible functional integration into large-scale networks. In contrast, primary cortices showed less variable patterns, potentially supporting their more fixed functional specialization. Again, we only found a weak association with intra-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.19, pspin = 0.065, 95% CI = [−0.254, −0.056]).

A The FC matrices were generated using time series data obtained from for nine tasks fMRI sessions in the same subjects. This was followed by the estimation of cosine distances across different tasks. This process resulted in a cross-task diversity matrix of dimensions. To quantify the cross-task diversity for the first vertex of all tasks, the average of each column in this matrix was computed. B By repeating the procedures outlined in (A) for each vertex and subsequently mapping the results to areas, we created an area-wise cross-task diversity map. Two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed, and p values were corrected using spin permutation tests. C By taking the average of each row of the vertex-wise FC within area and calculating the standard deviation (SD) across tasks, we generated the vertex-wise cross-task SD. Taking the average of all SDs within an area and repeating this procedure for all areas, we generated the intra-areal cross-task diversity map. Two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed, and p values were corrected using spin permutation tests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Abbreviation: FC functional connectivity.

We also investigated how intra-areal functional connectivity patterns changed across different task contexts (Fig. 3C). Here, we defined intra-areal cross-task diversity as the standard deviation between vertex-wise FC across different tasks, with the effect of parcel size controlled. We observed highest intra-areal diversity in the superior temporal lobe, while lower diversity was observed in paralimbic cortex. By computing Spearman's correlation coefficient, we identified a significant correlation between intra-areal diversity and inter-areal diversity (rho = −0.49, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.603, −0.407]). This correlation remained significant when controlling for tSNR as a covariate (rho = −0.48, pspin = 0.001; Fig. 3C). No significant correlation was observed between intra-areal diversity across tasks and intra-areal dissimilarity in gradient profiles, however.

To assess robustness of our findings with respect to analysis parameters, we recalculated gradients, gradient profiles, as well as inter- and intra-areal gradient profile dissimilarity for each modality using different thresholds of the connectivity matrix (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%). Correlations between inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity derived from gradient profiles with different thresholds were assessed, revealing consistent results (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, we investigated the impact of varying the number of gradients within each modality, ranging from three to seven. Inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity was estimated, and consistent results were observed across different numbers (Supplementary Fig. 3). To assess the effect of using different parcellation atlases, the main results were replicated using the Glasser atlas3. This atlas is purely MRI-based, but aggregates information from different modalities and offers whole-cortex coverage. Again, consistent results were observed when using this atlas (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We assessed our findings at each of the ten individual participants who were scanned at 7 T. Similar results were found across all participants, including gradient profile matrices (Fig. 4A), and measures in inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, we observed marked negative correlations between inter-areal dissimilarity and the histological gradient (rho = −0.58 ± 0.047, ranged from −0.63 to −0.49, all pspin < 0.001), and between inter-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.53 ± 0.067, ranged from −0.64 to −0.45, all pspin < 0.001). Inter-areal dissimilarity across participants was highly correlated (r = 0.90 ± 0.008; Fig. 4B). Also, intra-areal dissimilarity across participants was highly correlated (r = 0.76 ± 0.007; Fig. 4C). Individual-level intra-areal dissimilarity was considerably lower compared to inter-areal dissimilarity, and no significant associations to the histological gradient or cross-task diversity were observed. To examine the effect of sex, we conducted sex-disaggregated analyzes on the main results and observed consistent findings across both male and female subgroups.

A For each of the 10 subjects, we generated gradient profiles and inter-/intra-areal dissimilarity. Associations between individual inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient, as well as cross-task diversity were examined using Spearman's correlation coefficients. B Associations between individual inter-areal dissimilarity were estimated using two-sided Pearson's correlation. Distributions of rho values between inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.58 ± 0.047; sample sizes n = 10, with 10 biological replicates), and with cross-task diversity were examined (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.53 ± 0.067; sample sizes n = 10, with 10 biological replicates). Box plots display the mean (center line = 50% of the group), interquartile range (box bounds = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). C Associations between individual intra-areal dissimilarity were estimated using two-sided Pearson's correlation. Distributions of rho values between inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.19 ± 0.051; n = 10, with 10 biological replicates), and with cross-task diversity were examined (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.21 ± 0.069; n = 10, with 10 biological replicates). Box plots display the mean (center line = 50% of the group), interquartile range (box bounds = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the IQR.

We conducted replication analysis based on 12 healthy young adults (age: 29.75 ± 4.75 years, 7 females) with one session scanned at 7 T. We observed consistent results as for the main findings (Supplementary Fig. 6), supporting reproducibility.

We conducted a second replication analysis in an independent sample of 100 healthy adults (age: 34.33 ± 4.07 years, 47 females) scanned at 3 T61. Results were consistent, with similar multimodal gradients, gradient profiles, and inter-areal dissimilarity (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B). Notably, associations with histological gradients (rho = −0.40, pspin < 0.001) and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.59, pspin < 0.001) remained consistent, albeit with slightly smaller effects as for the 7 T dataset. Again, we observed only a marginal association between intra-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.09, pspin > 0.1; Supplementary Fig. 7C), with no significant correlation found for histological gradients.

Functional specialization and integration are two cornerstones of neural organization67,68. While specialization relates to distinctive neural behavior across different contexts69, functional integration emphasizes the shared influence among regions, ultimately contributing to coherent experiences and behavior69,70. The present study combined multimodal MRI acquisitions with robust areal descriptions of cortical cytoarchitecture19, in order to identify the similarity and divergence of inter-areal gradient fingerprints. Vertex-wise multimodal connectomes were constructed from high-field 7 T MRI data, and cortical gradients were estimated, aligning with those described in prior studies22,23,59. We noted higher inter-areal dissimilarity in sensorimotor cortices and lower inter-areal dissimilarity in the transmodal system, indicating the distinctiveness of the primary sensory cortex as a functionally specialized system. Additionally, functional connectivity in the primary cortex exhibited less variability across tasks, suggesting that information processing from different tasks may converge at early stages. Significant associations were identified between cross-task functional diversity and inter-areal gradient profile dissimilarity, indicating a link between global cortical motifs and functional flexibility across different task contexts. These findings suggest a sensory-paralimbic differentiation in cortical gradient profiles, providing insights into neural motifs contributing to specialized and integrative brain function.

The availability of multimodal neuroimaging data offers opportunities for examining brain organization across different spatial scales12,41,42. In this work, we leveraged repeated MRI scanning at ultra-high fields of 7 T, which we hypothesized would result in high signal71, reliability, and precision53,54,55,56,57. The first principal component of our estimated multimodal gradient profiles demonstrated that sensory-functional axes jointly guide hierarchical patterns of cortical microstructure, structure, and function. Our work presents a converging overarching principle, extending prior work that has focused on specific modalities in isolation22,23,72. These findings suggested a convergence of organizational principles across different scales and at the level of structure and function. Notably, and in addition to harnessing a multimodal imaging approach, we leveraged a recently disseminated atlas derived from post-mortem histological data to finely partition the brain into distinct areas based on cytoarchitecture, a presumed gold standard for cortical mapping19. Our work, thereby, integrated dimensional gradient and area-based descriptions of macroscale cortical spatial patterns, providing a unified framework for understanding the cortical layout. This framework could identify key principles of between- and within-parcel heterogeneity, distinguish different zones across the cortical hierarchy, and reveal associations between these heterogeneity patterns and cross-task diversity. Given that the gradient profiles in our study represent vectors in a multidimensional space, we then measured the distance between all cortical areas using a cosine distance metric. As expected, we observed an overarching pattern of inter-areal dissimilarity, with one end featuring sensory and motor cortices that had the highest dissimilarity and the other end encompassing heteromodal and paralimbic areas in the transmodal apex. This suggests that functional specialization in primary sensorimotor areas is accompanied by a more distinctive organization pattern. Reliability analyzes indicated that this inter-areal pattern was not influenced by potential methodological biases, including the B1+ field map, SNR of diffusion data, or CNR of T1 data. While tSNR was correlated with inter-areal dissimilarity, the correlation between inter-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity remained significant even after controlling for tSNR. Overall, the axis of inter-areal dissimilarity is consistent with the gradients previously reported for single modalities that are, especially at the level of function and microstructure, also anchored in primary systems on the one end, and heteromodal and paralimbic regions on the other end22,23. Tract-tracing and neuroimaging experiments have documented that primary sensory and motor cortices host more short-range cortico-cortical connections than transmodal systems60, and these regions also tend to have a higher coupling between microstructure and function, and between structural connectivity and function27. Such findings are potentially in support of their more specialized functional profiles60,73. Notably, the pattern of cortical organization within the limbic system closely aligns with that of other cortical areas, extending previous findings derived from single modalities22,23,72,73. For instance, the paralimbic system with more long-distance connections was reported to have higher microstructural similarity60. Similarly, another study combining structural and functional connections revealed that less diverse unimodal regions show a preference for local communication, while more diverse multimodal regions engage in more global communication patterns74. Indeed, the degree of laminar differentiation also varies gradually across the cortex, reflecting the specialization of underlying cortical microcircuits75,76. It is highest in primary areas, such as the visual and somatosensory cortices, and then decreases in unimodal and heteromodal regions, to reach its lowest level in agranular areas7,77. Projection patterns similarly follow this gradient78,79,80. Together, these organizational patterns, spanning from the microscale to the macroscale, may support the integrative role of the limbic system, enabling it to participate in various cognitive processes81. However, it is important to note that no significant associations were observed between PC63 and either inter-areal dissimilarity or cross-task functional diversity, suggesting a more complex relationship between cortical heterogeneity, functional diversity, and different indices of macroscale functional integration.

Distance-dependence theory suggests that proximal regions are more likely to be inter-connected82,83. In addition, those areas sharing similar microstructural and neurobiological characteristics are also more likely to be interconnected than regions with distinct features78,84,85. These findings support the overarching idea that adjacent regions with short-range connections often share gene expression and microstructural similarities, contributing to their specialized functional roles. Conversely, while nearby neurons are expected to share similar microstructural properties when extending smooth macroscale topography to the microscale86, prior electrophysiological experiments in various mammalian brain regions have shown that nearby neurons can exhibit disparate response properties87,88,89,90. By examining intra-areal dissimilarity in gradient motifs in the current study, we furthermore probed intra-regional consistency vs heterogeneity in neural organization. Overall, intra-areal gradient profile divergence was relatively low compared to inter-areal divergences, confirming the utility of areal parcellations to meaningfully subdivide the cortex more generally56,91. Notably, although there was no clear difference in intra-areal dissimilarity between networks, we observed a trend towards increased dissimilarity within the unimodal and heteromodal cortices. We speculate that this may be related to their more integrative functional role and increased functional flexibility compared to primary sensory and motor areas, which deserves further verification in future work. Meanwhile, the potential effects of region size should also be considered, as larger regions are more likely to exhibit higher intra-region dissimilarity. Moreover, and in contrast to the inter-areal findings, we did not observe noteworthy associations between intra-areal variations and functional and microstructural indices of the cortical hierarchy. We speculate that intra-regional heterogeneity can support the processing and integration of inputs across a given cortical territory76. That is, for disparate types of information to be integrated, they must at minimum be present in the same brain regions. Moreover, these findings are aligned with the tethering hypothesis of cortical patterning, where a disproportionate enlargement of uni- and heteromodal systems during human evolution and the progressive decrease of genetically mediated signaling gradients may have contributed to their higher intra-areal dissimilarity and relative structure-function decoupling30,92.

There is growing evidence for flexibility in the functional organization of the cortex, even within a relatively fixed structural and cytoarchitectural layout38,39,40,93. For instance, recent studies found that functional activation and connectivity change in certain areas in the same individual across different tasks38,39,93. Another study found that graph theory measures such as clustering coefficient and nodal degree can change significantly when comparing the same subjects across different task conditions40. To explore this further, we investigated the inter and intra-areal functional diversity across different fMRI tasks in the same participants. Multiple patterns of inter-areal functional diversity were found in association cortices, consistent with prior studies39, where cortical regions specialized for the same functions were strongly coupled. However, high diversity was found in functionally flexible regions that participated in multiple functions, supporting their role in integrating specialized brain networks39. We also found a negative correlation between cross-task functional diversity and inter-areal dissimilarity, suggesting that globally more specialized regions, such as sensorimotor and visual cortices, exhibit more stable functional connectivity patterns across tasks. A recent study reported that functional connectivity in somatomotor cortex increased with age during childhood through adolescence, whereas it declined in association cortices, reinforcing the differentiation of sensorimotor and association systems in typical development94. These findings support the existence of a sensorimotor-association axis of cortical organization8,22, and may explain higher stability of functional connectivity in sensorimotor cortex across tasks. For intra-areal cross-task diversity, we identified a specific axis, indicating relatively stable patterns in primary sensory and paralimbic cortices. Interestingly, paralimbic areas exhibited the least intra-areal dissimilarity compared to other cortical regions, showing higher inter-areal diversity but lower intra-areal diversity in functional connectivity across tasks. This may be due to the involvement of these regions in a wide range of cognitive and affective processes81,95. Prior findings suggest that paralimbic cortices with a simple laminar structure are well suited to integrate a neural “workspace” for a unified conscious experience due to their position in cortical hierarchies and their connectivity96. We inferred that the low intra-areal diversity in paralimbic cortices across tasks is due to their relatively simple local connectivity structure. However, the interaction patterns between the paralimbic cortices and other brain regions are dynamic, adapting to integrate different sensory inputs and meet various cognitive demands when performing different tasks96,97. Collectively, these findings suggest that the heterogeneity in global and local cortical motifs across different regions is reflected in their diverse participation across different functional contexts. A series of robustness analyzes, exploring the influence of thresholds for gradient estimation and the number of gradients, yielded similar results, suggesting that our analyzes was not affected by variations in specific analysis parameters. Moreover, we observed consistent findings at the level of individual participants and could replicate our findings using an independent dataset of healthy participants scanned at 3 T. Nevertheless, future studies could explore additional sources of variability, both between participants and within the same participant over time, which may arise from individual differences and temporal factors98. In this study, we focus on structure-function relationships within areas with similar cytoarchitecture and how these relationships differ between areas. Using the Julich-Brain atlas offers significant benefits because it is based on ground-truth cytoarchitecture. However, a potential limitation is its lack of coverage of the entire cortex. This limitation is anticipated to be addressed with the future publication of the whole-brain probabilistic map, currently under development19. To mitigate this issue in the current work, we replicated our main analyzes using the Glasser atlas and found consistent results. As our work shows, cortical parcellation and gradient descriptions provide synergistic information to understand human brain organization. By thus reconciling local and global cortical patterns, our work provides insights into the neuroanatomical basis of specialized and integrative cortical functions.

Our study was based on three independent human neuroimaging datasets. A 7 T dataset (MICA-PNI, 10 subjects, multiple time points) was for the main analysis and cross-subject reliability assessment. A 7 T dataset (MICA-7T, 12 subjects, one time point) was used for replication analysis. A 3 T dataset (MICA-MICs, 100 subjects, one time point) was used for replication. Sex was determined through self-reporting by participants and was considered in the study design. To minimize potential biases, we aimed to collect an equal amount of data from both male and female participants.

For our main analysis, we investigated the imaging and phenotypic data of 10 unrelated healthy adults (age: 29.20 ± 5.20 years, 5 females). Each participant underwent three sessions on separate days. Data were collected between March 2022 and June 2023. This dataset is openly available at the OSF platform (https://osf.io/mhq3f/).

This dataset consisted of 12 unrelated healthy young adults (age: 29.75 ± 4.75 years, 7 females). Data were collected between May 2023 and May 2024.

This dataset consisted of 100 unrelated healthy young adults (age: 34.33 ± 4.07 years, 47 females). Data were collected between April 2018 and February 2021. A subset of 50 participants is openly available (https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/mica-mics)61.

The studies were approved by the Ethics Committees of McGill University and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, respectively, and written and informed consent were obtained from all participants. In addition, participants were compensated financially for each MRI scanning session attended as reimbursement for their time and participation.

MP2RAGE is acquires two 3D images with different inversion times (TI) to generate a myelin-sensitive map of the T1 relaxation times and a synthetic T1-weighted (T1w) image. The 3D MP2RAGE sequence parameters are the following: 0.5 mm isovoxels, matrix = 320 × 320, 320 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR) = 5170 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.44 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 4°, iPAT = 3, TI1 = 1000 ms, TI2 = 3200 ms, bandwidth = 210 Hz/px, echo spacing = 7.8 ms, and partial Fourier = 6/8. Scans were visually inspected to ensure minimal head motion, and repeated if necessary. Both inversion images were combined for T1 mapping and to minimize sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities99,100.

DWI data was acquired using a multiband accelerated 2D spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. The acquisition included three shells with b-values of 300, 700, and 2000 s/mm2, and 10, 40, and 90 diffusion weighting directions per shell, respectively. The parameters used were: 1.1 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 7383 ms, TE = 70.60 ms, flip angle = 90°, refocusing flip angle = 180°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.1 mm, multi-band factor = 2. Reverse phase encoding b0 images were obtained for distortion correction of the DWI scans.

All multi-echo fMRI were acquired with a 2D blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging sequence. The parameters were as follows: 1.9 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 1690 ms, TE1 = 10.8 ms, TE2 = 27.3 ms, TE3 = 43.8 ms, flip angle = 67°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.9 mm, multiband factor = 3, and echo spacing = 0.53 ms. During the 6-min rs-fMRI scan, participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, fixate on a cross presented on the screen, and not think of anything. Two spin-echo images with opposite phase encoding directions were also acquired for distortion correction of the rs-fMRI scans, with the following parameters: phase encoding = AP/PA, 1.9 mm isovoxels, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.9 mm, TR = 3000 ms, TE = 18.4 ms, flip angle = 90°. Based on a validated open-source protocol101, we collected multiple task fMRI scans, including episodic encoding/retrieval and semantic tasks, as well as the MST, which both lasted ~6 min. During the episodic memory encoding, participants memorized paired images of objects. In the retrieval phase, participants were shown an image and asked to identify the paired object from three options. Semantic memory retrieval involved identifying the object that is most conceptually related to a target image from three options. In all memory tasks, there were 56 trials, and the difficulty was modulated based on semantic relatedness scores102. During the MST, participants determined whether the object in images was indoor or outdoor, and then identified whether the object shown in images was old, similar, or new. We also collected fMRI data while participants watched movies, tracking hemodynamic activity during naturalistic viewing conditions103. A detailed imaging protocol is provided in the data release (https://osf.io/mhq3f/), including the complete list of acquisition parameters.

Two T1w scans with identical parameters were acquired with a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (0.8 mm isovoxels, matrix = 320 × 320, 224 sagittal slices, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3.14 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, iPAT = 2). Scans were visually examined to ensure minimal head motion, and repeated if necessary.

qT1 relaxometry data was acquired using a 3D-MP2RAGE sequence (0.8 mm isovoxels, 240 sagittal slices, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, TI 1 = 940 ms, T1 2 = 2830 ms, flip angle = 4°, flip angle 2 = 5°, iPAT = 3, bandwidth = 270 Hz/px, echo spacing = 7.2 ms, partial Fourier = 6/8). Both inversion images were combined for qT1 mapping to minimize sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities and optimize intra- and inter-subject reliability99,100.

DWI data was acquired using a 2D spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence, consisting of three shells with b-values = 300, 700, and 2000 s/mm2, and with 10, 40, and 90 diffusion weighting directions per shell, respectively (1.6 mm isovoxels, TR = 3500 ms, TE = 64.40 ms, flip angle = 90°, refocusing flip angle = 180°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.6 mm, multi-band factor = 3, echo spacing = 0.76 ms). b0 images acquired in reverse phase encoding direction were used for distortion correction of DWI scans.

A 7-min rs-fMRI scan was acquired using multiband accelerated 2D-BOLD echo-planar imaging (3 mm isovoxels, TR = 600 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 52°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, mb factor = 6, echo spacing = 0.54 ms). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, not fall asleep, and look at a fixation cross. Two spin-echo images with reverse phase encoding were also included for distortion correction of the rs-fMRI scans (phase encoding = AP/PA, 3 mm isovoxels, TR = 4029 ms, TE = 48 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, echo spacing = 0.54 ms, bandwidth = 2084 Hz/Px).

The MP2RAGE scans of each subject were reoriented using FSL104, linearly co-registered, averaged, with background noise removed, corrected for intensity nonuniformity using N4 bias field correction from ANTS105, and segmented into white and gray matter using FSL FAST104. Resulting volumes were skull stripped using FSL104,106. Cortical surface models were generated from native T1w scans using FastSurfer107. Surface reconstructions for each subject underwent manual correction for segmentation errors, by placing control points and applying manual edits. The B1+ field map and the CNR of the T1 map were calculated for each participant to assess reliability.

Regarding the DWI data, pre-processing was carried out using MRtrix108 in the native DWI space. The DWI data underwent denoising109,110, b0 intensity normalization, and correction for susceptibility distortion, head motion, and eddy currents. These corrections were performed using FSL111 and involved utilizing two b = 0 s/mm2 volumes with reverse phase encoding. Anatomical masks for tractography were non-linearly co-registered to native DWI space using the deformable SyN approach implemented in ANTs112. We computed the mean and standard deviation maps of the b0 images. For each participant, voxel-wise SNR maps were generated by dividing the mean map by the standard deviation map. These SNR maps were subsequently projected onto the fsLR-5k surface.

For the rs-fMRI scans, pre-processing steps were conducted using AFNI113 and FSL104 tools. The first five volumes were discarded to ensure magnetic field saturation. We applied Multi-Echo Independent Components Analysis114,115 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and effect of motion correction. Spike regression was applied to remove timepoints with large motion spikes, effectively removing nuisance signals116,117. The volume time series were registered to FastSurfer107 space using boundary-based registration implemented in ANTs using linear and non-linear methods118. The tSNR maps were estimated for each participant.

The surface reconstructions for each subject underwent manual inspection and correction for segmentation errors by placing control points and applying manual edits. The qT1 scans were linearly co-registered to the corresponding subject's T1w scan.

The volume time series were registered to FastSurfer107 space using boundary-based registration implemented in ANTs using linear and non-linear methods118.

To investigate the vertex-wise multimodal connectomes, we first constructed a downsampled fsLR-5k surface using HCP's workbench tools (wb_command)120. The fsLR-32k surface templates and resampling spheres between “fsaverage” and “fs_LR” were accessed from the HCP's open-access pipeline121. Subsequently, we downsampled the surface template, registration spheres, and mid-wall mask to 5k, resulting in a mesh comprising 4432 cortical vertices for each hemisphere. All vertex-wise analyzes were performed based on this fsLR-5k surface.

We calculated vertex-wise MPC matrices for each participant. Consistent with previous work23,122,123, we constructed 14 equivolumetric surfaces between the pial and white matter boundaries to sample qT1 intensities across cortical depths. This procedure generated distinct intensity profiles reflecting intracortical microstructural composition at each cortical vertex. Data sampled from surfaces closest to the pial and white matter boundaries were removed to mitigate partial volume effects. Intensity values at each depth were mapped to a common template surface, resampled to fsLR-5k surface, and spatially smoothed across each surface independently (full width at half maximum [FWHM] = 3 mm). Vertex-wise intensity profiles were cross-correlated using partial correlations controlling for the average cortex-wide intensity profile and log-transformed. This procedure resulted in the MPC matrices representing participant-specific similarity in myelin proxies across the cortex.

To generate each individual's SC, we employed MRtrix on pre-processed DWI data108. Each surface vertex from the fsLR-5k surface was translated into a volumetric region of interest that filled the cortical ribbon using workbench tools120. This process yielded ~10 k seeds/targets for structural connectome generation. Anatomical segmentations and volumetric seeds were then mapped to DWI space, applying the non-linear registration warp-field mentioned earlier. Next, we estimated multi-shell and multi-tissue response functions124 and performed constrained spherical deconvolution to derive a fiber orientation distribution map125,126. This procedure, achieved through MRtrix, generated a tractogram with 40 M streamlines, with a maximum tract length of 250 mm and a fractional anisotropy cutoff of 0.06. To reconstruct whole-brain streamlines weighted by cross-sectional multipliers127, we applied spherical deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2). Connection weights between seeds/targets were defined as the streamline count after SIFT2.

Next, individual rs-fMRI timeseries mapped to subject-specific surface models were resampled to fsLR-5k surface. Surface-based rf-MRI data underwent spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 3 mm). An individual's FC matrix was generated by cross-correlating all vertex-wise timeseries. Correlation values subsequently underwent Fisher-R-to-Z transformations. FC matrices of all task fMRI scans were also generated using the same approach.

We converted each participant's SC, MPC, and FC matrices to a normalized angle affinity matrix, respectively, and applied diffusion map embedding on these matrices to generate multimodal gradients128. This non-linear dimensionality reduction procedure identified eigenvectors that describe main spatial axes of variance. Procrustes analysis aligned subject-level gradients to a group-level template generated from the group-average matrix of all participants. Gradients of the right hemisphere were aligned to the left hemisphere. Gradient analyzes were performed using BrainSpace (v0.1.10; http://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace), limiting the number of gradients to 10 and using default sparsity (keeping the top 10% of SC weights) and diffusion (α = 0.5) parameters129. Here, we focused on the first five principal gradients of each modality (Fig. 1A). For each modality, all gradients were normalized by dividing by the maximum value in the absolute value of gradients, with values ranging from −1.0 to 1.0.

The Julich-Brain is a 3D probabilistic atlas of the human brain's cytoarchitecture, resulting from the analysis of 10 post-mortem human brains19 (Fig. 1B). The probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps (Julich-Brain v2.9, https://julich-brain-atlas.de/) were projected onto a template fsLR-5k surface to generate a surface-based representation19. Surface-based probabilistic maps contained values indicating the probability of an area being localized in each voxel, ranging from 0% to 100% overlap, with values ranging from 0 to 1. We registered the probabilistic maps to the fsLR-5k surface template. For each vertex, we defined its area label by identifying the area with the highest probability at that position. This area label was then used to assign all vertices on the fsLR-5k surface to the 228 areas defined by the Julich-Brain.

Understanding the relationships between diverse brain regions, including their similarities and differences, is essential for investigating the spatial patterns of brain organization. In this study, we focus on exploring inter-areal heterogeneity and homogeneity to further reveal the global layout of cortical area. To quantify inter-areal heterogeneity, we computed the inter-areal dissimilarity for each area. Specifically, we calculated the cosine distance between gradient profiles of each area, resulting in a cosine distance matrix (Fig. 2A). The inter-areal dissimilarity was defined as the mean of each row in the cosine distance matrix, representing the distance between an area and all other areas. To identify cortical regions with significantly higher or lower inter-areal dissimilarity, we projected the inter-areal dissimilarity map onto a sphere and conducted 1000 spin permutation tests. An area was considered to have the highest inter-areal dissimilarity among the cortex if its original inter-areal dissimilarity value exceeded 97.5% of the permutation values. Conversely, an area was regarded as having the lowest inter-areal dissimilarity if its original value was lower than 97.5% of the permutation values. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied the FDR correction. To further investigate patterns of inter-areal dissimilarity, we conducted a network-level analysis utilizing the scheme proposed by Mesulam64, which delineates four cortical functional zones (i.e., idiotypic, paralimbic, unimodal, heteromodal; see Fig. 2B). Inter-areal dissimilarity between each pair of cortical hierarchies was compared using a two-sample t-test. FDR corrections were applied to correct for multiple comparisons, while spatial autocorrelation spin permutation tests were conducted for all tests. In order to explore the associations between inter-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructural hierarchy, we generated a MPC matrix based on histological data from BigBrain65, an ultrahigh-resolution 3D human brain model. From this matrix, we estimated the principal histological gradient as a representation of microstructural hierarchy. To examine the associations between the histological gradient and inter-areal dissimilarity, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient, with p-values corrected using 1000 spin permutation tests. To investigate the relationship between inter-areal dissimilarity and functional integration patterns, we calculated the PC63 using four cortical hierarchical levels64 as communities. Additionally, we estimated global FC strength by averaging the FC values for each region.

Differences between cortical regions are crucial to functional specialization, but at the same time, similarities between regions support the realization of higher-order cognitive functions and functional integration across brain regions. To assess the homogeneity of cortical areas, we calculated (1-cosine distance) to represent the similarity between regional gradient profiles, resulting in an affinity matrix (Supplementary Fig. 1A). To evaluate the association between inter-areal similarity and cortical hierarchy, we examined the distribution of similarity coefficients across four hierarchy levels. To identify cortical areas with higher similarity, we performed hierarchical clustering on the affinity matrix to detect groups among the areas. We evaluated the clustering performance by calculating criterion values to determine the optimal number of clusters. We scrutinized the clusters with the highest criterion value and assessed the distribution of cortical hierarchies within each cluster to investigate the association between inter-areal homogeneity and cortical laminar differentiation.

Functional segregation of distinct regions is a critical principle of the human brain. It is thus important to investigate the local organization, i.e., the layout within an area to provide insights into the wiring principle of the cortex. Given that each area was originally defined based on shared neuroanatomical features, we expect to find overall high intra-areal homogeneity. Here we quantified, however, to what extent the level of homogeneity varies across the brain. We assessed inter-areal dissimilarity at both the region-level and network-level. As previously described, we calculated the gradient profiles for each area by averaging the vertex-wise gradients within that area. For a given area i, we calculated the cosine distance between the vertex-wise multimodal gradients and gradient profile of area i, resulting in the generation of intra-areal dissimilarity of area i (Fig. 2C). This procedure was repeated for all areas, yielding the vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity map.

To visualize the patterns of intra-areal heterogeneity more effectively, we calculated the average vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity within each area. By controlling for the number of vertices within each area, we accounted for the effect of area size. Furthermore, we investigated the intra-areal dissimilarity at the network-level using the four cortical hierarchies proposed in a previous study64. We examined the distribution of intra-areal dissimilarity within these four cortical hierarchies and compared the differences between each hierarchy using a two-sample t-test with FDR correction and spatial autocorrelation spin permutation tests. To investigate associations between intra-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructural hierarchy, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient between the histological gradient and intra-areal dissimilarity, correcting the p value using 1000 spin permutation tests.

To explore patterns of functional diversity across tasks, we constructed vertex-wise FC matrices by cross-correlating timeseries data derived from multiple task fMRI sessions. The cosine distance between each vertex from different tasks was then computed, resulting in a cross-task diversity matrix (Fig. 3A). To quantify the cross-task diversity for a specific task, we averaged all distance values between that task and others. This process was repeated for all tasks, and the outcomes were mapped to areas, generating area-wise cross-task diversity for each task. Focusing on overall diversity, we calculated the average of values across all tasks to create the cross-task diversity map (Fig. 3B). To investigate associations between cross-task diversity and inter-/intra-areal dissimilarity, we computed Spearman's correlation coefficient. The resulting p values were corrected for spatial autocorrelations using 1000 spin permutation tests.

To further investigate how intra-areal FC patterns change with tasks, we estimated the intra-areal cross-task diversity. For each area, we calculated the mean of FC strength between each vertex v to other vertices within a. We repeated this process for all tasks t and estimated the standard deviation across tasks (Fig. 3C). We summed all vertex-wise standard deviation values within the area and divided it by the number of vertices in this area to control for the effect of parcel size. We examined the correlation between intra- and inter-areal cross-task diversity by computing Spearman's correlation coefficient, controlling tSNR as a covariate, and controlling for the spatial autocorrelation using 1000 spin permutation tests.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Apple May Shift to Making US iPhones in India. It Won't Be Easy","https://www.wired.com/story/apple-may-shift-to-making-us-iphones-in-india-it-wont-be-easy/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:53:05 GMT","

According to the Financial Times, which cites sources “familiar with the matter,” Apple plans to assemble in India all iPhones intended for the US by the end of 2026. The majority of Apple's iPhones are currently made in China, but Chinese-made products have become a toxic asset for US import.

The US government has imposed a 145 percent tariff on goods from China. While smartphones are included in a 90-day reprieve, announced in early April, President Trump has indicated this exclusion is indeed a temporary one. Ready to pay $2,949 for a base storage iPhone 17 Pro Max?

Apple's supposed shifting of its manufacturing to India is an insurance policy against such chaos in the future, but it did not begin here. In December 2024, we wrote about Apple's growing reliance on India for manufacturing as a bulwark against growing US-China tensions.

Indian production of iPhones commenced in 2017, starting with the lower-cost iPhone SE. The country began producing flagship-model launch iPhones in 2023.

Despite being the better part of a decade into Indian iPhone manufacturing, this latest alleged shift in strategy still represents a very costly turbocharging of its efforts—and likely at least a doubling of output from Apple's Indian production plants. WIRED approached Apple for comment, but had not received a response at time of publishing.

“Our estimates say that Apple produced around 40 to 43 million [iPhones] in India last year,” says Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. “About 12 or 13 million were consumed in the India market entirely, and the rest were exported out.”

More than 60 million iPhones are sold in the US each year, where the series commands a 57 percent smartphone market share, according to some estimates. ""So about 80 to 85 million [iPhones] they will need to produce in India,” says Singh, should Apple want to satisfy US demand at current levels while also serving local Indian market demand.

This expansion does not solely rely on Apple's investments. As in all of Apple's major production efforts, any Indian expansion will involve partners, primarily Tata Electronics, Foxconn, and Pegatron.

“Tata is completely running at capacity right now,” says Singh. Tata is the primary force behind Indian iPhone manufacture at present. It operates an assembly plant in Tamil Nadu, in the country's south. It acquired Wistron's iPhone-manufacturing Karnataka facility in 2023 and, in January 2025, closed on a majority 60 percent stake in Taiwanese company Pegatron's Indian operation.

This in turn represents a consolidation of Indian iPhone production being stewarded by an Indian company, Tata Electronics. Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron are all Taiwanese companies, despite their global reach and importance.

Apple's Tata-led production has not been entirely smooth. In 2023, Tata's Hosur factory, which produced iPhone casings, reportedly had a yield rate of just 50 percent, with half of the components failing Apple's rigorous quality checks. This is a very low yield rate, and it highlights the importance of a skilled and efficient manufacturing operation.

“There just isn't a sense of urgency,” a former Apple engineer told the Financial Times, speaking on Apple's Indian operations in 2023. Apple's 2025–2026 increase in Indian manufacturing will be a test of whether that situation has changed and by how much.

And despite this expansion being an effort to partially extricate Apple from its reliance on China, the expansion itself will rely heavily on Chinese workers. “You need the expertise from China,” says Singh. “Chinese engineers and other people, they have to come and setup the [production] lines.”

But this in turn could become a roadblock for Apple, if the Chinese government looks unfavorably on the company's accelerating shift toward India. “I think the geopolitical pressures between India and China is the only limiting factor,” says Singh.

One reason China may not object is the nature of the production going on in India. At Apple's Indian facilities, iPhone casings are made, and iPhones are assembled from already produced components.

This is not the highest value, the highest tech, form of manufacturing, the pinnacle of which—in consumer technology at least—is semiconductor fabrication. That's the creation of processor chips. The Apple A18 series chipsets found in the iPhone 16 family devices are made by Taiwan's TSMC, one of the most important companies in the world.

But the prospect of phone chipsets being produced in India remains a far-away one. “That's another five to 10 years away,” says Singh, of Indian semiconductor fabrication. “That's not a near-future thing. It's a medium- to longer-term kind of thing … They've already started, but it will take some time. So majority of the high-value components will still come from China.”

Shifting iPhone assembly to India is a solution to Apple's tariff problem, but it is not a solution to Apple's China problem. And it might be argued that that problem only truly begins if China invades Taiwan.

While TSMC operates fabrication plants in Japan, China, and the US (in Arizona) alongside its many Taiwan locations, the Taiwanese government has asserted the most advanced fabrication technology will stay within Taiwan. This is yet another point of geopolitical tension, though. Previously, TSMC's fabricators outside of the country were only permitted to produce chipsets two generations behind the latest. However, in January 2025, Taiwan's minister of economic affairs, J.W. Kuo, loosened restrictions in this area.

“Private businesses should make their own business decisions based on their own technological progress,” Kuo said, following the announcement of plans to build a 2-nanometer chipset fabrication plant in the US, representing an investment of up to $30 billion in the US market by TSMC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Meta Trial Shows the Dangers of Selling Out","https://www.wired.com/story/the-meta-trial-shows-the-dangers-of-selling-out/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Meta has a lot at stake in the current FTC lawsuit against it. In theory a negative verdict could result in a company breakup. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg once faced an even bigger existential threat. Back in 2006, his investors and even his employees were pressuring him to sell his two-year-old startup for a quick payoff. Facebook was still a college-based social network, and several companies were interested in buying it. The most serious offer came from Yahoo, which offered a stunning $1 billion. Zuckerberg, though, believed he could grow the company into something worth much more. The pressure was tremendous, and at one point he blinked, agreeing in principle to sell. But immediately after that, a dip in Yahoo stock led its leader at the time, Terry Semel, to ask for a price adjustment. Zuckerberg seized the opportunity to shut down negotiations; Facebook would remain in his hands.

“That was by far the most stressful time in my life,” Zuckerberg told me years later. So it's ironic to observe, through the testimony of this trial, how he treated two other sets of founders in very similar situations to him—but whom he successfully bought out.

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

The nub of the current FTC trial seems to hinge on how US District Court judge James Boasberg will define Meta's market—whether it's limited to social media or, as Meta is arguing, the broader field of “entertainment.” But much of the early testimony exhumed the details of Zuckerberg's successful pursuit of Instagram and WhatsApp—two companies that, according to the government, are now part of Meta's illegal monopolistic grip on social media. (The trial also invoked the case of Snap, which resisted Zuckerberg's $6 billion offer and had to deal with Facebook copying its products.) Legalities aside, the way these companies were upended by a Zuckerberg offer made the first few days of this case a dramatic and instructive study of acquisition dynamics between small and big business.

Though almost all of these narratives have been covered at length over the years—I documented them pretty thoroughly in my own 2020 account Facebook: The Inside Story—it was striking to see the principals testifying under oath about what happened. Hey, my sources were pretty good, but I didn't get to swear them in!

In their testimony, star witnesses Zuckerberg and Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom agreed on facts, but their interpretations were Mars and Venus. In 2012, Instagram was about to close a $500 million investment round, when suddenly the tiny company found itself in play, with Facebook in hot pursuit. In an email at the time, Facebook's CFO asked Zuckerberg if his goal was to “neutralize a potential competitor.” The answer was affirmative. That was not the way he pitched it to Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger. Zuckerberg promised the cofounders they would control Instagram and could grow it their way. They would have the best of both worlds—independence and Facebook's huge resources. Oh, and Facebook's $1 billion offer was double the valuation of the company in the funding round it was about to close.

Everything worked great for a few years, but then Zuckerberg began denying resources to Instagram, which its cofounders had built into a juggernaut. Systrom testified that Zuckerberg seemed envious of Instagram's success and cultural currency, saying that his boss “believed we were hurting Facebook's growth.” Zuckerberg's snubs ultimately drove Instagram's founders to leave in 2018. By that time, Instagram was arguably worth perhaps 100 times Zuckerberg's purchase price. Systrom and Krieger's spoils, though considerable, did not reflect the fantastic value they had built for Facebook.

The founders of WhatsApp did reap a stratospheric buyout, because in 2014 Zuckerberg threw $19 billion to acquire their then tiny operation. But, as told through testimony of some of its executives and funders, the acquisition hinged on promises that cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum would retain control. The WhatsApp cofounders hated advertising and were adamant that no ads should ever appear on their service. But documents introduced in the trial indicated that Facebook was basing its valuation on the premise that WhatsApp would be monetized, apparently with those despised ads. The founders left in 2018, when it became clear that Zuckerberg was calling the shots. “I espoused a certain set of principles, even publicly, to my users, and I said, Look, we are not gonna sell your data, we are not going to sell you ads, and I turned around and sold my company,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. His penance for this “crime,” he told me, was spending $50 million to create the Signal Foundation.

Though these founders were pressured to sell, there weren't literal guns to their heads—and they did cash out in exchange for pursuing their dreams. So we shouldn't feel too sorry for them. But lately people in Silicon Valley have been chattering about startup guru Paul Graham's “Founder Mode” theory, which assumes that the person most responsible for creating a company is the best one to run it—and that the world itself benefits from such people. Zuckerberg, of course, is an iconic founder. But the trial is revealing a narrative beyond the FTC's legal argument about anticompetitive acquisitions: Zuckerberg's penchant for snuffing out founders to advance his own goals.

Of course, sometimes founders are well advised to take the money and run. Consider the case of Clubhouse, the audio-based social networking product that exploded during the pandemic. Its founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, fended off multiple suitors, including a rumored $4 billion offer from Twitter. But after the pandemic—and some poor strategic choices—the service deflated like a punctured balloon. In 2023 it laid off half of its staff. On the other hand, it's still around, and at least in one of its recent town halls, Davison still seemed to be having fun.

One question that Mark Zuckerberg did not have to answer during his testimony was how he viewed his own transition from prey to predator. But I did pose that question to him during my book research. We were discussing the mental anguish he suffered during the 2006 crisis. Zuckerberg told me that he often advises young founders not to give in to pressure. This advice, of course, was not offered to those running companies he wanted to buy. So I asked him directly—given his lesson from the Yahoo experience, did Systrom and Krieger make a mistake by selling to him?

There was a long pause, not an uncommon phenomenon when Zuckerberg considers a question where a candid answer might put him in a damning position. Finally he gave a response that dodged the issue, saying that Instagram could never have reached its heights without Facebook's support. He said pretty much the same thing in court this month. On a legal basis, Meta will not be judged on how he bought off the dreams of founders, but whether he gamed the marketplace through his purchases. No judge will rule on the calculus of selling off a dream.

In Kevin Systrom's testimony, he opined that Zuckerberg denied resources to Instagram in part out of jealousy. The photo-sharing app, which he didn't invent, was growing faster than Facebook's blue app, a Mark Zuckerberg Production. When reporting Facebook: The Inside Story, I became familiar with this tension and put it to Zuckerberg: Was he in fact jealous of the Instagram team?

“Jealous…” he repeated.

Yes, I said. And that you would prefer growth of Facebook's Blue app to Instagram's?

He said no, and explained to me how he thought about it. Early on … it made sense to leave the founders alone and let them build their best products. “That was incredibly successful,” he says. “And it made sense for the first five years. But now we're at the point where all the products are big and important. I don't want to build just multiple versions of the same product. We should have a more coherent and integrated product strategy.”

And if that meant losing founders, so be it. “I can understand if you're an entrepreneur who built one of those things and had awesome success, you'd wake up and say, ‘Okay, I'm proud of what I did, but this isn't for me going forward.' That's how I see it, and we're going in the right direction.” Those close to Kevin Systrom, though, believe that had Zuckerberg not asserted control, he would have remained at Instagram for 20 more years.

Jim asks, “What was it like interviewing some of the pioneers of modern-day computing for Hackers?”

Thanks for the question, Jim. You are asking me to access the feelings I had over 40 years ago when I was talking first-hand to people who are now legends. But in the circles I traveled they were virtually unknown, even computer science pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. And to my knowledge no reporter had documented the world of MIT hackers, who pretty much invented computer culture.

I do recall as the interviews accumulated, I came to realize that the story I was telling was significant and would have continuing relevance. Also, some of them outright stretched my mind. These people were so interesting that after the book was published I kept talking to computer folk. I still am.

Amidst the chaos and upheaval at the Social Security Administration (SSA) caused by Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), employees have now been asked to integrate the use of a generative AI chatbot into their daily work.

But before any of them can use it, they all need to watch a four-minute training video featuring an animated, four-fingered woman crudely drawn in a style that would not look out of place on websites created in the early part of this century.

Aside from the Web 1.0-era graphics employed, the video also fails at its primary purpose of informing SSA staff about one of the most important aspects of using the chatbot: Do not use any personally identifiable information (PII) when using the assistant.

There is nothing wrong with your speakers; WIRED has disabled the sound. Via the SSA

“Our apologies for the oversight in our training video,” the SSA wrote in a fact sheet about the chatbot that was shared in an email to employees last week. The fact sheet, which WIRED has reviewed, adds that employees using the chatbot should “refrain from uploading PII to the chatbot.”

Work on the chatbot, called the Agency Support Companion, began about a year ago, long before Musk or DOGE arrived at the agency, one SSA employee with knowledge of the app's development tells WIRED. The app has been in limited testing since February, before it was rolled out to all SSA staffers last week.

In an email announcing its availability to all staff this week, and reviewed by WIRED, the agency wrote that the chatbot was “designed to assist employees with everyday tasks and enhance productivity.”

Multiple SSA employees, including front office staff, tell WIRED that they entirely ignored the email about the chatbot because they were too busy with actual work, compensating for the reduced headcount at SSA offices. Others said they had briefly tested out the chatbot but were immediately unimpressed.

“Honestly, no one has really been talking about it at all,” one source tells WIRED. “I'm not sure most of my coworkers even watched the training video. I played around with the chatbot a bit and several of the responses I received from it were incredibly vague and/or inaccurate.”

Another source said their coworkers were mocking the training video.

“You could hear my coworkers making fun of the graphics. Nobody I know is [using it]. It's so clumsy and bad,” the source says, adding that they too were given inaccurate information by the chatbot.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Slate Auto's $25K Electric Pickup Is Here: Pricing, Specs, Range, Release Date","https://www.wired.com/story/slate-auto-electric-pickup/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 02:20:00 GMT","

The startup Slate Auto officially emerged from stealth mode late Thursday evening to debut its compact electric pickup truck. The company, which is partially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, says it will sell the most basic version of its EV truck for about $25,000. That's $5,000 less than the cheapest EVs on sale now in the US, none of which are pickups.

Slate has been keeping details about its EVs under wraps, though some models have recently been spotted in the wild by sleuths or outright teased by the upstart automaker. Now we have a wealth of information about the trucks' capabilities, Slate's manufacturing process, and the EVs' rollout plans.

It comes in one color: gray.

The basic “Blank Slate” pickup that sells for that lowest price tag gets an estimated 150 miles of range from a 52.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. It comes in only one color, a gray tone that's molded into its composite body panels, and offers only a single option: a larger 84.3-kWh battery that gives it an estimated 240 miles of range. (Slate did not quote a price for the larger battery option.)

The company is now taking refundable $50 deposits for the pickup trucks, with first deliveries targeted for the last quarter of 2026. Slate says the vehicles will be manufactured at an as-yet-unannounced site in the Midwestern US, a move which allows it to sidestep many of the country's new import tariffs.

Slate CEO Chris Barman says that both the product and its production process have been designed from the outset to keep costs low. In an interview with WIRED, she says the decision to make just one single model of pickup truck allows Slate to build the EVs more efficiently by eliminating the complexity of multiple variants—including colors. “Not having metal stamping presses [for large body panels] and a paint shop saved Slate $350 million to $500 million,” she says. Barman's numbers are based on a projected scale of up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

There's no screen on the dashboard. Instead, buyers can choose from a number of phone mounts.

It's possible, however, that no two Slates on the roads will be identical. The company is stressing that the vehicles will allow for “accessible personalization.” This is partly to appeal to younger buyers, who have been shown by surveys to be much more open to purchasing EVs than older buyers, and who also may be more eager to trick out their truck.

The $25K starting price is low, but Slate will offer more than 100 accessories—sold individually and in bundles—that buyers can install themselves or have installed by their Slate distributor for a set fee. Slate expects its average buyer to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on these accessories, with the higher costs for those who want to convert two-seat pickups into five-seat SUVs.

The new automaker expects the two accessory kits that contain new body panels and roll structure, delivered in a flat pack, to be very popular. They let the owner convert the two-door pickup into a two-door SUV or a fastback utility vehicle. The rear wall of the pickup cab is designed to unbolt so it can be reused as the SUV's tailgate. Required airbags for rear-seat passengers are built into the added roll cage that must be installed—with electronic sensors confirming its connection—before the newly converted Slate will restart. The target prices for each of these conversion kits is around $5,000, Barman says.

The rest of the Slate is stripped down, but the CEO says it will contain all required equipment to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for model year 2027. It will have standard automatic emergency braking, for example, and the mandatory backup camera—the view of which is displayed in the driver's digital instrument cluster, because there's no central touchscreen. Instead of a built-in screen, Slate offers a variety of phone and tablet mounts.

Other accessories include a console between the seats, kits to convert the standard manual window winders to electric systems, various seat covers, vehicle wraps, and of course various wheel styles to replace the standard 17-inch, five-lug steel wheels. Slate plans to produce a “Builder's Book” to show buyers how to modify and personalize their vehicles.

Slate offers an optional SUV conversion that seats five.

Barman says the battery cells, using a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry, will be supplied by Korean maker SK-On from a US production plant. They will power a single 150-kilowatt (201-horsepower) motor powering the rear wheels. All-wheel drive isn't offered. An onboard AC charger is capable of delivering up to 11 kW, with DC fast-charging up to 120 kW. The NACS connector will be standard.

The Blank Slate will have a curb weight of 3,600 pounds, with a payload capacity of 1,430 pounds. Rated towing capacity is listed at 1,000 pounds—significantly less than the 4,000-pound maximum towing capacity in the new 2025 Ford Maverick Hybrid AWD, which has a smaller cargo bed but four doors for the larger cab.

Visually, the Slate follows the upright, horizontal, square-edged profile of the classic two-seat American pickup truck—though rendered in miniature when compared to the full-size US pickups from Ford, GM, and Ram that collectively sell almost 3 million units per year. It looks something like a retro Ford Ranger from the 1980s, versus the more car-like styling of the Hyundai Santa Fe, the only other small pickup offered in the US besides the Ford Maverick.

Dimensionally, the Slate is smaller than the Maverick: It's 175 inches long, 71 inches wide (not including the mirrors), and 69 inches tall. That compares to the Maverick's 200-inch length, 73-inch width (again without mirrors), and 68- or 69-inch height. Slate offers a full 60-inch (5-foot) bed, versus the Maverick's 54 inches. (Both measurements are with the tailgate raised.) While the Maverick has no front trunk (it has an engine instead), the Slate's front trunk offers 7 cubic feet of storage on top of the 37 cubic feet in the cargo bed (or 34 cubic feet in the SUV's load bay).

Barman said Slate will target retail buyers to establish the brand and get as many personalized trucks on the road as possible to boost public awareness. Slate's EVs will also be sold to corporate customers purchasing the vehicles for fleets, Barman says, though she declined to offer a breakdown of what percentages of sales Slate estimates will go to those two sectors.

We also didn't talk about this, but it's worth mentioning: Slate trucks may conceivably also be sold to Amazon. The connection makes sense, since Slate Auto emerged from a startup lab partially funded by Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos. The online retailer already deploys tens of thousands of Rivian EV delivery vans, but a smaller EV could serve its purposes for specific uses as well.

Meep, meep.

As Mark Twain once quipped, perhaps apocryphally: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Anyone who's been following the auto business for about 20 years may have read Slate's news and sensed a faint echo, a distant and long-forgotten memory tugging at the corners of their minds.

That would be V-Vehicles (later renamed NextAuto), a low-cost vehicle startup backed by famed venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Caufield & Byers; a few of its Silicon Valley cohorts; and Texas natural-gas magnate T. Boone Pickens. The company's intent was to create an ultra-low-cost, lightweight 40-mpg “V-Car” to be manufactured at a former headlight plant in Monroe, Louisiana. Buyers could wrap its white molded plastic body panels in any color they desired. It would be built from off-the-shelf parts and sold through a big-box store like Sam's Club, with a single stock number for simplicity.

The V-Car was not a battery-electric vehicle; Pickens' participation pushed it toward natural-gas fueling. But the business model required startup funding from the US Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loan program to convert its plant. Ford, Nissan, and Tesla all received those loans in 2009—shortly followed by Fisker. When the DOE turned down the V-Vehicle ATVM loan application in May 2010, the company's fate was sealed.

Kleiner made two other automotive investments: Fisker Automotive and Think North America, a 2009 effort to manufacture the plastic-paneled, two-seat Norwegian Think electric car in the US. None of those companies exist today.

Here's hoping that Slate—whose little electric truck is an appealing size for many and seems affordable, especially to those without a burning desire to personalize their ride—fares somewhat better.

Open earbuds (AKA open-ear buds) are among the fastest-growing trends in audio. Thanks to their distinctive design that keeps your ear canals clear, the best open earbuds let you enjoy your favorite music or media while staying naturally aware of the world around you. Without any way to block ambient sounds, these probably can't be your everything buds, but they will let you hear everything. We've tested dozens of open-ear gadgets, from clip-on buds to audio glasses and everything in between. These are our favorite open earbuds for every fit and budget.

What exactly are open earbuds and how do they sound?

Open earbuds are similar to regular wireless buds, but instead of plugging your ear canals for a good seal, they leave them open to exterior sounds. This means their audio performance won't be as intimate or full-sounding as regular earbuds, particularly in the bass. They're also less versatile than buds with ambient audio features like noise canceling and transparency mode that can suppress or let in exterior sounds on demand. Their primary advantage is an unaltered path to exterior sounds, which makes them a perfect fit when you want to pepper in music and media with your natural environment.

When or where would I use open earbuds?

As limited as open earbuds can be in situations like a loud office, a long flight, or a busy commute, they can slot in brilliantly when you want to multitask without missing out. They're an obvious fit for workouts like hiking, jogging, the gym, or even biking/ebiking where wind resistance overpowers the tiny microphones in traditional earbuds. Beyond workouts, open earbuds can be a convenient solution any time you want to stay aurally alert, from cooking dinner while keeping tabs on the kids to sneaking in some football on your phone while the family enjoys a Christmas movie.

What about semi-open earbuds?

Semi-open earbuds like Apple's standard AirPods give you a semblance of what open earbuds offer, but it's not the same experience. I'd even argue that a semi-open fit can give you a worst-of-both-worlds scenario—you can't get a good seal for a full representation of you're music or media, and you're not able to hear your environment as clearly as even sealed buds with transparency mode, let alone fully open earbuds. Some people who have trouble with regular eartips swear by the standard AirPods design from a fit perspective, but if you want to keep in touch with the world around you, fully open earbuds are better.

What kind of features can I expect in open earbuds?

Open earbuds support many of the same features found in traditional earbuds like multipoint pairing to connect to multiple devices at once, sensors for auto-pause, water-resistance, and even spatial audio. Most provide an app for extras like EQ or an earbuds finder, and you'll find onboard touch or push controls. Because of the limitations of their physical designs, open earbud controls are often more limited or less effective than traditional earbuds, but the best pairs work around these constraints for convenient control

One feature you shouldn't look for in open earbuds is noise canceling, which relies on a mix of passive sound isolation and microphones to measure your environment and reverse the polarity of exterior sound frequencies to “cancel” them out. The basic physics of the process requires a good seal to work effectively. While it's true that some semi-open earbuds like the AirPods 4 and even some fully open earbuds offer noise canceling, it's generally very limited with only lower frequencies seeing any noise reduction. If you need noise canceling, you're better off with options like the AirPods Pro, Bose's top-ranked QuietComfort Ultra, or any of our other noise-canceling favorites.

Soundcore's Aeroclip (8/10, WIRED Recommends) strike a brilliant balance between quality and value, making them my top pick for most budgets. Their high-tensil loop is made with titanium to keep them light and stable, while their clip-on fit is comfy and hassle-free. Sound is spacious and clear, and features like multipoint pairing, auto-pause, and a customizable EQ help them adapt to your needs. The touch controls along the exterior loops are responsive and convenient, even when your hands are full, and they round things out with eight hours of play time (32 with their compact case) for a great package at a reasonable price.

If you're willing to splash out, Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are the top pick. These are simply the best-sounding open earbuds I've tried, offering clear and zingy sound with plenty of instrumental detail to elevate your media. Their compact, rollable design clings tightly with minimal pinching, though they require a learning curve to attach properly. You'll get a few advanced features, including multipoint pairing and Bose Spatial Audio, along with accessible push-button controls for playback, calling, and volume. They're anything but cheap, but if you want the best sound in a chic design, Bose's open buds deliver.

Sony's original Linkbuds were just the second open-earbuds I reviewed, and they're still among the most distinctive. Their claim to fame is a ring-shaped driver with a center hole to let in the world, deviating from most clip-on or wrap-around buds. The Linkbuds Open (7/10, WIRED Recommends) build off the original with an attachable fin to keep them more tightly in place and an updated sound signature for more bass. I felt the need to adjust their EQ for clarity, and their novel touch controls—which let you tap either the buds or the side of your face—aren't the most responsive. Otherwise, these are a solid option for those who'd rather insert their buds than wrap or clip them on.

These halo-style headphones from Shokz (formerly Aftershokz) aren't technically open earbuds, but like all models on our list, they keep your ears naturally open for workouts and other activities. The OpenRun Pro 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) use the brand's signature bone conduction vibrating pads to send sound through your cheekbones rather than your ears. Shokz has perfected the technique to provide a richer and more balanced sound which includes adding “air conduction” that blends directional drivers with the pads. WIRED Contributor Michael Sawh enjoyed Pro 2's boosted bass, even if they lost some clarity over the original Open Run Pro. They offer IP55 dust and water resistance in a light and durable circlet to help you push your body while busting your jams.

These affordable buds from Soundpeats have served me well over many miles of ebike testing, bike rides, and even the occasional boat ride. They are a simple, nondescript pair that cling easily to your ears without a pinching feeling, and they offer shockingly good sound for the price. Sure, you're not getting full fidelity like you would with closed buds, but these have a lot of bass for open-ears, and they do particularly well with the human voices on podcasts or phone calls. They are IPX5 rated for occasional dips (and frequent sweat), and six hours of battery life between trips to the charger means they're ready for a meandering marathon. — Parker Hall

A wine glass is not just a wine glass. It is form and function, status and culture, history and modernity, all in a single object. It's a tool we use to consume something highly sought after, and at the same time, the tool itself is a subject of great inquiry, even obsession. Some people are really into wine, but others are every bit as much consumed by the glass it's served in.

There are dozens, perhaps even hundreds of wine glass manufacturers, large and small, heritage and upstart, producing glassware in nearly every corner of the world. There's a deep history of glassware production in Central Europe dating back to the 19th century, and today it's centered on makers in Austria (home to Zalto and Riedel, to name just two), Switzerland, and Germany. I tested products from fine glassware companies from across Europe as well as from England, Japan, and the United States, covering a broad spectrum of price points and styles, including our top pick for all types of wine, the Glassvin Universal ($79).

Whether you're a casual user or a serious obsessive, upgrading your wine glass game is a window into the finer things in life, and an investment in your own pleasure and enjoyment for years to come. Don't believe me? Blind-test any of the stems in this guide next to a simple Ikea Svalka or any other mass-produced cheap option—you'll be amazed by the difference.

What Kind of Glass Stem Should I Buy?

Glass stemware is available in a broad range of styles, sizes, and price points, from hundred-year-old artisan glassware makers in Central Europe to new brands making their mark on the traditional glassware market. Price considerations of course come into play, but as with so many of the products we use and love in this modern world, the most expensive option is not always the best.

If you're totally new to all of this, a great place to start is with a so-called universal glass—a stem that's meant for use with any style of wine you desire, from red to white to sparkling. Nearly every brand of glassware produces a universal offering, but some brands only make a universal, offering a degree of specialization and care.

People who get really into stemware sometimes develop a sort of brand loyalty, exploring the full range of one single brand for all of their drinking needs. And indeed, it's not uncommon for one firm to offer a half-dozen or more options of wine stem, specialized around the highly specific styles of wine meant to be served therein. A huge bowl stem might work beautifully for some red wines, but not all; a narrow, smaller glass might flatter certain white wines, but throttle others. Ultimately you're into the land of subjectivity with this stuff, and at the end of the day the right wine glass for you is the one that feels best in your hands.

How I Tested

At the start of the year I solicited product samples from more than two dozen glass manufacturers, running the gamut of style, price, and nation of origin. I then spent several months living with this glassware, incorporating it into every facet of my daily life and drinking copious amounts of beverages from each. In addition to wine, every single wine glass tested for this feature was given a baseline test of mineral water—a topic I am passionate about—because fine mineral water from proper stemware is an immensely pleasurable drinking experience, and because the profound enjoyment one can find from a nice wine glass shouldn't be limited only to those who consume alcohol.

Many of the featured brands offer specific glasses meant for certain styles of wine—the Grassl Mineralité, for example, is intended for “crisp, fresh” wines, whereas the Grassl 1885 is purposed for wines with “great complexity and body.” In such instances, I made a point of testing glassware with its intended serving suggestion first, before jumping around with other beverage styles and putting each glass through its paces.

In total I tested around 100 individual pieces of stemware over the past several months. Much swirling and consideration took place. It's almost like, with so much to consider for this guide, I ran into the problem of having to funnel a vast amount of data toward something like a manageable and reader-friendly conclusion. I think it is perhaps worth mentioning that this level of hands-on testing—as opposed to, say, relying on press releases, sales sheets, and the almighty Google—appears to be for the most part unique among wine glassware articles currently available online. This is why you read WIRED.

Why Do I Need Multiple Wine Glasses?

You might be wondering—quite reasonably!—why anyone would need, care about, or want to consider all these different wine glass options. I think that's an eminently fair question, one that I've thought about a great deal throughout the testing process for this story. For wine geeks, the right wine glass becomes a part of the wider milieu of geekery in which they inhabit, along with other accoutrements like wine bottle openers, wine refrigerators, and so on. But for many other kinds of consumers, wine glasses offer this sort of living node of beauty in their lives—we hold these works of art in our hands, and clink them together in celebration, and they stay with us throughout the evening, coming back to us again and again for another touch point.

I think stemware argues loudly for itself as an object of pleasure. A proper wine stem makes whatever you're drinking taste better, and the tactile experience of sipping and swirling from a lovely stem can be deeply gratifying.

This is the single most competitive category in all of glassware, and let me tell you—I had not fully comprehended the subtlety of life's rich pageant until faced with testing a dozen different universal stems. Some are a little larger, some are a little lighter, but they're all singular in their purpose, which is to offer wine drinkers the option of using just one glass stem across the entire beverage pantheon.

GlasVin is an enormously impressive company making deep inroads across wine culture; it makes a savvy wedding registry choice, offers a wide range of custom and engraving options, and makes a broad spectrum of products. Its Universal glass has that Goldilocks thing down: It's not too thin, not too heavy, not too tall, and not too expensive. There's a reason why many of the finest restaurants in America—including Kato, Alinea, and Cote—choose to partner with GlasVin, and I think its Universal makes a strong case for itself in any home. Consider your GlasVin Universal as an entry point to the world of GlasVin, which includes limited editions like the Fu (currently sold out), an epic wide-bodied glass designed by wine maven Charlie Fu; and the Obsession, which is designed to provide “maximal aromatic release.”

Hear me out: Budget and “entry level” are relative terms, and there are perhaps some readers who are doing the math right now—$33 per glass!—and blanching at whether or not this could be considered “budget” at all. Yes, you can get something cheaper at Ikea, but it will not remotely be equivalent to the Gabriel-Glas, which sits in a sweet spot of quality, affordability, and delight. They are gorgeous glasses, with broad bowls that allow for ample swirling and aeration, made from a single piece of molten crystal with no fuse points or glues. The rim is laser cut, which helps reduce the likelihood of chipping or damage. It's slightly weighty—a full 150 grams—and safely goes straight into your dishwasher for cleaning. It manages to feel both thin and stout in your hand, the combined result of which registers to my mind as a kind of durable luxury.

Gabriel-Glas is extremely focused: It makes this StandArt as its workhorse glass, and also offers a considerably more expensive hand-blown version called the Gold Edition, which is lovely (as you might expect). But if you're a novice initiate to the world of nice stemware, the StandArt makes an exceedingly useful and accessible starting place. I have been given these glasses as a gift, given them myself as a gift to others, and recommend them without caveat.

This is a bit of a misnomer. It's hard to choose a single “best red wine glass” because there are so, so many different styles and expressions of red wine around the world, and a glass that works well for, say, a brooding traditional Barolo might not be what you want to serve with a bombastic California zinfandel. We could do an entire sub-guide on red wine glasses, but if pressured under duress to pick just one, I'm going to go with a glass that flatters my personal favorite red wine style—all roads lead to Burgundy, and the Zalto Burgundy Glass.

Zalto is a household name in the wine stem world, and so popular among wine drinkers that it's been subject over the years to product shortages and competitive distribution paths. Some of that is hype, but when it comes to Zalto's signature Burgundy bowl, I think the product backs it up. The Zalto Burgundy radiates elegance: It's hand-blown, dishwasher safe, and bleeding massive, offering a full 32 ounces of volume—enough to pour out a full bottle of wine if one so desired. This size gives drinkers the ability to effortlessly swirl and sniff away at French pinot noir from the Burgundy region, but it's also quite at home when used for aromatic white wines, such as chardonnay or Grüner Veltliner.

There's just something about these glasses—the brand is made in Austria but has roots in the glassmaking traditions of the Veneto, in northern Italy, so perhaps it's a matter of sprezzatura. If you're at a restaurant using these glasses, it's quite like you're in good hands, and at home it elevates one's wine drinking situation to new heights. There are many outstanding red wine glasses on the market, but there is only one Zalto Burgundy Glass.

I was completely unfamiliar with the Mark Thomas line of glassware before researching this feature, and found myself immediately attracted to the entire product line for its unique “double bend” beveled shaping and sleek, smooth aesthetic. Founded in Austria in 2014, Mark Thomas focuses exclusively on hand-blown lead-free crystal glassware, and its products can be found at a unique collection of bars, restaurants, and leading wine shops, including Red & White Wines (Chicago), Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels (NYC), and Claridge's (London).

White wine glasses are another enormously popular and competitive category, and a lot of establishments will actually carry glassware specially purposed for serving white wines in. But this one, wow—it is feather light at just 76 grams, and yet still dishwasher safe. Everything tastes beautiful in the Mark Thomas (try it with mineral water or apricot juice), but there may be no finer glass in the world of enjoying crisp, clean white wines like riesling, sauvignon blanc, and even vintage Champagne. The brand's signature “double bend” offers a neat trick—one can fill to the rim of the first bend for a sample pour or wine tasting, or to the top of the second bend for a proper glass pour. They're visually appealing and offer an alluring, totally modern profile. This was a total discovery to me, and I'm now fully on Team Mark Thomas for its entire product line—but if you have to pick just one, start here.

Stemless glassware is divisive. Some serious wine drinkers might roll their eyes at it—hands go on the stem, not on the bowl!— while others will have happy memories attached to this sort of glass, or prize them for their unfussy usability. I was enormously impressed by everything I tried from Richard Brendon, a UK-based glassware company that works in collaboration with Jancis Robinson, OBE, MW, one of the most respected and influential wine writers in the world. (The World Atlas Of Wine remains perhaps the single most impactful book on wine I've ever read and is intensely recommended).

These little handheld numbers are intuitively shaped and effortlessly comfortable to use, and nothing has been compromised: They're made of mouth-blown sparklingly light crystal, delicate and fine yet utterly approachable (and dishwasher safe). These make a fine choice if you're doubling up on high-quality glassware for serving water and wine together in tandem (as God intended), but there is nothing on earth stopping you from enjoying a lovely glass of rosé in this glass, perhaps outside in the garden with a little sun.

It makes sense when you think about it. Many wine glass companies also get in on the decanter game, extending their aesthetic and product vision from the realm of glassware into the larger-format carafe setting. For home consumers this offers the ability to create a unified aesthetic effect—the wine glasses match the decanter, how cool!—but also to mix-and-match, because perhaps you like one brand's decanter offering more than the glassware itself.

Honestly, decanters could be their own whole guide, but of the brands I tried for this story, two stood out. These devices do more than look cool: They also serve a purpose in wine service, and I'm recommending two that can be employed to achieve neatly opposite effects.

From the Richard Brendon x Jancis Robinson Collection, the “Mature Wine Decanter” is a thing of sturdy beauty. It comes on shaped more like an empty glass bottle than some ornate objet d'art, but its design subtlety portends a sophisticated use case. This is the perfect decanter to use when serving a vintage wine—for our purposes, let's say wine 20 years old or older—for which you want to limit the exposure to oxygen across the serving window. This decanter comes with a handblown stopper, a neat piece of kit that shuts out oxygen and also looks pretty damn cool atop the piece. I liked the looks of this immediately, but then was blown away by its application over the course of a happy evening spent with a bottle of Cappellano Barolo dating back to the Clinton administration. If you are a vintage wine lover or you have one in your life, this decanter is a game changer.

The Josephine Collection No. 7 Decanter is a show-stopping conversation piece. Mouth-blown and very much in keeping with the unique design language of Kurt Josef Zalto, this decanter comes on first and foremost like a piece of conceptual glass art. It's enormous, offering a sizable surface area and the Josephine brand's signature “kink”—a kind of glassform wobble at the middle of the vessel—which allows for endless swirling. It also boasts an unusual “cone” shape at the bottom of the vessel, which promotes a spiral motion for the liquid inside when it's poured and aerated.

The end result is a decanter that positively gulps in oxygen, which makes it perfect for decanting out younger wines, particularly those that might traditionally benefit from extended aging. If you've got a Grand Cru Echezeaux or a serious young Oregon Chardonnay on your hands and you simply cannot wait a moment longer to drink them, this decanter is your new best friend (and also—please call me). Form and function, style and substance—I cannot recommend this decanter enough, and it's also available in an extra-large Magnum size, in case that's in fact how you roll.

Let's get one thing straight up front: Wine flutes are outro like Gwyneth Paltrow. Champagnes and sparkling wines should never be fluted under even the most dire of circumstances, as the shape of the flute compresses aromatics and flavors. I will make an exception for using your granny's vintage crystal flutes on special occasions, but if you're shopping for new glassware (and using this guide for such), flutes are not the way to go.

Josephine Collection is the work of Kurt Josef Zalto, a sixth-generation glassmaker who set out to forge his own path in the world of stemware. Every glass in his range is unique and memorable, but the brand's Champagne glass is my personal favorite from this line. Called the No. 4, this glass uniquely hybridizes various wine glass styles—a cantilevered bowl with ample surface area, a tight “chimney” for focused aroma—and it looks positively stunning while doing it. Best of all, the glass features a unique diamond-pointed base at the bottom of the bowl, which helps channel bubbles upward and promotes extended effervescence. It's a beautifully engineered glass, but also thin and sophisticated, a total luxury to use. Sniff and swirl and appreciate your sparkling wine with this glass, because hey, Champagne is only getting more expensive these days, so you might as well really enjoy it.

How deep down the rabbit hole must one be to appreciate the use of a travel wine glass set? Well—if you've ever found yourself, say, at an Airbnb stocked only with red Solo cups, or planning a winey picnic somewhere far off the beaten path, this kind of option might be right for you. I have surprised myself by finding repeated utility for the Voyage+ by Grassl Glass, which comes ready for adventure with four glassware slots, perfect for two stems of red and two stems of white. Allow me to share with you the perfect use case: a recent night out for my wife's birthday, which included a bit of a staycation situation at a local hotel, the occasion for which I had procured a very cool bottle of Italian red wine from her birth year. Would the hotel's provided acrylic glassware have been fine enough to drink from? Sure, of course. But did we immensely enjoy instead using a pair of Grassl 1855 bowls from our trusty Voyage+? You bet we did.

I've overall been enormously impressed by everything from Grassl, a Swiss wineglass manufacturer that to me offers just the right amount of consideration and geekiness while not overwhelming the wine drinking experience. Armed with this carrier, fully loaded with two 1855 red glasses and Mineralité wine glasses, there is no hangout for which you will be unprepared. The entirety of its Vigneron series is highly recommended.

Fontaine is a new company, very much an upstart, and its hand-blown titanium glass crystal feels lovely in your hands. This is the only wine glass it makes; its line is extremely small and focused, and includes only two other products, both intended for whiskey. At just 95 grams, the glass is beautifully light but never feels fragile or breakable. And if you do happen to damage your Fontaine, the brand offers a 1:1 replacement program at a reduced wholesale price. Everything tastes beautiful from this glass, to which I found myself returning again and again throughout the testing process, and have since incorporated into regular use in my own home.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit. 

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.”

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.

All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.

OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

A new American electric vehicle startup called Slate Auto has made its debut, and it's about as anti-Tesla as it gets. 

It's affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog. It has manual windows and it doesn't come with a main infotainment screen. Heck, it isn't even painted. It can also transform from a two-seater pickup to a five-seater SUV.

The three-year-old startup revealed its vehicle during an event Thursday night in Long Beach, California, and promised the first trucks would be available to customers for under $20,000 with the federal EV tax credit by the end of 2026. 

The event comes just a few weeks since TechCrunch revealed details of Slate Auto's plans to enter the U.S. EV market, build its trucks in Indiana, and that the enterprise is financially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

The auto industry “has been so focused on autonomy and technology in the vehicle, it's driven prices to a place that most Americans simply can't afford,” chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said during the event, which Inside EVs live streamed. “But we're here to change that.”

“We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,” CEO Chris Barman added.

Slate isn't saying exactly how much its truck will cost — multiple sources have told TechCrunch over the last few weeks the company has gone back and forth on the number. And so much can change between now and a late 2026 release date.

The company is saying it will start under $20,000 after the federal tax credit (providing that still exists next year). Interested buyers can place a $50 refundable reservation on the company's website.

The base version of Slate's truck will squeeze 150 miles out of a 52.7kWh battery pack, which will power a single 150kW motor on the rear axle. For folks who get a little spooked at that number, Slate is offering a larger battery pack that it says will have about 240 miles of range. It will charge using a North American Charging Standard port, the standard Tesla established that almost all major automakers now use.

The truck comes with 17-inch wheels and a five-foot bed, and has a projected 1,400 pound payload capacity with a 1,000 pound towing capacity. Since it's an EV, there's no engine up front. In its place there's a front trunk (or frunk) with 7 cubic feet of storage space, which happens to have a drain in case the owner wants to fill it with ice for that tailgate party.

That towing capacity is lower than a more capable Ford F-150, and is even less than the smaller Ford Maverick, which can tow around 1,500 pounds. 

Speaking of the Ford Maverick, Slate's truck is smaller. The Slate EV has a wheelbase of 108.9 inches, and an overall length of 174.6 inches. The Maverick has a 121.1-inch wheelbase and overall length of 199.7 inches

Everything else about the base version of the truck is awfully spare — and that's the point. Slate is really maximizing the idea of a base model, and setting customers up for paying to customize the EV to their liking. 

Slate is deeply committed to the idea of customization, which sets it apart from any other EV startup (or traditional automaker).

The company said Thursday it will launch with more than 100 different accessories that buyers can use to personalize the truck to their liking. If that's overwhelming, Slate has curated a number of different “starter packs” that interested buyers can choose from.

The truck doesn't even come painted. Slate is instead playing up the idea of wrapping its vehicles, something executives said they will sell in kits. Buyers can either have Slate do that work for them, or put the wraps on themselves.

This not only adds to the idea of a buyer being able to personalize their vehicle, but it also cuts out a huge cost center for the company. It means Slate won't need a paint shop at its factory, allowing it to spend less to get to market, while also avoiding one of the most heavily regulated parts of vehicle manufacturing. 

Slate is telling customers that they can name the car whatever they want, offering the ability to purchase an embossed wrap for the tailgate. Otherwise, the truck is just referred to as the “Blank Slate.”

As TechCrunch previously reported, the customization piece is central to how the company hopes to make up margin on what is otherwise a relatively dirt-cheap vehicle.

But it's also part of the friendly pitch Slate is making to customers. 

Barman said Thursday that people can “make the Blank Slate yours at the time of purchase, or as your needs and finances change over time.” It's billing the add-ons as “easy DIY” that “non-gearheads” can tackle, and says it will launch a suite of how-to resources under the billing of Slate University.

“Buy your accessories, get them delivered fast, and install them yourself with the easy how-to videos in Slate U, our content hub,” the website reads. “Don't want to go the DIY route? A Slate authorized partner can come and do it for you.”

The early library of customizations on Slate's website range from functional to cosmetic. Buyers can add infotainment screens, speakers, roof racks, light covers, and much more.

The most significant are the options that let buyers “transform” the truck into roomier SUV form factors. But these aren't permanent decisions. Slate says people will be able to change their vehicle into, and back from, an SUV if they like — “no mechanics certification required.”

All that said, Slate's truck comes standard with some federally mandated safety features such as automatic emergency braking, airbags, and a backup camera.

The road to making a successful American automotive startup is littered with failures. In the last few years, Canoo, Fisker, and Lordstown Motors have all filed for bankruptcy. And that's just to name a few. Those companies that are still around, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, are hemorrhaging money in an attempt to get high-volume, more affordable models to market.

Slate is a total inversion of that approach. It's going after a low-cost EV first and foremost, and hopes to make that business viable by supplementing it with money from this deep customization play. 

But, much like Rivian and Lucid Motors, it also has deep-pocketed backers. It raised has raised more than $111 million so far (the exact figure is still not public). And, aside from Bezos, has taken money from Mark Walter, Guggenheim Partners CEO and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers, as TechCrunch reported this month. 

The company has hired nearly 400 employees in service of accomplishing all of its ambitious goals, and is currently trying to hire more. Slate arguably could not have picked a more volatile time to make its debut, but it's also focused on domestic manufacturing, and may be insulated from some of the turmoil facing other startups and established automakers. 

“We believe vehicles should be affordable and desirable,” Barman said Thursday, adding that Slate's truck “is a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own.”

Chinese startup Manus AI, which works on building tools related to AI agents, has picked up $75 million in a funding round led by Benchmark at a roughly $500 million valuation, according to Bloomberg.

The company will use the money to expand to new markets, including the U.S., Japan, and the Middle East, Bloomberg noted, citing people familiar with the matter.

Bloomberg's report suggests that the fresh round has quintupled the valuation of Manus, which previously raised somewhere north of $10 million from backers including Tencent and HSG (formerly Sequoia China). 

Manus came into the spotlight when the company launched a demo of a general AI agent that could complete various tasks in March. (In TechCrucnh's testing, it didn't work quite as well as advertised.) The company later launched paid subscription plans costing between $39 per month and $199 per month.

Kai Chen, a Canadian AI researcher working at OpenAI who's lived in the U.S. for 12 years, was denied a green card, according to Noam Brown, a leading research scientist at the company. In a post on X, Brown said that Chen learned of the decision Friday and must soon leave the country.

“It's deeply concerning that one of the best AI researchers I've worked with […] was denied a U.S. green card,” wrote Brown. “A Canadian who's lived and contributed here for 12 years now has to leave. We're risking America's AI leadership when we turn away talent like this.”

Another OpenAI employee, Dylan Hunn, said in a post that Chen was “crucial” for GPT-4.5, one of OpenAI's flagship AI models.

Green cards can be denied for all sorts of reasons, and the decision won't cost Chen her job. In a follow-up post, Brown said that Chen plans to work remotely from an Airbnb in Vancouver “until [the] mess hopefully gets sorted out.” But it's the latest example of foreign talent facing high barriers to living, working, and studying in the U.S. under the Trump administration. 

OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. However, in a post on X in July 2023, CEO Sam Altman called for changes to make it easier for “high-skill” immigrants to move to and work in the U.S.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.hard to get this back if we lose it.

Over the past few months, more than 1,700 international students in the U.S., including AI researchers who've lived in the country for a number of years, have had their visa statuses challenged as part of an aggressive crackdown. While the government has accused some of these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted for minor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has turned a skeptical eye toward many green card applicants, reportedly suspending processing of requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status. It has also taken a hardline approach to green card holders it perceives as “national security” threats, detaining and threatening several with deportation.  

AI labs like OpenAI rely heavily on foreign research talent. According to Shaun Ralston, an OpenAI contractor providing support for the company's API customers, OpenAI filed more than 80 applications for H1-B visas last year alone and has sponsored more than 100 visas since 2022.

H1-B visas, favored by the tech industry, allow U.S. companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor's degree or the equivalent. Recently, immigration officials have begun issuing “requests for evidence” for H-1Bs and other employment-based immigration petitions, asking for home addresses and biometrics, a change some experts worry may lead to an uptick in denied applications.

Immigrants have played a major role in contributing to the growth of the U.S. AI industry.

According to a study from Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 66% of the 50 “most promising” U.S.-based AI startups on Forbes' 2019 “AI 50” list had an immigrant founder. A 2023 analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy found that 70% of full-time graduate students in fields related to AI are international students.

Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa.

The U.S.'s immigration policies, cutbacks in grant funding, and hostility to certain sciences have many researchers contemplating moving out of the country. Responding to a Nature poll of over 1,600 scientists, 75% said that they were considering leaving for jobs abroad.

It turns out that decentralized social networks can go down, too. 

On Thursday evening, the decentralized social network Bluesky experienced a significant outage, leaving users unable to load the app on both the web and mobile devices for roughly an hour. According to a message on Bluesky's status page, the company was aware of the outage, which it attributed to “Major PDS Networking Problems.” (PDS means personal data servers.)

The first status message was posted at 6:55 PM ET, and a second one indicating that a fix was being applied was shared soon after at 7:38 PM ET. 

The question many may be asking now is, how did this decentralized social network go down? Isn't it … decentralized? Isn't one of the perks of decentralization that there's not a single point of failure?

Despite the platform's decentralized nature, the majority of Bluesky users today interact with the service via Bluesky's official app, powered by the AT Protocol. While in theory, anyone can run the various parts of the infrastructure that make up the protocol, including PDS, relays, and other components, it's still early days for the social network, so few have done so.

Those who did, however, were not impacted by the outage.

In time, the idea is that many communities will be built on Bluesky, some with their own infrastructure, moderation services, and even client applications. (One example is the work that the Blacksky team is doing to create safer, more welcoming online spaces that take advantage of these decentralized tools.)

Eventually, the hope is that Bluesky will be one of many entities that run the infrastructure needed to support the growing number of applications built on the AT Protocol.

In the near term, however, an outage impacting Bluesky's infrastructure will be felt more broadly. 

The outage stirred up some of the rivalry between Bluesky and another decentralized social network, Mastodon, which runs on a different social networking protocol called ActivityPub. Mastodon users were quick to point to the outage in order to make jokes or jabs that focused on Bluesky's approach to decentralization.

One Mastodon user, Luke Johnson, wrote, “see how the mighty Bluesky crumbles while the Raspberry Pi running Mastodon under my bed just keeps chugging along” — a reference to how Mastodon can run off even tiny machines users themselves configure.

Or, as another Mastodon user joked, “nice decentralization ya got there.”

In any event, Bluesky's outage was resolved shortly after it began and the service is back up and running. 

On Friday, Bluesky CTO Paul Frazee confirmed in a post that Bluesky's Personal Data Servers (PDS) were the victim of DDoS attacks — typically, malicious attempts by bad actors to disrupt normal traffic to a server. Other PDSs were not targeted. The attack's source has not been identified, but Frazee says the current theory is that it was an accident by a third party. 

This post was updated after publication to include the confirmation of the DDoS attack.

Youtube also increases ad load. More ads per video, combined with organic growth, higher engagement and wider distribution (smart TVs probably have insane metrics-- plus no real ad blockers there, either) mean they'll keep having display/video ads doing extremely well, too.[1] https://www.techspot.com/news/102765-who-prabhakar-raghavan-...

They won't bring back manufacturing, and they could stunt our ability to make tomorrow's breakthroughs.

Despite the geopolitical chaos and market collapses triggered by President Trump's announcement of broad tariffs on international goods, some supporters still hope the strategy will produce a “golden age” of American industry. Trump himself insists, “Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country.”

While it's possible that very targeted tariffs could help protect some nascent sectors of domestic manufacturing, the belief in the power of blunt tariffs flies in the face of manufacturing reality. And it's not just the idea of a speedy return to economic prowess thanks to smoke-belching factories and the sudden ability to cheaply assembled armies of iPhones that strains credulity. The sweeping tariffs ignore the complexities of today's supply chains and the way technology advances are shifting how and where goods are made.

In fact, the high and crudely designed tariffs set out by the administration could damage a recent rebound in US manufacturing. Building factories and the supply chains they run on takes years—even decades—of steady investment. Meanwhile, tariffs have the immediate impact of boosting costs for critical supplies, many of which come from overseas—helping to raise prices and, in turn, slowing demand.

None of that is good for those planning to invest in US manufacturing.

“Tariffs, in general, as a tool for encouraging the type of manufacturing we want in the US are a terrible instrument,” says Elisabeth Reynolds, a professor of the practice at MIT.

Reynolds, who was an advisor to President Biden on manufacturing and economic development, says the Trump tariffs will raise the costs of US manufacturing without providing incentives for “strategic investments in the technologies we care about for national and economic security.”

Willy Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School, says the tariffs feel like “random acts of violence” in how they hurt manufacturing and supply chains. Because the tariffs proposed so far “are so scattershot and change so often,” he says, “it's basically freezing up investments. Who is going to make any kind of investment commitment when things are changing so fast?”

There are already indications that the prospect of widespread tariffs could be harming the US manufacturing boom. One closely scrutinized survey called the Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, showed troubling early signs of rising costs for manufacturers due to the tariffs. Other indicators watched carefully by policy wonks, including surveys of manufacturers by the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the Richmond Fed, and the Philadelphia Fed, also show a loss of confidence among US producers and drops in new orders and hiring.

Battery, solar, and wind projects are getting killed in record numbers. Here's a map of all the cancellations so far this year.

The longer-terms effects of the tariffs are, of course, unknown. For one thing, the specifics—how large, how long, and on what countries—seem to be constantly shifting. And that's a big part of the problem: For manufacturers and investors, uncertainty is the killer of plans for expansion, new factories, and even the R&D that feeds into new products.

It's that uncertainty, above all else, that could derail a reindustrialization still in the early stages for much of the country.

In fact, US manufacturing in the years following the covid pandemic has been booming—or at least the groundwork for such a boom is getting built. Until the most recent few months, spending on the construction of factories had been soaring. New facilities to build batteries, solar cells, semiconductors, electric motors, and other new technologies are springing up all around the country—or were until very recently.

“We never had more construction starts in the United States than we've had in the past four years,” says Milo Werner, a partner at the venture capital firm DCVC. “We're at this amazing moment where we could actually rebuild Main Street America and bring back the industrial base.”

The move to bolster US manufacturing was fueled by a sense during the beginning of the pandemic that the country must regain the ability to make critical products and technologies. The decline of US manufacturing had become obvious. Federal support to rebuild the industrial base came in a series of bills passed during the Biden administration, including the CHIPS and Science Act and the climate bill.

At the same time, opportunities offered by artificial intelligence and automation breakthroughs have spurred an appetite for new investments among many manufacturers. Many of those technologies are just starting to be deployed, but they promise a way for US producers to finally become more competitive with those in low-wage economies.

If the Trump tariffs slow or even reverse such progress, the impact on the country's economic and technological future could be devastating.

There are a lot of reasons to want a stronger US industrial base. But it's not mainly about whether we have countless well-paying jobs for those with only a high school diploma and little technical training, despite what you will hear from many politicians. Those days are mostly long gone.

Manufacturing jobs account for a little under 10% of total jobs in the US. That percentage hasn't changed much over the last few decades—nor is it likely to grow much in coming years even if manufacturing output increases, because automation and other advanced digital tools will likely cut into the demand for human workers.

Still, manufacturing is critical to the future of the US economy in other ways. The invention of new stuff and production processes greatly benefits from an intimate connection to manufacturing capabilities and expertise. In short, your chances of successfully creating a new type of battery or AI chip are much greater if you're familiar with the intricacies of manufacturing such products.

It's a lesson that was often forgotten in the 2000s as companies, led by such Silicon Valley giants as Apple, focused on design and marketing, leaving the production work to China and other countries. The strategy created huge profits but severely crimped the United States' ability to move ahead with a next generation of technology. In 2010, Intel cofounder Andy Grove famously warned, “Abandoning today's ‘commodity' manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow's emerging industry.”

Three bills investing hundreds of billions into technological development could change the way we think about government's role in growing prosperity.

Prompted by such concerns, in 2011 I visited manufacturers across the country, from industrial giants like GE and Dow Chemical to startups with exciting new technologies, and wrote “Can We Build Tomorrow's Breakthroughs?” Over the next few years, the answer to the headline's question proved to be no. GE and Dow gave up on their most innovative manufacturing ventures in batteries and solar, while nearly none of the startups survived.

The US was great at inventing new stuff, it turns out, but lousy at making it.

The hope is that this situation is changing as the country builds up its manufacturing muscles. The stakes are particularly high. The value of producing strategic goods and their supply chains domestically—biomedicine, critical minerals, advanced semiconductors—is becoming obvious to both politicians and economists.

If we want to turn today's scientific breakthroughs in energy, chips, drugs, and key military technologies such as drones into actual products, the US will need to once again be a manufacturing powerhouse.

Limited tariffs could help. That's especially true, says DCVC's Werner, in some strategically important areas marked by a history of unfair trade practices. Rare-earth magnets, which are found in everything from electric motors to drones to robots, are one example. “Decades ago, China flooded the US economy with low-cost magnets,” she says. “All our domestic magnet manufacturers went out of business.”

Now, she suggests, tariffs could provide short-term protection to US companies developing advanced manufacturing techniques to make those products, helping them compete with low-cost versions made in China. “You're not going to be able to rely on tariffs forever, but it's an example of the important role that tariffs could play,” she says.

Even Harvard's Shih, who considers the sweeping Trump tariffs “crazy,” says that far more limited versions could be a useful tool in some circumstance to give temporary market protection to domestic manufacturers developing critical early-stage technologies. But, he adds, such tariffs need to be “very targeted” and quickly phased out.

For the successful use of tariffs, “you really have to understand how global trade and supply chains work,” Shih says. “And trust me, there is no evidence that these guys actually understand how it works.”

What's really at stake when we talk about the country's reindustrialization is our future pipeline of new technologies. The portfolio of technologies emerging from universities and startups in energy production and storage, materials, computing, and biomedicine has arguably never been richer. Meanwhile, AI and advanced robotics could soon transform our ability to manufacture these technologies and products.

The danger is that backward-looking policy choices geared toward a bygone era of manufacturing could destroy that promising progress. 

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The Nintendo Switch 2 preorders went live last night. If you weren't one of the lucky few to score yours from Target, Best Buy, or Walmart, you'll have another shot at redemption by waiting up for the midnight release at your local store going into June 5.

However, if you respect your sleep schedule enough to not do that, you can still secure yourself a sick new gaming console. It's not a Switch 2, but it has it's own sense of awe surrounding it. The MetaQuest 3S is the best entry point for VR gaming. It's at an affordable price point and has a wide catalogue of games just waiting to be played. Right now, you can even get it on sale. It's marked down between 12% and 16% for a limited time, and it's even bundled with a carrying case. You can get the 128GB model for just $312 (down from $370) or the 256GB model for $415 (down from $470).

See at Amazon

In addition to the carrying case, you'll also get the game Batman: Arkham Shadow. Take on the cape and cowl to track down the mysterious villain called the Rat King and save Gotham on the Fourth of July. It's a narrative sequel to Batman: Arkham Origins but puts you even more in control of the Dark Knight with the Meta Quest 3S' headset and wireless motion controllers.

You'll also gain access to three months of Meta Quest+ which will allow you to play over 25 more games for no additional charge. Best of the bunch in my opinion honestly is Walkabout Minigolf. It's pretty straight forward. It's VR minigolf but it feels great to play, the course designs are super fun, and there's hidden golf balls on every course for you to find like a virtual Easter egg hunt. The multiplayer is phenomenal. Just hanging out on the putting greens with you pals across multiple states. It's a blast all the way through.

The Meta Quest 3S is a solid upgrade from the Meta Quest 2. The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset makes the whole thing run faster. The new outside sensors allow for full-color passthrough, and a new action button allows you to switch quickly between virtual and mixed reality.

Right now, you can get yourself the Meta Quest 3s bundled with a carrying case and Batman: Arkham Shadow for a good $58 off. The 128GB model has been discounted down to just $312 while the 256GB model is now down to just $415. It should hold you over hopefully until the Switch 2 is stocked on every shelf across America.

Kash Patel, a far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist who just so happens to be the director of the FBI, tweeted Friday about the arrest of a judge in Wisconsin who he alleges tried to obstruct U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But it wasn't long before Patel deleted the tweet. Two hours later, Patel retweeted the exact same thing, and it's unclear why he would delete the original tweet.

“Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on charges of obstruction—after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,” Patel wrote in his tweet from 10:11 a.m. ET.

“We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject—an illegal alien—to evade arrest,” Patel continued.

Patel went on to write, “thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot,” describing the scene like he's in a cheesy 1980s cop show, and insisting that, “the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public.”  Patel ended his tweet by saying that he will “have more to share soon” and tagging the X account for the FBI in Milwaukee.

Anyone trying to visit the tweet's original URL now sees a page that reads, “Hmm…this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else.” Patel's new version of the tweet appears to have identical wording, so it's a complete mystery why he deleted it. The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to questions about Patel's tweet emailed Friday.

ICE agents reportedly arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 to arrest a Mexican citizen in Judge Hannah Dugan's courtroom, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. The newspaper says Dugan directed the ICE agents to the chief justice's office and the person ICE was trying to arrest left through a side door. The Journal-Sentinel spoke with five experts who all had different opinions on Dugan's alleged conduct, but none thought she should be charged with a crime.

The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed on Friday that Dugan was arrested around 8:30 a.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET) on courthouse property. Dugan appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Dries and has been charged with two felonies, obstruction and concealing an individual, according to the Journal-Sentinel.

Dugan made no comment during the hearing, but her attorney reportedly said, “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.” A former federal prosecutor in Milwaukee, Franklyn Gimbel, who spoke with the Journal-Sentinel, called her arrest “outrageous,” and noted that the FBI could have simply invited her to show up and surrender herself. But theatrics are obviously a big deal for the very media-conscious Trump regime.

Dugan, 65, got her bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1981 and earned her JD in 1987, according to the Associated Press. She was elected to the county court, Branch 31, in 2016 and worked at Legal Action of Wisconsin and the Legal Aid before that.

President Donald Trump prosecuted a federal judge in Massachusetts in a similar case brought in 2019, but that case was dropped in 2022 during the Biden administration. Trump has made it clear that he's going to go after judges as a way to impose his particular brand of fascism on the United States. And his billionaire buddy Elon Musk, the head of DOGE, has repeatedly called for the persecution of judges. Musk tweeted about the case Friday, writing, “More judicial corruption.”

Kash Patel was confirmed as FBI director in late February in a vote of 51-49, with every Democratic senator and two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voting no. Patel was a board member for Trump Media, the company that owns Donald Trump's Truth Social, before resigning that role to take his job at the FBI and has made at least $2.6 million from consulting and media deals, according to ABC News. Patel also wrote an absolutely unhinged children's book depicting Donald Trump as a king, titled The Plot Against the King.

The FBI director has repeatedly embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory, published a list of so-called deep state officials to target, and has promised to “come after” the media. And yet many of Patel's supporters on social media have been frustrated by perceptions that the FBI director has been slow to enact retribution against perceived enemies. We'll see if that changes now that Patel is doing his best to usher in the “arrest judges” stage of fascism.

Sharks might not be as responsible for rare human bites as we assumed. In a study released today, scientists argue that at least some shark bites should be considered a form of self-defense.

Marine biologists from France led the research, published in Frontiers in Conservation Science. After analyzing shark bite data from throughout the world, they estimated that about 5% of shark-on-human bites are wholly defensive, rather than sharks trying to catch their next meal. The findings should help inform shark bite prevention efforts, the researchers say.

Lead researcher Eric Clua, a shark specialist at PSL University, was inspired to look into the topic by observations he had made during his field studies in French Polynesia.

He often heard about fishermen who systematically slaughtered sharks that had unwittingly become trapped in fish pens. These sharks would sometimes bite the fishermen if they were initially unsuccessful in killing the animal. He also heard reports of accidental shark bites on underwater spearfishermen where the sharks appeared to only attack because they wanted the fisherman to stay away from their prey.

“On closer examination, the opportunity arose to model this self-defense mechanism described in the study, which insists on human and not shark responsibility in this type of accident,” Clua told Gizmodo in an email.

The researchers first analyzed data from recorded shark bites in French Polynesia—specifically, incidents that contained at least some information on the possible motivation behind the bites. Between 2009 and 2023, 74 such shark bites were documented in the area. Four of these bites, 5% of the total, were likely motivated by self-defense, the researchers found.

Clua and his team then scoured through data from the Global Shark Attack Files, which has documented nearly 7,000 shark bites since 1863. They examined bites classified as provoked, involving people placed in close proximity to sharks. Once again, about 5% of the bites they studied—322 bites overall—seemed to meet the criteria for self-defense.

These criteria include the sharks biting immediately after a human action that is, or could be perceived as, aggressive, and the bites being repeated but leaving superficial, non-lethal wounds. Paradoxically, a defensive shark bite might also be disproportionately violent compared to the human action that preceded it, such as a stranded shark aggressively biting a human trying to return it to the water. But this disproportionality might simply be a sign of the shark's desperation to survive at any cost, according to Clua.

“The results of this study show that sharks have as much right as any animal or human to defend themselves when their survival is at stake,” he said. “They also show that, counter-intuitively, it is advisable not to come to the aid of a shark in danger, as it will not necessarily perceive this human action positively and may react aggressively.”

By uncovering the many motivations behind shark bites, the team hopes to prevent them from happening in the first place. People shouldn't interact with or approach sharks, for instance, even if they seem harmless or appear to be in danger. And in general, you should be in groups of at least two people when swimming in places where sharks live, which can reduce the risk of a sustained predatory attack. Unlike some land predators, Clua adds, staying still will not dissuade a predatory shark from attacking, so you should always try to defend yourself if the worst-case scenario happens.

At the same time, the researchers note that sharks are typically afraid of humans. As a result, shark bites are very uncommon, and even more rarely are they fatal compared to other animal-human interactions.

There were only 88 shark bites recorded worldwide in 2024 and seven related deaths, for instance. By contrast, hippos are estimated to fatally attack at least 500 people a year, and the fatality numbers get even more skewed when you consider the diseases spread by certain animals (mosquito-borne malaria alone kills over a half million people each year). So while it's important to practice good safety in waters that could contain sharks, people (reporters included) also shouldn't over-inflate the risk of being bitten by them in the first place.

“In addition to reducing the number of such bites in the field, we hope that one of the major effects of our study will be to modify the vision and attitude of journalists, by suggesting that they take a closer look at the conditions in which bites occur, without systematically blaming the animals, but rather making humans more responsible,” Clua said.

The team plans to continue studying other types of shark bites, such as “exploration”-driven bites where the sharks might bite humans to test whether they're suitable prey.

President Trump has decided to target the online fundraising websites that power a majority of Democrats' political campaigns. In an executive order on Thursday, the Trump administration initiated a plan to investigate ActBlue, the Democratic Party's primary grassroots fundraising tool.

The executive order, which was published on the White House website on Thursday, claims that “foreign nationals” could be using fundraising sites like ActBlue to make contributions to American elections. The order authorizes the new Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessant, to probe such sites for evidence of malfeasance. It states:

…press reports and investigations by congressional committees have generated extremely troubling evidence that online fundraising platforms have been willing participants in schemes to launder excessive and prohibited contributions to political candidates and committees.

The order goes on:

Specifically, these reports raise concerns that malign actors are seeking to evade Federal source and amount limitations on political contributions by breaking down large contributions from one source into many smaller contributions, nominally attributed to numerous other individuals, potentially without the consent or even knowledge of the putative contributors. The reports also raise concerns that such “straw donations” are being made through “dummy” accounts, potentially using gift cards or prepaid credit cards to evade detection.

The order authorizes Bondi and Bessent to use “all lawful authority, as necessary, to investigate” the fundraising tools for signs of foreign influence. Gizmodo reached out to the Trump administration for more information.

The order also cites a previous probe by House Republicans into ActBlue that supposedly found evidence of foreign-based fraud on the platform.

It should be noted that Republicans have their own fundraising operation that was launched during Trump's first administration. WinRed was launched in 2019 as a “for-profit” fundraising tool, and a means for the GOP to compete with Democrats' ActBlue. The Trump administration actively lobbied Republicans to use the tool, which has not been nearly as successful as its Democratic counterpart, and has often been criticized by Republicans themselves. The platform was previously investigated by several state attorneys general for the tactics it used to encourage donations.

But there are a number of catches.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Startup Atum Works claims that its nanoscale 3D printing method can easily replace current production flows and reduce chip fabrication costs by 90%, according to a launch post on YCombinator. There is a catch though: its capabilities are outdated by 20 years for logic chips, but may be just fine for packaging, photonics, and sensors.

Modern chips are like buildings: they have multiple floors, different types of blocks inside, and communications infrastructure. Every advanced chip is manufactured through an intricate process involving thousands of steps and hundreds of specialized tools, so it is quite expensive.

Atum Works claims that it has developed and built a nanoscale 3D printer that is capable of fabricating multi-material 3D structures with a 100 nm resolution at a voxel level at wafer scale. Instead of following the conventional planar lithography workflow, where circuits are patterned onto silicon wafers using light exposure through photomasks, Atum Works' system deposits materials at precise locations in three-dimensional space. This enables the fabrication of integrated circuits and allows items like interconnects to be formed in a continuous, unified process, which promises to improve yields compared to conventional methods. 

Modern EUV lithography tools have a resolution of around 13 nm (Applied's Sculpta can then enhance or modify patterns made by scanners with a 1~2nm critical dimension control), whereas modern etching tools achieve a sub-10nm precision in vertical direction. A 100nm resolution was relevant for 90nm ~ 110nm process technologies used in 2003 – 2005. 

That said, Atum Works's nanoscale 3D printer is not exactly suitable for building high-performance processors.

Is this a good sign for the global chip trade?

Beijing is easing retaliatory tariffs on chip and semiconductor imports from America, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) — potentially a good sign for the global chip trade.

Several industry sources shared the news with Chinese business publication Caijing, saying that eight tariff codes related to integrated circuits are exempted from the 125% tariffs it levied on U.S. goods in response to President Trump's 145% import duty on imports from China. This does not include memory chips, however, which Chinese companies manufacture within their borders. Chinese customs also told companies that have paid import duties for the exempted goods between April 10 and 24 that they're eligible to apply for refunds.

This might be a sign that trade relations between the U.S. and China are thawing. But Chinese authorities haven't made a public announcement about this announcement so far, and neither has it answered SCMP's calls to comment on the news. The China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA), representing the biggest chipmakers in the country, was also mum on the issue. Furthermore, the original report has since been deleted from the Caijing website and its official WeChat channel.

It could be that this information came from measured leaks, with the Chinese government gauging the U.S.'s reaction before making any further concrete moves. The trade war between the two economic powers has certainly upended global trade. This is especially true in the semiconductor industry, which relies on a global supply chain including the U.S. and China.

It is especially true in advanced chips, with the Nvidia H20 chip still selling well despite being watered down to comply with export restrictions. The White House recently added AMD's MI308 to its list of banned exports, leading to a more than $6-billion write-off for Nvidia and AMD, showing how dependent some Chinese tech companies are on American products.

While Trump began the trade war escalation by putting tariffs on the entire world, he was also the first to blink by exempting computers, smartphones, and other tech-related goods from China. The U.S. imports the majority of several consumer electronics from China, including game consoles, PC monitors, smartphones, lithium-ion batteries, and laptops.

This meant that American consumers and businesses would be gravely impacted by the current 245% tariff (which jumped from 145%) that Trump placed on all Chinese goods. So this exemption is crucial to the public to ensure they can continuously purchase tech goods without paying through the nose.

Is TP-Link undercutting its competitors by selling at a loss?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly opened an inquiry into TP-Link, the largest consumer router provider in the country, for unfair pricing practices and whether it poses a threat to national security.

TP-Link is known for its affordable home networking products and has reportedly cornered 65% of this market. According to Bloomberg, the DOJ is investigating whether the company achieved this through predatory pricing, wherein it sells goods at a loss to obtain a monopoly. Once it achieves that goal, it would significantly raise its prices to maximize profits at the expense of the consumer.

Aside from the Justice Department's probe, the U.S. Department of Commerce is also looking into whether TP-Link's Chinese connections affect the country's national security, especially with the brand's popularity among home users. This investigation began in late 2024, especially as the company got tied to Salt Typhoon cyberattacks allegedly backed by Beijing.

TP-Link Systems, based in Irvine, California, is the company behind the routers in the U.S. It was previously owned by TP-LINK Technologies, a Shenzhen, China-based corporation, and only fully established itself as an independent organization in October 2024. The company says it is unaware of any inquiry.

""To date, TP-Link Systems Inc. has not received any inquiry from the Department of Justice regarding these matters. As a U.S.-based company, TP-Link operates with the utmost integrity and transparency, and stands ready to cooperate fully with any government inquiries, should they arise,"" a spokesman tells Tom's Hardware.

The company claims that its products have been manufactured in its factory in Vietnam since 2018, ensuring that it has control over its supply chain. Still, U.S. officials are concerned about whether the corporate restructuring is enough to insulate it from meddling by the Chinese government, with some experts claiming that it still has a broad presence in mainland China.

""Unlike competitors, TP-Link owns its manufacturing and R&D operations, enabling cost savings and enhanced control over the security of our vertically integrated supply chain,"" the spokesman told us. ""We do not sell products below cost and maintain a policy of transparency in our business practices, ensuring fair pricing for our valued customers.""

Investigations like these could take months, if not years, to conclude, and they do not always lead to prosecution. Aside from the criminal proceedings, the DOJ also launched a parallel civil investigation, Bloomberg reported.

The Federal government is apparently doing this to hedge its bets, as Bloomberg says that criminal prosecution of predatory pricing is rather complicated — the government must prove that the company is selling at a loss and that it will recoup its losses by jacking up prices when it has a monopoly on the market. Civil cases have a lower evidentiary requirement, making it easier for the Justice Department to win its case.

If proven guilty, TP-Link could be fined up to a maximum of $100 million. Furthermore, its executives could be slapped with a $1 million penalty, plus possible imprisonment of up to 10 years.

The government actively pursued antitrust cases during the Biden administration, with Nvidia and Google being scrutinized. This policy has continued under Trump's leadership, with Director of Criminal Enforcement Emma Burnham of the DOJ Antitrust Division saying that the agency will focus on companies and individuals, including “everyday products we all rely on, as well as for vital goods and services the government needs to ensure our national security and provide critical infrastructure.”Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The leaked thermal gel should not affect the overall performance


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Gigabyte has acknowledged the recently reported thermal gel leakage issue plaguing its latest RTX 50-series graphics cards. The company's official response comes just a few days after a forum post on the Korean PC hardware community Quasar Zone showed thermal gel seeping from a recently purchased RTX 5080 card. Additionally, it was found that the issue was not limited to a particular model but nearly the entire lineup of RTX 50-series graphics cards from Gigabyte.

In its response, Gigabyte says that its Nvidia RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs utilize a specially engineered thermal conductive gel instead of traditional thermal pads. As per the company, this material is designed to provide better contact across uneven component surfaces and is applied using fully automated machinery to reduce human error.

The thermal conductivity gel solution is also said to have undergone rigorous testing and validation, including drop tests, thermal simulations under extreme conditions, and usage in both vertical and horizontal GPU orientations. That last bit is important, as the original author of the post mentioned using their Gigabyte graphics card with a riser kit in a vertical orientation.

The company explains that the thermal gel is an insulating, deformable, putty-like compound capable of withstanding temperatures up to 150°C without melting. However, Gigabyte admitted that some early production batches may have received an over-application of the gel, which could explain the visible leakage observed by users. While the company acknowledges the cosmetic irregularity, it emphasizes that the issue does not compromise performance, stability, or product lifespan.

Gigabyte also says it has since adjusted the gel application volume in newer production runs to prevent similar leakage in future shipments. Notably, the company has not announced any recall or replacement program, which isn't surprising considering the massive demand and limited supply of GPUs. Affected users are encouraged to contact regional Gigabyte customer service centers for further support.

While it is reassuring to see Gigabyte taking swift action with its response, one cannot simply overlook the incident. For most users, spending thousands of dollars on a high-end GPU comes with the expectation of flawless performance and build quality. Discovering a defect, even if cosmetic or non-critical, can shake consumer confidence, especially when it involves premium hardware.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) showed significantly lower muscle strength than matched healthy individuals, with women showing particularly worse nutritional status in terms of fat-free body mass and muscle mass and a higher incidence of sarcopenia.

""In the diagnosis of sarcopenia, clinical assessment based on BMI [body mass index] alone is insufficient; therefore, muscle strength testing should be included in the routine anthropometric evaluation of patients with IBD because of its association with low muscle mass,"" the authors wrote.

This study, led by Małgorzata Godala, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, was published online on April 17, 2025, in Nutrients.

The findings may not represent all the patients with IBD as this was a single-centre study. The sample size was relatively small, with most participants receiving biologic therapy. Additionally, the control group comprised only healthy individuals.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi, I'm Dr Lucas. I'm board certified in internal medicine and obesity medicine.

Loss of muscle is expected from weight loss with any mechanism, be it surgery, diet, or medication. It's generally accepted from historical data that muscle mass accounts for around 25% of the total weight that is lost.

It's important to mention, though, that muscle mass most commonly comes from estimations rather than direct measurement. DEXA scans and bioelectrical impedance scans are the most common methods for assessing body composition, and therefore, providing muscle mass estimates. With these technologies, lean body mass and fat-free mass are calculated as proxies for muscle mass.

The newer class of anti-obesity medications has generated renewed interest in the loss of muscle that can occur with weight loss. Among patients without diabetes, lean body mass was found to account for 40% of the total weight that was lost with semaglutide, which is Wegovy. This fraction is higher than what was seen with tirzepatide, which is called Zepbound, where around 25% of the total weight that was lost came from lean body mass.

For most people, the clinical benefits achieved with medication-supported weight loss far outshine the risks related to loss of muscle. However, because muscle mass and strength are both important for optimal health and because both will decline with age, a comprehensive approach to weight loss should include regular strength training and adequate protein intake, which both have many benefits besides their effects on muscle mass and strength.

Radiofrequency microtenotomy using the Topaz technique led to significant pain reduction, functional improvement, and low complication rates in patients with chronic plantar fasciopathy who were unresponsive to conservative treatments.

""The Topaz technique radiofrequency appears to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of chronic plantar fasciopathy, particularly in patients unresponsive to conservative therapies.

According to the authors, a primary limitation was the relative novelty of the Topaz technique, leading to a paucity of clinical evidence. The lack of standardization in postoperative rehabilitation protocols — such as variations in weight-bearing progression, physical therapy approaches, and follow-up durations — may have influenced reported outcomes. Additionally, the exact biological mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of the Topaz technique have not been fully elucidated.

Cannabis-related emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations increased more than 26-fold over a 13-year period among individuals aged 65 years or older and were associated with a significantly higher risk of dementia than visits for all-cause acute care, a new study showed.

“Regular cannabis use might directly increase the risk for dementia through changes in brain structure. It's also possible that regular cannabis use increases the risk of other established risk factors for dementia, including high blood pressure, head trauma and other injuries, and a higher risk for depression and social isolation,” co-investigator Colleen Webber, PhD, Bruyère Health Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, said in a press release.

The study was led by Daniel T. Myran, MD, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on April 14 in JAMA Neurology.

The study did not examine patterns of cannabis use that did not require acute medical attention. Detailed data on the duration, frequency, and type of cannabis use were not available. Additionally, residual confounding and reverse causation were possible.

You are 50 years old, otherwise healthy, and have not yet undergone any cancer screening. Recently however, you hear some of your colleagues at work discussing cancer screening tests, and how cancer incidence has been increasing. This news makes you feel a bit uneasy, and you begin to contemplate if you should also get tested, even though you have no symptoms. 

On the way home, you see a billboard for a nearby cancer center that says, “Ranked Among the Top 10 Cancer Centers in the Country, Five Years in a Row!” You think, “Wow, this is one of the best cancer centers in the country. Thank God, I live nearby, I could be treated here if I got cancer one day.” 

Once home, you reflect on the day and check out the cancer center's website, hoping to get more information. But are you getting unbiased information on screening? Is this a reliable source for when to start and stop screening, what screening tests to use, and how often? Is the website providing enough information on the benefits and harms of screening for you to make an informed decision on the matter?

That's what we aimed to discover in our research project — the results of which have just been published. In the paper, we compare the screening recommendations for lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, and cervical cancers at the Top Ten US Cancer Centers with those of the US Preventive Services Task Force (UPSTSF) — an independent organization of multi-disciplinary national experts in disease prevention and evidence-based medicine. The USPSTF publishes evidence-based recommendations on screening tests for various conditions, including cancer. Unlike other society-specific recommendations — such as the American College of Gastroenterology colonoscopy screening guidelines, for example — USPSTF experts have no conflicts of interest influencing their recommendations and the USPSTF screening recommendations are considered the gold standard. 

Here's what our analysis revealed: The screening recommendations from the Top Ten US Cancer Centers often differ from the USPSTF recommendations. This discordance was almost always in the direction of the cancer centers recommending more screening than the USPSTF. The difference was most notable for prostate and breast cancers and to a lesser extent colorectal and cervical cancers. Lung cancer screening recommendations from cancer centers were generally congruent with USPSTF guidance.

What does it mean that top cancer centers recommend more screening? These elite centers either recommend starting screening at an earlier age and stopping at a later age or not stopping at all. The centers often listed more modalities than USPSTF recommended for screening, such as MRI as well as mammogram when a mammogram is sufficient and less expensive. Many of these centers also promoted executive physicals that include several cancer screening tests under a flat-fee package, with costs ranging from $1700 to $10,000.

A major issue with recommending more screening is that all screening tests come with harms. These harms can manifest, for instance, as overdiagnoses. Overdiagnoses occur when the screening test detects false positives — lesions that look like cancer but are not, in fact, cancers. False positives not only lead to overtreatment but also unnecessary anxiety. Patients ultimately receive unnecessary medical interventions — biopsy, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, for instance — to assess or treat lesions that don't need to be treated. 

Despite the potential harms of screening that need to be considered alongside the benefits, the Top Ten Cancer Center websites primarily focused on the importance of getting screened, with only one center also highlighting the potential harms of breast cancer screening.

Furthermore, we found that very few of these websites referred patients to the USPSTF recommendations, and none included metrics on the benefits vs risks of screening — such as the number needed to screen or the number needed to harm — to help people understand the trade-offs.

This discordance and lack of transparency matters, especially if these cancer centers are being promoted as the cream of the crop. Because these centers are viewed by the public as trustworthy resources, when their screening recommendations don't align with the gold standard, it exacerbates public misunderstanding of the risks and benefits of screening and can foster mistrust of the system.

I have observed this misunderstanding in my own practice. I have been treating a 82-year-old patient with metastatic colon cancer who is on her third line of chemotherapy. One day, she tells me she cannot make her chemotherapy appointment the following week because she has a mammogram on the same day. Not only is this patient beyond the recommended age for a mammogram, but the likelihood that detecting a breast tumor would affect her prognosis during her treatment for metastatic colon cancer is as low as it can be in medicine. 

This type of confusion is not unusual. Studies have shown that patients often overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of screening. What we don't want is for top cancer centers to perpetuate these misunderstandings.

Ultimately, I think we need to ask ourselves what “Top Ten” even means. The phrase indicates top quality, but if accurate guidance on cancer screening is a metric, then these centers fail. 

It is also clear that there is a huge conflict of interest at play here — recommending more tests and doing more screening generates more revenue, but is that in the best interest of the public? 

Our society rewards doing more, but in medicine, oftentimes, less is more. And doing more with no benefit should be considered a poor performance metric, not plugged as the right care. It definitely does not speak of “Top Quality.”","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

A significant proportion of patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation as part of the CABANA trial had a high probability of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). These patients experienced greater benefits from AF ablation for cardiovascular outcomes and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status than patients with a low probability of HFpEF.

“Identifying patients with HFpEF might allow for the initiation of disease-modifying therapies that are known to improve HFpEF status,” authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Pieter Martens, MD, PhD, of the Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg in Genk, Belgium. It was published online on April 16, 2025, in JACC: Heart Failure.

The H2FPEF score was not calculable for all the patients owing to missing data. H2FPEF scores of 4 or 5 may not necessarily rule out HFpEF. The observed benefits of AF ablation may or may not be additive to those of emerging pharmacotherapies for HFpEF.

Radiologic imaging identified unexpected findings in nearly half of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cases, which led to changes in clinical management for 47%, in a retrospective cohort study.

“In high-risk cSCC tumors, radiologic imaging reveals unexpected findings in nearly half of cases and significantly changes management,” authors of the study wrote. “These findings reinforce the need for consistent imaging, particularly of the local site and nodal basins, in the evaluation of all high-risk cSCCs to aid accurate staging and treatment planning,” they added.

The study was led by Angela H. Wei, MD, Department of Dermatology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland. It was published online on April 17 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

The single-institution retrospective design was a limitation. The selection of tumors for imaging was not standardized, and advancements in imaging technology over the study period could have influenced results.

Even without accounting for veterinary or pharmaceutical waste, human antibiotic use alone is pushing rivers past ecological tipping points, putting global water systems and health at risk.



Contaminant pathways of antibiotics in the global aquatic environment. Modeled contaminant pathways and mass balances of antibiotics by path. Values in parentheses indicate total amounts of the top 40 antibiotics consumed worldwide in tonnes year−1; percentage values are relative to the total excretion amount (20,500 tonnes year−1).

In a recent article published in the journal PNAS Nexus, researchers estimated the quantities of the 40 antibiotics most commonly used by humans that reach oceans and rivers, with a focus on domestic sources.

Their analysis underscores the urgent need for global strategies to control pollution. It suggests that 8,500 tons of antibiotics reach river systems each year and that six million kilometers of global rivers exceed safe levels for promoting resistance and harming ecosystem health.

Antibiotic contamination in natural waters is increasingly reported in sediments, groundwater, and surface water, raising concerns for both human and environmental health. Even at low levels, antibiotics can facilitate the development of resistance genes, reduce microbial diversity, and have a negative impact on aquatic life.

Understanding antibiotic pollution is critical because antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to become a leading global health threat. Antibiotics enter the environment due to incomplete human metabolism, insufficient removal in wastewater systems, and widespread use in animal farming, aquaculture, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Industrial sources are somewhat regulated, but household and hospital wastewater, both important point sources, are often inadequately treated. An estimated half of the wastewater from these sources is released without treatment globally.

Since global human antibiotic use has surged, increasing by 65% between 2000 and 2015 and by 114% in low-income countries, concerns about the growing environmental load are intensifying. Advanced treatment technologies exist but are not widely implemented. Moreover, some antibiotic residues may persist in sediments or transform into other biologically active forms.

Direct global monitoring of antibiotics is limited by high costs and complexity, making regular tracking difficult. As an alternative, contaminant fate models can simulate the environmental fate of chemicals, helping identify high-risk regions.



Environmental exposure levels of antibiotics in global rivers. Total risk quotient (RQtot) is calculated as the sum of individual risk quotients of all 40 antibiotics in the global river system under low-flow conditions. Rivers in gray present insignificant risk (RQtot < 0.01). Only rivers exceeding a long-term average flow of 0.1 m3 s−1 are shown.

In this analysis, researchers used a contaminant fate model called HydroFATE to assess whether antibiotics from human use alone pose a threat to river systems globally, based on data from 23.8 million kilometers of river networks.

They estimated the antibiotic emissions from human activity by combining population distributions, per capita antibiotic use, and human metabolism rates. The fate of these substances was modeled based on their pathways, including treated and untreated wastewater, as well as natural land attenuation.

River networks were simulated to track contaminant transport by calculating how antibiotic loads accumulated downstream, incorporating instream decay and lake removal. Concentrations in rivers were computed as the total load divided by local river discharge.

The research team then validated the models by comparing the results with measured antibiotic concentrations at 877 global sites for 21 compounds. The model used the lowest monthly river flow between 1971 and 2000 to simulate risk under plausible but impactful conditions.

Environmental exposure was assessed using risk quotients (RQi), calculated as the ratio of modeled concentrations to ecological or resistance-promoting thresholds. These were summed into a total risk quotient (RQtot) to capture cumulative impacts.

The exposure faced by humans in terms of health impacts was evaluated using the equivalent dose concentration as a proportion of the defined daily dose and assessed against chronic exposure thresholds. The highest percentile of dose concentrations was used to estimate high-risk human exposure scenarios, assuming untreated water consumption.



Annual consumption of the 40 antibiotics selected for inclusion in this study, aggregated by country. Reported values are from Klein et al. (20), and extrapolated values were calculated based on the methodology described in the paper.

The researchers estimated that global antibiotic consumption was 32,200 tons per year, with 29,200 tons attributed to the top 40 most commonly used antibiotics. After accounting for additional countries, the estimate rose to 30,300 tons.

Of this amount, 68%, or 20,500 tons per year, is excreted, and approximately 29%, or 8,500 tons per year, is estimated to be released into the river system. Only 43% of domestic antibiotic loads are treated through wastewater systems.

Centralized plants eliminate 72% of incoming antibiotics but still contribute 17% of emissions. Decentralized and untreated systems contribute 29% and 54%, respectively. Most removal occurs through instream decay (48%) and lake retention (13%).

Under conditions of low flow, 49% of the global river length posed no risk, 9% had a low risk, 17% had a medium risk, and 25% had a high to very high risk. About 3.8 million kilometers of rivers had one or more substances that exceeded individual risk thresholds, and 0.7 million kilometers were contaminated by ten or more high-risk antibiotics.

Countries like India, Pakistan, and China showed extensive river lengths at high risk, largely driven by common antibiotics such as amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime, which were the main contributors by river length exceeding individual high-risk thresholds, although other antibiotics like ciprofloxacin were also significant contributors in specific regions or for human health risk assessment.

For human health exposure, 1.4% of global rivers fell within the highest antibiotic dose percentile, potentially affecting over 750 million people under conditions where untreated water was consumed.

The study finds that human antibiotic use poses significant risks to rivers globally, with even greater risks likely in areas where veterinary use, pharmaceutical waste, and inadequate wastewater treatment are also present.

While industrial discharge, aquaculture, and agriculture are key contributors, these were not included in the models due to limitations in data availability. Seasonal peaks and extreme weather events could also lead to higher local concentrations.

Despite its constraints, the model reliably estimates long-term risks and highlights the urgent need for improved wastewater management, stricter regulations, and responsible antibiotic use. Policies should prioritize high-risk regions, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and adopt a OneHealth approach in drug approval to protect ecosystems and public health.

A new study shows that chitosan helps rats expel ingested microplastics more efficiently, opening the door to dietary interventions that could reduce the health risks of plastic buildup in the digestive tract.

Study: Ingesting chitosan can promote excretion of microplastics. Image Credit: EvergreenPlanet / Shutterstock

Microplastics in the environment can enter the human body through diet and trigger various health complications. Researchers at Tokai University in Japan found that a non-digestible dietary fiber, chitosan, can promote the fecal excretion of microplastics in rats. The findings are published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Microplastics are tiny plastic fragments with a diameter of 5 millimeters or less. Primary microplastics, which are used as scrubbing agents in facial cleansers and toothpaste, can enter water bodies through household drains and sewage treatment systems. Secondary microplastics, on the other hand, originate from the breakdown of larger plastic materials, such as plastic bags, polyethylene terephthalate bottles, and cigarette filters.

Secondary microplastics are produced in larger quantities in the ocean and substantially impact the homeostasis of the marine ecosystem. Several studies have indicated the presence of secondary microplastics in fish and seafood products, as well as in everyday human food products, such as salt, mineral water, and other beverages.

Microplastics have also been identified in various human organs and feces. The accumulation of these substances in the human body following ingestion has been found to increase the risk of various health complications, including cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, stroke, atherosclerosis, and gastrointestinal disorders. The paper notes that rapid excretion via the digestive tract is critical.

This highlights the need for developing interventions that can promote the excretion of microplastics through the digestive tract. In this context, non-digestible dietary components, such as indigestible dextrin, lactosucrose, chitosan, and eggshell membrane proteins, may offer potential benefits by remaining in the gastrointestinal tract in an undigested form and modulating the intestinal absorption of digested dietary components.

In this study, Di Liu and Muneshige Shimizu from Tokai University conducted a study in rats to explore whether the ingestion of non-digestible dietary components promotes the fecal excretion of microplastics.

The study included 30 rats divided into four experimental and one control group. The experimental group rats were fed with indigestible dextrin, lactosucrose, chitosan, or eggshell membrane, mixed with polyethylene microplastics (average particle size of 200 μm) in a standard rodent diet. The control group rats received only polyethylene microplastics in a standard rodent diet.

Fecal samples, blood samples, and internal organs were collected from the rats for biochemical analyses and measurement of microplastics.

The microplastic-supplemented diet used in the study resulted in a continuous increase in rat body weight in both experimental and control groups. However, a significant increase in fecal weight was observed from the first day onwards only in rats administered with chitosan. Additionally, the weight of the gastrointestinal tract itself was significantly higher in both the chitosan group and the indigestible dextrin group compared to the control group at the end of the experiment.

The chitosan-fed rats also exhibited significantly higher fecal excretion rate of microplastics throughout the experimental period (one week) compared to other experimental and control rats. Notably, the calculated fecal excretion rate for the chitosan group over 144 hours was 115.6% ± 4.5%. The paper suggests that this figure exceeding 100% likely stems from methodological limitations, such as not analyzing the entire fecal sample, indicating a need for further refinement of measurement techniques.

Regarding gastrointestinal retention of microplastics, rats fed chitosan exhibited a significantly lower rate compared to those in the control group (6.1% vs 12.1%). The paper noted that MPs remaining in the gut were found mainly in the cecum.

Furthermore, during this 1-week experiment, no significant differences were observed in plasma total cholesterol (T-cho) and triglyceride (TG) levels among any of the groups, including the control group receiving MPs.

This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that chitosan, a non-digestible dietary fiber, can facilitate rapid fecal excretion of ingested microplastics in rats. Specifically, the study finds that chitosan, when mixed with microplastics in a standard rodent diet, can increase fecal excretion and reduce intestinal retention of microplastics.

Previous studies investigating the effect of chitosan on the fecal excretion rate of oil have shown that this high-molecular-weight non-digestible dietary fiber forms gel aggregates with oil and bile salts, which in turn facilitate higher oil excretion.

Regarding the mode of action of chitosan, existing evidence suggests that it dissolves in gastric juices and becomes a positively charged dietary fiber that binds to negatively charged bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract. Besides chemical interactions, chitosan has been found to bind to its substrate through physical interactions as well.

These observations may explain the mode of action of chitosan, which is associated with higher fecal excretion of microplastics. However, polyethylene microplastics used in this study are nonpolar in nature, which makes it unlikely that they will have strong chemical interactions with chitosan based on charge. Further research is needed to understand the mode of action and the effect of chitosan on different types and sizes of microplastics.

The lower intestinal retention rate of microplastics observed in this study further highlights the highest influence of chitosan on fecal microplastic excretion compared to other non-digestible dietary components tested. Given a previous observation that chitosan is excreted into feces by binding to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract, the researchers hypothesize that chitosan absorbs microplastics and cholesterol, subsequently facilitating their fecal excretion.

Notably, the study finds that approximately 12% of microplastics remain in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily the cecum, even after seven days of ingestion in the control group. Chitosan-mediated fecal excretion of microplastics can, therefore, serve as a promising intervention to reduce health adversities associated with prolonged intestinal presence of microplastics.

Researchers using next-generation DNA sequencing have identified four specific genes whose mutations are linked to the development and progression of lethal stomach cancers. This could potentially enable doctors to offer targeted treatments that would spare many patients from unnecessarily aggressive procedures, according to a study scheduled for presentation at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2025.

Not all stomach cancers are equal. Today, most gastric cancers are treated the same way - with surgery and chemotherapy - but we hope to identify key molecular differences so we can tailor treatment to the biology of each patient's tumor.""

Ulysses Ribeiro, MD, PhD, study's lead author and professor at the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo, Brazil

Researchers analyzed 21 genes in tumor samples from 87 patients who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for gastric cancer and then tracked how the mutations related to survival. About one-third of the patients had changes in a specific combination of four genes - BRCA2, CDH1, RHOA, and TP53 - and these patients were more likely to experience a return of their cancer or die from the disease. These mutations included both well-established cancer drivers - such as BRCA2 mutations, which are famously linked to breast and ovarian cancer - as well as previously unknown variants that may be important.

Dr. Ribeiro said the findings support the idea that a more personalized approach - guided by the genetic makeup of each patient's tumor - may lead to better outcomes and, for some patients, less aggressive treatment.

To help bring this kind of testing closer to everyday care, Dr. Ribeiro and his colleagues are also working to match these genetic findings with widely available lab tests that use immunohistochemistry to detect proteins expressed by genes. That step could make it easier and more affordable to screen tumors for high-risk features in the future.

The study focused on patients from a Western population - a group that has been underrepresented in gastric cancer research. Most past studies have been conducted in East Asia, where the disease is more common.

While more research is needed before these findings change medical practice, they offer a promising path forward, Dr. Ribeiro said. ""We believe that these findings move us closer to more personalized treatment based on each tumor's biology.""

Dr. Ribeiro will present data from the study, ""Next-generation DNA sequencing identifies somatic mutations associated to prognosis in gastric cancer patients,"" abstract 152, at 10:24 a.m. PDT, Saturday, May 3.

Young children with chronic conditions are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) than healthy children, according to a new study. The research will be presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2025 Meeting, held April 24-28 in Honolulu. 

Toddlers with chronic conditions are hospitalized for RSV at twice the rate as healthy toddlers over their first two seasons. The risk was highest for children born very prematurely under 28 weeks of gestation, or with conditions affecting multiple organs, the lungs, heart, or digestive system.

Researchers recommend that children with those specific conditions receive immunization against RSV in their first season to increase protection, even if their mother was vaccinated. Current guidelines suggest pregnant women should receive vaccination before birth to pass on antibodies.

Our research finds that many children with chronic conditions require seasonal RSV immunization beyond the period of protection that can be achieved with maternal vaccination. It expands current definitions from traditionally defined high-risk groups to other children with chronic conditions that could equally benefit from RSV immunization, up to two years of age. Our study underscores the importance of children with chronic conditions getting immunized against RSV in their second season, and in their first season even if their mother was vaccinated.""

In a powerful natural experiment using Australian health data, researchers found that being eligible for the shingles vaccine may reduce dementia diagnoses, strengthening the case for preventive strategies in brain health.

In a recent study published in the JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association), an international team of researchers determined whether eligibility for herpes zoster (HZ) (virus that causes shingles) vaccination based on date of birth influenced the likelihood of receiving a new dementia (memory loss and thinking problems) diagnosis.

Dementia affects over 55 million people globally, posing a growing public health crisis. While age remains the strongest risk factor, infections may also play a role. One underexplored link is between HZ and dementia. HZ results from reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, a neurotropic virus that can affect the central nervous system. Vaccination against HZ might not only prevent shingles but also lower dementia risk, possibly through immune modulation. A previous quasi-experiment in Wales found this association, but replication is essential across diverse populations and health systems. Further research is needed to validate these findings globally.

To ensure the finding was specific to dementia, researchers checked if vaccine eligibility affected 15 other common conditions like heart disease or diabetes; it did not show a significant impact on those diagnoses.

The present study employed a quasi-experimental design using primary care data from 65 general practices across Australia, facilitated by the health informatics platform PenCS. The analysis leveraged a natural eligibility cutoff created by the National Immunisation Programme, which began offering the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax) free of charge on November 1, 2016, to individuals aged 70 to 79 years. Eligibility was determined by birthdate: individuals born on or after November 2, 1936, were eligible, while those born before were not. This setup allowed for a comparison between groups that were nearly identical in age and baseline health, differing primarily in vaccine access.

Patient records included diagnosis histories, immunizations, prescriptions, and demographic details. Dates of birth were coded by week, and all diagnoses, including dementia, were identified using open-ended text fields provided by general practitioners. Patients aged 50 or older as of November 1, 2016, and with at least one clinical visit between 1993 and 2024 were included.

The primary outcome was the first recorded diagnosis of dementia during a 7.4-year follow-up period. The main exposure was eligibility for HZ vaccination based on birthdate. Statistical analysis centered on regression discontinuity (RD), comparing individuals born just before and after the eligibility threshold. This method controls for both observed and unobserved variables, assuming no abrupt changes other than vaccination status. Secondary analyses used time-to-event models, including accelerated failure time and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, along with robustness checks across multiple bandwidths and modeling strategies. All analyses were conducted using R statistical software.

It is important to note that the effect measured in this study is for eligibility for HZ vaccination, not for confirmed receipt of the vaccine, because vaccination status is likely underreported in the primary care data used. Due to this underreporting, the study authors did not attempt to estimate the effect of actually receiving the vaccine, as this could overstate the results.

Additionally, the study population was drawn from practices that agreed to participate and use the PenCS platform, so the data are not fully representative of all Australian primary care patients. The effect estimate is also ""local,"" applying most clearly to individuals who were around 79 to 80 years old at the time the HZ vaccination program began.

The protective effect observed in this study specifically pertains to the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax), as the newer recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) was not widely used in Australia during the study period.

The study confirmed that the effect wasn't just a statistical fluke tied to the year, as testing the same analysis method on birth dates in surrounding years (1933-1935, 1937-1939) revealed only the actual 1936 vaccine eligibility date showed a significant link to lower dementia rates.

Data from 101,219 patients were analyzed, focusing on 18,402 patients born within 482 weeks of the November 2, 1936, eligibility threshold. The mean age in this subset was 77 years, with 54.3% of the participants being women. The probability of receiving the HZ vaccine jumped from 6.5% among ineligible individuals to 30.2% among eligible individuals, confirming that the date-of-birth rule effectively differentiated vaccine exposure.

Importantly, no differences were observed in prior health conditions, uptake of other preventive services, or dementia risk factors across the eligibility threshold, supporting the validity of the natural experiment. Regression discontinuity analysis showed that eligibility for HZ vaccination led to a statistically significant 1.8 percentage point reduction in the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis over 7.4 years (95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 3.3; P = .01). The protective effect was consistent across alternative follow-up durations, grace periods, and model specifications.

Additional checks, including those limited to frequent primary care users and time-to-event models, supported the primary findings. No effects were observed on other common diagnoses or preventive health behaviors, indicating the result was specific to dementia. Comparative RD using an additional ineligible cohort yielded a similar effect size of 1.5 percentage points. Kaplan-Meier plots and cumulative incidence curves further showed the delayed onset of dementia in vaccine-eligible individuals.

The study ruled out confounding by confirming that no other interventions used the same date-of-birth eligibility rule and demonstrating that the effect was unique to the 1936 birth threshold. Analyses shifting the threshold to nearby years showed no similar effect, further validating the causal interpretation.

It is also important to note that dementia diagnoses are substantially underdetected in the primary care data analyzed. For example, only about 1.4% of patients older than 65 in the PenCS dataset had a dementia diagnosis, compared to an estimated 8.4% prevalence in the general Australian population. This underdiagnosis means that the absolute effect size observed may not fully reflect the impact of HZ vaccination on dementia risk in the broader population.

These findings, when combined with similar research from Wales, provide consistent and compelling evidence that HZ vaccination may help prevent or delay the onset of dementia.

To summarize, this study demonstrated that individuals eligible for free HZ vaccination due to their date of birth had a significantly lower likelihood of being diagnosed with dementia over a 7.4-year follow-up period. The use of a quasi-experimental design allowed for a comparison between nearly identical groups, minimizing confounding and providing stronger causal inference than traditional observational studies. These findings highlight the potential for HZ vaccination to serve as a low-cost intervention for dementia prevention. However, further studies in additional populations, as well as mechanistic and clinical research, are needed to explore the biological pathways, generalizability, and policy implications of these promising results.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Heart failure patients benefit from medically tailored meals after discharge","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250424/Heart-failure-patients-benefit-from-medically-tailored-meals-after-discharge.aspx","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 01:09:00 GMT","

A new study, published in BMC Nutrition, demonstrates that providing medically tailored meals (MTM) to patients with heart failure (HF) and malnutrition risk following hospital discharge significantly improves their nutritional status and keeps hospital readmission rates well below local and national averages.

The study compared the impact of delivering seven versus 21 MTM per week over a four-week period. A research team, led by Penn Nursing's Charlene Compher, PhD, RD, LDN, FASPEN, the Shearer Chair of Healthy Community Practices, Professor of Nutrition Science, and Director of Nutrition programs in the Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, enrolled 46 patients discharged from the hospital with HF and malnutrition risk. The research team conducted telephone surveys at baseline, 30-, and 60-days post-discharge to assess changes in malnutrition risk, adherence to American Heart Association (AHA) dietary guidelines, sarcopenia risk, and 30-day readmissions.

In collaboration with the Metropolitan Area Neighborhood Nutrition Alliance (MANNA) and the Clinical Nutrition Support Service at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania – the study revealed that patients receiving at least seven MTM per week experienced a significant reduction in malnutrition and sarcopenia risk. Notably, adherence to AHA diet goals improved over time, regardless of whether patients received seven or 21 meals. The 30-day readmission rates were significantly lower than the national average, at nine percent for those receiving 21 MTM and 12.5 percent for those receiving seven MTM.

Our findings suggest that even a modest intervention of seven medically tailored meals per week can have a profound positive impact on the health and recovery of heart failure patients. This intervention not only improves nutritional outcomes and diet adherence but also keeps hospital readmissions low, which translates to better patient care and lower healthcare costs.""

Charlene Compher, PhD, RD, LDN, FASPEN, Penn Nursing

The researchers concluded that the provision of at least seven MTM per week in the immediate post-discharge period is a promising strategy to improve malnutrition and sarcopenia risk, enhance diet adherence, and maintain readmission rates below national averages for patients with HF and malnutrition risk.

Huo Xue Tong Luo Capsule (HXTL) has been clinically used to treat osteonecrosis of the femoral head, osteoporosis, and other bone and joint diseases with promising effects. Our previous study has shown that HXTL can promote osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting lncRNA-Miat expression through histone modifications. However, the mechanism by which HXTL treats postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) remains unclear. In this study, we used network pharmacology-based mechanism prediction, molecular docking, and pharmacological validation to investigate the mechanism of HXTL in treating PMOP.

The key candidate targets and relevant signaling pathways of HXTL for PMOP treatment were predicted using network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis. RAW264.7 cells were used for Western blot to validate the predicted mechanistic pathways. The ovaries of mice were surgically removed to simulate PMOP. The effect of HXTL on PMOP was evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunohistochemical assays in vivo.

Network pharmacology analysis suggested that HXTL interacted with 215 key targets linked to PMOP, primarily affecting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that the main components of HXTL exhibited strong binding affinity to NFATc1, p-PI3K, and p-AKT1. Furthermore, our in vitro results confirmed that HXTL suppressed the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. In vivo, HE and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining results showed that HXTL inhibited osteoclast formation and protected bone mass.

This research demonstrated that HXTL could inhibit osteoclast formation and prevent bone loss induced by ovariectomy in mice by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings provide important evidence for the clinical application of HXTL in treating PMOP.

Indiana University School of Medicine scientists have developed a powerful new imaging technique to study bone marrow in mouse models. By overcoming key challenges unique to imaging this complex tissue, this advancement could support future drug development and therapies for conditions involving bone marrow, including cancers, autoimmune diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.

The new method was made possible by the multiplex imaging tool Phenocycler 2.0, which enabled researchers to visualize a record number of cellular markers within intact bone marrow tissue from mice. The findings were recently published in Leukemia.

Bone marrow is difficult to study because it is gelatinous and encased in hard bone. Since bone marrow plays an important role in blood and immune cell formation and houses valuable stem cells, our unique imaging approach offers a useful tool for a variety of research applications.""

Sonali Karnik, PhD, assistant research professor of orthopedic surgery at the IU School of Medicine and co-lead author of the study

Traditional tools like flow cytometry and standard fluorescence imaging are considered the most established methods for tissue analysis. However, flow cytometry requires disrupting complex tissues to study and quantify cell populations, and standard fluorescent imaging is limited to detecting only three cellular markers at a time. In contrast, the new methodology allowed the researchers to visualize 25 different cellular markers in intact bone marrow tissue without disruption, providing a more comprehensive view of the bone marrow to enhance the understanding of disease behaviors and the development of more effective treatments.

While the tool has previously been used to study organs like the spleen and kidney, the IU Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology team is the first to successfully apply it to mouse bone marrow. 

""Because mouse models are widely used to study human diseases, this technique offers a promising new method for investigating a range of conditions like autoimmune diseases, leukemia and other disorders involving bone marrow,"" said Reuben Kapur, PhD, a co-senior author on the study, director of the IU School of Medicine's Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research and co-director of the IU Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology.

The IU Innovation and Commercialization Office has filed a provisional patent for the new imaging methodology, and the team is now working to expand the marker panel to include additional features such as bone, nerves, muscle and more immune and signaling cell types.

Additional IU study authors include Connor Gulbronson, Paige C. Jordan, Rahul Kanumuri, Baskar Ramdas, Ramesh Kumar, Melissa L. Hartman, Izza Khurram, Drew M. Brown, Karen E. Pollok, Pratibha Singh and Melissa A. Kacena.

This research was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New biomarker offers hope for early Parkinson's diagnosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250425/New-biomarker-offers-hope-for-early-Parkinsone28099s-diagnosis.aspx","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:08:00 GMT","

A misfolded protein facilitates reliable diagnosis even in the early stages of Parkinson's disease in body fluids.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is usually diagnosed in its late stage on the basis of clinical symptoms, mainly motor disorders. By this point, however, the brain is already severely and irreparably damaged. Moreover, diagnosis is difficult and often incorrect because the disease takes many forms and symptoms overlap with other disorders. Researchers from the PRODI Center for Protein Diagnostics at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, and the biotech company betaSENSE have now discovered a biomarker in the spinal fluid that facilitates a reliable diagnosis at an early stage and can shed light on the progression of the disease and the effect of a therapy. They report their findings in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine from April 25, 2025.

Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic nerve cells in the brain, which usually leads to increasing motor impairments as the symptoms progress. Dopamine supplements can compensate for the loss and temporarily alleviate the symptoms. The misfolding of the key protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) from α-helical structures to β-sheet-rich structures plays a crucial role in the development of Parkinson's disease.

These misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes, so-called oligomers. The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain.""

Professor Klaus Gerwert, founding and managing director at PRODI and CEO of betaSENSE

In two independent clinical cohorts with a total of 134 participants, the Bochum-based researchers showed that, with a sensitivity and specificity of well over 90 percent, this misfolding of αSyn in body-fluids is a viable biomarker for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The research was conducted using cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients at the Parkinson's centers in Bochum (St. Josef Hospital, Professor Lars Tönges, Professor Ralf Gold) and Kassel (Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Dr. Sandrina Weber, Professor Brit Mollenhauer). The measurements were carried out using the patented iRS (immuno-infrared sensor) technology from betaSENSE GmbH.

betaSENSE has already successfully implemented the iRS technology for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. In this case, it was shown that the misfolding of the biomarker Aβ can indicate the risk of Alzheimer's dementia at a later stage with high accuracy up to 17 years before clinical diagnosis. ""We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson's for the misfolding of αSyn,"" stresses Klaus Gerwert.

In addition to diagnostic applications, the technology can also help to develop new active substances and prove their efficacy in clinical trials.

Solenoid pumps and Fluid Metering pumps are two popular options for microfluidic management. This article examines their key differences across various application scenarios, highlighting which is better suited to different project requirements.



Image Credit: Fluid Metering, Inc.

The key difference between solenoid pumps and Fluid Metering pumps lies in their operating mechanisms.

Solenoid pumps are driven by an electromagnet made up of a copper wire coil wrapped around a metal plunger. When electrical current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field that moves the plunger up and down, assisted by a spring.

In contrast, Fluid Metering pumps use a motor to drive a rotating, reciprocating piston to deliver fluid.



Image Credit: Fluid Metering, Inc.

A solenoid pump's internal valves are predisposed to clogging, resulting in pump seizures and compromised precision. The solenoid's springs can also weaken and break with wear and tear, or they trap debris and contaminants. These factors adversely affect pump performance over time as the springs lose their tension.

Fluid Metering's pumps feature simpler, valveless designs able to prevent clogging while ensuring long-term reliability.

Their high-precision Cerampump® construction and patented adjustment method also afford Fluid Metering pumps the necessary boost to achieve more precise fluid delivery while enabling more accurate and consistent fluid dispensing versus solenoid pumps.

Solenoid pumps can achieve a range of flow rates depending on their size, typically from a few milliliters per minute to a few liters per minute. Fluid Metering pumps generally offer flow rates ranging from a few milliliters per minute to just over 1 liter per minute.

When it comes to flow rate ranges for microfluidic applications, solenoid and Fluid Metering pumps may seem evenly matched at first glance. However, solenoid pumps need to be manufactured in different sizes to accommodate various flow rates.

In contrast, Fluid Metering pumps can cover a wider range of flow rates with a single pump, eliminating the need to use multiple pumps for different flow requirements.

Solenoid pumps inherently produce significant pulsation due to their spring-plunger design. While Fluid Metering pumps also generate some degree of pulsatile flow, there are several effective system modification strategies that can be used to help minimize this pulsation.

The high and unavoidable pulsation levels produced by solenoid pumps make them unsuitable for certain applications. In contrast, the pulsation levels in Fluid Metering pump systems can be significantly reduced, allowing for smoother operation.

Solenoid pumps are generally manufactured from standard plastics and rubber diaphragms, while Fluid Metering pumps boast a ceramic construction that is chemically inert.

Solenoid pumps offer only limited chemical compatibility. They typically struggle with viscous fluids due to increased flow resistance and internal valve clogging. Fluid Metering pumps, however, can handle harsh chemicals more effectively, including fluids of varying viscosities.

Solenoid pumps require regular valve inspections and frequent diaphragm replacements to maintain proper operation and prevent clogging. Fluid Metering pumps, by comparison, deliver 0.5 % precision over millions of cycles without the need for maintenance or recalibration.

Solenoid pumps tend to have a lower initial cost, but their ongoing maintenance requirements and potential for downtime increase costs while yielding a lower lifespan of just a few years.

Fluid metering pumps require little to no maintenance; however, they have an extended lifespan generally equal to or longer than the life of the instrument in which they are installed. This makes Fluid Metering pumps a more cost-effective option in the long run.

Solenoid pumps can be designed to accommodate similar flow rates, but Fluid Metering pumps can handle wider ranges with the same pump, making them the ideal choice for applications requiring reliable precision, high accuracy, long life, chemical inertness, and the ability to pump viscous fluids at high pressure.

Morgan announced her pregnancy last September, while sharing the news of her retirement. 

Former United States Women's National Team (USWNT) forward Alex Morgan has taken to social media to share the first images of her second child.

The 35-year-old announced her pregnancy last September, at the same time she shared her heartfelt decision to retire from football.

This week, Morgan posted images of newborn son Enzo, alongside daughter Charlie and husband Servando Carrasco.

“Adjusting to life as a family of four has been a beautiful whirlwind,” she told PEOPLE.

“Watching Charlie step into the big sis role has been so special… we're soaking in every second.”

It comes following the birth announcement last month, where proud parents Morgan and Carrasco posted an image on Instagram with the caption: “Welcome to the world, baby Enzo.”

She has been documenting the journey post-retirement to share with fans, including a subtle gender reveal in January.

The importance of family has been a cornerstone of Morgan's career.

Back in her retirement announcement, she said of the pregnancy: “As unexpected as this came, we are so overjoyed.

“To me, family means everything. I wouldn't be here without my husband and my family uplifting, motivating, encouraging, and supporting me and sacrificing for me for the last 15 years as a professional athlete.”

Her nation's fifth-highest goal scorer, she is still heavily involved in the progress of women's football off the pitch – but for now, she is busy ‘soaking' in the joy of becoming a family of four.

Independent. Since 2003

April 25, 2025 11.29 Europe/London By Julian Clover



Viewers in the UK will be able to watch live FIFA Club World Cup games on terrestrial television after agreement was reached between rights holder DAZN and Channel 5.

DAZN has already committed to broadcast all 63 games in the fledgling competition for free in the UK and Worldwide. Channel 5 will now also broadcast live coverage of 23 of those matches when the competition takes place this summer in the United States (14 June to 13 July).

Clubs competing in the tournament include Chelsea and Manchester City from the UK; Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Bayern Munich amongst the other European clubs and international clubs such as Inter Miami and Boca Juniors.

As part of the new partnership between Channel 5 and DAZN, 5 will sublicense DAZN's live coverage of 15 group stage matches, four round-of-16 matches, two quarter-finals, one semi-final and the final itself. Coverage will be broadcast live and free-to-air on the main 5 channel and on the 5 streaming service – with some matches shown on 5USA and 5ACTION.

Announcing the agreement Paramount's President of International Ad Sales Lee Sears said: “We're delighted to be able to have agreed this fantastic partnership with DAZN to expand free-to-air coverage of the FIFA Club World Cup, live on 5.  It's going to be one of the sporting events of the summer with most of the matches played in the evening peak time and 32 of the world's biggest clubs involved.

“We have a growing line up of live sport on 5 and, thanks to our innovative and agile approach to partnership, we're ambitious about offering our viewers and our advertisers even more in the months to come.”

Shay Segev, CEO, DAZN added: “We are pleased to be partnering with 5 to increase awareness of the inaugural edition of the FIFA Club World Cup in the United Kingdom and bring the competition to as many fans as possible across 5 and DAZN. The FIFA Club World Cup will bring unparalleled engagement opportunities and in expanding our partner network with 5, we look forward to bringing the tournament to the widest possible audience.”

Live coverage of the FIFA Club World Cup begins on June 14 2025.

Argentina's Lionel Messi celebrates with teammate Thiago Almada after scoring a goal during the 2026 FIFA World Cup South American qualifiers on Oct. 15, 2024.

Reporter

For just the second time in its 95-year history, soccer's most watched event and sought after trophy will be contested on American soil; the FIFA World Cup.

Over the course of 39 days, the United States, Canada, and Mexico will host 45 other countries, all competing for the biggest prize in soccer. Anticipation is high, so much so that President Donald Trump is establishing a dedicated task force.

“This important event, taking place during the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of our country, presents an opportunity to showcase the nation's pride and hospitality, while promoting economic growth and tourism through sport,” said Trump via a White House notice published on March 7. “My Administration will support preparations through a coordinated government effort.”

Here is everything you need to know about the 2026 World Cup:  

From June 11 to July 19 2026, an estimated 104 matches will be played across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. There will be 16 host cities, 11 of which are in the U.S. Every match from the quarter-final stage and onwards will be played in the States, with the grand final set to be played at the MetLife stadium in New Jersey.

Other U.S. host cities include Dallas, Kansas City, Houston, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, Miami, and Santa Clara in the Bay Area. 

For U.S. viewers, the 2026 World Cup will be broadcast on Fox Sports, with Spanish-language coverage also available on Telemundo.

It has yet to be confirmed if there will be alternative viewing options for 2026 World Cup matches. However, for the 2022 World Cup, those with subscriptions to streaming services such as Hulu + Live TV and YouTube TV could watch matches on those platforms. Fox Sports also provided full match replays on its free streaming service, Tubi.

This edition of the World Cup will be the first to include 48 countries, an increase from 32 which have played at each tournament since 1998. 

As hosts, the United States, Canada, and Mexico have automatically qualified for the tournament. Other countries must compete in qualifiers against nations from the same continent, followed by some inter-continental play-offs for certain countries.

Iran, Japan, New Zealand and reigning champions Argentina have all secured their place at the tournament. The full line-up will be finalized once qualifying finishes in March next year.

As mentioned, this is the first time that 48 countries will be competing at the World Cup, so the format has slightly changed from previous editions. The tournament begins with a group stage, with teams divided into 12 groups of four.

Teams will play every other nation in their group once, with the top two automatically going through. Out of the teams that finish 3rd in each group, the best eight teams based on their points total will also go through.

This leaves 32 teams in the competition, who go into the knockout stage of the tournament, all the way to the final on July 19.

The odds may well change over the next 12 months or so, but there are already some frontrunners to lift the trophy in New Jersey.

Current champions Argentina, with their star man Lionel Messi, will be looking to retain their world champion status by winning back-to-back tournaments, something last accomplished by Brazil in 1962.

Brazil themselves are also contenders for the 2026 World Cup, last winning the competition in 2002. Despite disappointment in recent tournaments, Brazil is still the most successful nation in World Cup history with five titles.

Meanwhile, last year's European Championship saw Spain beat England 2-1 in the final, with Spanish teenage superstar Lamine Yamal shining throughout the tournament. Both nations will back themselves in 2026 to reach similar heights.

France has a star-studded squad with strong depth and exciting young players. Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappé will hope to lead the line for France, this time without a mask. 

And 2026 will likely prove to be the last opportunity for Cristiano Ronaldo to get his hands on the only major trophy that has eluded him. The Portuguese forward is considered one of soccer's best ever, but he will be 41 by the time the World Cup kicks off next June. 

The U.S. men's soccer team will also look to use home advantage to improve on their performance at the 2022 World Cup, in which they reached the first round of the knockout stage.

The President has described next year's World Cup as “largest sporting event in history,” and as such has designated a specific task force for the tournament. 

The envisioned task force will support host cities with logistical efforts, as each location expects to receive 450,000 visitors and an influx of an estimated net impact of $480 million from tourism trade. 

This is not the first time that a President has organised a federal task force to help coordinate an international sporting event. President Bill Clinton put together similar agencies for both the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games and Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Olympics, both formed around three years before the respective games started.

If you are hoping for more of a Super Bowl-style spectacle come the World Cup final on July 19, then you're in luck. FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced that a half-time show will be performed during the final with Coldplay confirmed to lead the performance.

And if you want to get a feel for tournament soccer a year early, the U.S. will be hosting the FIFA Club World Cup this summer. The 32-team tournament will feature clubs from across the globe, playing at 10 different venues across the country with the final also being played at the MetLife Stadium. Trump's task force will also “assist in the planning, organization, and execution of the events” surrounding the 2025 tournament.

Some of the world's best players set to feature at next summer's World Cup will play in the States this year, including Argentina's Messi, who is the captain of Inter Miami.

With just over a year until World Cup 2026 – which will be played across the US, Canada and Mexico – tournament organizer Fifa has run a poster campaign that's seen host cities each commission a local artist to celebrate football and regional culture.

Across March and April, a new poster was unveiled every two days and now they're all live. It comes off the back of a similar project that saw each host city reveal its own sonic identity.

The posters are arguably the most striking communication yet to roll out ahead of the tournament. Many offer a simple, effective glimpse into how the games might feel in each city and generate some tangible excitement.

We've shared some of our favorites in this article, which we think best capture the spirit of what Fifa is trying to achieve.

Interbrand, which designed the visual identity of the tournament which was first revealed back in 2023, says it has had nothing to do with either the poster or sonic ident projects, while a Fifa spokesperson says the organization worked with the host cities directly on both.

The World Cup 2026 identity is the first ever to feature an image of the World Cup trophy in its true likeness and, according to Fifa, will form a template for future tournament identities.

The main World Cup logo features the trophy and the year and, although we are some way off the tournament, we are beginning to see how a broader identity may behave more dynamically nearer the time.

The ‘26' in the logo will be used as a framing device as the identity rolls out further and photography, pattern and color are starting to reference host cities, as you can see in the image at the bottom of the page. 

An official tournament song has been remixed by producers in each host city, including Houston, San Francisco and Mexico City.

Although nothing's really captured our imagination quite like the underwater football scene imagined in the Boston poster by John Rego, which depicts a lobster attempting a scorpion kick not seen since Colombia keeper René Higuita tried it.

Messi and Miami had no answer for Vancouver's speed and athleticism and paid for it with a 2-0 defeat

Vancouver Whitecaps fans reportedly paid close to three times face value to catch a glimpse of Lionel Messi at BC Place in the CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinals against Inter Miami on Thursday night. They were not disappointed.

Not only did they get a 90-minute showing from the Argentine maestro, but they also saw their hometown side pull off a stunning 2-0 upset - sparked by a brilliant headed goal from Brian White. It was all Vancouver needed in the first leg, but the job isn't done yet. Leg 2 is set for April 30 at Chase Field in Florida.

Brian White heads it in for the opening goal! 💥 pic.twitter.com/RMFdeYRkXQ

Still, this is a result that will live long in the memory of Whitecaps supporters, especially considering what happened when these two teams met last season. During Inter Miami's previous visit to BC Place, then-manager Tata Martino rested stars Messi, Luis Suárez, and Sergio Busquets due to fixture congestion - a match Miami still won 2-1. The decision sparked backlash from the Vancouver crowd and prompted Martino to publicly defend his call.

This year, with a spot in the Champions Cup final on the line, both sides fielded full-strength lineups - and it was Vancouver who seized the moment. Following a playbook that has given The Herons issues before, the Whitecaps ceded possession and waited for their chance to strike. White gave an early warning, just missing a through ball in front of goal in the third minute. About 20 minutes later, he made no mistake.

Despite Miami holding 73 percent of the ball in the first 20 minutes, it was caught out on the counter. Sebastian Berhalter picked out White with a perfectly weighted aerial pass, and the striker nodded home in the 24th minute.

Inter Miami looked flat in attack, with Messi leading the team in shots (three) but struggling to find space. Vancouver effectively denied the 37-year-old access to the box, forcing him into long-range attempts and set-piece opportunities. Two of his shots were on target, but Yohei Takaoka was up to the task with a stellar showing in goal.

Berhalter makes it 2️⃣ for the Whitecaps! ⚽ pic.twitter.com/gJBsZX56PX

Berhalter wasn't done, either. In the 85th minute, the midfielder capped another swift counter with a rocket, sealing the match. Unless Miami can fix its persistent issues against athletic, counter-attacking sides, its Champions Cup run may be over next week.

Saturday's Clasico showdown might end up being a measuring stick of just how far Carlo Ancelotti's side have fallen

This wasn't supposed to happen. Things aren't really going to plan for Real Madrid. Los Blancos, who were tipped to win the lot this season, have been miles off it. In fact, this, right now, is a football team on a steep decline. Madrid are out of the Champions League, slipping up in La Liga, and scraping narrow wins on moments of brilliance - as well as the odd slice of luck.

It is a fine thing, then, that Los Blancos are facing Barcelona this weekend. Clasicos are always tense occasions, and even the ones that don't mean as much always feel big - by virtue of rivalry alone. This one, though, holds a certain gravitas. There is not only a trophy on the line but also the sense of two teams at different junctures. Madrid are on the way down, broken when they were supposed to be chugging through the season. Barcelona, meanwhile, are on the ascent - and only likely to get better.

And after all of the pre-season talk about how Madrid were the ones to watch, and Barca were set up to fail, Saturday's final might well end up showing just how far Carlo Ancelotti and his troops have gone backwards.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Novak Djokovic has played the very best in men's tennis over the years, winning over 1,000 singles matches.

The Serbian legend enjoyed rivalries with some of the ATP Tour's greatest-ever players on his way to a record-24 Grand Slam titles.

20 times, Djokovic has played either Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, or Andy Murray in a Grand Slam final, coming out victorious on 13 occasions.

However, during that period, Djokovic came unstuck against another of his biggest rivals in their two Major finals.

Speaking ahead of this year's Madrid Open, Djokovic has heaped praise on the three-time Major champion, whom he considers to be ‘very underestimated'.

During his pre-tournament press conference, Djokovic was asked for his thoughts on three-time Grand Slam champion, Stan Wawrinka.

“He is an incredible player. Someone I really admire as a person as well,” said Djokovic.

“I think he is very underestimated in the discussions.

“He has won a Gold medal at the Olympics, three Grand Slams. He has had an amazing career.”

The Serbian was particularly impressed with the Swiss star's longevity, as he continues to compete on the ATP Tour at the age of 40.

“He is 40 years old with God knows how many surgeries on the knees, and he is still pushing and still coming in early in the tournaments, one of the first people who show up in the club and practices early and does everything he needs to do,” said Djokovic.

“That is super impressive. I really admire him and envy him for that.

“Going to the Challenger level and trying to build your rankings and get matches. I have never done that, never been in that position that I have to, and hopefully don't need to build rankings again and need to go to Challenger level, but I really admire that.

“It says a lot about champion spirit and mentality that these guys have.”

The world number 158 has won just one ATP Tour main draw match in 2025, but reached the quarterfinals of a Challenger Tour event in Napoli last month.

Wawrinka is scheduled to return to action at the Challenger level for the tournament in Francavilla, Italy, on May 5.

Appearing in his second Career Grand Slam final, Wawrinka beat Djokovic to win the French Open title ten years ago.

The 37-year-old now reflects upon the defeat that saw him miss out on the one Major title that then eluded him.

“On the big stage, yeah, of course – that was one of the toughest losses for me,” said Djokovic.

“By that time, I still had not won Roland Garros, and that was I don't know which final for me already [3rd].

“I thought I am not playing Rafa [Nadal] for a change in the final and I liked my chances to win my first French Open title but then Stan [Wawrinka] stole it from me, and he played some incredible tennis.”

Djokovic said that he and Wawrinka still joke about the aftermath of the final to this day.

“We still joke around and I tell him that the reason why he played so well was because of the shorts,” he said.

“I don't know how many of you remember those famous shorts he was wearing, and he came up to the post-finals press conference with those shorts, and I really hated him since then.”

Djokovic then lost another Major final to Wawrinka at the US Open in 2016, as the Swiss continued to find success at the Grand Slams.

At Major tournaments, Wawrinka has won 44% of his matches against Djokovic (4-9), whereas throughout the remainder of the ATP Tour, the 40-year-old has won just 11% (2-16).

Always one to step up for the big occasion, it'll certainly be interesting to see what would happen if the pair faced off at any of the three remaining Grand Slams in 2025.

The 2025 French Open is set to begin on Sunday, May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

MADRID (AP) — Joao Fonseca needed to rest his mind and reflect on everything happening to him.

It was all too new for the young Brazilian tennis player — the media requests, the new fans, the praise from the top players.

“We felt that it was time to take a pause and reflect about everything that happened,” said the 18-year-old Fonseca, who has been quickly rising through the ATP rankings and is considered one of the sport's most promising players.

“A lot has changed. I needed time to rest my mind. It was an important break.”

Fonseca, who is up to No. 65 in the world, paused for nearly a month after reaching the third round in Miami. He went back to Rio de Janeiro to practice and try to recharge after playing several tournaments in a row late last year and early this season.

He is playing at the Madrid Open this week, where on Saturday he is scheduled to face Tommy Paul in the second round of the ATP 1000 clay-court tournament.

“Now there are a lot of people talking about me...in the media, the Internet,” Fonseca said. “I have to stay grounded and keep working hard to achieve more in tennis. I have to keep focused on my things and not on the expectations from other people.”

Former players Andy Murray and Boris Becker, as well as four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz, were among those praising the Brazilian recently.

Fonseca won his first tour title in Buenos Aires in February, becoming the first man born in 2006 or later to win an ATP trophy. He was the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history and the youngest South American player to win a title in the ATP Tour era (since 1990).

Fonseca started attracting more attention after winning the Next Gen ATP Finals last December, a tournament that brings together the season's best players who are 20 or younger. He also made headlines after reaching the second round at the Australian Open this year.

“A lot changed since the Next Gen and the Australian Open,” he said. “I became more well known around the world.”

Fonseca comfortably defeated Elmer Moller, 21, in the first round in Madrid in a match played on center court.

“I'm getting more used to those kind of tournaments and the stadiums,” he said. “Today I was a little bit more experienced than the other guy. It's difficult to say that because I was younger than him, but I already knew how it was to play on big stadiums, and I think it was his first time and he was a little bit more nervous. I'm feeling a little bit more like of a routine, feeling more adapted on those courts.” 

Fonseca is already an idol to Brazilians, who haven't had much to cheer in tennis since former world No. 1 Gustavo “Guga” Kuerten, who won the French Open in 1997, 2000 and 2001.

Loud Brazilian fans have been following Fonseca closely across the world, with big crowds at his matches both in Madrid and in Miami this year.

Fonseca said he doesn't want to be considered the new Guga, though. Instead, he is just trying to stay focused on training hard and on improving.

“Thankfully I have a great foundation, with relatives, friends and coaches who have been helping me keep my feet on the ground and stay humble to keep on working,” he said.

The French Open is quickly approaching as both the ATP and WTA Tours continue to gear up for the second major of the year.

Rafael Nadal will not be competing at Roland Garros in 2025, with it being the first year that the clay court major takes place since his retirement.

However, Nadal will receive a tribute from Roland Garros to commemorate his 14 record victories at the tournament this year.

While Nadal is now retired, his former rival Novak Djokovic is set to make his 21st appearance at Roland Garros this year.

However, an ATP player that has beaten Djokovic twice has taken to social media to provide an update on his own Roland Garros status that has been put in doubt.

Alejandro Tabilo has beaten Djokovic twice over the past year, with their most recent meeting coming on the clay of the Monte Carlo Masters.

However, after losing his subsequent match to Grigor Dimitrov, Tabilo revealed he had a bone edema in his left wrist.

This forced him to withdraw from the BMW Open, before Tabilo confirmed he would miss the Madrid Open as well.

Following this, there were reports that he had withdrawn from Roland Garros, but Tabilo has now responded to say that these rumors are false.

“Totally false that I won't be playing RG [Roland Garros] let alone aspire to rank protected,” Tabilo said on his Instagram story.

“That was never an option with my team, on the contrary, we're working hard to get to the next Grand Slam.

“Know to understand this moment, because this kind of fake news affects and hurts a lot. Thank you to those who continue to support me.”

Although Tabilo has confirmed he is still intending to play at Roland Garros, it is not yet clear whether he will play his scheduled tournaments in Aix-en-Provence and the Italian Open.

The current world number 35 will hope that he can recover in time, as he has 575 points from his success at these tournaments last year.

Tabilo won the Challenger tournament in Aix-en-Provence last year, before beating Djokovic en route to reaching the semi-finals at a Masters 1000 tournament for the first time in his career in Rome.

If he is unable to recover in time for these events, Tabilo could fall to outside the top 60 of the ATP rankings.

Tabilo has just days to recover in time for his first scheduled event, with the Aix-en-Provence Challenger beginning on Monday April 28.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz was forced to withdraw from the Mutua Madrid Open this week due to an adductor injury. But that is not the only reason the spotlight was on the 21-year-old in Spain.

This week Netflix released a new docuseries 'Carlos Alcaraz: My Way'. ATPTour.com looks at five things we learned from the series.



The Spaniard is not shy about sharing his ambitions
A theme of the three-episode series is Alcaraz's chase not just to be one of the best tennis players in the world, but to be the best in history.

“I'd like to be on par with the Big Three as far as titles go,” Alcaraz said. “It's part of my struggle to be the best athlete in history.”

Members of his team often point out what it takes to maximise his potential, using Novak Djokovic's willingness to make sacrifices as an example.

“Maybe i'm not as strict with myself,” Alcaraz said. “I'm taking my time to really enjoy more — and maybe more than I should — and ultimately that's my method.”

 

There are difficulties fans don't see
People around the world see Alcaraz's highlight-reel efforts on the court and all the smiling he does. It always appears the Spaniard is having a blast.

But the docuseries shows that not everything is easy for the 21-year-old. The demands of life as a professional tennis player — and chasing history — take their toll from time to time.

“In 2023 I was already mentally exhausted,” Alcaraz said. “It was 24/7, 100 per cent about tennis and at the French Open, I lost to Djokovic in the semi-finals and I had a friend who was on vacation during that time and he was going to be in Ibiza with friends… ‘Let me make it out, tomorrow I'm going'. 

“I knew I had to talk to [agent] Albert [Molina] first. ‘Sh*& Albert, I don't know how to tell you, I mean man I've got to go, if even for two or three days to Ibiza'.”

Alcaraz's team was not thrilled with the idea with Queen's Club and Wimbledon coming up, but in the series it becomes clear that there are points when the Spaniard senses when he needs a break and takes one in an effort to reset. 

Federer  & Agassi provided sage advice
Several legends, including Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Andre Agassi appear in the series. Federer and Agassi both provided memorable advice.

Alcaraz recalled a nugget Federer gave him: “I asked him what he did to maintain his motivation for so long year after year after year and he told me that I have to make life more enjoyable and you have to somehow find enjoyment in every tournament you get to attend. Meet friends, find things to do, go see films, always find things to do that bring you happiness wherever you go.” 

Agassi, another former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, told Alcaraz in a limousine in Las Vegas to pick Nadal's brain when the lefty retired.

“When he decides, whenever, you should reach him and ask him for the things that he would do different,” Agassi said. “Be smart, you know. You always want to learn in 10 minutes what took somebody 10 years.”

 

Family & friends are very important to Carlitos
Alcaraz is most at ease around family and friends. He enjoys living at home with his family in Murcia and loves his mother Virginia's cooking.

A special scene is during Alcatraz's 21st birthday celebration at home with family and friends. His grandmother sings and Alcaraz is all smiles. His older brother Alvaro also keeps him humble.

“He really is a family guy. he loved being with his childhood friends at the party because it's when he's the most relaxed and can really be himself,” Alvaro said, before the scene cut to b-roll of the group watching Alvaro speak to Carlitos on video. “Please know that no matter how famous you decide you want to be, that you'll always be my little brother and I'll slap you over the head if you get all full of yourself.”

Ferrero says young Alcaraz was like a roller-coaster
Former World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero provides plenty of insight through the series as he pushes Alcaraz to be the best he can be. The 16-time tour-level titlist discussed how Alcaraz's agent, Alberto Molina, asked him to join the team.

“The idea of getting to work with a young kid, work with him from a young age to help build something from the ground up with the knowledge I have as a player, as a trainer, the idea spoke to me very much,” Ferrero said.

Alcaraz would spend a couple of weeks at the coach's eponymous academy, living there before going home for a weekend. Ferrero was honest about those days. 

“Carlos was a shy kid at the beginning with me. I think he had a lot of respect for me. He wasn't very stable,” Ferrero said. “His emotional maturity, man he got very cocky with the wins and then he'd complain if it doesn't go his way, he was down. So basically, a roller-coaster.”

Daniil Medvedev advanced to the third round of the Mutua Madrid Open on Friday after Laslo Djere withdrew due to a left shoulder injury.

Seeded ninth, Medvedev is making his sixth Madrid appearance this fortnight and will next face Argentine lefty Juan Manuel Cerundolo. It will be their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.



The World No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings holds a 14-8 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win-Loss Index. Should Medvedev go one step further than last year's quarter-final run in Madrid, he would become the fifth man to complete the set of semi-finals at all active ATP Masters 1000 events, alongside Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. The 29-year-old Medvedev is seeking his first title since winning Rome in 2023. 

Djere defeated Fabio Fognini in the opening round Wednesday and leaves Madrid with a 10-3 season record at Tour level. In February, he won the ATP 250 in Santiago.

Gael Monfils withdrew from the Mutua Madrid Open on Friday due to illness, giving defending champion Andrey Rublev a walkover into the third round.

Monfils, who rallied to a three-set win against Borna Gojo in the opening round, leaves the clay-court event with a 16-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win-Loss Index. In January, the Frenchman won the ATP 250 in Auckland and became the oldest man to win a tour-level title since a 43-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1977.




Rublev will next meet Alexander Bublik, whom the seventh seed leads 5-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Their Madrid clash will mark their first encounter on clay.


The 27-year-old Rublev boasts an 11-9 season record, highlighted by his title run in Doha, where he beat Bublik in the opening round. A 17-time tour-level titlist, Rublev captured his second ATP Masters 1000 crown last year at the Caja Magica.

Novak Djokovic has told Sky Sports his priority working with Andy Murray as his coach is to peak for the French Open and Wimbledon, following a disappointing couple of months. 

The 37-year-old will play at the Madrid Open this week for the first time since 2022, live on Sky Sports Tennis, looking to rebound from a shock opening-round exit in Monte-Carlo earlier this month to Alejandro Tabilo.

That defeat followed a loss in the Miami Open final to Jakub Mensik, denying Djokovic a chance at securing his 100th tour-level title.

The 40-time ATP Masters 1000 champion remains on the brink of joining Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books, but admitted his priority after performances in recent years is to peak for the Grand Slams.

""The priority is obviously trying to take the level of tennis that currently is maybe not where we want it to be to the higher level, so that I can peak at French Open,"" Djokovic told Sky Sports in Madrid.

""That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

""Of course, we're in Madrid, we came in early. We're putting in a lot of hours in the court and in the gym, trying to perfect the body and the game and basically every aspect of my game to be a few per cent better than it was in the previous weeks.

""If I can reach that desired level this tournament, that would be amazing. I don't have really high expectations and I really hope I can get through the first hurdle and then we'll take it from there.""

Britain's Murray has formed part of Djokovic's coaching team since November, with the Serbian revealing the Scot plays a major role in managing his motivation for training, and that both are happy with the arrangement at the moment.

""The priority for us is always trying to approach the training session with the right kind of mentality - it's not always easy,"" Djokovic added.

""Some days I feel excited and really motivated, some days less. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy.

Dominic Thiem has assessed Alexander Zverev's chances of winning a Grand Slam title and also named his three favourites to win the 2025 French Open.

Zverev secured his first title of 2025 at the ATP 500 tournament in Munich last week, where he cruised past Ben Shelton 6-2, 6-4 in the final.

The world No 2's triumph on home soil ended a barren run that followed his defeat to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final in January — a loss that took his record in major finals to 0-3.

In his maiden Grand Slam championship match, Zverev lost to Thiem in a tension-riddled five-set 2020 US Open battle after leading by two sets to love and serving for the match in the fifth set.

The German also lost in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in the 2024 French Open title match having held a 2-1 lead in sets.

After Zverev's Munich Open title win, Thiem revealed he was impressed by his former rival's performance.

“Sascha was too good. I don't think Shelton played badly, but I was watching it live and it's unbelievable,” the Austrian told Sky Sports.

“Shelton served well at 220, 225 km/h and Sascha just stands back and neutralises the balls on the return. That's sensational. It's such small things and that's why he deserved to win.”

‘I believe Novak Djokovic can win more Slams – in tennis terms, he is the best'

Alexander Zverev finds an interesting word to describe tennis drug testers

Asked if Zverev can make his Grand Slam breakthrough this year, Thiem identified the German as a leading French Open contender — alongside Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

“It's realistic for Sascha [to win] at every Grand Slam. He's just so good,” said the former world No 3.

“You saw that in Australia too. I think the slight dip in form he had afterwards is completely normal.

“Now in Munich he has recovered, just at the right time. There are still two cool, big tournaments to go before the French Open.

“He is also one of the absolute top favourites at the French Open with Alcaraz and Sinner. Everything has to go well for a Grand Slam, but if that happens, he's absolutely capable of winning it.”

Zverev is looking to build on his Munich victory at the Madrid Masters, where he crushed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 6-2 in his opening match.

The 27-year-old is the top seed in Madrid as he chases a third title in the Spanish capital.

...

World number one Aryna Sabalenka was beaten for the fourth time in the Porsche Grand Prix final on Monday when she fell 6-4, 6-1 to former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko and missed out on the sports car from the main sponsor yet again.

""I think you hate me now, you wanted the car so badly. You will get it another time,"" Ostakenko told Sabalenka in a light-hearted exchange.

Sabalenka said ""enjoy your beautiful car"" and quipped ""I will order one now"" after failing like in 2021 against Ash Barty, and 2022 and 2023 against Iga Swiatek, to claim the Porsche by winning the final of the star studded indoor clay court event in Stuttgart.

""Congrats Jelena you were the better player than me,"" Sabalenka added on a serious note after she found no answer against her 24th-ranked opponent and went down in 1 hour 25 minutes.

Ostapenko broke Sabalenka in the opening game which set the tone, and was undeterred when Sabalenka tied at 4-4.

She went on to win eight of the remaining nine games and allowed Sabalenka a mere five points in the last five of them en route to victory with a return winner on first match point.

Ostapenko finished with 21 winners and just eight unforced errors.

It was Ostapenko's first win over Sabalenka in their fourth meeting, and a first clay court title for her since the surprise Roland Garros success in 2017.

The Latvian beat the two top ranked players in the world to get a ninth career title in what she named ""an amazing week,"" having ousted second ranked triple French Open champion Swiatek in the quarter-finals.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

The first WTA Madrid round of 32 contests will be played on Day 5. Teenage prodigy Mirra Andreeva and US Open semifinalist Emma Navarro are among the top players scheduled to compete. We here at LWOT predict all the matches in two articles, including Coco Gauff vs Ann Li in the other.

Head-to-head: First meeting

Starodubtseva was helped by not having to play Karolina Muchova in the last round due to the Czech's withdrawal, but she still deserves credit for taking advantage against Elisabetta Cocciaretto. There will not be much variety in this matchup against Samsonova. Both players try to hit hard and flat through opponents and do not deviate from their styles. On a clay court, I trust Samsonova to implement that game more consistently.
Prediction: Samsonova in 3

Head-to-head: Bencic 2-1 Haddad Maia

Haddad Maia ended the worst run of her professional career in the last round against Bernarda Pera, the Brazilian's first singles win since January. While Haddad Maia's win was scrappy, Bencic performed excellently against Zeynep Sonmez and the 20th seed, Clara Tauson. Although clay is Bencic's worst surface and Haddad Maia's best chance of beating the Swiss, the ugly win against Pera did not inspire enough confidence to back the 2023 French Open semifinalist to overcome Bencic.
Prediction: Bencic in 2

Head-to-head: Vekic 2-0 Navarro

Neither player has reached the heights of last season so far in 2025. That is especially true of Vekic, but an exception was her impressive performance to beat Navarro at last month's BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Predicting the winner in their first match on clay is a challenging task. Navarro's level on the dirt is more consistently reliable, but Vekic winning a silver medal at Roland Garros last year proved her capabilities. The American is backed to beat Vekic for the first time by utilizing her more complete game, but it is a 50/50 matchup.
Prediction: Navarro in 3

Head-to-head: Andreeva 1-0 Frech

Andreeva did well to stay solid against Marie Bouzkova, who is tough to hit through on clay, in the previous round. Frech's style is similar to Andreeva's. The Pole tries to be aggressive from the baseline when possible, and her backhand is her stronger groundstroke. Andreeva's best level is simply much better than Frech's. The teenager needs to have a bad day to give her opponent a realistic chance of causing an upset in Madrid.
Prediction: Andreeva in 2

Day 4 at the ATP Madrid 2025 edition promises to be an action packed day of tennis. As ever, we preview and predict the matches scheduled for you.

Head-to-head – Draper 0-1 Griekspoor

This should be an exciting match. Jack Draper is having a solid 2025 and currently stands at 6th in the world while Tallon Griekspoor has had a lot of wins under his belt this year. They met each other once, almost two years ago, and a lot has changed since. Draper will like to have a good week here to build up momentum for the French Open and while Griekspoor impressed in the first round, expect the Brit to be at his aggressive best and start strong.
Prediction: Draper in 2

Head-to-head – First Meeting

Karen Khachanov played well last week in Barcelona and that should give him confidence heading into this week. He faces Reilly Opelka, who is under protected ranking, and maybe clay is not his favorite surface to play on. The American relies on his serve but his baseline game is not lacking either. That being said, Khachanov is a solid baseliner and on clay he should be able to create more chances on Opelka's serve.
Prediction: Khachanov in 3

Head-to-head – Nishikori 2-1 Shapovalov

Neither player enters this match with great results in clay court tournaments this year. Kei Nishikori did struggle in his first round match here but the Japanese is highly experienced and he knows these courts very well. He takes on the flamboyant Denis Shapovalov who would love a good week here. Expect Nishikori to absorb Shapovalov's power well and and counter punch when needed.
Prediction: Nishikori in 3

Head-to-head – Dimitrov 2-2 Jarry

Grigor Dimitrov had a mixed week in his last clay court tournament in Monte Carlo. He reached the last eight but was double bageled in that match. Lucky for him he faces Nicolas Jarry, a player he beat in that very tournament. Jarry won his first match on clay this week but Dimitrov is a big step up in quality. Expect Jarry's woes to continue.
Prediction: Dimitrov in 2

World No 5 Novak Djokovic chats to Sky Sports in Spain ahead of the Madrid Open, touching on his aims for 2025 and his coaching relationship with Andy Murray; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Novak Djokovic has told Sky Sports his priority working with Andy Murray as his coach is to peak for the French Open and Wimbledon, following a disappointing couple of months. 

The 37-year-old will play at the Madrid Open this week for the first time since 2022, live on Sky Sports Tennis, looking to rebound from a shock opening-round exit in Monte-Carlo earlier this month to Alejandro Tabilo.

That defeat followed a loss in the Miami Open final to Jakub Mensik, denying Djokovic a chance at securing his 100th tour-level title.

The 40-time ATP Masters 1000 champion remains on the brink of joining Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books, but admitted his priority after performances in recent years is to peak for the Grand Slams.

""The priority is obviously trying to take the level of tennis that currently is maybe not where we want it to be to the higher level, so that I can peak at French Open,"" Djokovic told Sky Sports in Madrid.

""That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

""Of course, we're in Madrid, we came in early. We're putting in a lot of hours in the court and in the gym, trying to perfect the body and the game and basically every aspect of my game to be a few per cent better than it was in the previous weeks.

""If I can reach that desired level this tournament, that would be amazing. I don't have really high expectations and I really hope I can get through the first hurdle and then we'll take it from there.""

Britain's Murray has formed part of Djokovic's coaching team since November, with the Serbian revealing the Scot plays a major role in managing his motivation for training, and that both are happy with the arrangement at the moment.

""The priority for us is always trying to approach the training session with the right kind of mentality - it's not always easy,"" Djokovic added.

""Some days I feel excited and really motivated, some days less. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy.

""Then it's obviously about specific elements in the game with certain shots that are happening in a certain pattern for days or weeks already.

""It's really a combination of things, I would say. As we are coming closer and closer to the first match, we're working on more of the specifics to fine tune the game. To be ready to play points and matches, not just from the game standpoint but also mentally and emotionally.

""The first four or five days of being here was more about the physical aspect of trying to build the endurance and strength and get a feel for the different conditions that are here.

""It's high altitude, so the ball is flying and it takes some time to get used to it. Things are going in the right direction. Obviously, that it's not a guarantee that I'll play very well in the match, but we're generally happy with where we're going.""

Historic surplus and prize money at Wimbledon set new standards for the sport​.

​Wimbledon 2024 has set a new financial benchmark, delivering a record surplus of nearly £50 million to British tennis. The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) reported profits of £54.3 million for the year ending July 2024, with turnover reaching £406.5 million. Under its longstanding agreement with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the AELTC passed on 90% of its profits, amounting to £49.853 million, marking the highest surplus ever received by the LTA. This financial success came despite weather challenges during the tournament.

The 2024 Championships also saw a significant increase in prize money, with a total fund of £50 million, which is an 11.9% rise from the previous year. Both the men's and women's singles champions received £2.7 million each, while first-round singles participants earned £60,000. Notably, the prize pool for wheelchair and quad wheelchair events was set at £1 million, reflecting a commitment to inclusivity and recognition of the sport's growth.

This financial change is set to have a lasting impact on British tennis. The LTA can leverage these funds to invest in grassroots programs, facility upgrades, and talent development initiatives. Such investments are crucial for properly aiding the next generation of British tennis players and ensuring the sport's continued growth and accessibility across the UK.

The record-setting financials also come at a pivotal time in professional tennis, as players increasingly push for a larger share of Grand Slam revenues. In March, the top 20 ATP and WTA players collectively signed a letter desiring greater transparency and increased prize money from all four major tournaments. Wimbledon's announcement of record turnover and prize distribution may add fuel to that conversation, prompting more discussions about how much of the sport's wealth should be redistributed to the athletes.

Inside the Baseline…

Wimbledon's remarkable financial performance in 2024 shows just how pivotal the tournament is for British tennis. The huge surplus provided to the LTA offers a unique opportunity to invest in the sport's future, and it will help grow British tennis like never before. By channeling these funds effectively, British tennis can build a more inclusive infrastructure, ensuring that the sport thrives for generations to come.

By Gianni Taina

For the first time in years, Juan Martín del Potro has acknowledged the possibility of returning to the ATP Tour—but not as a player. That chapter officially closed last December during his farewell match, where he was joined by tennis legends like Gabriela Sabatini and Novak Djokovic.

Interestingly, it's Djokovic who could entice del Potro back to the circuit. In a recent interview, the Argentine was asked about becoming the coach of the former World No. 1, and his response was surprisingly open.

“To be a coach, you need to dedicate yourself 100% and travel the world again. I did that for 20 years, and I'm tired. That said, if Novak asked me to work with him, it would make me very happy,” del Potro told Olympics. “I couldn't say no to him, but I don't think it will happen. The door isn't 100% closed, but I believe my time as a coach will come later”.

Currently, Djokovic's primary coach is Andy Murray, a retired tennis icon. This marks an intriguing difference between the two legends, who are both 37 years old and faced each other on some of the biggest stages in tennis history.

With 24 Grand Slam titles, Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most major wins in tennis history, ahead of Rafael Nadal's 22 and Roger Federer's 20. According to del Potro, that tally could still grow.

“I think winning a Grand Slam is something personal for him. He can win more. In terms of tennis, he's the best. He has so much experience. If he stays physically fit, he can handle it all and succeed,” del Potro said. “It would be great for tennis if he could win another, like when he claimed Olympic gold in Paris. As long as he's active, he's the best”.

Djokovic's most recent Grand Slam victory came at the 2023 US Open, a year in which he captured three of the four major titles, falling short only at Wimbledon. Since then, younger stars like Jannik Sinner (23) and Carlos Alcaraz (21) have claimed the subsequent five majors, though Djokovic reached the final of the 2024 Australian Open, a tournament he's won a record 10 times.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are two of the top players in the world right now, and given their young age, both have the potential to dominate the ATP Tour for years to come. However, US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro believes another star still holds the title of the best player in the game today.

“Djokovic is still playing. And for me, as long as he's active on the tour, he's the best,” Del Potro said in a recent interview with Olympics.com. “Tennis-wise, he's the best,” said the Argentine legend, who believes Nole still has the energy and talent to compete at the elite level and win major titles.

“He has so much experience, and if he's physically in good shape, for me, he's going to keep trying—and he just might do it,” said Juan Martin, who also speculated about Djokovic's main motivation to keep competing on the ATP Tour at 37: “I think he can still win more Grand Slams… Achieving that is something very personal for him.”

At the same time, the 2009 US Open winner made it clear he hopes to see Novak claim at least one more major title before retiring. “It would be something really beautiful for the tennis world if he wins again,” he said. “Like he did in Paris, winning the gold medal,” he added, referring to the 2024 Olympic Games.

Serbian superstar Novak Djokovic.

During his prime, Juan Martin Del Potro competed against Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray. That made his chances of reaching the top of the ATP rankings nearly impossible. “A lot of us played well, but they make a small difference in the smallest details,” he reflected.

“It's not just tennis—it's mentality, physicality, character, the way they handle pressure. And for many years they did it better than all of us, especially in key moments or at big tournaments,” added Juan Martin. “If they're playing at an 8 or 9 level on the tour, in Grand Slams they play at 10, and that's where we couldn't catch up because they are just that good.”

Novak Djokovic is the last remaining member of a generation of players that dominated its era. Now, many young talents are competing to take that mantle, including Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and Del Potro weighed in on what the future may hold.

“It could be a good generation, but they're still very young and it's too early to say whether they'll be that good,” explained Juan Martin. “What's important is that they play really well and have the potential, but often potential and talent alone aren't enough. You need hard work, discipline, and good health.”

Finally, the Argentine legend spoke about how the retirement of the sport's biggest stars is creating opportunities for the next wave of talent. “Before, there were only six spots left in the Top 10 because the Big 4 was impossible to break,” he said. “Now that the Big 4, David Ferrer, Stan Wawrinka and I are no longer there, the Top 10 is changing a lot. There's a big opportunity for everyone.”

Novak Djokovic is the first to admit that his level of tennis has been patchy recently, but there is no reason to be overly concerned as his main aim is to peak at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

After his run to the semi-final of the Australian Open, Djokovic suffered a couple of early defeats as he lost in the first round of the Qatar Open and followed it up with a second-round defeat at the Indian Wells Open.

Those losses sparked concerns that it might be the beginning of the end for the tennis great, but he bounced back at the Miami Open as he reached the final, losing against teenager Jakub Mensik. That was followed by a second-round exit from the Monte Carlo Masters.

Djokovic concedes his standard has not been at the desired level, but he is using the ATP Tour events to prepare for the French Open and Wimbledon.

“The priority is obviously trying to take the level of tennis that currently is maybe not where we want it to be to the higher level, so that I can peak at [the] French Open,” the 24-time Grand Slam winner told Sky Sports.

“That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

“Of course, we're in Madrid, we came in early. We're putting in a lot of hours in the court and in the gym, trying to perfect the body and the game and basically every aspect of my game to be a few per cent better than it was in the previous weeks.

“If I can reach that desired level this tournament, that would be amazing. I don't have really high expectations and I really hope I can get through the first hurdle and then we'll take it from there.”

Three-time Madrid Open champion Djokovic is seeded fourth at this year's ATP 1000 event in Spain and he will kick his campaign off against Matteo Arnaldi in what will be a first career meeting between the two.

He has been putting in the hard work with coach Andy Murray in the past few weeks with the main focus on the physical side of things.

Djokovic, though, admits that motivation is sometimes lacking during practice, but that is where Murray comes into the picture.

“The priority for us is always trying to approach the training session with the right kind of mentality – it's not always easy,” Djokovic added.

“Some days I feel excited and really motivated, some days less. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy.

“Then it's obviously about specific elements in the game with certain shots that are happening in a certain pattern for days or weeks already.

“It's really a combination of things, I would say. As we are coming closer and closer to the first match, we're working on more of the specifics to fine-tune the game. To be ready to play points and matches, not just from the game standpoint but also mentally and emotionally.

“The first four or five days of being here was more about the physical aspect of trying to build the endurance and strength and get a feel for the different conditions that are here.

“It's high altitude, so the ball is flying and it takes some time to get used to it. Things are going in the right direction. Obviously, that it's not a guarantee that I'll play very well in the match, but we're generally happy with where we're going.”

His first tournament back will be his home Masters event in Rome, where he will be among the favorites to lift the trophy, even if he doesn't see it quite that way.“The first games will be really difficult,” he admitted. “But hopefully I'll be able to get back into the rhythm and then we'll see how it goes.”

“The first games will be really difficult,” he admitted. “But hopefully I'll be able to get back into the rhythm and then we'll see how it goes.”

The Italian hasn't played a tennis match since beating Alexander Zverev to defend his Australian Open title in January. The terms of his settlement with WADA meant he was not even allowed to train with his team or any other registered players until April 13.“I think at the beginning of the three months, it was quite nice,” Sinner reflected.A bit of time away from all the grind, I spent time with family, with friends. I was doing new things and getting to know myself better, finding out where I stand. I think it helped me a lot.

In Sinner's absence, his closest rivals for the tour's top spot were unable to take advantage.

How much stock should we put in their Indian Wells collision?ByZachary CohenPublished Apr 25, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 25, 2025

One of the most intriguing matches on Friday's Mutua Madrid Open schedule sees Ben Shelton taking on Mariano Navone in the Round of 64. This is a rematch of a match we saw at Indian Wells, where Shelton earned a relatively straightforward 6-3, 6-2 victory. However, Shelton is coming off a run to the final in Munich last week, and he could be a little fatigued after having played five matches — and two physical three-setters. This match is also being played on Navone's preferred surface. With that in mind, I think it's worth playing the Argentine as an underdog.Shelton obviously has a massive weapon with that serve of his, and that should keep this match from being lopsided. However, you do need a little more than just a serve in order to win in Madrid. I know this is considered a server-friendly tournament, but that's relative to other clay-court events. You can still grind out points and win matches from the back of the court, and Navone is going to have a massive edge over Shelton when we do see longer rallies. After all, Navone is 21-17 on clay in his career. Shelton is just 14-14 on the surface, and four of those wins came in Houston.

I also like Navone to at least put pressure on the Shelton serve. He's one of the best clay-court returners in the world, so he won't just accept defeat in the American's service games. He's going to change up his court positioning and do everything he can to find ways into points. Navone should also be able to do good work in his own service games. Shelton really isn't much of a returner, and Navone is a good clay-court server.It's also hard to ignore the way Navone handled Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard last round. Shelton is obviously a much better baseliner than the Frenchman, and it isn't remotely close. But Mpetshi Perricard is a much better server than Shelton, so the Argentine should be ready to dig in as a returner here. And honestly, the Shelton serve might look like a changeup compared to Mpetshi Perricard's.The deep run from Shelton in Munich is also something that has to be considered. Not only is it hard to find your legs after a lengthy run in another city, but it's also hard to find your focus. And if Shelton doesn't bring his A-game, Navone will send him packing for Rome.Pick: Navone ML (+125)

Max Verstappen has praised Oscar Piastri for his “calm” approach to racing, with the reigning World Champion suggesting that the McLaren driver – who is now leading the Drivers' standings – has the qualities needed to battle for the title.

After making his debut in 2023, Piastri showed signs of progression during his sophomore campaign last year, claiming two race wins as well as helping McLaren to seal their first Teams' Championship since 1998.

That trajectory has continued into 2025, with Piastri proving victorious in China, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and becoming the new championship leader in the process, sitting 10 points clear of team mate Lando Norris.

While Verstappen lost out on the win in Jeddah to Piastri – the Red Bull driver picking up a five-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage during a Lap 1 battle with the Australian, before going on to finish the race in P2 – he was complimentary about how his rival is performing so far.

“I think I've said it before. People forget a little bit – last year was his second year. Now he's in his third year, and he's very solid,” Verstappen said of Piastri after the race. “He's very calm in his approach, and I like that.

“It shows on track. He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes – and that's what you need when you want to fight for a championship.”

Verstappen also suggested that Piastri's manager, former F1 driver Mark Webber, has been a positive influence on the 24-year-old, adding: “I think with Mark by his side, he's helping him a lot.

“It's great. People learn from their own careers – that's what I had with my Dad [former F1 driver Jos Verstappen], and Mark is advising Oscar. At the end of the day, Oscar is using his talent, and that's great to see.”

“We are not good at every track, that's quite clear. Bahrain, we were lacking a lot. Here [in Jeddah], for sure, it was a lot better. But, like I said, it's also very low deg [tyre degradation] and then more cars come alive, so we still have work to do, but at least it's a promising result.

The actor stars in the Looney Tunes film, which was recently saved by Ketchup Entertainment after being scrapped by Warner Bros. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	A few weeks after Coyote vs. Acme was officially saved by Ketchup Entertainment and is headed to theaters, star Will Forte is still in shock. 


	The Looney Tunes film, featuring Forte and John Cena opposite an animated Wile E. Coyote, became the most talked about movie in Hollywood in late 2023 when The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Warner Bros. intended to scrap the movie as part of a $115 million writedown. It appeared it would never be released, but a social media campaign to save the project helped lead to an acquisition deal between Ketchup and Warners for the worldwide rights.

	At the Los Angeles premiere of his new show The Four Seasons on Thursday, Forte told THR that “words cannot describe” how he's feeling about the movie's changed fate.

	“I never thought it would happen so it just came out of nowhere and I'm so thrilled,” he said. “Thank you Ketchup Entertainment, I'm so excited for people to see this movie. I'm gonna promote the crap out of it, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll go, I'll do whatever — go to the top of Mount Everest, I'm there.” 


	Forte had previously been vocal about the shelving, telling MovieWeb earlier this year, “My thoughts were that it's a fucking bullshit,” before adding, “It is such a delightful movie. It deserves so much better … I can't tell you possibly why the decision was made to not release it, but it makes my blood boil.”  


	The film — directed by Dave Green and produced by Chris deFaria and James Gunn — does not yet have a release date.

""Los Angeles and the Oscars were of an entirely different world from the one I know,"" the 'No Other Land' filmmaker said in a piece for The New York Times. ""But my life is still at the mercy of the settlers and the occupation.""


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Palestinian co-director of No Other Land Hamdan Ballal has penned a candid op-ed in The New York Times detailing the extent of his West Bank assault last month: “Our movie won an Oscar, but our lives are no better than before.”


	Ballal, a co-director of the Academy Award-winning documentary, as well as two other men, Khaled Mohammad Shanran and Nasser Shreteh, were attacked and arrested late March. Another co-director of the film, Israeli creative Yuval Abraham, said Ballal “had injuries to his head and stomach, bleeding” after being assaulted by a group of settlers in his home village of Susiya.

	After the Academy “refused” to publish a statement in support of Ballal after his Oscar win, according to Abraham, the organization was swift to apologize. “We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances,” it later said in a statement.

	Now, Ballal is talking about the experience in his own words. On what was a typical evening on Mar. 24, Ballal says he was quickly confronted by a group of men at his home and believed he and his wife would be killed that night. “It is difficult for me to write about this moment now,” Ballal wrote in the piece published Friday. “After I was beaten, I was handcuffed, blindfolded and thrown into an army jeep. For hours I lay blindfolded on the ground on what I later learned was an army base, fearing that I would be held for a long time and beaten again and again. I was released a day later.”


	The filmmaker said that winning the Oscar just three weeks earlier was “one of the most incredible moments of his life”. He said: “I had a taste of power and possibility… Los Angeles and the Oscars were of an entirely different world from the one I know: I was struck by the enormous buildings, the rushing cars, the wealth all around me. And suddenly there we were, me and my three other co-directors, on one of the world's most important stages, accepting the award.”


	But even though the movie received global recognition, Ballal confesses that he feels the group had failed in their attempt to make life better for his fellow community. “My life is still at the mercy of the settlers and the occupation,” he said. “My community is still suffering from unending violence. Our movie won an Oscar, but our lives are no better than before.”

	











	The attack on him and his community was “brutal”, Ballal continued, but occurs frequently in the region. “Just a few days later, dozens of settlers, many of them masked, attacked Jinba, a village nearby. Five people were hospitalized, and more than 20 were arrested. Later the army raided the village and ransacked homes, the mosque and the school.”


	With the press attention received because of the Oscar victory, Ballal finishes the op-ed by urging the public not to “turn away” from the violence happening in Susiya and further afield. “I know that there are thousands and thousands of people who now know my name and my story, who know my community's name and our story and who stand with us and support us. Don't turn away now.”


	The IDF had offered a different version of events surrounding the incident in its own statement released after the incident, saying the violence started after “several terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles.” Both sides began throwing rocks at one another, and as IDF and Israeli police arrived at the conflict, “several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces.” Both parties agreed that three Palestinians were detained.


No Other Land, capturing the budding friendship between a Palestinian activist and Israeli journalist, was directed by four filmmakers — two Israeli, two Palestinian. It took home the prize for best documentary at the 97th annual Academy Awards on March 2.

OUAI's Jen Atkin honored the Rhode guru as beauty innovator of the year and dished that “what really gets her heated” is old episodes of ‘Grey's Anatomy': ""I kind of wish Ellen Pompeo was here today.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



The Daily Front Row presented its 9th annual Fashion Awards in Los Angeles on Thursday night during a starry ceremony at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The well-known fashion publication revealed its roster of fashion and beauty winners in advance, a starry list of names that included Tyra Banks, supermodel Adriana Lima, stylist Brad Goreski and designer Betsey Johnson. 


	But upon arrival, attendees learned that another trophy had been added to the list and its intended recipient would be on hand to accept. In a surprise move, Hailey Bieber, model, influencer and Rhode founder, turned up in the 90210 as she was feted as beauty innovator of the year.

	After stepping into the lights on the Beverly Hills Hotel's Crystal Ballroom stage, Bieber kicked off her acceptance speech with an apology. “My speech is going to be very generic in comparison to all the beautiful speeches before me,” referencing heartfelt words shared by honorees Banks, Lima, stylist duo Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald, hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos, makeup artist Alexx Mayo, and presenters Lizzo, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Dixie D'Amelio and more. “It's amazing to be in this room surrounded by so many talented and amazing people.

	Bieber then explained that when she founded Rhode, she wasn't looking to “start a brand for the sake of starting a brand.” She had much bigger ambitions. “I really wanted to create an entire world, and something that I say often is, ‘Welcome to the world of Rhode.' Because to me, Rhode isn't just products. It's a feeling. It's a lifestyle. It's a place. It's a world that is open to everyone and anybody that identifies with it. To see so many people gravitate toward it and become a part of our world is so humbling and so beautiful.”


	She singled out members of the Rhode team, including her fellow founding partners Michael and Lauren Ratner, and thanked “our incredible customers and supporters.” She also credited her friends for “being the best test subjects and biggest cheerleaders, and shouted out OUAI founder Jen Atkin for teaching her about beauty and brand building. Atkin was standing steps away behind the podium after offering the honoree tribute. Bieber then saved her final shout-out for her husband, pop superstar Justin Bieber.

	











	“And lastly, I want to thank my husband for supporting the dream of mine from the beginning and for always cheering me on,” she said. 


	Her acceptance speech came after a loving tribute from Atkin, who dished some personal details about their friendship and even fought back tears in the process. 


	“I am so excited to be here tonight to talk about my dear friend of over a decade, the glazed donut turned beauty mogul, Hailey Bieber. We traveled the world as I got to watch her slay the biggest red carpets. I got to watch her shoot major campaigns and on her biggest day, her wedding day, we hid in a tent from the paparazzi while I sobbed uncontrollably. But through everything she has remained truly the perfectly moisturized calm in the storm.”


	Atkin then teased that she was going to break her nondisclosure agreement by spilling “a big secret” and “the real drama behind closed doors.”


	“What really gets her heated is old Grey's Anatomy episodes,” Atkin dished. “I'm talking seasons one through four. She's obsessed and I kind of wish Ellen Pompeo was here today with us.”


	Back to Rhode. “The idea of Rhode really was a dream of hers for so, so long. She talked about it constantly. She wasn't interested in following trends or creating pricey products with this complicated routine. She wanted really great formulas, beautiful packaging because she also wanted to create really engaging and authentic content because she wanted us all to be alongside her journey of creating this. I was there for Rhode's very first campaign shoot, and immediately you guys, I felt so bad for her entire team. The woman is a detail fanatic. I'm talking from formulas to fonts, creative to catering. She is so incredibly hands-on. She shows up. She works so hard, and she knows exactly what she wants.”

	











	Atkin praised that level of dedication for pushing Rhode not only into the center of all things beauty, “but culture at large” through viral lip treatments, cellphone cases, photo booths and pop-ups around the world. “Hailey, I am so proud of you, you're a boss. You are a style icon and a skin-care guru, but your success is not just limited to your career. You are the most loving wife, daughter, sister, friend, and now you're a mom to the cutest little boy I've ever seen — besides my son.”


	Breakout actor, comedian and Las Culturistas podcast host Matt Rogers hosted the Daily Front Row's Los Angeles ceremony, which was presented by Lagos, Moroccanoil, DAOU Vineyards, Milly and Casamigos. The program also saw Banks honored as fashion icon by presenter Beverly Johnson, Lima feted as comeback of the year by UFC champ Amanda Nunes, Alexx Mayo named makeup artist of the year with a tribute by Lizzo (who also sang him “Happy Birthday”), Betsey Johnson honored with a lifetime achievement award presented by Selma Blair, Dimitris Giannetos named hairstylist of the year with an introduction by Dixie D'Amelio, Brad Goreski honored as style curator of the year presented by Ashley Park, stylist duo Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald feted as men's stylists of the year with a tribute by Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Genesis Webb handed the breakthrough music stylist of the year trophy by client and close friend Chappell Roan.

The Catalyst of Change honor was presented to her by Lily Allen on Thursday night (April 24).


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Every night on tour, Olivia Rodrigo performs for countless women and girls – but when they all funnel out of the arenas and festival grounds at the end of each of her shows, she worries constantly for their futures.


	That's why she's spent almost her entire career advocating for reproductive rights, using her platform to speak out against oppressive policy changes and raising money through her concerts for abortion funds. And on Thursday evening (April 24) at Planned Parenthood of Greater New York's Spring Into Action Gala in New York City, those efforts were honored by the organization with the designation of 2025's Catalyst of Change award to the 22-year-old pop star, who asked during her speech, “When I play shows, I look out at crowds filled with young girls and the bond I feel with them is profound… I often wonder, ‘What happens to those girls when they leave those venues? What are their dreams? What kind of world are they returning to?'”

	











	Rodrigo was one of two guests of honor at the night's celebration at Cipriani South Street in lower Manhattan, with Amanda Zurawski — the Texas woman who sued her home state in 2023 after she nearly died due to pregnancy complications and was denied an abortion — also getting a moment of recognition as this year's Champion of Change award winner. Past winner Laverne Cox was on hand to present Zurawski with the honor, while the “Vampire” singer's friend and fellow activist Lily Allen (with whom she chanted “F–k you” to the Supreme Court at her Glastonbury set three years prior, shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned), gave Rodrigo a heartfelt introduction. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Olivia, my love, you're the realest,” the British singer-songwriter gushed after commending Rodrigo for not “[straying] from her values to make powerful people comfortable.” “You use your platform because you actually give a s–t about reproductive freedom and justice. And in this world, genuinely giving a s–t is revolutionary.”


	After taking the stage and giving Allen a hug, Rodrigo used her speech to highlight the work of Planned Parenthood and shout out Zurawski — “You deserve this award far more than I do,” the singer said, singling out the activist in the audience — before paying tribute to Cecile Richards, the healthcare organization's former president who died earlier this year after battling brain cancer.

	











	“It's a privilege to be here tonight to support an organization that, despite countless obstacles, continues to show up with compassion, hope and dignity for women,” Rodrigo told a crowd of donors and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York board members, who clung to every word. “My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.”


	“[Richards] led at a time of relentless attacks on care and constant efforts to silence and shame women into submission,” the three-time Grammy winner added. “She reminds us that standing up for what's right doesn't mean we have to be fearless. We can be scared, we can be angry, we can feel hopeless. We just have to fight anyway.”


	The event honoring her comes after years of Rodrigo being one of the most vocal and hands-on modern pop stars when it comes to advocating for reproductive freedom. Back in May 2022 at a Sour Tour concert in Washington, D.C., just after the overturning of Roe, she made headlines for telling her crowd, “Our bodies should never be in the hands of politicians … I hope we can raise our voices to protect our right to have a safe abortion, which is a right that so many people before us have worked so hard to get.”


	On her next tour in support of 2023 Billboard 200-topping sophomore album Guts, Rodrigo launched her Fund 4 Good, which funneled proceeds from her shows on the trek to local abortion funds. Through the initiative, the Grammy winner also had local abortion funds set up tables at her venues, allowing young fans to learn about reproductive health and resources. In December, she announced that she'd donated more than $2 million in ticket sales from her 2024 Guts Tour — which continues this year with shows in Latin America and Europe as well as a run of global festival dates — to 10 organizations around the world championing girls' education, reproductive rights and the prevention of gender-based violence.

	











	Read Rodrigo's full speech at the 2025 Planned Parenthood Spring Into Action Gala below.


Um, first of all, huge thank you to Lily. I absolutely adore you and I'm so grateful that you're here tonight, thank you. And a huge thank you to Planned Parenthood of Greater New York for this incredible honor. 


I feel very fortunate for so many things in my life and my career. Over the past few years, I've gotten to live out dreams that I had as a little girl. I've traveled the world, I've written music that inspires me, and I've met so many of the people I grew up worshiping, like Miss Lily, for example.


But perhaps the greatest privilege this career has given me is connection with women through my music. When I play shows, I look out at crowds filled with young girls and the bond I feel with them is profound. To be in a space where we can all feel safe to be wild, emotional and carefree is incredibly powerful, and even though we're not speaking one on one, those moments where we sing together and lock eyes, something real forms. It feels like we're part of each other's lives. I often wonder, ‘What happens to those girls when they leave those venues? What are their dreams? What kind of world are they returning to?


We live in a world that politicizes our bodies and uses harmful ideologies to deny us safety and healthcare, and it breaks my heart to think that, because of oppressive laws and outdated policies, some of those girls may not get to follow their dreams the way I was able to follow mine. Just a year ago, fueled by heartbreak and anger over what was happening in the world, I launched my Fund 4 Good, a global initiative that supports local nonprofits, championing reproductive freedom, girls' education and the prevention of gender-based violence. A portion of my tour proceeds went to the fund, and I'm proud to share that we've raised and donated over $2 million to organizations around the world.












I'm so, so incredibly humbled to be here amongst so many real-life heroes in the fight for freedom of choice. Amanda, wherever you are – where are you? Oh, hi Amanda! I'm absolutely floored by your story. Your ability to turn something so heartbreaking and painful into such powerful activism is so incredibly inspiring. I'm just so in awe of you. You deserve this award far more than I do, and I'm just very honored to stand with you tonight and celebrate your bravery.


I can't express how much I admire Planned Parenthood and the life-saving work that they do. Providing affordable healthcare, cancer screenings, birth control, STD testing, and abortion care, amongst so many other things, gives women the autonomy to care for themselves and shape their futures. It's a privilege to be here tonight to support an organization that, despite countless obstacles, continues to show up with compassion, hope and dignity for women. My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.


Before I go, I want to honor Cecile Richards. She led at a time of relentless attacks on care and constant efforts to silence and shame women into submission, but Cecile stood her ground, and in doing so, she stood up for millions of us. I never got the chance to meet her, but her legacy of resilience and decency continues to impact me. She reminds us that standing up for what's right doesn't mean we have to be fearless. We can be scared, we can be angry, we can feel hopeless. We just have to fight anyway. Thank you again, so much.

""Beard's continued physical therapy has shown to be very effective in dealing with the issue that caused him to leave the recent US leg of the tour,"" a statement from promoters read.

	Over a month since ZZ Top announced drummer Frank Beard would be sitting out a number of tour dates over an unspecified “health issue,” it's been confirmed that his absence will now extend to the band's forthcoming Australian tour.

	The Texas trio revealed on March 15 that Beard would be absent from the group's current Elevation tour due to the need to undergo an unspecified health procedure. “Shelter Music Group, ZZ Top's management, has announced the band's drummer, Mr. Frank Beard, has temporarily stepped away from the current tour to attend a health issue requiring his focus in the near term,” a social media post from the band read.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“Beard, along with fellow ZZ Top members Billy F Gibbons and Elwood Francis, presently on the Elevation tour since March 5, have engaged fellow Texan and longtime tech member, percussionist and drummer, John Douglas, for the interim.”


	Douglas has long maintained a close relationship with both Beard and his bandmates, having previously sat in for the drummer during a Paris performance in October 2002 when he underwent an emergency appendectomy.


	“Beard's continued physical therapy has shown to be very effective in dealing with the issue that caused him to leave the recent US leg of the tour,” Live Nation's statement continued. “While cheered by the positive news, band and management believe that his total recovery must be priority #1. 


	“Beard's attending physicians have suggested more physical therapy over a longer period would potentially achieve better and longer lasting results, and this will now be his focus.”


	Beard has been the drummer of ZZ Top since 1969, when he took over from co-founder Dan Mitchell. Alongside vocalist and guitarist Billy Gibbons, Mitchell and bassist Lanier Greig had founded the band that same year. 


	Following Grieg's replacement by Billy Ethridge, Dusty Hill assumed the role of bassist in 1970, with their lineup remaining unchanged for 51 years until Hill's death at 72 in 2021. Elwood Francis has since served as the group's bassist.

	











	The group will embark upon their first Australian tour since 2013 on Saturday, April 26th. The ten-date tour will conclude in mid-May, with a handful of New Zealand tour dates to be followed by an additional North American trek in June. The band's 51-date trek will run through until October.

	Prior to “Money on Money” hitting streaming services, Thug has laid low for much of the first four months of 2025 outside of appearing on Lil Baby's “Dum, Dumb, and Dumber” with Future. 


	Future and Thug have an extensive collaborative history as two of the rap titans calling Atlanta home. They previously joined forces for the Super Slimey joint album in 2017, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. 


	Other standout collabs from their catalogs include “Relationship,” Gunna's “Pushin P,” Drake's “Way Too Sexy” and “Sup Mate.”


	After serving more than two years behind bars as part of the longest-running trial in Georgia's history, Thug secured his freedom when he was released after reaching a plea deal on Halloween that saw the rapper sentenced to 15 years of probation.


	Earlier in April, Thug announced UY SCUTI on X and launched the album's official online shop equipped with vinyl records, CDs and merch bundles. 


	“It's Time. Red Planet,” he wrote alongside the link to the UY SCUTI store. According to Nine Planets, Uy Scuti is a supergiant red star that's located in the constellation named Scutum.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Marvel Comics and Marvel Studios are teaming on a Fantastic Four: First Steps comic which is launching on July 2. Here's why this is a big deal: It's the first time that the comics side and the studio side have worked together on a comic set in the world of a specific MCU movie. 


	Matt Fraction  (Hawkeye, Fantastic Four) wrote the Fantastic Four: First Steps comic with drawings by Mark Buckingham Fantastic Four, Fables)  and cover art by Phil Noto. It's a one-shot comic book that's published by Future Foundation. 


	The one-shot comic book is designed to be an artefact from the world of the upcoming movie and confirms a few things that fans have speculated about, including that The Fantastic Four: First Steps is not an origin story, but will pick up four years after they become heroes. Marvel Comics worked closely with filmmakers on the comics, pulling in the tone and feel of the pic's feel from production designer Kasra Farahani. Fraction and other talent from the comic even visited the set of the film.

	These superheroes are hugely significant to Marvel; the publication of The Fantastic Four in 1961 kicked off the Marvel Era in comics, and Marvel's First Family introduced what would later become hallmarks of Marvel storytelling: relatable characters with real, human drama.


	Marvel Comics Editor in Chief C.B. Cebulski said, “As Marvel's First Family, the Fantastic Four and their stories have always been at the very center of the Marvel Universe. With The Fantastic Four: First Steps coming later this summer, we at Marvel all felt this was the perfect opportunity to bring our teams together in honor of their legacy in both the world of the film and within our comics. It's been a blast to have our teams in Publishing and Studios bounce ideas back and forth to create something truly special and one-of-a-kind, and we can't wait for fans to be able to dive in to this comic—squarely in the world of the MCU—and experience the Fantastic Four like we've never seen before this summer.”

	











	He added, “The heart of Marvel has always stemmed from the comics, and Kevin and the team have been bringing those pages to life in extraordinary ways with each and every film. With this comic, we're bringing those two worlds together in a way we think fans will love.”

	The Oscar-nominated 2020 movie Greyhound saw Hanks play an inexperienced U.S. Navy commander who, soon after the U.S.' entry into the war, is tasked with leading an Allied convoy being stalked by a German submarine wolf pack. It was based on the 1955 novel The Good Shepherd. Cast also included Rob Morgan and Elisabeth Shue.

	The sequel is the latest Apple Original to hail from Hanks and Goetzman's Playtone. The partners previously teamed with Amblin on WWII series Masters of the Air.


	The partners on the sequel declined to comment.

Political Editor


	This year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner will be focused on “journalists and journalism” and in a departure from the past, will include speeches from the association's annual award winners, according to this year's president, Eugene Daniels.


	The evening at the Washington Hilton not only looks to be a departure from tradition, as there will be no POTUS and no comedian, but will “match the moment that we are living in right now,” Daniels said. 


	The moment is a fraught time for the press corps and the WHCA itself.

	As president, Daniels presided over the transition from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, and while things generally went smoothly in the first couple of weeks, that quickly changed on Feb. 14 when the president's team announced an indefinite ban on the Associated Press from its slot in the White House pool. The AP sued, with the WHCA supporting the case via a friend of the court brief. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The day after the first hearing in the case, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the administration, not the WHCA, would take charge of who is in the pool and of other logistics, taking over duties that the independent non-profit has handled for decades. 


	Although the AP has had some access restored following a judge's determination that the White House was in violation of the First Amendment, the White House has indicated that it wanted to take other actions, like control over who sits where in the briefing room.


	Daniels, who recently moved from Politico to MSNBC, said that there may be unexpected moments of the evening, but cautioned that he didn't “want to oversell a bunch of surprises.” 


	“When [the WHCA board was] sitting down, and as the dinner has kind of shifted, and as the world has shifted, the focus [was on] ‘You know what, we should hear from the people who actually do all the work. We should hear from the people who have for years pushed and prodded the presidents, and who are the apex of their careers in getting this award, and we should honor them by giving them center stage.”


	Deadline spoke with Daniels on Thursday about what to expect on Saturday, and how he and the WHCA have handled Trump 2.0. 


DEADLINE: So a very simple question: What can we expect to see at the dinner?












EUGENE DANIELS: Everyone can expect a dinner that tries to match the moment that we're living in, that works to match the mood of the press corps, and that is working to fit the need of celebrating the First Amendment, celebrating the award winners, celebrating the scholarship students that are there, and at its core, celebrating the people that go to the White House every single day, holding the most powerful leaders in our country accountable. It's going to look a little different for folks. … Will there be moments of levity? Maybe. Probably not. Even the videos that we have are more earnest and in a defense of journalism and a celebration of the work that the WHCA does everyday.


DEADLINE: When did it become clear that you had to drop plans for a comedian? [Amber Ruffin was originally set for the dinner.]


DANIELS: Those conversations, that thought process started happening around the time that the White House started blocking the AP. And the reason was because the mood of the press corps, and the feelings that that we felt on the board and that we heard from some of our members. And that just became very obvious as time went on, that at the end of the day, the focus needs to be on the journalists and journalism, and uplifting the folks in that room at a time when not everyone's feeling uplifted because of the attacks on the press.


DEADLINE: The White House was also out there attacking the comedian as well. Was that a factor?  


DANIELS: No. That wasn't a factor. The White House's objections to the comedian had nothing to do with our decision. We stand up to the White House all the time. When they make wrong decisions, like kicking the AP out or taking over the pool rotation or getting rid of the wire positions in the pool, the board, the association, our members are not scared of going toe-to-toe with any White House.


DEADLINE: Did you have any advance warning before the press secretary announced that the White House would be taking over the pool selection?


DANIELS: No, no, not at all. When she got behind the lectern and said that she they were taking over the pool, that was the first time that the board had heard of it, that they'd come to that decision.


DEADLINE: I heard some people say, Why didn't the press just boycott the briefing? Why wasn't more of a show of unity?


DANIELS: I think that, as a board, because I can speak for the board, we are a member-based organization, and we can do what the members want to do. And so I think I'll probably maybe leave it there…Many people in the press corps felt like we have to continue to do our jobs, being in the rooms, asking the tough questions, and that won out at the end of the day. … We represent our members, and we, as a board, cannot do things that our members don't want to do.


DEADLINE: Is there anything that you would have done differently before the White House made this move?


DANIELS: I don't know what we could have done differently. They didn't come to us and ask us. They didn't tell us, ‘Hey, you know, let's talk about this pool. Let's see what we can do here.' We were just as surprised as everyone else. So there was nothing else for us to do.


DEADLINE: There were some members who said it feels like everyone is just on their own. What was your response to that? [Andrew Feinberg, correspondent for The Independent, expressed concerns over print outlets' access to accurate and timely pool reports].


DANIELS: I don't want to talk about my response to Andrew Feinberg. What he was talking about was a print pool email. He wasn't talking about whether folks wanted to protest. And people never missed out on the print pool notes, so folks were never on their own. The board has worked diligently, all nine members, on a volunteer basis to fight for more access, and that has continued even as the relationship has changed with the White House.

	











DEADLINE: What other issues, the seating. Do you know what the status of seating in the briefing room? 


DANIELS: That's a question for the White House.


	[As reports surfaced that the White House was considering such a move, the WHCA board released a statement saying that the administration was trying to “cynically seize control of the system through which the independent press organizes itself, so that it is easier to exact punishment on outlets over their coverage.”]


DEADLINE: The thing about the pool is there are incredible amount of logistics involved in that. What's your assessment on how the White House has handled that? 


DANIELS: The reason that for years, the White House Correspondents' Association board, and …  people who are our pool chairs have been operating the pool logistics and all of the other logistics, is because it's important. And if White Houses have believed this too, that the people that are being covered do not choose who covers them. I'm not going to kind of judge how good or bad the White House logistics are. What I will say is that the no one understands the needs of the correspondents, videographers, audio techs, radio correspondents, producers, wire reporters, like the people who are their actual colleagues. Anyone who would suggest that the WHCA's control of the logistics was bad is just completely inaccurate. We have for decades, been able to see beyond the next angles, knowing all of the institutional knowledge that's on the board and within the membership, knowing what could happen on any type of trip, and there's no replacing that.


DEADLINE: What do you think the impact has been with the White House in control the pool? At the court hearing for the AP's case, Zeke Miller was asked that question and said, Oh, there is a difference in the type of questions that the president is getting.


DANIELS: I am not going to speak to what my friend Zeke said. But what I will say is that the board stance has always been a question of addition and not subtraction. So the White House has been adding people for years into pools that they maybe liked more than us, who are going to ask different questions. And we never fought that. It's addition, not subtraction. What we're talking about here is something completely different. And so what you have is the government choosing the people who ask the questions of the president. What I have been heartened by is that despite all of these attacks, the members of our association continue to ask hard-hitting questions, probing questions, questions that the American people deserve to have answers to, to the president of the United States, to his aides, to the people who you know walk down the driveway of the White House and do gaggles, members of the President's Cabinet. That has not stopped. But yes, there is a sprinkling of other types of questions but I will let other people speak to that.


DEADLINE: The administration keeps saying this is the most transparent White House in history. I hear that from Karoline Leavitt a lot. Do you agree with that?


DANIELS: I'm 36 years old, and I was not here when George Washington was president, so I can't speak to that. We see President Trump a lot, right? We hear from President Trump a lot. That isn't a question, and that's not something that the WHCA has opposed in any new way, shape or form.


DEADLINE: Leavitt also has made a point of having a new media seat and more reporters, more podcasters in the briefing room. What do you think has been the impact of that?












DANIELS: As you can see every single day that they have a press briefing, our folks still ask the same tough questions, no matter who else is in the room. I don't really know how to answer that question, because at the end of the day, again, it was a question of addition, not subtraction. Our folks are still in the room asking the tough questions, and that's what matters.


DEADLINE: You also moved from Politico to MSNBC, which has been a target of the president, has that had an impact at all on on how the administration treats you. 


DANIELS: The president attacked Politico as well, just to be very clear, on Truth Social and otherwise. I think at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. What people say about me and how they treat me is not my focus. My focus is on making sure that folks within the membership do what they need to do the jobs that they wake up every day to do. Personal pot shots at me are never going to stop me from advocating, supporting and defending the members of our association and the association itself.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


Blake Lively, currently embroiled in a headline-generating feud with Justin Baldoni and others, has revealed that her mother was assaulted years before she was born. 


	Accepting her honoree nomination at last night's Time100 Gala, the It Ends With Us star said that at her mother's “urging and unwavering bravery, she wanted me to share with you that she is a survivor of the worst crimes someone can commit against a woman.” 


	Delivering a toast last night at the gala, Lively said her mother, Willie Elain McAlpin, who was present, had “never got justice from her work acquaintance who attempted to take her life when she was the mother of three young kids—years before I was born.” 

	











	According to Lively, her mother was saved from the experience by an assault survivor who she had previously heard speak about her pain on the radio. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“The woman painfully and graphically shared how she escaped, and because of hearing that woman speak to her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today,” said Lively. “She was saved by a woman whose name she'll never know. I am alive, and standing with you all here today, being honored, because of a woman whose name I'll never know. I am here, my mom is here, because that woman not only survived, but she told others how.” 


	Lively described this experience as a “silent torch of womanhood that we come to know—a pact that privately we must show others how to survive, literally or spiritually.” 


	She paid tribute to “incredible” fellow Time100 Honoree Gisèle Pelicot, the French woman who attended every day of the trial of her husband and dozens of men accused of drugging, raping and assaulting her late last year.


	Lively swerved the elephant in the room, Baldoni, only briefly alluding to the saga by noting: “I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum.”


	A few hours prior, Deadline revealed that Lively and her publicist had been accused by Baldoni and his PR team of a “ploy to obtain subpoena power.” The overwhelming dispute began late last year when Lively filed a suit accusing Baldoni of harassment and strategizing to “destroy her reputation” on the It Ends With Us set.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


	Capping a week of earnings calls with CEOs in many industries slashing forecasts and warning of dire impact from Donald Trump‘s tariffs, Charter Communications‘ Chris Winfrey advanced a different view.


	Speaking to Wall Street analysts on the company's first-quarter call Friday morning, Winfrey characterized the tariffs in favorable terms, though he gestured to the uncertainty gripping corporate America.


	“Charter's an American company offering services to more than 57 million U.S. families and businesses,” he explained about the Stamford, CT-based provider of Spectrum broadband and pay-TV. “We have a 100% U.S.-based workforce, so naturally our preference is to buy American-made products when they're available and when they're priced competitively.”

	He continued, “Saying the obvious, tariff imbalances are by definition unfair. Clearly, President Trump has taken a strong stand that, at least from the outside, it appears to be creating an important opportunity for other countries to lower their tariffs and eliminate trade barriers and, from our perspective, to benefit U.S. workers like ours and our U.S.-based customers. But again, stating the obvious, we hope it can all happen soon and we're hoping that's the case.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	CFO Jessica Fischer addressed how the tariffs would factor into Charter's financial outlook. “I don't expect tariffs to have a meaningful overall impact on our capital expenditures,” she said, noting that the company has reiterated its guidance of $12 billion in spending “even including what we expect for the impact of tariffs today.”


	CEOs at Procter & Gamble, American Airlines and PepsiCo have told analysts in recent days that the on-again/off-again tariffs are rattling consumers and making it difficult for companies to plan. Media companies have been decidedly more sanguine, with Comcast, Imax, TelevisaUnivision and Netflix all indicating few concerns as of now.


	Winfrey was CFO of Charter when Trump was elected for his first term in 2016. The following year, after he was inaugurated, former CEO Tom Rutledge visited the White House to announce the company's commitment to $25 billion in spending on broadband infrastructure. 


	“They created a culture of customer service and excellence,” Trump said during the Oval Office meeting with Rutledge and other officials. “Most importantly, they brought back many jobs that had been shipped overseas, something that is happening far too often. But we're changing that.”

	











	Charter stock rose 8% in early trading Friday on the company's earnings report, which included better-than-expected total revenue of $13.74 billion. The company shed 60,000 internet customers in the January-to-March period, partly due to the L.A. wildfires. It also saw a decline of 181,000 video customers, which was a marked improvement from the prior-year quarter's loss of 405,000. Winfrey and Fischer cited the benefits of integrating streaming services like Max, Disney+ and Peacock into Spectrum plans, pegging the net value per month to customers at upwards of $80.


	The bottom line was a blemish on the quarterly numbers. Earnings per share came in at $8.42 per share, well below the compared with consensus outlook by analysts of $8.69.


	Media companies thus far have insisted they are not vulnerable to the tariffs, which were ramped up significantly after the March 31 end of the first quarter. Comcast execs on Thursday said they have not seen any impact in their theme park or ad businesses. Tech companies will report earnings next week, notably Apple next Thursday. With China leading the list of countries with which the U.S. has escalated trade conflict, investors are eagerly awaiting the views of Apple CEO Tim Cook and other CEOs.

“The Valley” star Brittany Cartwright is opening up about co-parenting her son, Cruz, 4, with her estranged husband, Jax Taylor. 

In an April 2025 Access Hollywood interview, Cartwright referenced that their son was diagnosed with autism in late 2024. According to Cartwright, the diagnosis was “a little bit harder for Jax to accept than it was for [her] to accept.” She clarified that Taylor adores Cruz. 

“He loves his son,” said Cartwright, who filed for divorce from Taylor in August 2024. 

She also said she “deal[s] with all the doctors and the therapists” for Cruz. She said while Taylor “doesn't see as much as [she] see[s] that goes into it,” he is “learning” about autism. 

“We're both learning. It's brand new. It hasn't always been easy. It hasn't been but I wouldn't change anything about Cruz. Ever,” said Cartwright to the publication. 

A post shared by Brittany Cartwright 💛 (@brittany)

While speaking to Access Hollywood, Cartwright explained why she went public with her son's diagnosis. 

“I can use my platform for something amazing. And I can help other families that are going through this,” said Cartwright during the interview. 

In addition, she said she wants to spread the message that “early intervention is so important” for children with autism. 

“With other families that are going through it, they need to realize that early intervention is so important to give their child the best life they can have,” said Cartwright. 

During an April 2025 interview with People magazine, Cartwright said her son attends preschool with a therapeutic companion and goes to speech and occupational therapy. Cartwright stated that she is “trying to do everything [she] possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever.” 

“I just make sure that he never misses a class, never misses a therapy session. If I have to work, I have the most amazing nanny in the entire world, she is literally my family. I don't know what I would do without her. Sometimes Jax will take him,” said Cartwright to the publication. “I want him to learn things as well, but the majority of the time, it's me. And I feel like I need to be there, I need to be learning what's going on, so that I can really work with him at home as well.”

A post shared by Brittany Cartwright 💛 (@brittany)

In a different April 2025 interview with Access Hollywood, Taylor spoke about his son. He said he decided to receive mental health help and get sober for the sake of Cruz. He then referenced his child's autism diagnosis. 

“My little boy needs me more than ever. And I feel like it's just a sign from God. Brittany and I are really coming together about this. Our little boy is our priority and making sure that he has the best life possible. And knowing that me and his mom will love him more than anything,” said Taylor to Access Hollywood.

“Dancing With the Stars” pros Val Chmerkovskiy and his brother, Maksim, took to social media to honor one of their closest supporters, businesswoman Elaine Wynn, shortly after her April 2025 death.

Maks, who was crowned the season 18 winner of “Dancing with the Stars” in 2014, posted an Instagram video on April 20 which he captioned, “RIP dear Elaine. You were truly one of a kind. Thank you for everything and I hope you're dancing up there.”

Dressed in a simple black graphic tee, the 45-year-old addressed the camera to say he's a private person when it comes to grief, but he felt addressing the situation was “necessary.” He acknowledged he was “a couple days late” to respond to the loss before telling his fans, “a few days ago, there was the passing of Mrs. Elaine Wynn.” He called the 82-year-old “an important figure in my life” before commemorating the dance enthusiast's impact with a sweet anecdote.

A post shared by Maksim Chmerkovskiy (@maksimc)

“It was my first season of ‘Dancing With the Stars.' It was a couple weeks in with my first ever partner on ‘DWTS,' Tia Carrere. I remember we flew out to New Jersey to my very first ‘Dance With Me' studio,” he recalled. “They filmed the package around me with all my couples for Tia to see the ballroom world, and most importantly Maks in coach mode.” He added, “George Hamilton was on that season. He gave me the phone and he said ‘Here, this is my friend and she wants to talk to you.' I said, ‘Hello?'” 

The ballroom pro went on to reveal the voice on the other end of the phone said, “Hi Max. My name is Elaine Wynn. Do you who I am?” Maks said he responded “no,” but he arranged to call her back and quickly got to know the philanthropist.

“When I spoke to her, she was so fond of the segment with my kids that she invited me with all my couples to put on a show for her,” he said, describing how Wynn invited him to be a part of a cancer fundraiser at Sloane Kettering in Manhattan. He said his participation in the star-studded event brought Wynn and another of her friends, “High School Musical” director Kenny Ortega, to their feet and paved the way for him to do seven corporate events with Wynn properties.

The same day his brother shared the sentimental video message about Wynn, Val Chmerkovskiy honored the casino mogul in his Instagram Stories, per Parade's report.

Val, who finished in second place with his partner Zendaya on season 16 of ‘DWTS,' wrote, “RIP to a generous, brilliant woman whose love for ballroom dance (and my brother) gave me and so many of my friends life-changing opportunities and memories. I will always cherish those times and your tremendous generosity.”

Elaine Wynn's net worth was around $2 billion at the time of her death, according to Town & Country. She was divorced from Steve Wynn, whom she married two times. Wynn's assets are expected to be divided among her two daughters, Kevyn and Gillian, and her seven grandchildren.

Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said.

In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen.

“I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. “No matter what happens with PK and I, he's always been my best friend, my husband, we're family. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.”

In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began.

Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. But when he was invited to attend the reunion taping, he declined and sent a statement instead.

Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion.

“I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com.

“Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. “That statement is both heartbreaking and false. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.”

“Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. “Many have wanted to speak out, but I have asked them not to because the truth should never need a champion. I refused to stoke a fire I did not ignite. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. That woman embodied kindness, integrity, and grace. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.”

PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. Am I correct?” Dorit responded that she was wrong.

In a confessional, Kemsley explained, “There are times that I think PK's the greatest father in the world. But is he the most hands-on father? The truth is, no. He would disappear and be gone for weeks and weeks without even calling the kids. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.”

Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. She explained that her comment came as she was still reeling from a multi-page email her ex had sent her.

Speaking with Rollacoaster, Kemsley said she never wants to go  “toe to toe” with PK.

“I know his feelings about what I had said in the moment about him not being a great dad, I not only apologized to him, but I – in my confessional and in the after show – immediately took it back and explained that this is after a couple of months of not speaking, I was really worried about the kids,” she explained. “I felt very, very bad. It was in a weak, vulnerable moment after a seven-page vicious email. You can only take the high road for so long.”

While her marital problems are still being sorted out, Kemsley said she is looking forward to her next chapter. “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jonathan Knight's ‘Insane' Summer: New Show in the Works","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/jonathan-knight-show-las-vegas-residency/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:32:39 GMT","

There's still no word on whether Jonathan Knight's “Farmhouse Fixer” will return to HGTV for a fourth season. But fans eager to see more of him after his stint on the current season of “Rock the Block” may want to head to Las Vegas. 

Jonathan told People on April 24, 2025, that his summer there is “going to be insane.” The New Kids on the Block (NKOTB) member, who's competing with his brother and fellow bandmate Jordan Knight on season six of “Rock the Block,” will be part of the group's Las Vegas residency at the Dolby Live at Park MGM from June 20 to July 5. They'll be back for more shows from November 1 – 15, and again in February 2026. 

The summer residency, he said, will be extra busy due to other fan events they have planned. And it looks like filming a new HGTV show while there is in the works, too. 

A post shared by New Kids On The Block (@nkotb)

Teasing NKOTB's “The Right Stuff” residency, Jonathan told People, “Vegas is going to be insane. It's definitely gong to be very different from other shows that we did. I mean, we are in Vegas, so it's a little more upscale, a little more sexy. And the stage is absolutely huge.”

On top of the concerts, per People, the group has multiple fan events planned. A “Blockhead HQ Clubhouse” will be located at Park MGM, complete with an NKOTB museum featuring “memorabilia, live entertainment and panels, themed food and drinks.” Members plan to make appearances there, too.  

The band will also appear at several after-parties following their concerts on June 21, June 28, and July 5, per People, at On the Record Speakeasy inside the Park MGM. 

Meanwhile, it looks highly likely that Jonathan — and potentially his bandmates — will be part of an HGTV show filming in Vegas. In February, a casting agent working with High Noon, the production company behind “Farmhouse Fixer,” posted a casting call for a NKOTB “superfans” who live within 60 minutes of Las Vegas and desperately need a home makeover. 

The post from Justin Nichols said, “✨NOW CASTING: NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK SUPERFANS IN THE LAS VEGAS AREA✨ Do you have tons of NKOTB merchandise and swag? Is your house a 1980s time warp? Does your home desperately need a makeover?!” 

Casting is now closed, according to Backstage, which said filming will take place in June and July — the same time of NKOTB's first residency shows.  

On April 24, NKOTB announced they'll release a 35th anniversary edition of their “Step By Step” album on June 13, featuring bonus material, unreleased tracks, and remixes. The album features Jonathan's first song as lead singer, “Happy Birthday” — a move that the group's manager insisted on.  

“I never wanted to be front and center,” Jonathan told People, “but I remember Maurice was very adamant about me singing it. He said, ‘Everybody has a birthday and it happens every year. So you have to do this because fans are going to play this every year on their birthday for the rest of their lives.' And, yeah. he was right.” 

Jonathan sang it live during each concert on the group's Summer Magic Tour in 2024, which many of his HGTV colleagues attended. 

“It's such an amazing gift that we're still singing these songs that we recorded when we were kids,” he told People, “and that our fans still love singing along with us 35 years later.”

When “American Idol” judges Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie delivered their decision on which four contestants would round out the top 14 on April 21, 2025, Baylee Littrell did not make the cut after performing John Legend's “All of Me.”

That was a shocker for lots of Backstreet Boys fans who've been cheering on the son of BSB member Brian Littrell since he confirmed his 22-year-old son had auditioned. Baylee made it all the way to the top 20, but both Underwood and Bryan acknowledged that his elimination is likely tough on his dad and his fans. 

A post shared by Baylee Littrell (@bayleelittrell_music)

Moments after the top 14 was finalized, Underwood acknowledged to “Entertainment Tonight” that she was aware Brian, who attended and even sang during his son's audition, was likely a bit upset with the judges over their decision. 

When the outlet asked Underwood about him possibly being upset, she replied, “Um, don't think it didn't cross my mind!” 

Bryan also weighed in, telling “ET” that “there may be a Backstreet Boy that's a little disappointed, and a lot of Backstreet Boy fans.” 

Baylee, meanwhile, told “ET” after he got cut, “It's been a very long journey, a lot of pre-judgment, and now, uh, these guys gave me my chance. Just blessed to be here. Backstreet's back.” 

Though Baylee received tons of support from BSB fans, he also faced a great deal of criticism from “Idol” viewers who labeled him a “nepo baby,” riding on the coattails of his famous dad. 

Baylee's famous dad responded to his son's April 22 Instagram post about being cut from the competition, writing, “Bubba I am and always will be in your corner. You'd are so strong and so very talented, and inspire me every day. It's never the end, only the beginning for so many to be blessed by your gifts….. you killed it last night. 🔥❤️”

Brian's wife, Leighanne Littrell, also weighed in on their son's post, disappointed that “Idol” didn't upload his final performance to its social media pages. 

“I wish they would have posted last nights performance,” she wrote. “You killed it bubba! SO SO VERY PROUD! You are a true artist, no bells and whistles needed! Keep on keepin on! I can't wait for what's to come!”

Another Backstreet Boy, Kevin Richardson, wrote on Baylee's post, “So glad you got to experience this. Proud of you young man. Your journey has just begun… ❤️”

BSB fans also flooded Baylee's post with support, including one who wrote, “So proud of you Baylee! It got your name and music out for the world to see! 😍 You killed it! Here's to much success and more music! 😍”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘The Voice' Schedule: When Do the Live Shows Start","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/the-voice-live-shows-begin/","Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:11:55 GMT","

The Knockouts Part 3 of “The Voice” season 27 aired on April 14, with 20 contestants set to sing in the upcoming Playoffs, which will air on Monday, April 28, at 8 p.m. EST, NBC reported. 

Part two of the Playoffs will air on May 5, during which the season 27 coaches, Adam Levine, Kelsea Ballerini, John Legend, and Michael Bublé, who each have five members on their team, will choose two to go on to the next live round, which will likely begin on May 12.

The format of “The Voice” changed to once a week on Mondays instead of two days in a row, but the live rounds will feature some episodes on Tuesdays, per NBC.

Ballerini has a diverse team of singers, and as of now, she has Jaelen Johnston (21), Darius J (35), Alanna Lynise (21), Tinika Wyatt (50), and Iris Herrera (19) going to the Playoffs.

On Bublé's team are Jaydn Cree (23), Adam David (34), Kaiya Hamilton (26), Barry Jean Fontenot (31), and Angie Rey (25).

Legend has Olivia Kuper Harris (34), Renzo (33), Ari Camille (21), Bryson Battle (21), and BD.ii (31).

Team Adam consists of Conor James (28), Britton Moore (21), Ethan Eckenroad (26), Lucia Flores Wiseman (22), and Kolby Codell (33).

On the April 14 episode of “The Voice” season 27, Kelsea Ballerini used her last steal to take Darius J from Levine.

“I have been waiting for this for so long,” the “Peter Pan” singer said. She shared, “I think Darius is so special. He has this certainty about him and this joy, quirkiness. I don't think I have anyone on my beat on that level of full-encompassing performer. I fought so hard for Darius since the jump.”

During the blind auditions, Darius J sang Usher's “Caught Up,” which made Bublé turn around first. Levine immediately pressed his button next. Ballerini followed soon after, resulting in a three-chair turn.

As the coaches fought to have the singer on their team, Levine told him, “When it comes to ‘The Voice,' I've honestly done it all. I just feel like it's going to be a very magical ride. Please pick me as your coach.”

Ballerini chimed in, “You are the best entertainer I have seen on this stage. Hearing your voice is one thing, and it is electric, and it's magnetic.”

She continued, “Seeing you use your voice is a whole different level. Like, you are such an artist, and my gut is telling me that I can do this with you.” Ultimately, Darius J went with Levine until Ballerini's steal. 

Tune in on April 14 to see which artists make it to the next round and ultimately land them in the live shows. Fans can also stream “The Voice” episodes the next day on Peacock.

Last Thursday night, moviegoers across this godforsaken land rabidly made their way to the nearest multiplex — or pilgrimaging across state lines to the closest theater capable of projecting 15-Perf IMAX 70mm film — in order to see early screenings of the first original blockbuster from a gifted filmmaker whose fame has been predicated upon his ability to put a strong personal stamp on increasingly generic Hollywood franchises.

At that very same time, halfway around the world, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and chief creative officer Dave Filoni took the stage at Star Wars Celebration 2025 in Chiba, Japan to announce that the next chapter of cinema's most iconic saga would be directed by a filmmaker whose fame has been predicated upon his ability to be friends with Ryan Reynolds.

 








Related Stories ‘Sinners' Took a Nice Bite Out of a Random Tuesday at the Box Office Ryan Coogler Thanks Over 40 ‘Cinematic Influences' Who Inspired ‘Sinners,' Including Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, and Brian De Palma 

The movie business has always been held aloft by the tension between genuine pop artistry and mass-produced slop, two separate but hopelessly entwined ambitions that have proven even harder to balance than the Force. While both have their value, those values are in a constant state of flux, and they can only be determined with any real accuracy by measuring the difference between them. 

Seldom has that difference ever seemed more dramatic than it did at the fateful moment when “Sinners” mania overlapped with the reveal of “Star Wars: Starfighter.” 

On the one hand, you have an ultra-personal multiplex event that could not and would not have been made by anyone else — a music-driven genre mash-up that reworks age-old vampire tropes into a fresh, thoughtful, and deliciously hot-blooded period saga rooted in the specifics of Black history. On the other hand, you have a nakedly anonymous attempt to salvage a franchise that produced one of the most radical legacy sequels in the history of that concept, only to spend the last eight years selling itself out to the lowest common denominator in a futile bid for forgiveness. 

While “Sinners” was offering one audience something they had never seen before, “Star Wars: Starfighter” was pitching a different audience a movie so generic and familiar that even its title sounds like it's repeating itself. 

Of course, “Sinners” has the advantage of being a finished product that people have seen and loved, whereas “Star Wars: Starfighter” is still just a graphic designed to rile up the fanbase and appease whatever portion of Disney shareholders have already forgotten the great “Lightyear” debacle of 2022. (Just to be clear, this isn't Starfighter the ship. This is the origin story of the human Starfighter that the ship is based on.) And, while anything's possible, I'm not suggesting that Coogler's movie will ultimately outgross the first “Star Wars” feature that promises to pick up from the saga where “Episode IX” left off. 

 










All the same, the enthusiasm gap between these two projects — the reality of one, and the promise of another — has been tellingly immense. So far as the national water cooler is concerned, “Sinners” has ousted the Chicken Jockey as the biggest film story of the year, and stoked the rare kind of excitement that leads to $8.6 million Tuesdays and people scalping IMAX tickets on eBay. It's also cemented Coogler's status as a brand unto himself, and proved that Warner Bros. doesn't have to sell its soul to “A Minecraft Movie” in order to stave off financial ruin. Conversely, there may not be a single person on Earth who's more optimistic about the future of the galaxy far, far away now that a significant portion of its fate has been entrusted to the director of “The Adam Project.”

The serendipitous timing of these announcements was a bit on the nose. You couldn't have scripted a better way of confirming the reality that studios have been trying to prevent ever since they offered mid-budget movies as a blood sacrifice at the altar of mega-tentpole franchises: Mediocrity is losing its grip on the public imagination. (Cookie-cutter as “A Minecraft Movie” might have been in the end, I maintain that getting the “Napoleon Dynamite” guy to adapt a plotless video game about blocks was less of a slam-dunk than it seems, and the Chicken Jockey phenomenon speaks to a degree of novelty that was missing from recent short-fallers like “Captain America: Brave New World.”) 

 










I trust that Levy is a nice guy, and I suppose it's possible that the sheer gravity of “Star Wars” might inspire the “Free Guy” auteur to up his game (I'd entertain the argument that both “The Force Awakens” and “The Last Jedi” are the best movies their respective directors have ever made), but I'm not the only one who finds Disney's lack of faith in its signature IP disturbing, and I struggle to imagine that it will work out well for them. 

Levy's hiring only seems to deepen the sense that Jon Favreau's forthcoming “The Mandalorian and Grogu” — possibly the worst movie title I've heard since “Star Wars: Starfighter,” in addition to being an outgrowth of a TV show that lost most of its luster two seasons ago — isn't just a stop-gap to buy the franchise some time, but also a reflection of the studio's apprehensiveness to make any decisions it can't take back. 

But, as I recently wrote about in the context of Disney's “Thunderbolts*” trailer and what it means for the MCU to restyle itself in the vein of A24, “the future belongs to movies that people actively want to see,” and the decision to go with someone as flavorless as Levy reeks of the “let's coast off a love of the brand and not offend anyone” approach that simply doesn't work anymore.

 










I know that Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand weren't exactly the most idiosyncratic directors of their day either, but the second and third “Star Wars” movies didn't have to justify their own existences in the same way that “Starfighter” will; they didn't come out at a time when people could watch a variety of aggressively mid “Star Wars” TV shows from the comfort of their homes. 

And, not for nothing, but even the relative passivity of television isn't safe from the numbing glut of streaming content. Case in point: The buzz around “Starfighter” was immediately eclipsed by the electric reaction to the new season of “Andor,” which just so happens to be the only “Star Wars” project since “The Last Jedi” that defies expectations as to what its franchise can be and do.

“Sinners” isn't based on pre-existing IP, but its success depended upon a brand of a different kind. Not only is the film about pop art's power to preserve cultural memory as part of an intergenerational song of pain, hope, and the pursuit of freedom, it was sold on the strength of Ryan Coogler's self-evident passion for telling this particular story (a story whose origins trace back to his late uncle James, who once seeded the young filmmaker's imagination with vivid details about growing up in the Delta). 

 










Warner Bros. didn't hide the fact that audiences would get two Michael B. Jordans for the price of one, or that both of them would square off in a blues-soaked battle royale against a horde of white blood-suckers at the height of the Jim Crow South, but it's no accident that the most effective piece of marketing — by far — was a 10-minute Kodak video in which Coogler talked people through his new movie's various screening formats. 

Today's audiences have grown somewhat accustomed to the concept of shifting aspect ratios and the benefits of large-format theaters (every new Christopher Nolan film comes with its own infographic explaining the difference between IMAX, lieMAX, and the sub-human poverty of a standard DCP), but it something very different to see a cool young filmmaker so enthusiastically nerd out about the perforations on the side of an Ultra Panavision frame. Cutting between exclusive “Sinners” footage and film school-worthy clips of Coogler standing in front of the diagrams he'd drawn on a white board, the video went viral because it clearly illustrated how much this shit means to him, and how much attention he and his team paid to making the experience special for moviegoers. 

As the director said in a recent interview: “I want people walking out of the theater and thinking, ‘Man, I had a full meal. They really care about the medium.' Everybody on the project knew that this was going to theaters. They all care about seeing movies on the big screen and what it feels like when you see a good one.”

 










That enthusiasm proved contagious. You don't need to care about the difference between 2.76:1 and 1.90:1 to feel it in your bones when the screen widens during the film's climactic siege, and you sure as hell don't need to care about it in order to appreciate a director making so earnest an appeal to our attention at a time when most studio movies feel like they were made with the same casual indifference that audiences have been conditioned to watch them. 

While Coogler's first original project was always going to command a certain amount of hype, the decision to lead with its importance to him galvanized people around the notion that “Sinners” was more than just another movie they could watch at home in three weeks (rave reviews from basically every critic in the country didn't hurt either). 

It lay the groundwork for the film to feel like an event, it teed the film up to deliver on that promise, and it set the stage for audiences — especially Black audiences, who continue to be starved for mega-budget studio movies that provocatively engage with race as something more than a temporary branding initiative — to unpack the layers of its meaning on social media with a much greater degree of thought and wonder than the likes of “Snow White” or “The Amateur” managed to inspire. 

 










It's good that “Sinners” is great, but I tend to suspect that even a somewhat less successful version of the same film would have triggered a broadly similar response, which is to say that “Sinners” is sparking so much real excitement because it palpably came from such a real place. 

While it's not a coincidence that “Nope” was the last completely original movie to hit at this level (another self-aware spectacle that interrogated the blind spots of Black representation on screen, and will be dominating best of the decade lists in a few years' time), the fervor around “Sinners” also puts it in a category that Jordan Peele's creature feature shares with “Oppenheimer,” “Avatar,” and “Nosferatu.” 

Which is to say: Films that connected with audiences because they dared to emphasize an idiosyncratic creative vision over the safety of selling people on something they'd already seen before. Hollywood is soiling itself at the thought of a director (eventually) owning the rights to his work? Hollywood should be kissing Ryan Coogler's feet for creating a film that already feels like it belongs to him.

The 16th annual TCM Classic Film Festival got off to a roaring start Thursday night, screening one of the greatest movies ever made in one of the greatest venues in the country with one of the most influential filmmakers of all time in attendance. 

The movie: the 1980 sci-fi classic “The Empire Strikes Back.” The venue: the glorious TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. The filmmaker: George Lucas, appearing for a rare pre-show Q&A to discuss the making of his “Star Wars” sequel and why he felt financial — but not creative — pressure following up what was then the most commercially successful film in history.

 










In a conversation with Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, Lucas explained that he never felt intimidated by the prospect of failing to live up to “Star Wars,” because he had written the story for “Empire” long before the first film became an unexpected hit. “When I write, it's like a blueprint — there's not great deal of detail in it,” Lucas said. “As it turned out, when I got the ‘Star Wars' script done, there were 180 pages. So I cut it into three parts and said I'll focus on the first one, because we'd never get enough money to make the whole thing.”

Lucas credited Fox executive Alan Ladd Jr. with giving “Star Wars” the green light at a time when no one — including Lucas himself — knew exactly what the movie was going to be. Ladd just wanted to be in business with the guy who had directed “American Graffiti,” which Lucas said was the most profitable movie ever made at that point in relation to its cost. “It cost $700,000 and it made over a hundred million. Alan Ladd said, ‘You're really talented. I want to make a movie with you.' This never happens.”

Lucas was determined to make all three of his “Star Wars” stories no matter what, and negotiated a deal in which he kept the sequel rights so that he could produce “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi” elsewhere if the first movie wasn't successful or Fox just wasn't interested in continuing the series. Lucas took a lower fee than he would ordinarily have gotten as a filmmaker coming off of a huge hit in exchange for the sequel and merchandising rights — a gamble that not only allowed him to make the sequels on his own terms, but ultimately made him a billionaire.

 










“I said, ‘I want the rights for these things because I'm going to make those movies no matter what happens,'” Lucas said. “‘And besides that, I want the licensing.' They said, ‘What's licensing?'” Lucas' idea was to use merchandising to help promote the movies, with kids wearing “Star Wars” shirts that would help spread the word. “Fox was shocked when on the first day the lines were all around the block. ‘Where'd these people come from?' Because they hadn't really run a campaign.”

Indeed, amazingly enough, no one at the studio but Ladd really believed in the movie, which Lucas said wasn't unusual for “Star Wars,” which even his friends thought was a strange film for him to be making. “I certainly didn't think it was going to make any money,” Lucas said, but he added that when it did make money it put him in an unusual position maintaining ownership of the sequels. “I said, I'm going to do it myself. I'm going to go to the bank, I'm going to get the money.” 

Lucas self-financed “Empire,” with Fox staying on as a distributor, and that's where the real risk came in — he wasn't worried about the movie measuring up to “Star Wars” creatively, but had it bombed financially he would have been ruined.

Luckily, “The Empire Strikes Back” was a huge hit as well as an artistic success, one of the few sequels to a classic film that is commonly agreed upon to be as good as if not superior to its predecessor. The film's power was on full display at the Chinese Thursday night, with a packed crowd (one that included many of Lucas' directing peers, like his USC classmate Randal Kleiser, Joe Dante, John Landis, Ernest Dickerson, and Alexander Payne) enthralled by the spectacle, and audibly entertained by the sequel's new characters like Yoda and Lando Calrissian.

 










Mankiewicz wrapped the discussion up by asking Lucas why Yoda “talks backwards,” and Lucas had a simple answer. “Yoda had a very distinctive way of speaking, and that was done purposely,” Lucas said. “If you're speaking regular English, people don't listen that much. But if it's hard to understand what someone is saying, people focus on it. Yoda was basically the philosopher of the movie, and I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen to these long talking scenes, especially 12-year olds.”

Lucas concluded by talking about how difficult writing is, and what his friend and mentor Francis Coppola taught him about the importance of a good screenplay. “He said, ‘Look, the first draft's gonna be horrible. You're gonna want to commit suicide. The second draft will be bad. The secret to doing a good script is to rewrite, rewrite, rewrite. Don't stop and say it's good enough. Because there's nothing that is good enough.”

The TCM Classic Film Festival continues through Sunday with more in-person appearances, including Michelle Pfeiffer with “The Fabulous Baker Boys,” Rob Reiner with “Misery” and “The American President,” and Al Pacino and Michael Mann with “Heat.”

Adam Scott won't be hosting “Saturday Night Live” this season (his “Innie” won't get the chance either), and Ben Stiller thinks that's a shame. But Scott seems willing to take Lorne Michaels' call should there be one for Season 51. 

“SNL” on Thursday announced its final three hosts for Season 50, starting with Quinta Brunson, followed by the hosting debut of Walton Goggins, and concluding with Scarlett Johansson. Shortly after the cork board announcement from the show was posted, Stiller responded to a comment saying it was a “missed opportunity fr” that Scott wasn't among them, simply saying, “I agree.”
 










IndieWire spoke with Scott on the red carpet where he's being honored for the annual Time 100 gala (his old “Parks and Recreation” co-star Nick Offerman wrote up the blurb naming Scott one of the 100 most influential people of the year). When asked if he was interested in hosting the legendary variety show, Scott said “Of course. It would be amazing.”

“‘SNL' is, I think it's hard to argue it's not the greatest show on television because of its longevity and because of its influence on culture,” Scott said. “50 years of really kind of guiding culture in a lot of ways but also reacting to culture at the same time. The cast right now is unbelievable. They're really in one of their peaks, I think. So yeah, of course. It would be amazing.” 

While “SNL” lampooned buzzy series and films like “The White Lotus” and “Anora” and even brought Oscar winner Mikey Madison on to host, “Severance” has gotten the short shrift, but we'd love to see what they can do with all the inscrutable goat stuff on the Apple TV+ show. And we'd love to see Scott reunite with “SNL” great Amy Poehler; we bet she could do a great Harmony Cobel. 

“SNL” returns May 3 with the return of Brunson to Studio 8H, and Season 50 concludes on May 17. “Severance” will also return for a third season after receiving critical praise and dominating streaming charts in its return for Season 2.

Salami Rose Joe Louis is Captain Beefheart for synth heads who grew up watching Adult Swim. She debuted in a punk band playing the blender (as in the household appliance). She named her first album Son of a Sauce!, her second Zlaty Sauce Nephew. She then followed those, naturally, with a handful of grand sci-fi concept albums.

Before she was Salami Rose Joe Louis, Lindsay Olsen was a scientist studying the ocean's acidity. During lab breaks, she'd tinker away at the piano, finding alliances between molecular forms and chord sequences. Nowadays, her music might best be described, per one of her song titles, as “giddy aquatic.” Her songs mimic the inky materiality of the sea: Globules of sound bubble in the low end then reach some mirrored surface—melodies ascending, cresting high, then returning.

Olsen composes almost entirely on a charmingly démodé Roland MV-8800 workstation, and her early-digital sound evinces a Stereolab-like talent for repurposing technological kitsch into her own lingua franca: a wave of cartoonish blurps, cheeky voicings, and complex free-form melodies. But the highly ambitious—though ultimately overwrought—sci-fi narratives of her recent releases obscured her talent beneath interdimensional travelogs, talking clouds, and bionic humanoids. On her new album Lorings, she strips back the galactic props and trades cosmological conjecture for inward contemplation. The music is much stronger for it.

Lorings reveals Olsen's endearing bashfulness, much like the peeking smile she wears on the album's cover. Her vocals are softly fitful; the songs are never louder than a finch's call. Olsen's lyrics, though stuttering, communicate a much clearer insight than before. Here, the songs stand on their own merits, each a calm riot of skill and invention.

Olsen's spongy, rosy pads make the album feel balmy and mellow upon first blush. But Lorings reveals itself to be far more itchy and restless on further inspection: the product of someone trying to hush an overactive imagination. On “Motorway” and “I dunno ways,” Olsen periodically disrupts precise, slow-moving melodies with experimental gambits. Lounge synths come into collision with free jazz. “That must be hard for you” sounds like the jazz fusion of CASIOPEA if they made music quiet enough not to disturb their roommates.

Lorings is an exquisite balancing act, encapsulating big ideas within small frames. The music possesses a clean fidelity without negating any of its homespun charm. Olsen's resplendent atmospheres don't feel panoramic but more like a contained brightness. The staccato chords of “Hobbies” gesture towards the anthemic but stay closed within the tight walls of the song, like moonlight filtering into a shoebox apartment. The album's sequencing itself is weighted neatly between hecticness and lethargy. Lorings' first half is a sensory playground. “A sauna sized pill,” the most frenetic among the bunch, is as sprightly as it comes: the sound of a million rubber eggs let loose in a wind tunnel. The backend slows down, all pulse and shimmer. It sets the stage for the most impactful and unburnished lyric on “Wet Log”: “I called my mom and asked/Does this sadness last?”

Lorings makes it obvious not just how talented Olsen is, but how much of a nerd she is, too. She twists pop melodies into tightly wound helixes, making music that sounds both as complicated and instinctive as the electrical frequencies which power her machine. Here is that rare electronic composer capable of perfecting waveforms while able to zoom out, arrange on a macro level, and make a great pop song.

Along the wild western coast of Ireland's County Galway lies Connemara. Oscar Wilde once praised the region's “savage beauty,” a phrase you will encounter at least a dozen times reading about its rugged expanses of mountain, bog, lake, and sea, to all of which its 30,000 or so residents appear proudly subordinate. Hovering the place on Google Maps takes you over craggy ranges and flowering heath, coral beaches and tiny fishing villages, ruins of castles and nunneries straight out of Gothic romance novels. Here the modern world bears a striking resemblance to the ancient world of myth.

Maria Somerville has described her debut album, 2019's All My People, as a subconscious expression of a deep longing for home. The Irish musician wrote those songs—vague slips of murky slowcore that drew from Grouper's muted drone-pop and the Irish folk ballads her uncles used to sing in pubs—while living in Dublin, where she had moved for school. But all the while she felt the pull of Connemara, where she was born and raised, and where she finally returned in 2020. Moving into a combination home and studio on the edge of Lough Corrib (the second-largest lake in Ireland), Somerville settled into a quieter way of life, which included regular walks through the windswept countryside and conversations with her father, a retired fisherman who shared with her the secrets of the trade, like the way a certain shimmer on the rocks portends rain. I wonder if it was a secret to her neighbors that Somerville had signed a deal with 4AD, or hosted a twice-weekly NTS show where she whispered morning greetings over gentle selections from Laraaji, Yo La Tengo, Durutti Column, Low, overlaid with field recordings of the rush of wind and sea.

Written and recorded during her time in Connemara, Somerville's second album and first for 4AD, Luster, feels like an evolutionary leap akin to that of Cocteau Twins between Blue Bell Knoll and Heaven or Las Vegas; the first was pretty, the second is sublime. Through a dense mist of shoegaze, post-punk, and ambient electronics, Somerville presents a dreamworld that is both mythic and real, a wild and ancient landscape in which her own figure is just barely perceptible. At the same time, you might consider it a deft and sweeping survey of all that “dream pop” can encompass—drawing lines from Mazzy Star to My Bloody Valentine to Broadcast to Julianna Barwick, settling comfortably alongside the masterpieces of the canon.

Taken one way, the songs on Luster are desolately lonely, beamed out into the bracing Connemara ether or directed towards a “you” that is nowhere to be seen. “Projections of you/In my head,” she sings huskily on the chorus of “Projections”; on “Stonefly,” she repeats, “Without you…” like a mantra over synth swirls that harken back to “hypnagogic pop.” Certain lyrical motifs resurface again and again—the sea, the sky, the path. The word “time” appears more frequently than I can count: On “Spring,” it comes in waves that ebb perpetually away, and on the breathtaking “Garden,” she swims through time itself, past dark caves and out toward warmer waters. Is she swimming forward in time, or back? A secret third direction, she clarifies: “Into.”

And yet Luster is the least insular of Somerville's projects—perhaps excluding last year's Princ​€​ss, the debut from the mysterious collective of the same name, of which Luster's press notes reveal Somerville to be a contributor. (In retrospect, it isn't hard to spot her fingerprints on songs like “Sometimes” and “In My Head.”) Where she recorded All My People for the most part alone, here she collaborates with a handful of mostly Irish musicians who fit into the mix so subtly you barely register they're there: the harpist Róisín Berkeley on the starry-eyed “Réalt,” guitar from Connemara native Olan Monk on “Stonefly,” uilleann pipes from Lankum's Ian Lynch tucked into “Violet,” plus broader contributions from Henry Earnest and Finn Carraher McDonald. Perhaps as a result, there is a holisticism to the hero's journey on which Somerville embarks—a feeling that you're not alone, especially when you are.

At times a lyric sheet is required to discern what Somerville is singing: The distinctly Grouper-esque “Halo” obscures a reverie of ancient Irish mysticism with thick clouds of reverb. Written out, Luster's lyrics can feel a little unresolved: “I can see/More clearly than I could before/I know now/What's true/For me,” from “Trip,” is a sentiment so simple it verges on trite. But that's exactly the appeal of “Violet,” on which Somerville channels Carla dal Forno's goth-folk romance, singing in the woolly way your voice sounds when you wake up: “Burden of life/Life is love/Love is time/Time is love/So many things in the air.” What could be sophomoric simply registers as true, then dissipates before the thought solidifies. “Everything is…” she sighs, but I can't make out the rest, as if she'd traced the final word onto a steamy bathroom mirror. In any case, what matters is it's spring, and wild strawberries are growing along the path outside her house.

Somerville presents Luster as a tale of homecoming, but a sad love story materializes at the margins. “I've got this broken heart…” she exhales on “Up” over a drumbeat so sedate it feels like time is standing still. Through a haze of layered vocals, I can pick out half the words—the sea, the sand, the soil, in which she plants her broken heart to be reborn as something new. Maybe you know the feeling—surrounded by the majesty of nature, projecting your own sorrows upon it. Then it all blurs together, and the waves come in to wash your footprints away.

“I feel strange,” Alex Sauser-Monnig sings on their new record, Alex, “but it's just a natural reaction to a world coming apart at the seams.” In the six years since Dawnbraker, their debut as Daughter of Swords, the world's only come more unglued; Alex is a frenetic coming-out party before the clock strikes midnight. Musically, the album recalls a decade-old strain of perky, chart-aspiring indie pop, the purview of bands like MisterWives or Oh Wonder—only these songs have far more on their mind. Alex applies the playful sound of early-2010s alt-pop to the more troubling realities of life as queer person in the mid-2020s, without feeling like escapism. Sauser-Monnig's brief vignettes are little pockets of joy amid societal strife and systemic erasure.

Like Dawnbreaker, Alex was produced by Nick Sanborn of Sylvan Esso, this time joined by bandmate Amelia Meath (Meath and Sauser-Monnig also play together in Mountain Man). Unlike the more muted debut, Alex is upbeat and endearingly eager to please; anyone unwilling to use a goofy cartoon sound effect to allude to sex should steer clear. Those who have a soft spot for this kind of quirked-up indie pop will be handsomely rewarded. Sauser-Monnig devotes the opening tracks to the thrill of a new crush, filling “Talk to You” with handclaps and starting off “Hard On” like a bedroom-pop version of '80s glam rock. “I got a hard on for loving you,” they croon. It's a cheeky nod to gender dysphoria, but the way Sauser-Monnig's songs address such awakenings feels more mischievous than didactic, like a child trying out a new curse word.

Underneath Alex's cutesy presentation are some very real issues, and the album might verge on glib “hey look we're bombing Iraq” territory if Sauser-Monnig didn't handle the subject matter creatively. On the tongue-in-cheek garage rocker “Vacation,” their narrator plays millionaire for a day and discovers a life of luxury and top-shelf liquor that's too good to resist: “Lying by the tennis court/You touch my thigh below my skort/And I'm gone.” They counter the Sheryl Crow-esque chorus of “Money Hits” with climate-apocalypse scenes of “running through the woods/While the water rises.” It's probably the only song about late capitalism with a goofy staccato piano solo in the middle, and somehow it captures the cognitive dissonance in a way an outwardly mournful song cannot.

When the pace slows, there are a few moments of true rest: The unassuming “Willow” sounds like it might sway back and forth forever. At times the songs' polish outweighs their complexity, like when “Morning in Madison” begins to resemble George Ezra's cloying adult contemporary hit “Budapest.” But Sauser-Monnig usually earns the benefit of the doubt, even at their most saccharine. “Hello to the day/Coffee in the shade/Blues in the sun/Trying to have fun,” they sing on “Dance.” It's simple stuff, but such is daily life in a crisis. On Alex, Sauser-Monnig certainly sounds like they're having fun; they're just not in denial about everything else.

Here is the list of topics you expect from Rod Wave: heartbreak, trust issues, loneliness, getting really rich is not all that it's cracked up to be. Here is the list of topics you don't expect from Rod Wave: slavery. Last weekend, at the theater to catch Sinners, Ryan Coogler's new Jim Crow–era vampire thriller starring Michael B. Jordan as cool-ass twins with names (Smoke and Stack) that sound like they're an underground Bay Area rap duo in 1996, the final credits rolled to the strangest needle drop possible: a crestfallen Rod Wave ballad that includes a brief conversation with an imaginary slave master.

That's right. As the theater lights flicker back to life, you're swept up by the Florida crooner's gently bruised melodies, confessional lyrics that touch on everything from vampire-induced insomnia to “whips and chains,” and the same sort of melancholic instrumental that he has been wailing over forever—you know the one, all washed out and weepy like it should soundtrack a YouTube compilation of tear-jerker scenes from Dawson's Creek. “Excuse me, master, I think you're confused/I was promised 40 acres and mules,” he sings, like he's been punched in the gut. Every now and then in the music video, released a few weeks ago, cotton field scenes from the film blink on the screen. If you experience “Sinners” (the song) removed from the context of Sinners (the movie), you would think it was the theme for 12 Years a Slave, not Coogler's contemplative vampire romp with spit-swapping sex scenes, characters getting their faces torn off, Delroy Lindo shitting himself, and MBJ dropping more playful “niggas” than a Bossman Dlow mixtape.

In defense of Coogler's choice to pick Rod Wave for the theme, there are heavy messages attached to Sinners. The movie suggests that the Black American tradition can be carried on through the blues, and it reckons with the ideas of Black ownership and freedom, and the lengths white supremacy then and now has gone to suppress that. It works, in a way, to have Wave, a modern hip-hop bluesman, leave viewers with a bittersweet aftertaste, and they even kind of pull it off. When Wave sang, I leaned back in my recliner and sat with the music for a few minutes as the cleaning crew made its way through the aisles. Sure, we're a long ways away from 2019's Ghetto Gospel when Wave's vocals were heavyhearted and his wounded storytelling was told with the urgency of a man who had been waiting his whole life for a chance to open up, when the music was about a personal struggle buoyed by a sense of hope, but he still has a way of making you take the most ridiculous melodrama seriously.

Nevertheless, “Sinners” is just comically bad, too flat and routine, but the title song may be the least of Sinners' musical issues. Composer Ludwig Göransson's Delta blues score is hokey, with the soul of spending a day at a living history reenactment. That plays out in the visually surreal musical sequence halfway through the movie, where, at Smoke and Stack's juke joint, the blues is traced to gospel, funk, twerk music, West Coast gangsta rap, HBCU marching bands, and even Kanye West's opulence. It's an imaginative concept with its heart in the right place, but the stiff and generic genre-skipping of Göransson's instrumental has the same classroom lecture feel of watching Childish Gambino's “This Is America” video. (Maybe it's no surprise that Göransson co-wrote and co-produced that song.)

In contrast to the score and in-film music, Rod Wave's track is at least not boring or preachy. Actually, it's even fun to think about how it calls back to the rapper-movie crossover themes that were commonplace in the 1990s, where part of the job was threading together storytelling beats from the movie into the lyrical narrative. Think, Snoop and Dre capturing noir vibes for their theme for Bill Duke's Deep Cover. Or LL Cool J's theme for the shark-scientist showdown Deep Blue Sea called “Deepest Bluest,” where he, at one point, raps from the perspective of a shark: “My world's deep blue/Killers gotta eat, too/Looking for human flesh to rip my teeth through.” (Cool James snapped.) If Sinners were made back then, we might have even gotten a Rod Wave acting turn with a catchphrase, maybe a cool outfit with a cowboy hat or duster coat, and a fun death-by-vampire-bite scene, instead of just a deeply bizarre and serious slow-burn with slavery fiction.

But I wouldn't change much about “Sinners.” In a worse timeline, Coogler made the call to more obvious and safe pillars of the Southern hip-hop class, like commercially appealing newcomer BigXthaPlug or underground-favorite-turned-bag-getter Killer Mike, and I would have heard the song once and never thought about it again. Rod Wave makes it feel like a throwback to a kind of rap stardom where famous rappers just did shit in pop culture because they were famous rappers. If I ever rewatch Sinners, I'll be waiting for the final credits just to get a kick out of it all over again.

	It's not easy being a woman streamer, and the last few months have made it even harder. Social media accounts that target and denigrate high-profile Twitch streamers (who are often women or people of color) were once relegated to the more obscure corners of the internet; now they're pushed to the top of the X algorithm. In March, three high-profile women streamers were stalked while streaming at the Santa Monica Pier, igniting a conversation about the dangers and difficulties of being so visible in a world increasingly dominated by misogyny. 


Imane “Pokimane” Anys and Leslie “Fuslie” Fu are two wildly popular Twitch streamers (with 9.4 million and 1.2 million followers, respectively) who are both women of color and got their starts streaming Riot Games' multiplayer online battle arena, League of Legends. For them, existence is an act of resistance, and success is a sign that they have overcome the odds stacked against them — their Twitch streams never delve into drama content or rage bait, offering instead a steady flow of sweetness, like a content chocolate fountain. 

	











	With nearly 10 million followers on Twitch, 6 million on Instagram, and a spot on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, Imane “Pokimane” Anys is the most successful female Twitch streamer ever. She's been creating content for over a decade and leveraged her success to start a talent management and brand consulting firm (RTS) and a healthy snack line called Myna. Speaking with Anys, it's clear that the 28-year-old has had some impressive media training — she is bright, peppy, and positive for most of our chat, effortlessly threading the needle between addressing the issues women streamers face and preaching positivity.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	She compliments other female streamers who have supported her journey, discusses how she finds a happy medium when expressing herself on streams, and brings up Hazelight Studios' co-op game, Split Fiction (which both she and Fu have played on their streams to promote the game's limited-time Friend Edition). As for attempts by the more reactionary corners of the internet to label the game “woke” because of its two female protagonists, named after Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares' daughters? Anys calls the entire ordeal “kooky beans.”

	“If that was on Twitter, I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes people just be saying stuff,” she says cheerily. “But I freakin' love that Josef felt comfortable to express his thoughts in regard to this. I can only imagine the pressure on any developer or any game company in responding to comments like that. So, I really appreciate that he was so outspoken about it.”


	Outspokenness is not often appreciated online, especially when the person speaking is a woman of color (even if that woman is as Disney-Princess-sweet as Anys). Couple that with the increased visibility of Twitch streaming, which can (and has) resulted in truly scary situations, like the man who accosted Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter, Brittany “Cinna” Watts, and Emily “Emiru” Schunk during an IRL livestream in March. It's easy to wonder if Anys has ever felt overwhelmed by it all. 


	“There are moments where I was like, ‘This is a lot, but I can feel the support of people online and in my close circle, that makes me feel like I can overcome this,'” Anys says. “As crazy as it might sound, I felt like I had no choice but to overcome those difficult moments, especially because I had certain financial goals in terms of taking care of my parents or repaying them for their sacrifices, or wanting to achieve something. It felt like, yeah, this might suck, but what other choice do I have?' There have also been moments, especially in the last two years, where I'm like, ‘this is just too much for one brain and one heart to handle. Maybe I should take a step back.'”


	Anys has taken steps back before — in 2022, she announced a hiatus from streaming, and just a few weeks ago, she said on X (formerly Twitter) that she needed “a little break from the internet.” For her, the ability to take these moments to self-reflect away from the spotlight is a privileged position, one that's only come thanks to her success.

	“I'm really grateful,” she says. “I have the power to pick and choose, as opposed to just feeling forced to make a certain decision. I can take all the knowledge that I've gained and know when to push forward and push through, and maybe fight for certain causes and things that I believe in … it doesn't get so overwhelming that I want to quit everything and move to some random farm.” 


	When asked if she ever gets exhausted, Anys cuts in before the question is finished, saying, “Although it can be exhausting, I wanted to interject and say, it can be equally fulfilling. Nothing hits harder than someone saying you inspired me.” 

	











	Speaking of inspiration, Leslie “Fuslie” Fu, owes part of her success to Anys and the Pokimane brand. Though the Chinese-American Twitch streamer is more off-the-cuff than Anys and slightly goofier, with a tendency to go on tangents (something she herself warns me of), it was Anys that inspired her to begin streaming League of Legends on Twitch.


	“I can't believe it's been 10 years,” Fu, who started her stream career while getting her Master's degree in education, says. “There's been so many highs and so many lows — which is kind of how I define streaming.”


	Fu's highs include establishing a core group of “streamer friends” and following in the footsteps of Asian-American content creators like Ryan Higa and Michelle Phan, whom she looked up to as a young woman, long before she became a Twitch streamer.


	“I grew up watching their content and realizing they were like me, they looked like me. I felt safer and more inspired to put myself out there because they did first, they paved the way,” Fu says. “As a child, I saw their faces. I saw that it was okay to do what they're doing, that I could be successful at it. Without them, I never would have tried what I'm trying.” 


	Fu's full-circle moment came when members of her Twitch community said, “Leslie, that's how you are for me,” and she realized that she had become a role model for so many young Asian Americans.


	“Sometimes I forget that I'm a woman, I forget that I'm Asian. And then someone will be like, ‘Thank you for doing this. You make me feel safe.' If I can create a space where they feel safe and show them somebody that looks like them, it's really special,” Fu explains. 


	But what about the lows? How does she reckon with being such a visible woman of color in a space still dominated by people who don't look like her?


	“It's been pretty brutal, especially the past year,” Fu admits. “I want to say, with my whole heart, that it's gotten easier and it's great to see more representation, but, sadly, I think it's gotten worse, especially social media, especially Twitter. It has been nothing short of draining. My solution has just been to kind of get off of it entirely, which is sad.”


	That solution protects her somewhat from the rage-bait accounts like Drama Alert, which often focus on painting popular women streamers like Anys and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter in a negative light.

	











	“I used to be able to use so many platforms and feel safe, and find my people there, and now half the time it's just rage-baiting, there are a lot of people just saying things to get you to say something back,” Fu laments. “I face less harassment because I'm not there as much, so [the harassment] kind of falls on deaf ears. It takes a special kind of mind to see everything online and continue to engage or to stay online with a positive attitude. I can't say there's a solution. It just sucks.” 


	Whenever she does get harassed, Fu reminds herself of how hard she's worked to get here. “Sometimes it just feels like you want to give up, but then I realize, ‘No, I have spent 10 years building a career, creating a community, online, offline — there is way too much here that's actually positive,'” Fu says.


	Though Anys and Fu are very different women with different personalities, interests, communities, and more, they share similar sentiments about their path to Twitch fame and how others can follow in their footsteps (yes, they do think streaming is a viable option for young women and people of color, even in the current climate). 


	“Lean on those that are either similar to you or that you feel comfortable with, because I would not have made it as far as I have in streaming if it wasn't for my female streamer friends or my male streamer friends who were supportive and kind and understanding,” Anys suggests For her, a solid support system is crucial when facing the seemingly endless criticism of people on the internet, as is doggedly refusing to give up on a dream.   


	“It's good to remind yourself that you can still accomplish anything you want … try to be the one who proves everyone else wrong.”

	Fu looks to fellow women to act as a lighthouse in the stormy sea.

	President Donald Trump is on the cusp of completing the first 100 days of his second presidency, and things are feeling a little more lawless than the first time around. The initial months of the second Trump presidency have been marked by his administration's attempts to force their agenda down to the gullet of the country, even if it means breaking the core founding principles of the nation in the process. 


	On Friday, Time magazine published an interview with Trump discussing his first 100 days, and the president wasn't convinced that the United States was a country run by laws, not by men. 


Time senior political correspondent Eric Cortellessa and editor-in-hief Sam Jacobs asked the president — who has redecorated the Oval Office to align with the gaudy gold-plated trappings of his golf clubs and penthouses — about a portrait he added of John Adams. 


	Adams once “we're a government ruled by laws, not by men,” the interviewers asked. “Do you agree with that?”

	Trump — who initially couldn't even remember where the painting was — wasn't so sure. 


	“We're a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law,” he responded. “So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100 percent. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me.” 


	Honest men like Trump — who are already exploring ways to bend laws to their benefit. Earlier in the interview, Trump teased to Time that while he didn't know anything about the possibility of serving a third term, people were begging him to and he knew of options to make it happen. “There are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes,” Trump claimed, adding that he's being “inundated with requests” to serve a third term.

	But if Trump wants to claim that he doesn't believe in the exploitation of loopholes, the evidence is stacked against him. Particularly on matters of immigration. The president and his advisers have gone to great pains to reinterpret centuries-old wartime powers like the Alien Enemies Act to conduct mass deportations without due process for migrants, dumped hundreds of men in brutal prisons in El Salvador without trial or conviction, and defied the federal courts at every turn. 

	











	When asked about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador, and whose return to the United States the Trump administration was ordered to “facilitate” by the Supreme Court — the president didn't want to talk about it. He told Time that he wasn't in charge of complying with the court's orders or making the decision to secure Abrego Garcia's return. “I leave that to my lawyers,” he said. 


	When pressed, the president added that he hadn't requested that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele return Abrego Garcia because Bukele had “said he wouldn't,” and repeated spurious accusations that Abrego Garcia was a violent gang member belonging to MS-13.

	Trump then stated that he was still open to the possibility of deporting American citizens to foreign prisons. “I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases,” he said. “If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law.” 


	Donald Trump occupies the most powerful political office in the country, and the world. While John Adams may have said that the United States is a land of laws, it may only take the work and will of one man to dismantle them.

AmeriCorps programs play an essential role in disaster recovery across the country. They helped communities hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall, as well as after the Los Angeles wildfires in January, supporting shelter operations, managing call centers, volunteers and donations, mucking and gutting out buildings that were destroyed, cleaning up debris, and so much more. After Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico in 2017, AmeriCorps deployed its members to respond to the disaster and help recover and reconnect food delivery to communities across the island. 


	So, what happens when there's no AmeriCorps to help after the next disaster?


	Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has been working its way through the executive branch of the federal government, slashing programs, cutting positions, and even shuttering some government agencies and institutes. In the first 13 weeks of the second Trump Administration, over 58,000 federal workers have lost jobs and an additional 76,000 people have accepted buyout offers to leave the federal government, and it's only been three months. 

	











	Last week, Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency placed most of the employees at the federal agency responsible for supporting national and community service — AmeriCorps — on administrative leave. This reduction in the agency's workforce took place a day after the 1,500 young volunteers serving in the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) were sent home early from their service terms. In addition to the NCCC, these actions affected the AmeriCorps State and National, AmeriCorps Vista, and AmeriCorps Seniors programs. Beyond the people who lost their jobs and volunteer opportunities last week, cutting AmeriCorps will have dire consequences on the communities where its programs and people serve, as well as our democracy more broadly.

	Since it was created by President Bill Clinton in 1993, more than 1.25 million Americans have served with AmeriCorps. And the agency does not only work with young people: Hundreds of thousands of older adults have served as volunteers for the AmeriCorps Seniors program over the years. Altogether, around 200,000 people serve in some capacity each year, working on disaster response, assisting veterans, supporting students, and delivering meals to individuals in need.

	I have studied how AmeriCorps programs work to empower individuals and connect them to communities as they respond to and recover from disasters. This work, which includes cultivating resilience and building civic capacity, highlights what's at stake when we lose this national program. 


	AmeriCorps provides paid volunteer opportunities around the U.S. My research with members found that service through AmeriCorps is a common stepping stone for young people looking for civic work. More than 60 percent of participants in the programs we studied reported they hoped to transition into work in the non-profit sector after they had completed their service. A number of members of Congress have come forward to report how AmeriCorps helped to shape their careers. 


	Beyond the loss of a training program and civic on-ramp for the individuals who serve, losing AmeriCorps will be felt in communities across the country. AmeriCorps strengthens and supports civil society by channeling interested individuals into positions with civic groups. When we asked the community partners working with local AmeriCorps programs about how they connect with their volunteers, many reported that they hire them post-service for full-time jobs. 


	In California, for example, 63 percent of community partners working with the Watershed Stewards Program shared that they hired service corps members for full time work after they had completed their programs. These groups play a vital role in monitoring and improving watershed health, encouraging citizen science, and supporting community education about watersheds throughout California.

	AmeriCorps also plays an important role in building and supporting resilience in times of crisis. These programs support young people (as well as older adults), training and placing them in communities to weatherize homes, clear out brush in forests, limit the effects of floods, create and expand food banks, and help communities build more dense civic networks that will support one another after disaster hits. In all, they serve a critical purpose in developing and sustaining our civic networks and community infrastructure so they are more resilient and can respond and recover more quickly to the effects of all kinds of extreme events. 


	AmeriCorps is part of the connective tissue that our democracy needs to survive, particularly in times of crisis. Slashing this program won't just harm the people who work for the agency or the hundreds of thousands of volunteers who serve through its various programs. Our democracy is made up of reciprocal ties between and among all of us, and AmeriCorps strengthens these ties. We will all feel the loss of AmeriCorps as extreme events come more frequently and hit with more severity, and our democracy will pay the price.

	When Michele Romano went missing last August, her family and their close friend, podcaster Lauren Lee Malloy, labored over flyers bearing her image: a woman with a gentle smile and a spill of braids, wrapped in a cozy, pale rainbow cardigan.


	“So many people shared the flyers, but she was never in the media,” says Malloy, who launched a podcast last year investigating her own mother's 1993 death. “The family was so hopeful that the news would pick up her story, that they would help find her.” The nightmare didn't end when Romano was found, though; her remains were discovered in the woods alongside a Rhode Island highway in March.


	While local police and a private investigator work to discover what happened to Michele, the Romanos were stunned to see that same image from the flyers posted to Facebook groups dedicated to catching a serial killer a few weeks following the discovery of her remains. “Take my sister Michele's name and pictures off of this effing website right now. She was not killed by a serial killer,” wrote her sister Valerie on one such page. Seeing her sister's face posted alongside fevered theorizing was jarring and upsetting. While Valerie declined to comment via Malloy, Malloy emphasized this sentiment on a call with Rolling Stone. “[Valerie] told me yesterday, ‘The rumors going around do nothing but torture us all over again. We can't even grieve. It's only been two weeks since she's been found, and we still have a long road ahead, because we don't even have her body to bury her.'”

	











	No one is sure exactly where it started — one member of law enforcement points the finger at TikTok — but around a week ago, rumors began swirling on social media and in the press about a serial killer stalking New England. There's at least one private Facebook group with 60,000 members and growing, along with breathless videos cropping up on TikTok featuring amateur sleuths offering up their own theories. Still, it's unclear whether these rumors are rooted in fact — and if such videos and posts are doing more harm than good. “We're in a situation where Michele's family is playing Russian roulette every time they reload their social media feeds, just wondering who's the next media outlet that's going to share Michele's photos without our permission,” Malloy says. “They had to beg for people to help and share her flyer for months, and now this is what's happened.”

	The facts of the alleged serial-killer theory, with no embellishments or theorizing, are simple: Over the past few months, the remains of several people were found across New England, from recently deceased individuals to skeletal remains. There was Paige Fannon, 35, of West Islip, New York, who was found on March 6 in the Norwalk River — that same day, a human skull was spotted in a wooded area in Plymouth, Massachusetts. And then, on March 19, an unidentified body was found near a cemetery in Groton, Connecticut. On March 20, Denise Leary, 59, was found dead in New Haven. Romano, 56, was discovered on March 26, while another set of unidentified remains were found in Killingly, Connecticut, with another mysterious body located off of the Massachusetts Turnpike in April. Soon, social media groups — and publications — started lumping these cases together, despite repeated law-enforcement claims that they are unrelated.


	In fact, every police department reached by Rolling Stone denied rumors of a pattern, aside from the Rhode Island State Police, who did not respond to several requests for comment. “There is no evidence to support the fact that any death investigation in the city of Norwalk is related to a serial killer,” says Chief of Police James Walsh. Officer Christian Bruckhart of New Haven made a similar statement: “There is no indication that the woman's remains found in New Haven are the result of a homicide,” he says. “Denise Leary was suffering from some mental health diagnoses, and her remains were found near where she lived. The office of the chief medical examiner performed an autopsy and was unable to establish an exact cause of death, but the investigation is consistent with her death being an accident.”

	Meanwhile, a representative from the Connecticut State Police says that the Killingly remains are also unrelated. “We can confirm that human remains were discovered, and there is no known threat to the public,” he says. “This investigation is in the early stages and remains active and ongoing.” And then there's Groton Police Chief Louis Fusaro. “There's multiple agencies investigating different parts of this,” he says. “What I can tell you is there's been multiple incidents, including some that we've investigated involving missing people, that folks on social media seem to perceive as a serial killer. I can tell you we don't have any evidence of that.”


	Despite all of that, Facebook groups are ballooning with members offering up theories and even confessing to the deaths via elaborate poems and word puzzles. “It's like a creepypasta where you have people with anonymous accounts posting things, trying to pretend they're like a serial killer, which is, in turn, causing all these police departments to get this flood of calls, so who knows if they're missing real calls,” says Malloy. “Some group members have realized exactly how damaging this is, and they're trying to control it.”

	











	Take the creator of that private page with more than 60,000 members, Jennifer Mitchell of New Hampshire. “Not sure what the fate of this group is at this point,” she wrote after one prankster claiming to be a serial killer teased the group with alleged confessions earlier this week. Several members alerted the police in Narragansett, Rhode Island, about the posts, which seemed to point to more bodies in that area. “Even though we believed it to be a hoax/false, we conducted a search of the area with our detectives and also used two K-9 cadaver dogs from the Rhode Island State Police to check the area, which was all negative for any clandestine gravesites,” detective Sergeant Brent Kuzman says. “We wanted to ensure our community safety and quell any potential fears.” 


	Still, the damage was done, and police wasted valuable resources. “I was really hoping that it wasn't true, and I'm glad they didn't find anything,” Mitchell says. “But it's still pretty sickening that someone did that.” She originally created the group back in 2020, in part due to the spate of young male college students who were found dead in bodies of water in Boston around that time, the work of what some people dubbed the Smiley Face Killers. (There were often graffitied happy faces at the scene, but it's still just a theory that anyone was involved in the deaths.) She's not a fan of true crime, she says, she just wants to help victims get justice.


	In recent weeks, though, her group has doubled in size, and while in the past there were only two or three posts per day, Mitchell and her new moderators now have to wade through 60-plus comments ranging from helpful to libelous. “People will share people's license plates, pictures of their faces, accuse them of being a serial killer,” she says, adding that she's frustrated with the amount of misinformation she now has to shuffle through — including that Romano was the victim of a serial killer. After Valerie posted her message to the group, Mitchell has been working overtime to take down any image of Michele she sees.


	That hasn't stopped people from weaving their own stories about the deaths, though, in some cases trying to connect them to previous New England serial killers, like the Valley Killer, an unknown person who was linked to seven murders along the Connecticut River Valley in the Seventies and Eighties, and the New Bedford Highway Killer, who was responsible for at least nine murders in the late 1980s. That killer was also never caught. But Maureen Boyle, who wrote Shallow Graves: The Hunt for the New Bedford Highway Serial Killer, isn't buying the New England serial-killer theory. “People are found along highways and in the woods all the time,” she says. “But that doesn't mean that all these cases are related, and it doesn't mean that there's a serial killer on the loose. Too many people are making a game of it. This is not a game. We have families who are grappling with grief who are now being re-victimized.”

	











	Boyle speculates that the serial-killer narrative is so popular because it presents us with a singular boogeyman. “It is much easier for people to think there's just one person out there, and if we catch him, everything's going to be safe,” she says. “And that's just not true. There are serial killers around. But they're not as prevalent as people might think. There are also a lot of crazy people out there that are killing people.” Also, she says, people just find the idea entertaining, thanks to shows like Dexter and true-crime documentaries. “It's a type of killer that the general public doesn't really understand,” she says.


	Malloy, for one, is troubled by folks who find entertainment in tragedy. She became active in efforts to solve cold cases and find missing people around the time her podcast, My Mom's Murder, blew up in 2024. She was initially told her mother died of a heart issue when she was a child, only to learn that she may have been murdered. That case has since been reopened, and Malloy went on to become a K-9 handler for the Rhode Island Canine Search and Rescue team and secretary for the Licensed Private Detectives Association of Rhode Island. 


	Malloy also moderates a Facebook group dedicated to one of the New Bedford killer's alleged victims and noticed an influx of new requests to join following rumors of a new murderer. One request troubled her deeply: Under reasons for joining, a woman wrote: “I love this stuff.” “I don't know how you can read the family's pain and say ‘I love this stuff,' but it just showed how desensitized people are to the reality of true crime,” she says. “Victims' families are in these groups. They're seeing the things that are posted. These are their loved ones. It's a TikTok to you, but it's somebody else's mother or sister or daughter, wife, friend.”


	Still, some folks caution not to dismiss the idea of a serial killer out of hand — or the power of social media to help solve crimes when used properly. Peter Valentin, a senior lecturer of forensic science at the University of New Haven, spoke to the news about the case — clips of which began circulating on TikTok. “It's difficult to be definitive,” he tells Rolling Stone of the serial-killer theory, explaining how law enforcement will have to furnish both physical evidence connecting the deaths as well as a pattern in who has died to confirm such an idea. “It would be silly to close off any potential source of useful information,” he adds, referring to social media. “However, you have to be mindful that not every demographically similar death is [necessarily] related to what we're dealing with right now. Still, there's some interesting breakdowns in communication that occur over state lines, over jurisdictional lanes, that mean that two cities that aren't all that far apart from each other had similar situations, and they didn't realize it.”

	One thing is clear, though: Michele Romano's face only became national news after the public decided she was the victim of a certain kind of tragedy. After I spoke with Malloy on the phone, she texted me a photo of a bouquet of white roses on the ground where Michele was found — an alternative to the image that has been hijacked by social media.


	“Something about the white roses against the dark, wet ground really struck me,” she wrote underneath the photo. “I sent it to Valerie after I paid my respects, but I've never shared it publicly. For all the thousands of people who've shared Michele's photos without ever knowing her, there were only three other bouquets at that spot…. It's easy to share something online. It's a whole other thing to stand at the spot where a mother, sister, and daughter's remains were found and feel her very real family's grief.

Megan Thee Stallion is locked and loaded on her latest single “Whenever.” The record arrives alongside a chaotic music video that finds the rapper twisting into contortions on top of a reception area desk, dancing in the desert, and posing in a fish tank. When she raps “It's whenever, bitch, it's whatever, ho/We can do it right now, we can take it out the door,” she means it. Name the time and place.”


	“Whenever” marks the first music release from Megan since last year's Megan: Act II, an extended edition of her third studio album, Megan. Last month, the Houston native teased plans for an Act III project, too. “I'm really just trying to figure out who do I want to do features with at this point in life,” she said. “I only want to do features with people that … one, I haven't done a feature with yet, and two, that I listen to on my own time — people that I actually, you know, fuck with.”

	











	She also noted that Doechii is on her “album wish list,” adding: “I feel like Doechii would be the type of person that you would have to be in the studio to make a song with. I would like to hear a beat that she would like to rap over and also I'm like challenging myself to rap over beats that I wouldn't normally rap over without losing myself.”

	We already know an awful lot about the fates of many of the characters on Andor, but the show's second season is nevertheless some of the most gripping television of the year so far. As the timeline barrels toward the beginning of Rogue One, leaping a year ahead every three episodes, both the stakes and the scale of the narrative are escalating rapidly. With the show's first block of episodes now available, showrunner Tony Gilroy was ready to break down some burning questions and take a broader look at the season — including a reveal of two major characters who definitely won't be appearing on the show. (Some spoilers for the first three episodes lie ahead — but for the record, Disney does not consider the information about the absent characters to be a spoiler.)


What was the process of breaking the stories for this season, especially given you were essentially making four mini seasons?Consider the advantages that we had. First of all, we'd done a season, so we knew how to do it. We knew what we were into. I also canonically have to stick to certain items on the calendar. I have to do Mon Mothma‘s speech from the Senate on a certain date. Now, there was a lot of mess about the Ghorman massacre. There was a lot of confusion in canon about what it meant. It had never been resolved. And then beyond all that, we know where we're ending. We know where we're going.

	So, the breakthrough was going, “Oh, my God, we're not gonna do five years [worth of seasons]. We're gonna do another year where each block of three will represent a year.” And literally, I think I probably went back upstairs to my hotel room and started sketching that night or the next day. 


	And the next revelation was, “Oh, my God, it would be so cool and elegant and smart if when we came back, we only came back for two or three days — if we came back in these really concentrated periods of time. And to really help people with the time thing, if we really came back and said, ‘Man, we're just gonna drop the needle and drop and move away.'”

	Then the final piece of that puzzle was, with the help of knowing where I have to go, I wrote the in and the out — the scenes at the top and the end of each block, as proof of concept that it could really work and we wouldn't have to do a lot of naked exposition. Could we really elegantly let that negative space work in our favor? And then I wrote my three episodes at the top to get that sharp. And then we went into the room and then we divvied it up. 

	











Even more than the first season, there's so much that feels topical. You have undocumented people working in farms. There are things later on that seem to tie very directly into things in the real world. How much were you thinking about current events and how much were you just letting it play out?The sad truth is, I did not write this with a newspaper. We were sketching this out four or five years ago — it'd be impossible. I think you'd lose your mind trying to make a gigantic show [that tries] to catch up with current events. History has its own relevancy, and the repetition and the rinse and repeat of history is something that a lot of people don't really seem to be aware of. If you go on Wikipedia and look up rebellions and revolutions, it's one of the longest entries I've ever seen. It just goes on and on. And by the time they get to the 16th century, they just start listing them. And I've been reading about this stuff, the ones that interest me — whether it's the Haitian Revolution or the Russian Revolution or Thomas Paine or Oliver Cromwell — I've been reading about all this stuff for my whole life because it interests me.


	The idea that there's something completely unique about what we're going through is a bit naive. There's that old curse, “May you live in interesting times.” And I think what's cool about the show is it's really about ordinary people, just regular people who are just going about their lives. And all of a sudden history is knocking on the door. What happens when the shit comes to your neighborhood? I'm trying to be timeless, really. So any similarity is a very unfortunate repetition of all the shit that's happened in the past that I'm basing this on.

The scope of it all, and the tragedy, it's a little bit like a Russian novel or something.Yeah. I really think of it as a novel in two parts. I think of it as, like, you had the opportunity to take a shot at doing War and Peace. That's the opportunity. When are you going to get this chance again?


	That's really why I don't think I knew this when I started. Some part of me probably was feeling it, but I was so underwater and so overwhelmed for so long on the show, and so anxious about it until we really found [our] footing. And as we said before, Covid just saved the show and gave me a chance to take a deep breath and sit in this room and not direct, and really do what I'm supposed to be doing. The opportunity that was here for me to talk about things I would never have a chance to put in any other script must have been always in the back of my mind, because when I finally hit it and realized that was what was happening, I felt at home.

	











We get again and again a taste of Luthen's absolute ruthlessness. It gets ramped up. You realize he really will do anything. He's a truly complex character, and many things in this show resist tidy moral lessons. Cassian argues that the rebellion wouldn't really exist without him. How do you see him? Every revolution has people like that. What he's told you flat out, he wasn't bullshitting: “I've given everything, I've sacrificed everything.” The accelerationist political theory that he espouses is a classic in the repertoire of insurrection and revolution. Make things really bad and up the pressure — that's a legitimate tool. I think that where he fails is, the human resources part of it is really bad [laughs]. He's so warped by his commitment, and by what's happened to him, by where he finds himself, and the desperation to see some sort of activity, that he shoots himself in the foot along the way and makes things worse. He clearly is not a friend to any romantic relationship. He's careless with the people that he should be taking care of more. He manipulates them in ways that are complicated.


	He's a guy who built a startup in his garage. He built a revolution in his garage, and now he's gonna go public and he's got VC funding. And man, how do you scale up a revolution when paranoia and secrecy and all the things that got you there, that's your basic code — how do you work with others?


	All revolutions have these firebrand, deeply committed, terrifying people that get shit done that are not there at the goal line. They don't make it to the end. They don't get to see it. They become a liability. The original gangsters are not always rewarded with a halo until they write the history. Maybe.


Then you have Syril and Dedra, your Imperials in love — it's a unique thing this season. Tell me about having these two bad guys and watching the relationship that way. I never think of them as bad guys, first of all. They're so juicy. And the idea that two people can be so beholden to an end goal of the Empire, the support of the Empire, and yet have such completely different approaches… They seem so much alike, don't they?


	They both overstepped their boundaries in investigations, and they both appear to be completely beholden to the empire. But in truth, one of them is a romantic and fantasist. Syril is a romantic, really. His inner conversation must be very loud and very extreme.


	Dedra, on the other hand, is a zealot. I think her imagination is like a Formula One driver. I think it's just, keep on going and get it done. It's so fascinating to me what happens between the two of them and how they interact, and I don't have anybody else for them to be with.

	











	They started to fall together in our mind in Season One. I think Denise Gough [who plays Dedra] was upset a little bit that we were gonna do that in the beginning, but I think she's overjoyed now with what she gets to play. 


Mon Mothma's hedonistic husband, Perrin, seemed a bit more rounded out this season. I felt some sympathy for his point of view this time.Totally. It peeved me the way that people in chat rooms just hated him and talked about how horrible he was. And I thought, that's not what I envisioned. And I told [actor Alastair Mackenzie, who plays Perrin] that we would do some things to complicate it. Perrin is clearly no saint, and he's certainly no rebel. But he has a very legitimate point of view and one that I think the show benefits from having.


	Why shouldn't somebody represent hedonism? Why shouldn't somebody represent pleasure? Why shouldn't somebody represent living in the moment? What the fuck is wrong with everybody else who's running around doing all this other stuff? So, getting to do the wedding speech for him, we really worked hard on that. We really wanted that to be special. I'm very happy that's in there.


My guess is that in this moment in history, people will suddenly find themselves a lot more sympathetic to someone who just wants to live their life while all this crazy stuff is happening in the world.Yeah, I know. They'll be going the other way now. We'll have Perrin suddenly being everyone's favorite. I also wanted to explain their marriage… If you get married at 15, and it's two beautiful people and they're rich and complicated and sophisticated, they've been through all kinds of things. Marriage is not a monolith. And the scene where they have the breakfast where he calls out Tay Kolma to her that next morning — I just love the way that Ariel Kleiman directed that scene. I think it's so beautifully directed. I'm just in awe of the blocking and everything. It was nice on the page, but the two actors and Ari — that scene is just so much about a complicated marriage of people that have had all kinds of trouble, but yet no one else knows their story the way that they do. And the affection that comes from that and the comradeship that comes from that is something that the show benefits from.


Syril's mother again reveals herself as, in a galaxy full of terrifying creatures, one of the most terrifying. Her passive-aggressiveness is the most powerful force in the Star Wars universe.[Laughs.] Yeah, man, she's an alpha, an emotional alpha predator for sure.

	











She's gotta be a fun character to write.It really is. It took a long time to get it right. Danny [Gilroy] worked on it and got really close. And then we have to do all these mock scenes. Whenever we're auditioning actors, we have to write all the scenes for 400 actors. We have to write the scenes because of secrecy. We can't let the scripts go out. So we have to write a scene that approximates what the scene's about.


	And her stuff came alive in the mock scenes. And then as [Eedy actor] Kathryn Hunter came in, it took a lot of people dialing in to try to get the right voice for her. But now I can hear it. Now I can do it. She's just so much fun to write. We wanna do a supercut of just her. That's what we gotta do. Just the Eedy Show.


Let me ask about the first three episodes where Cassian's on Yavin with these really amateur rebels who are embroiled in deadly infighting. What were you trying to show there? How did that end up being a big part of the first three episodes?I wrote the opening. I had the whole opening with him talking to the woman [before stealing a Tie Fighter], which was really good for me to do, because it shows Cassian as a leader. It really fills in the last year — obviously, he's been stealing things for Luthen and the revolution is evolving.


	It's a really powerful speech that he's giving to her. There's a little bit of Luthen — is he manipulating her a little bit? You don't know. And so I had this really elegant-feeling speech. And then we knew that the visual effects department was really excited. I just gave them free hand and said, “OK, this is what I want to have happen in the hangar when he goes to steal this thing and it goes wrong.” And I knew they were working away and it was gonna be really cool and he's gonna fly off. So the show starts very proper. And it's very regal what he says to her.


	And honest to God, I went to dinner, a big family dinner, and my son and my niece's husband, who's also an actor, were at my end of the table and everybody's drunk and whatever, and they were like Heckle and Jeckle, and all night long, they were just going at it.


	I went to work and I was like, I really wanna have some stupidity in here. [Laughs.] The rebellion has to have some idiots. I've started so elegantly and it's gonna seem so prissy if I just leave it on that [level]. What would it be like? So I wrote the parts for them and they ended up playing the two parts. That's my son and my niece's husband, the two guys on opposite sides. And it comes from a drunken dinner. And they're not dumb men! They can behave dumb. They're very entertaining at dinner. So I wrote it for them.

	











You do a reveal that this has all been in Yavin, the future home of the Rebel base. What are we supposed to take away from that reveal? It's a rebel hideout that certain people know about the way pirates used to have a certain island or something like that. Cassian Andor is a bit like Zelig in a way. Not that he's invisible or anonymous, but he's in all these places where things happen. 


	And no one had ever done the origin of Yavin. And the only thing they really know is there were these beasts there. That's already in canon. The beasts are canon. I don't know, it just felt like a cool thing to do. Why not?


I'm allowed to say at this point that Darth Vader doesn't ever appear in this show. Was that ever something you thought about?No, that was never on my agenda. Writing for Darth Vader is really limiting. I've done it. He doesn't have a lot to say.


The Emperor never shows up either, but the way he's spoken about makes me picture the more original Lucas conception of him: more like Richard Nixon, as Lucas once said, than the cackling villain we see in the movies. You have to picture him on the day-to-day management side.He was too big a piece of meat for me to introduce. It was too heavy a lift. I thought about it at one point, but it was too heavy a lift.


But when we speak about the Emperor on the show, he's more like a president or something. The offscreen character feels more like a politician rather than the full-on Sith.One of the fascinating things that I realized when I started the show in the very beginning is how many billions of beings are in the galaxy. Nobody knows about the Jedi, nobody knows about the Sith. It's just a tiny percentage of people that have any notion of it at all. It's not in the culture. And I remember being really surprised as it was explained. I thought it was something that everyone knew about, but no, it's very secretive and small.You're moving on from the Star Wars universe to do other things. Given that you're not moving forward in this world, what kinds of things can be done in the Star Wars universe that haven't been done? I don't know. You gotta be really careful. I was riffing [in one interview] about a three-camera show — there's not a lot of irony sometimes in some of the chat rooms. It doesn't help you to riff about Star Wars. I was goofing a little bit, but I was legit.


	I think it was the very first conversation with [Lucasfilm president] Kathy Kennedy way back when she was like, “After Rogue One we could do anything. What do you want to do with this?” And I literally was like, “Could you do Inherit the Wind? Could you do a courtroom drama in Star Wars?” Why couldn't you? It'd be fascinating. You'd have to invent the legal system, but you could. Why not? That would be interesting.

The detection of life beyond Earth would be one of the most profound discoveries in the history of science. The Milky Way galaxy alone hosts hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets. Astronomers are using powerful space telescopes to look for molecular indicators of biology in the atmospheres of the most Earth-like of these planets.

But so far, no solid evidence of life has ever been found beyond the Earth. A paper published in April 2025 claimed to detect a signature of life in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. And while this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers – including the paper's authors – aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists. A detection of life would be a remarkable development.

The astronomer Carl Sagan used the phrase, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” in regard to searching for alien life. It conveys the idea that there should be a high bar for evidence to support a remarkable claim.

I'm an astronomer who has written a book about astrobiology. Over my career, I've seen some compelling scientific discoveries. But to reach this threshold of finding life beyond Earth, a result needs to fit several important criteria.

There are three criteria for a scientific result to represent a true discovery and not be subject to uncertainty and doubt. How does the claim of life on K2-18b measure up?

First, the experiment needs to measure a meaningful and important quantity. Researchers observed K2-18b's atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope and saw a spectral feature that they identified as dimethyl sulfide. 

On Earth, dimethyl sulfide is associated with biology, in particular bacteria and plankton in the oceans. However, it can also arise by other means, so this single molecule is not conclusive proof of life.

Second, the detection needs to be strong. Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons. The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise.

The K2-18b detection has a significance of 3-sigma, which means it has a 0.3% probability of arising by chance. 

That sounds low, but most scientists would consider that a weak detection. There are many molecules that could create a feature in the same spectral range.

The “gold standard” for scientific detection is 5-sigma, which means the probability of the finding happening by chance is less than 0.00006%. For example, physicists at CERN gathered data patiently for two years until they had a 5-sigma detection of the Higgs boson particle, leading to a Nobel Prize one year later in 2013.

Third, a result needs to be repeatable. Results are considered reliable when they've been repeated – ideally corroborated by other investigators or confirmed using a different instrument. For K2-18b, this might mean detecting other molecules that indicate biology, such as oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. Without more and better data, most researchers are viewing the claim of life on K2-18b with skepticism.

In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life much closer to home, on the planet Mars.

Over a century ago, retired Boston merchant turned astronomer Percival Lowell claimed that linear features he saw on the surface of Mars were canals, constructed by a dying civilization to transport water from the poles to the equator. Artificial waterways on Mars would certainly have been a major discovery, but this example failed the other two criteria: strong evidence and repeatability. 

Lowell was misled by his visual observations, and he was engaging in wishful thinking. No other astronomers could confirm his findings.

In 1996, NASA held a press conference where a team of scientists presented evidence for biology in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Their evidence included an evocative image that seemed to show microfossils in the meteorite. 

However, scientists have come up with explanations for the meteorite's unusual features that do not involve biology. That extraordinary claim has dissipated.

More recently, astronomers detected low levels of methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Like dimethyl sulfide and oxygen, methane on Earth is made primarily – but not exclusively – by life. Different spacecraft and rovers on the Martian surface have returned conflicting results, where a detection with one spacecraft was not confirmed by another.

The low level and variability of methane on Mars is still a mystery. And in the absence of definitive evidence that this very low level of methane has a biological origin, nobody is claiming definitive evidence of life on Mars.

Detecting microbial life on Mars or an exoplanet would be dramatic, but the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations would be truly spectacular.

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has been underway for 75 years. No messages have ever been received, but in 1977 a radio telescope in Ohio detected a strong signal that lasted only for a minute.

This signal was so unusual that an astronomer working at the telescope wrote “Wow!” on the printout, giving the signal its name. Unfortunately, nothing like it has since been detected from that region of the sky, so the Wow! Signal fails the test of repeatability.

In 2017, a rocky, cigar-shaped object called ‘Oumuamua was the first known interstellar object to visit the solar system. ‘Oumuamua's strange shape and trajectory led Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb to argue that it was an alien artifact. However, the object has already left the solar system, so there's no chance for astronomers to observe it again. And some researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that it's just a comet. 

While many scientists think we aren't alone, given the enormous amount of habitable real estate beyond Earth, no detection has cleared the threshold enunciated by Carl Sagan.

These same criteria apply to research about the entire universe. One particular concern in cosmology is the fact that, unlike the case of planets, there is only one universe to study.

A cautionary tale comes from attempts to show that the universe went through a period of extremely rapid expansion a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Cosmologists call this event inflation, and it is invoked to explain why the universe is now smooth and flat.

In 2014, astronomers claimed to have found evidence for inflation in a subtle signal from microwaves left over after the Big Bang. Within a year, however, the team retracted the result because the signal had a mundane explanation: They had confused dust in our galaxy with a signature of inflation.

On the other hand, the discovery of the universe's acceleration shows the success of the scientific method. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was expanding. Then, in 1998, evidence emerged that this cosmic expansion is accelerating. Physicists were startled by this result. 

Two research groups used supernovae to separately trace the expansion. In a friendly rivalry, they used different sets of supernovae but got the same result. Independent corroboration increased their confidence that the universe was accelerating. They called the force behind this accelerating expansion dark energy and received a Nobel Prize in 2011 for its discovery.

On scales large and small, astronomers try to set a high bar of evidence before claiming a discovery.

Horror legend Tony Todd left behind a handful of upcoming projects when he passed away last year, including Final Destination Bloodlines and The Raven. Another one of Todd's final projects is titled The Bunker, and The Hollywood Reporter has debuted the trailer today.

Directed by Brian Hanson and written by Charles L. Bunce and Brian Hanson, this sci-fi horror film explores isolation, paranoia, and survival under pressure. Watch the trailer below.

Electric Entertainment has acquired North American rights. Stay tuned for a release date.

In The Bunker…

“Earth faces an unprecedented threat as mysterious alien ships appear in the sky. Dr. Michelle Riley (Chelsea Edmundson), a micropathogen specialist, is sealed in an underground bunker, tasked with developing a biological weapon to combat the extraterrestrial invaders.”

Tony Todd stars alongside Tobin Bell and Chad Michael Collins.





Writer in the horror community since 2008. Editor in Chief of Bloody Disgusting. Owns Eli Roth's prop corpse from Piranha 3D. Has two awesome cats. Still plays with toys.

There's a popular theory about how nightmares may have evolved as a natural form of exposure therapy where our brains simulate encounters with our deepest fears in order to better prepare us for the horrors of the waking world. Funnily enough, psychologists claim that consuming horror media can have the same cathartic effects in real life, which is likely the reason why we see so many scary movies incorporate relatable horrors into their stories – horrors like the suffering that can arise from living with a mental illness.

And in honor of Joanna Tsanis' The Killgrin personifying mental anguish as a literal monster that feeds off of its victims' misery, we've decided to come up with a list highlighting six Mental Health Monster Movies. After all, the horror genre has a long and celebrated history of crafting memorable antagonists inspired by the darkest recesses of the human mind.



For the purposes of this list, we'll be defining “Mental Health Monster Movies” as any creature feature where the story (or the antagonist) serves as an allegory for dealing with a mental illness. That being said, don't forget to comment below with your own psychological horror favorites if you think we missed a particularly relevant example.

With that out of the way, on to the list…



Even the movie's detractors have to admit that Jennifer Kent's The Babadook changed the game when it comes to genre productions that wear their psychological inspirations on their sleeves. That's why we couldn't possibly publish an article about Mental Health Monsters without bringing up the film that paved the way for movies like Smile and most of the other entries featured here.

Not only does The Babadook feature the most memorable monster on this list, but it also works as a serious and well-scripted drama that just so happens to feature a supernatural antagonist. In fact, the film's poignant ending and refreshingly honest reflections on grief and depression feel just as impressive now as they did a decade ago.



Watching our loved ones fade away as age catches up with them is one of the most terrifying experiences that we all must learn to deal with at one point or another, so it makes sense that are truckloads of horror movies about walking corpses and creepy old ladies meant to remind us of our own mortality. However, Natalie Erika James's Relic stands out from the crowd by having its decaying “monster” also be a victim, with the story expertly diving into the emotional cost of losing an elderly family member to old age (or a supernatural case of black mould).

Combining body horror with plenty of existential dread and a surprisingly empathetic script, this somber tale about death and dementia is one of the most effective films on this list if you're willing to embrace its deliberate pacing and exceptionally moody atmosphere.



The original Algonquian description of the fearsome Wendigo is much more nuanced than most of the monster's depictions in popular culture, with this cannibalistic spirit having frequently been used to illustrate tragically real mental disorders derived from extended periods of starvation. That's why it makes sense that the Guillermo-Del-Toro-produced Antlers (which was based on a short story by Channel Zero's Nick Antosca) chose to re-interpret the creature as an allegory for addiction rather than a simple man-eating monster.

While I personally would have preferred it if the film incorporated more elements of the original Native myth into the story, Antlers is still one hell of a creepy fable about child abuse and how untreated addiction can lead to disaster in a family unit.

The flick's disturbing monster design isn't too shabby, either!



The first of two David Bruckner movies on this list, Hulu's Hellraiser reboot may have been controversial among fans of the franchise (I personally enjoyed it despite the new mythology ignoring much of the nuance present in Barker's original creation), but the film's most interesting change was in using the gruesome Cenobites as a jumping-off point for a story about addiction and the kind of psychological trauma that makes someone seek out new and dangerous experiences.

The allegory doesn't always work, but it still makes for a much more compelling setup than the loosely related horror yarns of previous Hellraiser sequels. Plus, the new Cenobite designs are appropriately gnarly!



Another nightmarish reflection on the horrors of aging, Adam Robitel's mockumentary about an elderly woman struggling with Alzheimer's is much more than your average jump-scare-laden Found Footage flick. For starters, the film's novel take on possession horror distances it from the Exorcist-wannabes that oversaturate the sub-genre, but it's really the film's painfully realistic examination of mental degradation that makes it a must-watch.

Veteran actress Jill Larson is also a revelation as the titular Deborah, balancing the character's menacing outbursts with somber moments of quiet suffering so expertly that you often forget that this isn't a real documentary – and that's not even mentioning the film's nightmarish conclusion that'll likely be burned into your retinas for the rest of your days.



Horror movies about unseen threats live or die based on the strength of their main performance (after all, acting opposite of nothing is no easy task), so David Bruckner was quite fortunate to secure Rebecca Hall as the lead for his underrated supernatural horror flick, The Night House. Not only does Hall do a great job of convincing us that we should fear the unseen monster that stalks the titular house, but she's also totally committed to a disturbingly believable portrayal of a woman haunted by the same inner turmoil that led her husband to take his own life.

Dealing with complex themes of grief, suicide and how struggling with these issues can isolate us from our loved ones, The Night House isn't just a scary experience, but also a deeply moving one. The amorphous nature of the story's main threat might irk some viewers, but I'd still recommend this thoughtful little character study to fans of psychological scares.

The Killgrin is now available on VOD via Dark Sky Films. Watch it tonight!

Justin Baldoni's legal battle with Blake Lively has taken a bizarre new twist, with lawyers launching 14 new claims against his embattled former publicist, Stephanie Jones, on Thursday.

Baldoni's, 41, movie company, Wayfarer, and his publicist for the film It Ends With Us, Jennifer Abel, both filed new claims including a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, defamation, and fraud against Jones.

They accused Jones of snooping on Abel's private messages all the way until January this year, and plotting a 'flagrant abuse of process' with Lively, 37, to generate a subpoena from a 'sham lawsuit' to cover up Jones allegedly leaking messages to Lively.

Abel's new filing also accused Jones of making 'bizarre' claims about Abel to her staff based on supposed information from 'psychic readings.'

'In one instance, Jones announced to Abel's subordinates that she had learned through psychic readings that Abel was an alcoholic and a gambling addict.' 

Abel added that the claim had 'no basis in reality', and instead 'raised alarm about whether Jones was in the midst of a mental breakdown.'

Justin Baldoni's, 41, legal battle with Blake Lively, 37, has taken a bizarre new twist, with lawyers launching 14 new claims against his embattled former publicist Stephanie Jones

Jones' camp added that Abel's latest filing ‘offers no evidence for her claims, and many are recycled'. 

Abel's court document said: ‘Although Jones had always been volatile, she now appeared to be actively unraveling.'

‘On a different occasion, Jones announced, again per her psychic, that Abel would soon be pregnant with twins, humiliating and infuriating Abel, who—Jones knew—had struggled with fertility issues,' the filing said.

Jones' lawyers shot back, calling the new claims 'just distraction and noise' and 'a few debunked conspiracy theories', in a scathing statement to DailyMail.com. 

The two bombshell documents filed in New York federal court totaled a combined 125 pages. 

The same night the documents were filed, Lively attended the TIME100 all-star gala in New York City, following her controversial inclusion on the publication's Most Influential People list. She was joined by her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, at the event.

She sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly, who told DailyMail.com Blake 'shouldn't be here.'

Megyn accused her of 'bastardiz[ing] Me Too allegations' in her quest to sue Baldoni for sexual harassment, which he has denied.

The latest filings in the legal war were made in Jones' lawsuit against Abel.

After Lively and Baldoni's legal battle exploded into the courts in December, Jones sued her former staffer Abel in January claiming that Abel plotted behind her back to steal Baldoni as a client, and falsely pinned an alleged smear campaign against Lively on Jones.

Trial-watchers were expecting a run-of-the mill filing this evening: a boilerplate denial of Jones' claims.

But instead, Baldoni and Abel's lawyer Bryan Freedman went on the offensive.

Abel's filing accused Jones of stealing her personal data from her Jonesworks PR firm company phone when she announced she was quitting in July 2024.

Baldoni's movie company Wayfarer and his publicist for the film It Ends With Us, Jennifer Abel, both filed new claims including a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, defamation, and fraud against Jones (pictured)

Abel's new filing accuses Jones of 'bizarre' claims to staff, based on 'psychic readings,' including false accusations about Abel (pictured) being 'an alcoholic and a gambling addict', which Abel says caused alarm about Jones being 'in the midst of a mental breakdown' 

They accused Jones of snooping on Abel's private messages all the way until January this year, and plotting a 'flagrant abuse of process' with Lively to generate a subpoena from a 'sham lawsuit' to cover up Jones allegedly leaking messages to Lively

She claimed Jones had illicit access to all her personal texts through her iCloud account – until as recently as January this year.

Abel claimed the alleged snooping amounted to a ‘violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act', ‘violations of Stored Communications Act' and ‘violations of the Federal Wiretap Act'.

The claws were out in the filing, with Abel giving a damning description of Jones' workplace.

She claimed morale at Jonesworks was ‘Abysmal', that it ‘had a toxic workplace culture', and staff ‘constantly gossiped and complained'.

Abel even claimed Jones would ‘regularly turn on deafening music so that she could berate her employees free from scrutiny.'

She quoted an unnamed former employee allegedly saying ‘I don't think there was one day in the office that someone wasn't crying.'

Abel claimed that when she left and Jones seized her company phone, the PR boss ‘had been sharing her private text messages with the entire office, mocking and disparaging her.'

The filing even claimed Jones ‘retained access to Abel's iCloud for multiple months thereafter, monitoring and intercepting her private communications in real-time [...] not only with her clients, fiancé, doctors, parents, and friends but also with the undersigned counsel.'

In their filings, both Abel and Wayfarer cited another twist in the case that was revealed by DailyMail.com last week.

DailyMail.com uncovered how Lively used her little-known company Vanzan Inc. to quietly file a mysterious lawsuit against unnamed defendants in September last year, months before her public legal battle with Baldoni began.

She then used the lawsuit to secretly issue a subpoena to Jones for embarrassing texts between Baldoni, Abel and his crisis PR Melissa Nathan, without alerting any of them.

The texts, allegedly showing a smear campaign plot against Lively, were used in her bombshell California legal complaint in December that kicked off the public legal war between the two Hollywood stars, and were shared with the New York Times in an explosive article the next day.

In their legal filing on Thursday night, Abel and Wayfarer slammed the tactic as a ‘sham lawsuit' and ‘nothing more than a transparent ploy to obtain subpoena power.'

Abel called it a ‘flagrant abuse of process'.

‘Since there were no identifiable parties and no party had been served, the subpoenas were issued without notice, depriving Abel of any knowledge of the subpoena, much less the opportunity to object,' her filing said.

She accused Jones of having already leaked texts with Lively's team – and using the secret Vanzan lawsuit to create ‘a veneer of legitimacy' and ‘plausible deniability'.

‘As a result of Jones' malicious scheme, Abel's life has been turned upside down,' her filing said.

‘In an unimaginable invasion of Abel's privacy and dignity, Jones and the Lively Parties now possess the full contents of Abel's iCloud and email accounts, including her photos, text messages, and emails. Abel lives in fear of what is to come, given the vast troves of personal data in the possession of these hostile actors.'

Wayfarer's filing accused Jones of a ‘breach of contract' for giving up the messages, claiming it violated the ‘confidentiality provision' by ‘voluntarily and maliciously disclosing Confidential Information'.

The same night the documents were filed, Lively attended the TIME100 all-star gala in New York City, following her controversial inclusion on the publication's Most Influential People list. She was joined by her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, at the event

Lively sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly, who told DailyMail.com Blake 'shouldn't be here.' Megyn accused her of 'bastardiz[ing] Me Too allegations' in her quest to sue Baldoni for sexual harassment, which he has denied

In her December complaint, Lively claimed Baldoni had acted unprofessionally on the set of the domestic abuse movie It Ends With Us in which the pair starred and Baldoni also directed

As well as two counts of ‘Breach of contract', they accused Jones of ‘breach of implied covenant' and defamation.

Jones' lawyers hit back with statements to DailyMail.com slamming the new claims as a distraction from what they say was a straightforward breach of contract by Abel.

Jones' attorney Kristin Tahler accused Freedman of ‘reversing course, dropping previously touted claims, presenting zero new evidence'.

Tahler was referring to Abel's previous stance that she had suffered ‘false imprisonment', trapped at the Jonesworks office and intimidated into signing documents and giving up her company phone – a claim that did not appear in the new filings on Thursday.

‘This case will be decided on the mountain of evidence that demonstrates Wayfarer Studios and Ms. Abel deliberately breached their contracts with Jonesworks, which the defendants have conspicuously failed to rebut,' fellow attorney Maaren Shah added.

‘The defendants' weak attempt to assemble their own case against Ms. Jones amounts to nothing more than a few debunked conspiracy theories and media gimmicks that have no basis in fact or evidence.'

Until DailyMail.com's discovery of the Vanzan lawsuit, the timeline of the courtroom battle between Lively and Baldoni appeared to begin in December, when she filed a California Civil Rights Department complaint and a federal lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation.

Lively claimed he had acted unprofessionally on the set of the domestic abuse movie It Ends With Us in which the pair starred and Baldoni also directed.

She also accused Baldoni and his team of publicists of launching a smear campaign against her amid the release of the film last summer.

Baldoni filed a countersuit in January. Both parties deny the allegations against them.

The New York Times published an explosive story about the alleged sexual harassment and smear campaign immediately after Lively's California filing, referring extensively to the embarrassing texts between Baldoni's publicists obtained by Lively's lawyers.

The paper reported that the texts included in Lively's filing had been obtained by a subpoena – a curious detail that raised eyebrows at the time.

Freedman pointed out that he wasn't aware of a subpoena and that none of his clients had been subpoenaed in the matter at that stage.

The latest salvo comes on top of months of claims and counterclaims over the fallout from It Ends With Us, with lawyers for both Lively and Baldoni publicly slugging it out.

The film at the heart of the feud, based on the 2016 bestseller by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and was a box office hit 

Many of the revelations that have emerged have proved highly embarrassing, not least Lively memorably comparing herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi and referring to husband Ryan and pal Taylor Swift as 'my dragons'.

Some of her more lurid claims also came under scrutiny, not least her assertation that Baldoni had sexually harassed her by nuzzling her neck during a scene and commenting on how she smells – none of which was recorded due to microphones being turned off.

But footage first published DailyMail.com revealed that it did have audio which picked up a full account of the conversation and revealed that it had been about the smell of Lively's fake tan.

She also faced criticism for serving legal papers to Baldoni's team in the middle of the devastating wildfires that ripped through Los Angeles in early January.

Other revelations from the initial complaint included Lively's alleged failure to read the novel on which It Ends With Us is based until long after filming had begun.

Baldoni's cross-complaint also revealed that he and his family had been forced to spend the premiere of It Ends With Us sitting in a basement because Lively refused to allow him to be in the same room as her.

 Jennifer Abel, who is also entangled in the ongoing legal drama involving Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, is now facing new claims. Read on to learn more about the latest developments. 

It seems Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal feud is getting more dramatic than ever. Now, Stephanie Jones, who was Justin Baldoni's former publicist, is facing 14 new claims that are raising eyebrows, according to the Daily Mail.

Baldoni's Wayfarer company and his publicist for the It Ends With Us movie, Jennifer Abel, have filed new allegations against Jones. These include violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, fraud, and defamation, according to the outlet.

Jones has reportedly been accused of snooping on Abel's private messages until January of this year and planning a “flagrant abuse of process” with Lively to create a subpoena from a “sham lawsuit” to conceal Jones's alleged leaking of messages to The Shallows actress.

The new filing also includes claims from Abel alleging that Jones made “bizarre” statements about her to employees, based on supposed information from “psychic readings.” Abel stated, “In one instance, Jones announced to my subordinates that she had learned through psychic readings that I was an alcoholic and a gambling addict,” per the outlet.

Abel reportedly mentioned that the claim had no “basis in reality,” and instead raised concerns over whether Jones was experiencing a “mental breakdown.”

Abel's court filing also stated, “Although Jones had always been volatile, she now appeared to be actively unraveling.” It added, “On a different occasion, Jones announced, again per her psychic, that Abel would soon be pregnant with twins, humiliating and infuriating Abel, who, Jones knew, had struggled with fertility issues.”

However, Jones' attorneys are pushing back. In a statement to the publication, they called the new allegations “just distraction and noise” and “a few debunked conspiracy theories.”

The two explosive legal documents, filed in New York federal court, total 125 pages combined, according to the report.

Conspiracy beliefs often take hold because it is easier for our brain to comprehend one explanation, one villain, or one horrific theme, rather than a multitude of competing theories, which can be more disorienting. 

The grotesque murders on August 8-9, 1969, shocked the country and the Western world. ""Helter Skelter,"" a phrase from the Beatles' White Album, written the year before, was taken as an apocalyptic vision intended for Charles Manson and members of his so-called ""family."" The phrase was written in blood on the walls of the murdered LaBianca couple. Vincent Bugliosi used ""race war"" as the theme of his prosecution case against Manson.

Morris's documentary, Chaos: The Manson Murders, is based on Tom O'Brien's 2019 prodigious book CHAOS: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties. O'Brien and Morris give prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi's theory short shrift. They explore the idea that Charles Manson was involved with the CIA's experiments on mind control. The MK-ULTRA and Manson connection is credible. However, there is no definitive proof, just a lot of speculation and innuendos.

Did the MK Ultra psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Jolyon West, who was running a CIA-funded Haight Ashbury medical clinic, influence Manson during their overlapping time in the Haight Ashbury, the two years before the murders? It is a fact that Manson had his ""family"" go for treatment of STDs and pregnancy at the same clinic. It is a fact that the CIA and Manson were both interested in LSD. Dr. West's files from this period and others have gone missing. 

As a U.S. Air Force medical director during the Korean War, Dr. West undertook the study of 36 out of 59 U.S. airmen returned from North Korean prison, convinced they had exposed Korean civilians to germ warfare. Speculations were that the soldiers had been brainwashed. MK Ultra, a new CIA program, contracted Dr. West to develop experiments using hypnosis and psychotropics to protect our soldiers from mind control. The program enlarged and funded universities and private psychiatrists with the task of developing techniques for mind control, especially the use of LSD, which was given to subjects without their knowledge. Another goal of the research was to convince people to kill with no remorse. The MK Ultra program closed down in 1964.

Errol Morris's previous documentary, Wormwood  (2017), examines issues surrounding the death in 1952 of MK Ultra scientist Frank Olsen and the role that LSD played in his murder, initially attributed to suicidal depression. It took dozens of years for Frank Olsen's son to solve this case.

Charles Manson was a drug dealer who used LSD, the mind-altering counterculture drug of the 1960s. His ""family"" was perpetually stoned, though Manson less so, to maintain absolute control. 

According to Dr. Jodi M. Lane, who recently published her assessment of Charles Manson, he fits the criteria of Dr. Robert Hare's definition of a psychopath: glibness or superficial charm; grandiose sense of self-worth; conning; manipulativeness; lack of remorse; shallow affect; callousness; and lack of empathy. Manson failed to accept responsibility for his actions. He had a need for stimulation, a proneness to boredom. He led a parasitic and deviant lifestyle and had no realistic long-term goals.

His ""family"" primarily consisted of the rootless, young, very impressionable women who left home to partake in the 1960s hippy counterculture—a far cry from the homebody female of the 1950s. Their rootlessness primed them for a magnetic attachment to a manipulative, grandiose man such as Charles Manson. Generous LSD supplies cinched the deal.

Kenneth Walsh, an award-winning historian, said of the 1960s, ""It was a decade of extremes, a decade of transformational change and bizarre contrasts: flower children and assassins, idealism and alienation, rebellion and backlash. For many in the massive post-World War II baby boom generation, it was both the best of times and the worst of times.""

No surprise that Woodstock followed just a few days after the murders.

The APA listed brainwashing under dissociative disorders, though it was not an official diagnosis until 1980. ""While ""brainwashing"" is a term often used to describe coercive persuasion, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) includes ""Identity Disturbance due to Prolonged and Intense Coercive Persuasion"" under its ""Other Specified Dissociative Disorder"" (OSDD) category, which can be a result of experiences like brainwashing.""

Mind Control was not new: In 1950, author and authority on psychological warfare Edward Hunter (1902-1978) coined the word brainwashing from the Chinese. In the military classic ""The Art of War,"" written by the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu around five centuries ago, the primary message is to avoid war. ""All warfare is based on deception.""

Centuries later, ""Mao Zedong's Red Army used terrifying ancient techniques to turn the Chinese people into mindless, Communist automatons. “Brainwashing” was a literal translation from the Mandarin words for wash (xi) and brain (nao). Hunter warned of its dangers. The process was meant ""to change a mind radically so that its owner becomes a living puppet—a human-robot—without the atrocity being visible from the outside.""

Astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to revisit a misunderstood black hole thought to be gulping matter 40 times faster than the theoretical limit. It turns out, dust may have obscured the truth.

A ""fast-feeding"" black hole that appeared to defy physics is actually pretty ordinary, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal.

In November 2024, astronomers using JWST reported that they'd found a black hole from the early universe that appeared to be gorging on matter 40 times faster than theoretically possible. The black hole, called LID-568, was observed as it existed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang — much too early in the history of the universe for it to have gotten that huge.

However, new research suggests that this excessive eating rate may have been an overestimation. After revisiting the JWST observations of the ""record-breaking"" black hole, astronomers confirmed that it is not extreme after all. In fact, heavy dust obscured the black hole, leading to incorrect calculations, the researchers found.

In an accreting black hole, the infalling material is compressed and heated, causing it to emit high-energy radiation such as X-rays that push material away. The amount of matter a black hole can consume is governed by the Eddington limit, which defines the maximum luminosity at which the outward radiation pressure balances the black hole's gravitational pull. This limit depends directly on the black hole's mass — the higher the mass, the higher the Eddington limit.

When the radiation pressure becomes high enough to overpower gravity, the black hole stops accreting matter and thus limits how brightly it shines. However, under certain conditions, a black hole can continue to accrete matter beyond this limit — a process known as super-Eddington accretion.

The observations from last year suggested that LID-568 was undergoing super-Eddington accretion at nearly 40 times greater than expected. LID-568 existed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang — which is not enough time for this black hole to have grown this big. As a result, the astronomers speculated that such rapid super-Eddington accretion could provide a convincing explanation for the formation of supermassive black holes with unimaginably high masses in the early universe.

But in the new research, published April 4 in The Astrophysical Journal, astronomers found that LID-568 is feeding at a rate consistent with the Eddington limit — and the mistake was caused by dust.

The reason for the initial miscalculation about the black hole's hunger is because dust absorbs and scatters light, which significantly dims the light that reaches us from a black hole.

""For a heavily dust-obscured object like LID-568, it is very important that dust extinction is corrected properly,"" said study co-author Myungshin Im, director of the Seoul National University Astronomy Research Center told Live Science in an email. If this effect is not properly accounted for, it can lead to inaccurate calculations of the black hole's mass, which, in turn, affects the Eddington limit associated with it.

Im explained that, in the team's study, the researchers measured the black hole's mass using infrared light from the gas around it. Infrared radiation is much less affected by dust than optical light, which was used in the previous study for black hole mass measurement.

This different approach allowed them to calculate the black hole's mass to be just under a billion solar masses — about 40 times greater than the previous estimate. Using this revised black hole mass, the Eddington luminosity was recalculated. Overall, the observed luminosity closely matched the Eddington limit. Therefore, the black hole was not in the super-Eddington phase when it was observed, the team concluded. It was just clouded by dust.

—Incredible photo shows supermassive black hole blowing a jet of matter into interstellar space

—Black holes can destroy planets — but they can also lead us to thriving alien worlds. Here's how.

Consequently, LID-568's current feeding habits cannot be attributed to the growth of supermassive black holes, Im said. Astronomers have been aware of this issue in the case of distant galaxies and usually apply corrections for dust extinction in their measurements.

However, for ""active galactic nuclei"" (AGN) — which contain actively feeding black holes at their centers that dominate the AGN's brightness and are surrounded by complex dust environments — ""dust extinction correction has not been thoroughly applied yet,"" Im said. This means the masses of other black holes may have been measured incorrectly, leading to misinterpretations of their properties. The team's approach could lead to a better understanding of dust-obscured black holes in a new class of galaxies called ""little red dots,"" which were recently discovered through JWST observations, the team explained in their paper.

The newfound tomb of an Egyptian prince has a false door, which ancient people viewed as an ""entry"" and ""exit"" for souls in the afterlife, researchers say.

Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered the 4,400-year-old tomb of a prince whose burial has a giant ""false"" pink door to enable souls to enter and exit.

The tomb belongs to Prince Userefre, also spelled Waser-If-Re, the son of King Userkaf, also spelled Wserkaf a pharaoh who reigned around 2465 to 2458 B.C. during Egypt's fifth dynasty (circa 2465 to 2323 B.C.).

The newly discovered false door has inscriptions that say that he was a ""hereditary prince,"" as well as a ""judge,"" a ""minister,"" a ""governor"" of two regions, and a ""chanting priest,"" the statement said.

""Previous to this discovery, we didn't even know he existed,"" Ronald Leprohon, professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Toronto who was not involved with the excavation, told Live Science in an email. Leprohon noted that the prince's name may have meant ""Re is powerful."" Re (also spelled Ra) was a sun god in ancient Egypt.

The giant false door, which is made of pink granite, is about 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) high and 3.8 feet (1.2 m) wide, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. In ancient Egypt, false doors are commonly seen in tombs, as the Egyptians believed that the souls of the deceased could enter and exit through them, according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The door's immense size and construction from pink granite is remarkable, experts said.

""This is the first time that a false door like this was found in Saqqara"" Zahi Hawass, a former antiquities minister who is leading excavations at the tomb, told Live Science in an email. The man's status as a prince with important titles explains why a false door like this was built for him, Hawass said.

Melanie Pitkin, a senior curator at the Chau Chak Wing Museum at the University of Sydney who was not involved with the excavation, said in an email that ""at this time, false doors are most commonly made from limestone, which was a ubiquitous resource in Egypt. Since pink and red granite was quarried and transported from Aswan [about 400 miles or 644 km south], it was more expensive and reserved for royalty and the high elite.""

A red granite offering table was found near the false door. Leprohon noted that in ancient Egypt, people sometimes left food offerings on offering tables and believed that the deceased could ""magically"" eat ""the offerings deposited on the so-called offering table in front of it."" In reality, it was the funerary priests and their families that actually ate the food, he noted.



The tomb appears to have been reused at some point during the 26th dynasty (circa 688 to 525 B.C.). At this time, a statue depicting King Djoser (reign circa 2630 to 2611 B.C.) along with his wife and children was placed within it, the statement said. Djoser ruled during the third dynasty (circa 2649 to 2575 B.C.) and built ancient Egypt's first known pyramid, the step pyramid at Saqqara. Analysis of the statue and its design indicates that the statue was made during king Djoser's rule and may have been from the step pyramid itself or a building near it. Why it was moved into the tomb at that time is unclear, the statement said.

The statue shows a seated Djoser putting his right ""hand with love on one of his daughters,"" while his queen is to his left and ""is also putting her hand on one of her daughters,"" Hawass said. In front of them is a black granite statue that also dates to the third dynasty, Hawass said.



Ann Macy Roth, a clinical professor of Egyptology at New York University who was not involved with the excavation, said that the sculptures from the third dynasty are remarkable as ""there is very little sculpture from that era."" Roth noted that prior to this discovery, ""I can only think of one piece that represents a woman,"" so the statue depicting Djoser's wife and daughters is extraordinary.

Excavations are ongoing, and the prince's burial chamber has not yet been found. ""We only found a part of the tomb,"" Hawass noted.

Lara Weiss, the CEO of the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Germany who was not involved with the excavation, said that the discovery of the tomb ""adds to the growing evidence that Saqqara remained a prestigious burial site during the Fifth Dynasty, even as royal tombs moved to Abusir.""

She told Live Science in an email that ""it's ""a nice puzzle piece for understanding a transformative moment in ancient Egypt's political and religious history — between the centralized power of the Fourth Dynasty and the perhaps more diversified elite power structures of the Fifth.""

Pope Francis Dies:

Mourners attend a rosary prayer in Saint Peter's Square on the day of Pope Francis' death in Vatican City.

The funeral for Pope Francis was intended to be a stripped down affair to honor the simplicity of the man. Instead the attendance of US President Donald Trump has turned it into a high-profile stage for international diplomacy at a moment of geopolitical turmoil.

With the world in the throes of a trade war, markets gyrating wildly and a truce between Ukraine and Russia hanging in the balance, everyone from Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Britain's Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron is seeking a quick audience with the mercurial American leader on his first trip abroad since the inauguration.

Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge on Friday after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced in an X post that Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstruction for allegedly assisting Eduardo Flores-Ruiz in avoiding arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week.

A U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman confirmed to CNBC that Dugan was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. local time on courthouse property.

The arrest of a judge marks a sharp escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S.

Dugan was released on bond after making her initial appearance Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee before Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries, according to her case docket. Dugan's ""arraignment and plea"" proceeding is set for May 15, the docket shows.

Milwaukee County Circuit Court Chief Judge Carl Ashley told NBC that the judicial code of conduct restricts him from commenting on the matter, but said Dugan's court calendar ""will be covered by another judge as needed.""

Patel in his tweet wrote that the FBI believes Dugan ""intentionally misdirected federal agents away"" from Flores-Ruiz as agents were attempting to arrest him at her courthouse.

""Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public,"" Patel said in the post.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Tuesday that the FBI was looking into Dugan's conduct surrounding an attempted arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at her courthouse on April 18.

On that day, Dugan ""became visibly angry"" after learning that ICE agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Flores-Ruiz after a hearing in his criminal battery case, according to a sworn affidavit unsealed Friday.

Dugan and another judge entered the hallway and confronted the arrest team, telling one deportation officer that he needed a judicial warrant to make an arrest instead of an ""administrative warrant."" Dugan then ordered them to the chief judge's office, the affidavit alleged.

After returning to her courtroom, Dugan ""escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel"" through a jury door, which leads to a nonpublic area of the building, the affidavit stated, citing ""multiple witnesses.""

Flores-Ruiz and his attorney then returned to the hallway and took an elevator down to leave the building, the special agent alleged. After being told that Flores-Ruiz was in front of the courthouse, agents ran toward him and identified themselves as law enforcement officers.

""Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued,"" according to the affidavit. 

""The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained,"" it alleged.

Dugan's criminal complaint shows she has been charged with concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, and obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a federal department or agency.

ICE agents have previously arrested people in the courthouse hallways in March and April, according to the Journal Sentinel.

ICE did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A person who answered a call to Dugan's chambers declined to comment.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC, ""The days of actively aiding and abetting illegal aliens invading our country are over.""

""The Trump administration will never waver on putting Americans and America First with a no-nonsense approach to immigration enforcement. In this administration, anyone who commits crimes exposes themselves to criminal liability,"" Desai said.

Follow:


            Pope Francis' wooden coffin was sealed on Friday night, in a private rite that officially ends three days of his body lying in state at the Vatican.
    


            About 250,000 people filed through St. Peter's Basilica to pay their final respects to Francis, who was the first pope from Latin America and the first from the Jesuit order.
    


            The liturgical rite of sealing his coffin was led by the Cardinal Camerlengo Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the church, who is tasked with making arrangements for the pope's funeral. Farrell, a Dublin-born cleric who became a naturalized American citizen, was formerly the Bishop of Dallas, in Texas.
    


            Other church officials assisted, including the Venezuelan archbishop, the Brazilian prelate and the late pope's secretaries, according to the Vatican press office. A US cardinal accused of mismanaging clerical sexual abuse – the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony – has also been listed as playing an official role.
    


            The ceremony, which took place behind closed doors, included several short songs, spoken prayers and a moment for silent prayer.
    


            Farrell spread a white silk veil over the late pope's face and sprinkled the body with holy water, according to an order of service released by the Vatican press office earlier this week.
    


            In keeping with tradition, the camerlengo placed several possessions inside the coffin before sealing it, including the pope's pallium – the long white robe he wore – coins minted during his pontificate and a deed summarizing the highlights of his tenure.
    


            The rite concluded with a hymn to Mary.
    


            As part of Francis' push to simplify the papal funeral rites, his body is in a single wooden coffin, rather than having three nested coffins of cypress, lead and oak as was tradition.

            Outside the basilica, the streets leading to the Vatican were much busier on Friday afternoon than they were earlier in the week, with thousands joining the line to file past the coffin before the church closed to the public at 7 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET).
    


            Friday marks the fourth day of national mourning in Italy and a public holiday – Liberation Day – meaning many locals had more time to join the line. Others traveled from much farther away following news of the pope's death.
    


            “It was wonderful to see him,” said Joana Veiga, from Porto, Portugal, who arrived with her sister in the morning. “It was very peaceful – calm.” Her sister missed a chance to see Francis last year in Portugal, and was thankful that they made it in time for his lying in state.
    


            Pope Francis' funeral will take place on Saturday on the steps outside of St. Peter's Basilica at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). That will mark the beginning of the ancient tradition of the Novendiales, nine days of mourning for the deceased pope during which funeral Masses are held each day inside the basilica.
    


            His final resting place, in Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, will also be simple in style. It will be made of marble from Liguria, northern Italy, where his great-grandfather was from. He asked that the tomb not have ornate decoration, instead only including an image of the cross he wore as Archbishop of Buenos Aires and the Latin inscription of his papal name: Franciscus.

The bank said on Wednesday it now expects the Polish economy to grow 3.2 percent in 2025, which is 0.2 percentage points lower than its January forecast.

In 2026, Poland's GDP is projected to grow 3 percent, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from the World Bank's previous prediction, Polish state news agency PAP reported.

Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also cut its economic growth forecast for Poland in 2025 to 3.2 percent, from an earlier projection of 3.5 percent.

The IMF said it expected the Polish economy to expand 3.1 percent in 2026.

Poland's central bank last month updated its GDP growth forecasts for the country, saying it expected the economy to expand 3.7 percent this year, followed by 2.9 percent in 2026 and 2.3 percent in 2027.

President Andrzej Duda in January signed Poland's budget for 2025, which expects the economy to grow 3.9 percent this year.

The Polish economy grew 2.9 percent in 2024, after expanding by 0.1 percent in 2023, according to a preliminary estimate by the state-run statistics office.

It took several DNA tests to confirm the identity of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, who was killed in Russian captivity last fall. 

Roshchyna, 27, disappeared in August 2023 while reporting from Ukraine's Russian-occupied territories, with Moscow acknowledging her detention the following year. 

Ukraine was devastated by the news of her death, which was followed by a five-month delay in the return of her body by Russia. 

On April 24, however, lawmaker Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, who chairs the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said that her body had been returned in late February, but the news was withheld due to uncertainty over her identity.

""Given the signs of torture and the condition of the body, Roshchyna's family requested not just one but several DNA tests. As far as I know, the tests were conducted both in Ukraine and abroad to conclude with certainty that it was indeed Viktoriia,"" Yurchyshyn wrote on Telegram. 

""Russians killed the 27-year-old journalist after unlawfully detaining and torturing her for an extended period,"" he said.

After launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has increased its assault on press freedom, deliberately targeting Ukrainian journalists with attacks and abducting media workers in occupied territories in an attempt to control the narrative. Throughout the full-scale invasion, journalists have played a crucial role in spotlighting Russia's brutal war, documenting its war crimes and their aftermath. 

As of April 24, Russia has committed 833 crimes against journalists and the media in Ukraine, according to the Institute of Mass Information (IMI). One hundred two media workers have been killed, including both those on assignment and those who had joined Ukraine's Armed Forces.

At least 30 Ukrainian journalists remain in Russian captivity as of April, IMI reported, with little known about their health conditions or whereabouts. Multiple reports have revealed that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) are tortured and killed while in Russian captivity. 

""Russia does this deliberately. It eliminates and silences journalists,"" says Kateryna Diachuk, head of the Freedom of Speech Monitoring Department at IMI. 

When Russia occupies a new settlement, one of its first actions is targeting individuals who could resist the occupation, including journalists.

""Russian troops have lists of journalists, activists, and war veterans, and they look for people on those lists when occupying a territory,"" Diachuk says. 

Ukrainian journalist and poet Oleksandr Hunko, who was briefly detained in occupied Nova Kakhovka in April 2022, says that FSB (Russian Federal Security Service) officers asked him about other local journalists during interrogations.

To hold journalists in captivity, Russia fabricates cases against them, often accusing them ofextremism, espionage, and sabotage.

Dmytro Khyliuk, a journalist with the UNIAN news agency, was kidnapped alongside his father from their home in Kyiv Oblast in March 2022, while the area was under Russian occupation.  

While Khyliuk's father was later released, Russia accused the journalist of communicating with the Ukrainian military and put him in a penal colony in Russia's Vladimir Oblast. 

According to a recent report by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), citing a man who spent a year in the same prison cell as Khyliuk, the journalist is being subjected to torture and humiliation, with his current weight reportedly ""no more than 45 kilograms.""

Another Ukrainian journalist, Iryna Danylovych, was abducted in occupied Crimea. She was sentenced to seven years in prison for ""illegal possession of explosives"" and transferred to a penal colony in Russia. 

Recent reports also indicate that her health has declined while in captivity: According to the  Crimean Tatar Resource Center NGO, 45-year-old Danylovych ""lost hearing in her left ear."" In addition, ""the left side of her body is numb following a micro-stroke, and she constantly complains of heart issues and headaches.""

Russian troops also target retired journalists and the relatives of media workers, just like the family of Iryna and Oleksandr Levchenko from the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 

According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, 62-year-old Iryna is a retired journalist. She and her husband were kidnapped in their hometown of Melitopol in May 2023, with few details known about them since then. 

""Russians do not give access to journalists in captivity,"" Diachuk says. 

Details about Roshchyna's captivity remained largely unknown, too. According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, Roshchyna had been held in at least two notorious Russian prisons: the penal colony №77 in Berdiansk in occupied Ukraine and the detention center №2 in Russia's Taganrog. Both facilities are known for the use of torture against prisoners.

She was tortured with electric shocks while in Russian captivity, Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported in early March, citing an unnamed witness in the Taganrog detention center.

There were also cuts on Roshchyna's arms after interrogations, the witness said. The journalist lost weight and weighed up to 30 kilograms, according to the witness. The cause of her death is yet to be established. 

Roshchyna reportedly died on Sept. 19, marking the first known death of a Ukrainian journalist in Russian captivity. 

""Vika was a young, 27-year-old woman. And what did Russia do to her that she died just one year later?"" Diachuk says. 

As civilians, Ukrainian journalists are trapped in legal limbo, as international law prohibits the capture and exchange of civilians for prisoners of war, with only two of them liberated since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to IMI: Nariman Dzhelyal, a Crimean Tatar journalist and politician, as well as Maksym Butkevych, Ukrainian journalist and human rights activist. 

""Ukrainians in Russian captivity are like insects frozen in amber. Time has stopped for them, but it's important for all of them to know that everything possible is being done to secure their release,"" Butkevych said during a meeting with Zelensky days after his release from captivity on Oct. 18. 

Russia began targeting Ukrainian journalists long before the full-scale invasion. First reports of media workers being kidnapped, attacked, or detained emerged shortly after the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014.

According to Oksana Romaniuk, the head of IMI, over 100 journalists, both Ukrainian and foreign, have been detained by Russia since 2014.

""But those detentions were not as long as the current ones,"" says Diachuk. 

But some of the journalists detained between 2014 and 2021 still remain in captivity. Most of them are Crimean Tatars – the indigenous people of occupied Crimea. 

Among them are journalists and activists Oleksii Bessarabov and Dmytro Shtyblikov who were detained in occupied Crimea and both accused of espionage in 2016. As a result of a fabricated trial, the two were sentenced to 14 years behind bars, according to IMI. 

""What Russia is doing is undoubtedly a crime. I would say it is a crime of genocide, as we see the filtering of citizens based on specific criteria,"" says Romaniuk, as quoted by IMI. 

""Journalists document Russia's crimes. They capture historical moments. And disseminating this truthful information to the world is not beneficial for Russia because it does not want to show that it is committing crimes,"" says Diachuk.

Arkells frontman Max Kerman performs at Festival d'ete de Quebec in Quebec City on July 4.Amy Harris/The Associated Press

Max Kerman is the lead singer of Arkells and the author of the new book Try Hard: Creative Work in Progress.

I had a satisfying moment the other morning: I learned a new expression.

I was reading the print edition of The Globe and Mail, taking photos of interesting articles and texting them to a group chat called “Sweet Baby Idiots.” This is my version of sharing a link. Like any noble group chat, it exists so my friends and I can talk about the news and then – as people of action! – figure out how to solve the world's problems.

After sharing one distressing article after the next, I posed a question to one specific friend, Mat. A group text is a safe platform for curious questions, and Mat is the sage of the group.

“I don't know if I've ever been as disappointed in the state of affairs as I am right now,” I wrote. “Societal inequality – the needless degree of it – drives so much chaos and hostility. What's the best way average citizens like us can reject this system? Do any of our everyday actions matter, at all?”

I don't consider myself a hysterical person, but Mat could sense I was unusually bothered, and instead of replying in the group chat, he called me. For the next ten minutes, we lamented all of the things people lament, and then we stumbled onto something useful.

I found myself wondering if the best way to open your mind and connect with people is to engage in more shared spaces. Places where real life happens – parks, schools, libraries, coffee shops, live music venues and subways are living and breathing ecosystems. Being among strangers in these vibrant public places helps us build an understanding of one another.

I mused to Mat that moving through public spaces might seem to have a passive effect on us, but the emotional impact is significant. When you share space, you begin to feel something in common with the people around you, even when your day-to-day lives are vastly different. It's why sports and music can lead to such unifying experiences. It's why I love events like free street festivals. The people watching, the smells, the sounds, the vendors. If you've been out at 10 p.m. on an Art Crawl in Hamilton or OssFest in Toronto, you know the energy I'm talking about.

Mat, who happens to be an academic, said to me gently, “There's actually a word for this. It's called collective effervescence. The feeling of energy and harmony when people are engaged in a shared purpose.”

I smiled. This is what I was after! Interconnectedness. Everyone bringing their own unique talents and spirits to a collective. Emboldening one another. Sharing in mutual appreciation of everyone's unique gifts.

A week later, I was out for a beer with Mat and were talking about the virtues of public education – one of the most important shared spaces we have in society. Mat grew up in a troubled home, and without much thought, I said to him: “If not for the diversity of your public school, you wouldn't have met the kind of families who let you sleep over when things were going badly at home. Isn't it great that you knew them? You had a warm, safe bed to sleep in.”

In his sage way, he looked at me with a sympathetic smile, and said, “But Max, isn't it kind of great that they knew me, too?”

Mat is a humble, non-attention-seeking person. I let the words sink in. Of course. Shared space is a two-way street.

I immediately felt incredibly foolish, apologized, and sent him a text the next day to apologize some more.

“Cut yourself some slack, Maxy!” Mat wrote back. “I think most people assume there's a trickle-down effect of being among the right people. I was just trying to articulate that both sides of the equation can enrich each other.”

It's near impossible these days to offer an idea that doesn't offend some part of the political spectrum, but I am going to try here: sharing space with others is good. That's it.

I have a very lucky job, alongside four of my best friends, that occasionally affords me a glitzy life – but the deepest satisfaction in my work comes from the time and space I've shared with the people of all walks of life that I've met along the way. It's opened my mind and offered me an endlessly full life.

Settings – ones that encourage observation and allow for spontaneous conversation – make me more curious, feel more connected and often put my own problems in perspective.

Now, I also get that sharing space with people can be annoying. Tranquility is important! Nobody likes a crowded subway or a loud neighbour in your apartment building. And I don't want to be near my neighbourhood Facebook group when there's a disagreement. I get that people become worn down by the world and cynicism can come easy. But nothing good ever came from worn-down, cynical people. Just because the world gets annoying doesn't mean we should opt out.

In fact, when we start to feel annoyed, we'd probably do well to find more ways to opt in.

Standing on the balcony of the White House's Blue Room, flanked by the First Lady on one side and the Easter bunny on the other, Donald Trump declared: “Religion is coming back in America.”

The president made the announcement as he kicked off the annual Easter Egg roll, this year freighted with unexpected significance, falling on the day that Pope Francis was pronounced dead.

Mr Trump paid tribute to the pontiff, describing him as “a very good man who loved the world” and taking the opportunity to say he agreed with the late Pope's message of tolerance on migrants. He did not elaborate further.

While Christianity has always been a dominant force in US politics, Protestant Evangelicalism has long been the denomination favoured by Republicans.

But with the return of Mr Trump to the White House, and his stated ambition to bring about a new “golden age” in America, Catholicism appears to be the religion most prominent among Maga Republicans.

At least a third of his cabinet are Roman Catholic, with many of his top team and followers using their faith to justify the president's policy agenda.

“For some, it's really the choice to join the last vestige of the Roman Empire,” said Massimo Faggioli, professor of historical theology at Villanova University. “We need to save the West, that's why we become Catholic,” he added, explaining the thinking.

JD Vance converted in 2019, and is seen as a trailblazer in popularising the faith in the Republican political sphere. Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, who is of Cuban heritage, is also a practising Catholic.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt's Catholic faith is so intertwined with her work that she leads her team in prayer before every media briefing. Six of the nine US supreme court justices are members of the Catholic Church, too.

A number of high-profile Trump-backers have also converted to the faith in recent years, including Russell Brand, who was baptised in the Thames last year, and launched a Christian prayer app part-funded by Mr Vance. Tammy Peterson, the wife of Canadian psychologist and academic Jordan Peterson, also converted last Easter.

Candace Owens, the far-Right media personality, converted last year, as did pro-Trump comedian Rob Schneider.

Catholicism's resurgence can be seen at a grassroots level as well, with dioceses across America seeing the number of people converting this Easter jump by up to 70 per cent on previous years.

“You have many of these who come from the Protestant Church and become Catholic because they think that Catholicism is the only possible refuge against post-modernity and the secular world,” said Prof Faggioli.

However, the surge in conversions is not just a turn towards Catholicism, but a highly specific version of it: one described as “muscular Catholicism” that casts itself in opposition to the modernising approach of the Church in Rome and progressive US politics, and emphasises American strength as a core tenet of faith.

A study published by the Catholic Project at the Catholic University of America found almost all priests ordained in 2020 or later described themselves as moderate or conservative. This marks a stark contrast to the 50 per cent of priests ordained in the 1960s, who described themselves as politically liberal.

A conservative Catholic revival has been brewing for decades in the US in response to liberalising reforms to the Church in Rome, with tensions coming to a head during Joe Biden's presidency, when Catholic concerns about culture war issues mapped neatly onto Republican talking points.

The Democrats' wholescale embrace of progressive policies issues such as transgender ideology and abortion under the Biden-Harris administration sparked fury among conservatives.

Kamala Harris's support for such policies during her presidential campaign is also thought to have contributed to large numbers of mostly Catholic Hispanic Americans voting for Mr Trump in last year's election.

Mr Trump boosted his vote share among Latino Catholics from 31 percentage points in 2020 to 43 per cent, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.

Despite Mr Biden being a Catholic himself, and Mr Trump not, the Republicans effectively seized on the groundswell of Catholic opposition to Democrat policies, publicly courting non-establishment leaders, including many on the radical fringe.

A “Catholic Prayer for Trump” dinner in March last year charged $1,000 for the chance to break bread with the president and pray for America at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

The president also accused the Biden administration of persecuting Catholics, releasing “Make America Pray Again” merchandise and vowing to create a task force to “fight anti-Christian bias”, which launched this week.

Meanwhile, Ms Harris came under heavy criticism during the election campaign for failing to attend the annual Al Smith dinner, which raises money for Catholic charities.

Brad Vermurlen, Faculty fellow at the Nesti centre for faith and culture at the University of St Thomas, attributes the swing of Hispanic Catholic towards Mr Trump to voters “feeling burned” by a “consistent stream of anti-Catholic rhetoric coming from the Biden-Harris administration”.

“They got fed up with the rainbow flags hanging from the White House.”

Where John F Kennedy felt compelled to distance himself from the Roman Catholic Church in 1960, describing himself as “the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic”, the faith has become a badge of honour for Maga Republicans.

When Mr Vance converted, he described it as “join[ing] the resistance”, while Steve Bannon, another Catholic and host of the influential War Room podcast, has cast the vice-president as a St Paul figure, spreading the gospel of Trumpism.

The growing popularity of Catholicism in the US is particularly pronounced among young men, tapping into another reservoir of support for Mr Trump.

“Catholicism hasn't made concessions to the feminist movement in the sense of access to ordained ministry,” said Prof Faggioli.

“It has become identified with a certain kind of sexual morality, with natural law, and there's the whole sense that the tradition of the liturgy, going back over a thousand years of uninterrupted continuity.”

Unlike the Church in Rome under Pope Francis, who spoke out strongly in support of migrants, appointed women to high-ranking Vatican positions and struck a more conciliatory tone towards LGBTQ people, authorising blessings to same-sex couples, US Catholicism places a greater emphasis on conservatism.

“Clearly it is a different type of Catholicism compared to Roman Catholicism of the 20th century,” said Prof Faggioli, describing the movement as a backlash against the so-called Vatican II progressive reforms of the 1960s that aimed to make the Church more relevant and accessible to the modern world.

“The new Conservative movement is really a revanchist movement against all possible updates of the Catholic Church,” said Prof Faggioli, adding that this clash became “explosive” under Pope Francis.

His papacy galvanised an existing strain of traditionalism in the American Catholic church, with critics, including some clergy, accusing him of sowing confusion over fundamental church doctrines and haphazardly rushing through reform.

The late Pope clashed with a number of prominent US Catholic leaders, and in 2023 lamented the “backwardness” of some American conservatives, warning about how “ideologies replace faith”.

A few months before he died, Francis engaged in his final high-profile skirmish with his US flock in a letter to American bishops stating that deporting migrants violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families”.

“The challenge of a nationalist Catholicism is very old – it's the story of relations between Catholicism and the rise of the modern state or empire,” Prof Faggioli said.

“The United States is just a new unknown, because once you could count on the US. Now, you don't know what to expect.”

In a clear case of racial profiling, immigration police in Florida unlawfully arrested and held a US-born citizen.

In a clear case of racial profiling, immigration police in Florida unlawfully arrested and held a US-born citizen.

For almost a decade now, Florida has served as a laboratory for hardline immigration policies that are later exported to other state legislatures across the country. The recent arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S.-born citizen who was mistakenly detained under an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold in Leon County, shows the threat that these persecutory laws pose for the civil rights of all people, regardless of immigration status.

Since 2019, state lawmakers, at Gov. Ron DeSantis's behest, have approved a series of anti-immigrant bills, starting with Senate Bill (SB) 168 and SB 1808. These bills mandated cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and banned sanctuary cities in Florida, even though at the time of passage, no Florida cities had enacted sanctuary city-type policies. 

That was followed by further legislation threatening licenses of nonprofit shelters that housed unaccompanied migrant children; more bills banning sanctuary policies (even though, again, no city in the state had enacted those policies); and the passage of SB 1718 in 2023. This legislation made national headlines by, among other things, establishing felony charges for crossing the state line with an undocumented person in your vehicle even if they were family; mandating that health care providers that accept Medicaid dollars ask a patient's immigration status; and requiring the use of E-Verify for private companies with 25 or more employees.

Soon after Donald Trump's 2024 election win, DeSantis started beating the anti-immigrant drum once again, convening the Florida legislature to enact a smorgasbord of policies that included making it harder for Floridians to send remittances to loved ones abroad, and repealing the state's in-state tuition law, which allows undocumented students to pay the same undergraduate college tuition rates as U.S. citizens. He also levied harsh threats to remove elected officials who obstruct cooperation between local police and federal immigration enforcement.

State lawmakers did indeed meet for a special session in February, but they did not enact DeSantis's wish list. After infighting between the governor and the legislature, Florida Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez stopped DeSantis from establishing a state agency for immigration enforcement that would be de facto controlled by him via an appointee. The compromise was instead to set up a board composed of the governor, the agriculture commissioner, the chief financial officer and the attorney general to oversee this new agency, financed with $500 million of Florida taxpayer dollars.

Along with setting up this state-level immigration enforcement agency, the legislature also enacted Senate Bill 4C, which is now the center of a new scandal in Florida that has caught nationwide attention. This law established criminal penalties for undocumented immigrants over 18 years old who “knowingly enter or attempt to enter this state after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”

The organization that I work for, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, along with others and represented by the ACLU and Community Justice Project, filed a lawsuit that successfully got Senate Bill 4C temporarily blocked in court earlier this month. This law is currently not supposed to be enforced at all in Florida, and no arrests are supposed to be made based on it. Despite this, at least 15 arrests have been made.

This lawless behavior by Florida officials was capped off by the illegal arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez on April 16. Florida Highway Patrol, a police force that has been deputized under the orders of DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement operations, arrested him. Lopez-Gomez was charged under Senate Bill 4C for having illegally entered Florida as an unauthorized alien, even though he is a U.S.-born citizen. He was detained at the request of ICE.

Lopez-Gomez was the passenger in a car and was traveling to Florida for work. He had been previously placed in an ICE hold for another traffic incident in Georgia in which his family had managed to convince officials to release him after showing proof of citizenship, which included his birth certificate. He had no such luck in Florida.

After his arrest, he was transferred to the Leon County jail and held there. Appearing virtually at his hearing, I met his desperate mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, who showed up with his birth certificate to try and convince the judge to release her son.

I met his desperate mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, who showed up with his birth certificate to try and convince the judge to release her son.

Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held and put Lopez-Gomez's birth certificate up to the light after it was silently waved in the courtroom by the family. “In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.

After inspection of the birth certificate, the judge found no probable cause for the charge but argued that, due to ICE requesting he be detained, she did not have jurisdiction to order his release.

It's worth noting the depth of just how wronged Lopez-Gomez was here. He was arrested and detained under a law that was blocked by a judge and that was not meant to target him in the first place as a U.S. citizen, a double error which deprived him of his freedom. On top of that, this is all acknowledged by a judge who refuses to uphold his Fourth Amendment rights, and instead surrenders jurisdiction of a U.S. citizen who is acknowledged to have committed no crime to ICE, which is not supposed to hold jurisdiction over U.S. citizens. Lopez-Gomez's arrest was a shocking violation of basic principles of U.S. civil liberties and constitutional rights. It can be compared to Franz Kafka's novel, The Trial, in which a man must defend himself in a trial in which he does not know the crime for which he is accused by a nebulous authority. 

We were able to secure legal representation for Lopez-Gomez, and the ensuing firestorm generated by his case once news broke out helped to ensure his eventual release, even though he had been previously ordered to remain in detention under a 48-hour ICE hold.

Journalists, advocates, and elected officials desperately called ICE officials and did not hear back until about 6 pm, when his mother was contacted outside of the Leon County jail, where we had gathered along with community members protesting Lopez-Gomez's unjustified detention.

A Department of Homeland Security official met us at a Wendy's restaurant about a block away, where Lopez-Gomez finally reunited with his family. He appeared shaken after spending 24 hours in jail and told us he was not fed while detained the day before.

“I felt bad in there,” Lopez-Gomez told us as he ate a meal upon his release. “They didn't give us anything to eat all day yesterday.”

Sebastiana Gomez-Perez was immensely grateful to everyone who helped secure her son's release, saying, “I don't have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don't have a way to pay them; we can only thank them.”

Lopez-Gomez's arrest was a shocking violation of basic principles of U.S. civil liberties and constitutional rights.

Lopez-Gomez's arrest is a clear case of racial profiling. He was born in Cairo, Georgia, but spent most of his life in Mexico. He does not speak English, and when stopped, the Florida Highway Patrol officers assumed he was undocumented based on his inability to speak English, and based on his appearance. What is also shocking is that arrest records show that the ICE hold was requested based on biometric evidence — but if that is the case, the officers should have known Lopez-Gomez was a citizen.

In a hearing in Miami federal court the day after Lopez-Gomez was released, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams said she was “astounded” that state authorities had continued to make arrests despite her ordering them not to. While stopping short of holding state authorities in contempt of court, she extended her initial 14-day restraining order against Senate Bill 4C for another 11 days, making it clear that Florida law enforcement was bound by her order and that the arrests needed to stop. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier finally ordered the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Florida Highway Patrol, state sheriffs and police chiefs to “please instruct your officers and agents to comply with Judge Williams' directives,” while still making the absurd argument that the court order should not apply to law enforcement officers.

Lopez-Gomez's arrest shows why the persecutory and ever-growing hostile framework of immigration enforcement in this country is a threat to every citizen and not just undocumented immigrants. We currently see student visa holders detained and ordered deported for merely writing op-eds that contradict the opinions of the Trump administration. We see legal permanent residents detained and ordered deported because of peaceful student activism. We see efforts to strip citizenship from those naturalized. We have finally arrived at the unfortunate but logical conclusion of this government overreach: U.S. citizens detained by immigration enforcement agencies that should have no jurisdiction over them, while Trump threatens to ship “home-growns” to prisons in El Salvador, where due process is nonexistent and torture is rampant.

The scope of persecution against immigrants, the enforcement practices, the surveillance tactics and the erosion of our civil rights always expand to the broader population, as Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez experienced.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

President Donald Trump is ordering a major overhaul to the process by which agencies evaluate probationary federal workers before they can gain full employment status and job protections.

Agencies must also use probationary and trial periods, usually within a year, to assess employees' fitness and alignment with agency needs before granting them full federal employment status.

Trump's order accuses agencies of previously failing to remove poor performers, and alleges they “often retained and [gave] tenure to underperforming employees who should have been screened out during their probationary period.”

“Moving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as ‘Schedule Policy/Career,' and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance,” he said.

Trump's efforts to reshape the federal workforce have been met with multiple lawsuits contesting the legality of his policies, including his decision to fire tens of thousands of probationary workers earlier this year.

At least 60 days before an employee's probationary period ends, agencies must meet with the worker to discuss performance and continued employment that meets the agency's needs and advances the “public interest,” the order states.

Additionally, within 30 days of the end of each employee's probationary or trial period, each agency head or a designated individual must determine whether the employee should be appointed to federal service or terminated.

Employees on probationary or trial periods also bear the “burden of demonstrating why their continuation in employment through ... their appointment to the Federal service is in the public interest,” the order states.

Trump's order takes effect immediately and directs the Office of Personnel Management to create new regulations and provide guidance to federal departments.

The director of that office may also define circumstances and procedures by which probationary or trial-period employees may appeal their terminations.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
