            Pope Francis' wooden coffin was sealed on Friday night, in a private rite that officially ends three days of his body lying in state at the Vatican.
    


            About 250,000 people filed through St. Peter's Basilica to pay their final respects to Francis, who was the first pope from Latin America and the first from the Jesuit order.
    


            The liturgical rite of closing his coffin was led by the Cardinal Camerlengo Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the church, who is tasked with making arrangements for the pope's funeral. Farrell, a Dublin-born cleric who became a naturalized American citizen, was formerly the Bishop of Dallas, in Texas.
    


            Other church officials assisted, including the Venezuelan archbishop, the Brazilian prelate and the late pope's secretaries, according to the Vatican press office. A US cardinal accused of mismanaging clerical sexual abuse – the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony – has also been listed as playing an official role.
    


            Some relatives of the late pope also participated in the rite, according to the Vatican.
    


            The ceremony, which took place behind closed doors, included several short songs, spoken prayers and a moment for silent prayer.
    


            Farrell spread a white silk veil over the late pope's face and sprinkled the body with holy water, according to an order of service released by the Vatican press office earlier this week.
    


            In keeping with tradition, the camerlengo placed several possessions inside the coffin before sealing it, including the pope's pallium – the long white robe he wore – coins minted during his pontificate and a deed summarizing the highlights of his tenure.
    


            The rite concluded with a hymn to Mary.
    


            “During the night, the Chapter of St. Peter's will ensure a presence of prayer and vigil at the body of the Pontiff, until the preparations for Holy Mass tomorrow (Saturday) morning,” the Vatican said in a statement after the rite ended.
    


            As part of Francis' push to simplify the papal funeral rites, his body is in a single wooden coffin, rather than having three nested coffins of cypress, lead and oak as was tradition.

            Outside the basilica, the streets leading to the Vatican were much busier on Friday afternoon than they were earlier in the week, with thousands joining the line to file past the coffin before the church closed to the public at 7 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET).
    


            Friday marks the fourth day of national mourning in Italy and a public holiday – Liberation Day – meaning many locals had more time to join the line. Others traveled from much farther away following news of the pope's death.
    


            “It was wonderful to see him,” said Joana Veiga, from Porto, Portugal, who arrived with her sister in the morning. “It was very peaceful – calm.” Her sister missed a chance to see Francis last year in Portugal, and was thankful that they made it in time for his lying in state.
    


            Pope Francis' funeral will take place on Saturday on the steps outside of St. Peter's Basilica at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). That will mark the beginning of the ancient tradition of the Novendiales, nine days of mourning for the deceased pope during which funeral Masses are held each day inside the basilica.
    


            His final resting place, in Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, will also be simple in style. It will be made of marble from Liguria, northern Italy, where his great-grandfather was from. He asked that the tomb not have ornate decoration, instead only including an image of the cross he wore as Archbishop of Buenos Aires and the Latin inscription of his papal name: Franciscus.

The arrest signals that Trump is “ramping up a campaign of intimidation against the judicial branch,” one critic noted.

On Friday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel announced on X that the FBI had arrested a state judge in Wisconsin, allegedly over her efforts to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents out of her courtroom while she was adjudicating a case involving an immigrant they were targeting.

Patel bragged about the arrest on social media, then deleted the post, which claimed there was evidence of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan “obstructing an immigration arrest operation” on April 18.

“We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be,” Patel wrote.

The FBI just arrested a sitting judge.

The U.S. Marshals office confirmed the arrest shortly after Patel published the post. Dugan later appeared before a U.S. District Court judge, where she was charged by federal officials with two felonies relating to obstructing or impeding an arrest, and concealing an individual to prevent an arrest.

Dugan's arrest is the first publicly known example of the Trump administration arresting a local official for allegedly obstructing its immigration policies, The Washington Post reported. The arrest came after right-wing media in Wisconsin sensationalized Dugan's actions earlier this week. 

Legal experts speaking to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel were split on whether Dugan will actually be convicted. According to sources who witnessed her actions, ICE agents sought an individual who was the subject of a court hearing Dugan was presiding over. Dugan told those agents to stay in another judge's office while she finished the proceeding. When the hearing concluded, she directed the individual to use a side door instead of the main exit, without informing the ICE agents. The agents eventually detained the individual.

Some legal experts have justified Dugan's actions, saying they may be viewed as a reasonable effort “to protect the integrity of the courtroom,” the Journal Sentinel reported.

“No one should jump at the assumption” that Dugan's actions amounted to obstruction, Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told the publication.

Dugan “shouldn't have to be concerned that the courtroom will be, for all intents and purposes, a trap for people who are doing their legitimate business there,” former federal prosecutor Franklyn Gimbel said.

On social media, several other legal experts decried Patel's arrest of Dugan, noting that it marked an escalation of the Trump administration's attacks on the judiciary, including at local levels.

“They are arresting judges now, ramping up a campaign of intimidation against the judicial branch,” opined Don Moynihan, political science professor at University of Michigan.

“The clash between executive and judicial branches just exploded,” said Frank Figliuzzi, national security and intelligence analyst for NBC News.

“Awful. Horrible,” wrote civil rights lawyer Sherrilyn Ifill. “I don't know if this judge did anything wrong. But I can say that if this Admin insists on disappearing migrants to foreign gulags in violation of court orders, more & more ppl will feel compelled to thwart ICE.”

“Milwaukee's Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE by not turning her courtroom into a trap. This isn't justice. It's a warning shot: obey, or get cuffed,” podcaster Brian Allen said.

Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-Wisconsin), whose district encompasses Milwaukee, issued a statement regarding Dugan's arrest.

“This administration's willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking, and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) also condemned the arrest.

The “arresting [of] a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move,” Baldwin said, noting that the action “threatens to breach” the separations of governmental power.

“We do not have kings in this country,” Baldwin went on, adding that, “by attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders and arresting a sitting judge,” Trump is “putting basic democratic values…on the line.”

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Trump is weaponizing a high-tech surveillance state in violation of international human rights law, experts say. 

Trump is weaponizing a high-tech surveillance state in violation of international human rights law, experts say. 

A new report from human rights experts urges the United Nations to condemn the “evaporation of fundamental rights” in the United States, where the Trump administration is using high-tech surveillance tools and a nebulous “anti-terrorism” legal framework that has ballooned since 9/11 to weaponize law enforcement against social movements that challenge state power.

While the legally dubious arrests of pro-Palestine student activists and the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego García along with other immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador have received the most media attention, these cases provide only a peek into the expanding surveillance dragnet President Donald Trump and his appointees have at their disposal, which includes tools capable of sucking up an unprecedented amount of online personal data.

“The human rights violations described in the report make clear that the U.S. is in an authoritarian political reality where the Trump administration, Congress, and state governments have fully suspended international human rights and are engaging in tactics of repression that are hallmarks of fascist regimes,” said Nadia Ben-Youssef, advocacy director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, in a statement.

Released on April 24 by the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology; the University of Dayton Human Rights Center; the University of California, Irvine School of Law; and a coalition of civil liberties groups, the report highlights alleged violations of international human rights law under the Trump administration and outlines a vast surveillance apparatus used to repress freedom of expression. The report was submitted to the UN Human Rights Council, which is scheduled for a regular review of U.S. human rights commitments in November. The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the council in February, as he did in his first administration.

The report points to Trump's jailing of migrants at the Guantánamo Bay offshore prison camp and his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador as clear violations of due process rights under U.S. and international law. Courts have attempted to block Trump's immigration spectacle, and officials were forced to return the migrants flown to Guantánamo Bay, but the administration has courted a constitutional crisis by refusing to return García and other men sent to El Salvador despite court orders.

However, it's the disappearing of student activists, legal U.S. residents, and even U.S. citizens into the byzantine system of immigration jails that has most alarmed the broader public, particularly after Trump said that he hopes to deport U.S. citizens accused of crimes to El Salvador's infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison as well.

After a police crackdown on pro-Palestine protests during the Biden administration led to the arrests of more than 3,000 people on campuses nationwide, the Trump administration revoked visas of at least 1,800 students. At least eight have been targeted for arrest. Facing multiple lawsuits and a string of legal setbacks, the administration abruptly changed course and announced in federal court on Friday that it would restore thousands of foreign college students to “active status” in a key federal database, which is required to study and work off-campus.

The ongoing targeting of pro-Palestinian activists for arrest and deportation violates international laws that protect non-citizens in any country from arbitrary expulsion based on political expression, not to mention the First Amendment of the Constitution, according to the report.

The report points to Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil and doctoral student Ranjani Srinivasan, who both were targeted after participating in pro-Palestinian activism on campus. After pleading for help from the university, Srinivasan fled to Canada as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called her a “terrorist sympathizer” on social media without evidence.

Khalil, who has a green card, was arrested in early March by plainclothes federal agents who came to the campus apartment he shared with his wife, who was pregnant at the time. Khalil now sits thousands of miles away in a rural Louisiana immigration jail. A recognizable and explicitly nonviolent organizer who did not wear a mask to protests, Khalil has not been charged with any crime but was labeled by supporters of Israel's war on Gaza as a supporter of the militant group and political party Hamas.

Khalil denies any connection with Hamas, and his lawyers now say he was arrested without a warrant. In new court filings this week, attorneys for the administration claimed Khalil was arrested and transferred out of state after he attempted to flee, a claim contradicted by testimony and video from Khalil's wife, who was there at the time of arrest. She has since given birth to a son while Khalil's lawyers fight for his release and against deportation.

Marc Van Der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said it's “completely outrageous” that the Trump administration attempted to argue in court and the media that there was a warrant for Khalil's surprise arrest, which quickly became global news.

“In DHS' filing in immigration court this week, we learned for the first time that the DHS agents who arrested Mahmoud lied to him: they wrote in their arrest report that the agents told him that they had an arrest warrant, but DHS has now admitted in their filing that that was a lie and that there was no warrant at all at the time of the arrest,” Van Der Hout said in a statement on Thursday.

In a statement about the report to the UN, Reem Subei, a senior staff attorney at the civil rights group Muslim Advocates, said the issue isn't that the U.S. is failing to uphold basic rights, but that the government is making “a calculated use of state power to punish political dissent.”

“Through forced disappearances and deportations, pervasive surveillance and criminal charges, authorities are targeting students and advocates — especially those organizing for Palestinian liberation — as a means of isolating and dismantling a global movement,” Subei said. The targeting of activists violates international law and reinforces a longstanding pattern of racialized oppression in the U.S., she added.

That oppression intensified for Muslim communities after the 9/11 attacks. During the so-called “war on terror,” the U.S. government massively expanded the surveillance state at the expense of privacy rights and civil liberties. Indeed, the authoritarian “anti-terror” apparatus that Trump controls today is rooted in decades of pro-Israel foreign policy that has stigmatized Palestinians as “terrorists” since 1967.  

“The UN must recognize this not as a series of isolated incidents, but as a systemic effort to suppress expression, assembly, and solidarity across borders,” Subei said.

What remains unanswered in many of these cases is how the government identified, tracked down, and targeted immigrants and activists in the first place. According to the report, digital surveillance in the U.S. is so comprehensive that people reasonably fear taking action that could invite government intrusion into their lives or the lives of people they associate with, which violates principles of freedom of expression. Both law enforcement and private right-wing groups used facial recognition technology to identify activists during anti-genocide protests, which has led to protests by students demanding free speech protections.

To track down targets for deportation, immigration police are using social media scanning tools to geolocate individuals and identify home addresses by accessing license plate databases, utility billing databases, app-based location data, and other online data sold by private data brokers, according to the report. The Department of Homeland Security now forces all detainees suspected — but not necessarily convicted — of violating immigration law to submit DNA samples, and the government added the DNA of 1.5 million people to its central database between 2020 and 2024.

While non-citizens are the target of such efforts, everyone's data is sucked into various digital dragnets operated by the federal government and law enforcement agencies at every level. Technology such as smartphones, app-based location tools, automated license plate readers and artificial intelligence has made such surveillance ubiquitous as the Trump regime puts its agenda into action.

Known as the “data-broker loophole,” law enforcement in the U.S. has long argued it can legally gather private online data without a search warrant because the data is purchased by private companies. Such digital surveillance strategies have already been used by the U.S. government to surveil users of  Muslim dating and prayer apps and participants in the 2020 protests for racial justice. In 2022, Democrats in Congress demanded that private data brokers stop selling the personal information of people who visit abortion clinics. According to the report:

Smart cameras and [automatic license plate readers] enable law enforcement to track, in some cases, the entirety of people's public movements; entities from the military to local police have contracted with social media surveillance firms access to surveil people engaging in free expression. AI technology also enables law enforcement to comb through and analyze troves of data to invade the public's privacy at levels that would have been prohibitively expensive or simply impossible just a decade ago.

Digital tools are not always precise, however; multiple U.S. citizens have received emails from the Trump administration demanding they leave the country. More people may have received similar emails but have not come forward in the media.

“Our hope is that the report sounds the alarm for the international community to act with greater urgency to challenge this administration and its belligerent efforts to dismantle constitutional protections and international norms,” Ben-Youssef said.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

            Pope Francis' wooden coffin was sealed on Friday night, in a private rite that officially ends three days of his body lying in state at the Vatican.
    


            About 250,000 people filed through St. Peter's Basilica to pay their final respects to Francis, who was the first pope from Latin America and the first from the Jesuit order.
    


            The liturgical rite of sealing his coffin was led by the Cardinal Camerlengo Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the church, who is tasked with making arrangements for the pope's funeral. Farrell, a Dublin-born cleric who became a naturalized American citizen, was formerly the Bishop of Dallas, in Texas.
    


            Other church officials assisted, including the Venezuelan archbishop, the Brazilian prelate and the late pope's secretaries, according to the Vatican press office. A US cardinal accused of mismanaging clerical sexual abuse – the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony – has also been listed as playing an official role.
    


            The ceremony, which took place behind closed doors, included several short songs, spoken prayers and a moment for silent prayer.
    


            Farrell spread a white silk veil over the late pope's face and sprinkled the body with holy water, according to an order of service released by the Vatican press office earlier this week.
    


            In keeping with tradition, the camerlengo placed several possessions inside the coffin before sealing it, including the pope's pallium – the long white robe he wore – coins minted during his pontificate and a deed summarizing the highlights of his tenure.
    


            The rite concluded with a hymn to Mary.
    


            As part of Francis' push to simplify the papal funeral rites, his body is in a single wooden coffin, rather than having three nested coffins of cypress, lead and oak as was tradition.

            Outside the basilica, the streets leading to the Vatican were much busier on Friday afternoon than they were earlier in the week, with thousands joining the line to file past the coffin before the church closed to the public at 7 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET).
    


            Friday marks the fourth day of national mourning in Italy and a public holiday – Liberation Day – meaning many locals had more time to join the line. Others traveled from much farther away following news of the pope's death.
    


            “It was wonderful to see him,” said Joana Veiga, from Porto, Portugal, who arrived with her sister in the morning. “It was very peaceful – calm.” Her sister missed a chance to see Francis last year in Portugal, and was thankful that they made it in time for his lying in state.
    


            Pope Francis' funeral will take place on Saturday on the steps outside of St. Peter's Basilica at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). That will mark the beginning of the ancient tradition of the Novendiales, nine days of mourning for the deceased pope during which funeral Masses are held each day inside the basilica.
    


            His final resting place, in Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, will also be simple in style. It will be made of marble from Liguria, northern Italy, where his great-grandfather was from. He asked that the tomb not have ornate decoration, instead only including an image of the cross he wore as Archbishop of Buenos Aires and the Latin inscription of his papal name: Franciscus.

It took several DNA tests to confirm the identity of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, who was killed in Russian captivity last fall. 

Roshchyna, 27, disappeared in August 2023 while reporting from Ukraine's Russian-occupied territories, with Moscow acknowledging her detention the following year. 

Ukraine was devastated by the news of her death, which was followed by a five-month delay in the return of her body by Russia. 

On April 24, however, lawmaker Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, who chairs the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said that her body had been returned in late February, but the news was withheld due to uncertainty over her identity.

"Given the signs of torture and the condition of the body, Roshchyna's family requested not just one but several DNA tests. As far as I know, the tests were conducted both in Ukraine and abroad to conclude with certainty that it was indeed Viktoriia," Yurchyshyn wrote on Telegram. 

"Russians killed the 27-year-old journalist after unlawfully detaining and torturing her for an extended period," he said.

After launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has increased its assault on press freedom, deliberately targeting Ukrainian journalists with attacks and abducting media workers in occupied territories in an attempt to control the narrative. Throughout the full-scale invasion, journalists have played a crucial role in spotlighting Russia's brutal war, documenting its war crimes and their aftermath. 

As of April 24, Russia has committed 833 crimes against journalists and the media in Ukraine, according to the Institute of Mass Information (IMI). One hundred two media workers have been killed, including both those on assignment and those who had joined Ukraine's Armed Forces.

At least 30 Ukrainian journalists remain in Russian captivity as of April, IMI reported, with little known about their health conditions or whereabouts. Multiple reports have revealed that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) are tortured and killed while in Russian captivity. 

"Russia does this deliberately. It eliminates and silences journalists," says Kateryna Diachuk, head of the Freedom of Speech Monitoring Department at IMI. 

When Russia occupies a new settlement, one of its first actions is targeting individuals who could resist the occupation, including journalists.

"Russian troops have lists of journalists, activists, and war veterans, and they look for people on those lists when occupying a territory," Diachuk says. 

Ukrainian journalist and poet Oleksandr Hunko, who was briefly detained in occupied Nova Kakhovka in April 2022, says that FSB (Russian Federal Security Service) officers asked him about other local journalists during interrogations.

To hold journalists in captivity, Russia fabricates cases against them, often accusing them ofextremism, espionage, and sabotage.

Dmytro Khyliuk, a journalist with the UNIAN news agency, was kidnapped alongside his father from their home in Kyiv Oblast in March 2022, while the area was under Russian occupation.  

While Khyliuk's father was later released, Russia accused the journalist of communicating with the Ukrainian military and put him in a penal colony in Russia's Vladimir Oblast. 

According to a recent report by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), citing a man who spent a year in the same prison cell as Khyliuk, the journalist is being subjected to torture and humiliation, with his current weight reportedly "no more than 45 kilograms."

Another Ukrainian journalist, Iryna Danylovych, was abducted in occupied Crimea. She was sentenced to seven years in prison for "illegal possession of explosives" and transferred to a penal colony in Russia. 

Recent reports also indicate that her health has declined while in captivity: According to the  Crimean Tatar Resource Center NGO, 45-year-old Danylovych "lost hearing in her left ear." In addition, "the left side of her body is numb following a micro-stroke, and she constantly complains of heart issues and headaches."

Russian troops also target retired journalists and the relatives of media workers, just like the family of Iryna and Oleksandr Levchenko from the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 

According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, 62-year-old Iryna is a retired journalist. She and her husband were kidnapped in their hometown of Melitopol in May 2023, with few details known about them since then. 

"Russians do not give access to journalists in captivity," Diachuk says. 

Details about Roshchyna's captivity remained largely unknown, too. According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, Roshchyna had been held in at least two notorious Russian prisons: the penal colony №77 in Berdiansk in occupied Ukraine and the detention center №2 in Russia's Taganrog. Both facilities are known for the use of torture against prisoners.

She was tortured with electric shocks while in Russian captivity, Ukrainian investigative journalism outlet Slidstvo.Info reported in early March, citing an unnamed witness in the Taganrog detention center.

There were also cuts on Roshchyna's arms after interrogations, the witness said. The journalist lost weight and weighed up to 30 kilograms, according to the witness. The cause of her death is yet to be established. 

Roshchyna reportedly died on Sept. 19, marking the first known death of a Ukrainian journalist in Russian captivity. 

"Vika was a young, 27-year-old woman. And what did Russia do to her that she died just one year later?" Diachuk says. 

As civilians, Ukrainian journalists are trapped in legal limbo, as international law prohibits the capture and exchange of civilians for prisoners of war, with only two of them liberated since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to IMI: Nariman Dzhelyal, a Crimean Tatar journalist and politician, as well as Maksym Butkevych, Ukrainian journalist and human rights activist. 

"Ukrainians in Russian captivity are like insects frozen in amber. Time has stopped for them, but it's important for all of them to know that everything possible is being done to secure their release," Butkevych said during a meeting with Zelensky days after his release from captivity on Oct. 18. 

Russia began targeting Ukrainian journalists long before the full-scale invasion. First reports of media workers being kidnapped, attacked, or detained emerged shortly after the annexation of Crimea and the start of the war in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in 2014.

According to Oksana Romaniuk, the head of IMI, over 100 journalists, both Ukrainian and foreign, have been detained by Russia since 2014.

"But those detentions were not as long as the current ones," says Diachuk. 

But some of the journalists detained between 2014 and 2021 still remain in captivity. Most of them are Crimean Tatars – the indigenous people of occupied Crimea. 

Among them are journalists and activists Oleksii Bessarabov and Dmytro Shtyblikov who were detained in occupied Crimea and both accused of espionage in 2016. As a result of a fabricated trial, the two were sentenced to 14 years behind bars, according to IMI. 

"What Russia is doing is undoubtedly a crime. I would say it is a crime of genocide, as we see the filtering of citizens based on specific criteria," says Romaniuk, as quoted by IMI. 

"Journalists document Russia's crimes. They capture historical moments. And disseminating this truthful information to the world is not beneficial for Russia because it does not want to show that it is committing crimes," says Diachuk.

Rejecting Trump's authoritarian “new normal” means preserving the evidence that things weren't always this way.

One of the defining features of Donald Trump's second term is an aggressive drive to control the narrative, in part by burying inconvenient evidence. A key example is his regime's multi-pronged assault on federal data infrastructure and independent institutions that safeguard public knowledge. In just its first hundred days, Trump's regime has laid siege to federal data agencies, eliminated or drastically overhauled key reports, ceased collecting crucial information, and pressured scientists and statisticians to alter findings that conflict with the Trumpian political narrative.

These attacks on government statistics pose a threat to democratic accountability, one that will unmoor demands for change by making it harder for the public to keep track of how much the goalposts have moved and how much damage is currently occurring. Trump's approach is notably distinct from that of previous administrations; while US politicians have long attempted to spin and cherry-pick data to suit their political ends, Trump has sought to erase information that does not fit his agenda. This authoritarian approach to government data is incompatible with a functioning democracy.

The US Census Bureau, already hollowed out by years of underfunding, has faced deeper hiring freezes and staffing cuts under Trump's second term. These cuts threaten to slow field operations, delay key releases, and reduce oversight for data accuracy. Trump officials have also eschewed subject matter expertise by disbanding many of the Census Bureau's outside advisory committees. Even more alarmingly, the Trump regime has brazenly disregarded privacy norms in its attempts to weaponize government data against immigrants. The harmful new precedents jeopardize the efforts of federal surveyors who rely on public trust to maintain adequate response rates.

The Trump regime has further burdened federal statistical agencies with a reality-denying executive order targeting (nebulously defined) diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. The directive is premised on denying the actual diversity of the United States, and requires that products be quickly brought into compliance or scrubbed altogether. In addition to undermining data reliability and veracity, the new restrictions put additional strain on the underfunded and understaffed skeleton crews struggling to keep things afloat. Trump's insistence on restoring something like Jim Crow in federal data products is awful in its own right. Compliance with his directive also diverts time and resources from mission-critical work, further hollowing out the government's capacity to serve the public.

Efforts to comply with the Trump regime's war on “DEI” meant that, for example, parts of the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) — a critical dataset used to track economic and demographic shifts across the US — were temporarily taken offline early in Trump's second term. Codebooks for the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a vital longitudinal dataset that tracks how working-class families use public assistance, were also made unavailable. Public access to multiple health datasets was temporarily suspended, along with summary pages that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produces in part to guide medical practitioners. The unannounced purge left researchers scrambling to locate archived copies of datasets, while health care workers struggled to advise patients in the absence of once-reliable sources of information.

Enter the Internet Archive, a nonprofit digital library that has played a critical role in preserving government websites, federal reports, and public communications from previous administrations. Among the Internet Archive's key products is the Wayback Machine, which scrapes and preserves websites in a way that allows users to track site changes and retrieve information that has been removed. The Wayback Machine also accepts user submissions, meaning researchers who had already downloaded missing datasets could make them available to others. Amid the alarming series of dataset removals and alterations early in Trump's second term, the Internet Archive took on renewed importance in preserving data access and institutional memory.

This makes the latest maneuver by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — an Orwellianly named group of government saboteurs — all the more egregious. DOGE has once again supplanted Congress' power of the purse, this time to slash funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), including by rescinding already-awarded grants. Among the casualties is the Internet Archive, which was midway through a $345,960 NEH-funded project to preserve access to historic government publications and web records. DOGE's legally dubious defunding jeopardizes one of the final lines of defense against authoritarian memory-holing. As such, it's hard not to conclude that the Archive is being targeted because its effectiveness makes it an obstacle to the Trump regime's project of strategic erasure. After all, this is the same Trump who has impugned the integrity of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, implying that their standard revisions meant that their US employment estimates were fraudulent.

Deciding what gets measured, and how frequently those measurements are updated, are always political choices – if nothing else then because implementing those decisions uses finite resources. And politicians across the spectrum have presented data in ways that align with their policy goals. During the Biden administration, for example, public health advocates expressed concern when the CDC quietly recalibrated its cutoffs for “high”, “medium”, and “low” levels of COVID-19 in wastewater. Crucially, however, Biden's CDC preserved public access to the underlying data so researchers and watchdogs could still see the full picture, making it possible to challenge the official narrative using a shared set of facts.

Trump's conduct during his second term is different in kind from that of the Biden administration and others before it. Trump's strategy has not been to spin or cherry-pick, but to erase inconvenient facts altogether. To do so, Trump has impugned the neutrality of the data and the integrity of career public servants, and his regime has circumvented Congress to gut public access to public information. Some have noted that the Trump regime's actions are curiously out of sync with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint that appears to be shaping some of Trump's second-term agenda. But viewed through the lens of an insecure authoritarian who doesn't want to take chances with the truth, Donald Trump's behavior makes perfect sense. It's familiar territory for a man who attempted to rewrite the results of the 2020 presidential election — an election he continues to falsely insist he won.

The sabotage of data infrastructure is a form of epistemic control. If there is no record of how things were before, it becomes far easier to accept today's reality as how things have always been. Devoid of context, things like economic contraction, climate disaster, erosion of public health, and ballooning inequality become unpleasant but inexplicable, rather than results of deliberate policy choices. Rejecting Trump's authoritarian new normal means preserving the evidence that things weren't always this way — and continuing to collect the data that makes it possible to track, understand, and challenge what comes next. That means safeguarding the information and the people that this regime is trying to disappear.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Search and rescue operations at the site of a Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on April 24 have ended, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said on April 25.

The attack killed 12 people and injured 87 others, including six children, according to the report.

Thirty-one people remain hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a day earlier.

A series of explosions rocked the capital around 1:00 a.m. local time on April 24, Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported. Additional explosions were later heard around 4 a.m. local time.

Russia launched attack drones, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles, the Kyiv City Military Administration said.

"We were at home and there were explosions," Maria Rumiantseva, a 40-year-old resident of one of the buildings damaged in the attack, told the Kyiv Independent.

"Then I heard the Shahed. We just went out into the corridor, went to open the door, and that was it — an explosion."

Klitschko added that six children, as well as a pregnant woman, were among the injured.

Fires were reported in residential buildings, Kyiv City Military Administration chief Tymur Tkachenko said, adding that cars and commercial buildings have been impacted as well. 

Fallen debris was found around the city, Tkachenko added, describing the  attack as "Russian peace in all its glory."

The mass attack came just hours after the Kremlin demanded Ukraine's full recognition of Russia's claim over four Ukrainian oblasts it partially occupies, neutral status for Ukraine, and an end to all Western military support.

Earlier on April 23, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace in Ukraine.

Later in the night, Russia launched missiles targeting various regions of the country.

Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also targeted in the "massive combined strike," though Kyiv was hit the hardest, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.

In response to the attack, Poland's Air Force scrambled allied fighter jets to protect the country's own airspace from missiles that may stray into Polish territory.

Russia has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure since the onset of its full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022.

The U.S. has been in talks with Ukraine and Russia to negotiate an end to Russia's war against Ukraine.

Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms.

So far, Moscow has refused.

            A senior Russian general died in a car bombing in the Russian city of Balashikha on Friday, authorities say, the same day that US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
    


            Witkoff spent three hours meeting with Putin at the Kremlin in Friday, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters after the meeting, adding that the talks were “constructive and very useful.”
    


            Witkoff's trip to Russia, the fourth since Trump returned to the White House in January, came at a crunch time as the US president's self-imposed deadline of ending the war within his first 100 days in office nears.
    


            “This conversation allowed the Russian and US positions to be further brought closer together, not only on Ukraine, but also on a number of other international issues,” Ushakov told reporters in a call.
    


            Ushakov, who is a former Russian ambassador to Washington, was part of the meeting with Putin, as was Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, Russian state news agency Tass said.
    


            The United States has been applying more pressure on Ukraine after threatening last week it could walk away from the talks “within days” if it becomes clear a deal cannot be reached.
    


            The latest framework, presented by the Trump administration in Paris last week, proposed significant sacrifices from Kyiv, including US recognition of Crimea as Russian territory and Ukraine ceding large swaths of territory to Russia, according to an official familiar with the plan.
    


            According to Ushakov, part of the discussion considered direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow – a possibility that would likely require further discussion and delay in the diplomacy the Trump White House has hoped would yield concrete results in a matter of days.
    


            “As for the Ukrainian crisis itself, the discussion was, in particular, about the possibility of resuming negotiations between representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine,” he said.
    


            Witkoff and Putin likely also discussed an amended peace proposal which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said emerged from a week of diplomatic wrangling. Zelensky said President Donald Trump had received on his desk a fresh document proposing a path forward in negotiations more amenable to Ukraine and its European allies.
    


            Two diverging versions of a peace deal have been at the heart of the past weeks' discussions – one supported by Ukraine and its European allies, and another backed by Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.
    


            A European official familiar with the different drafts said the Ukrainian and European proposal envisaged a ceasefire followed by discussions of about territory, with Kyiv receiving Article-5 like guarantees from its allies.

            The official said that Witkoff's version proposed the recognition of Crimea as Russian by the United States, “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine, Kyiv not joining NATO, and sanctions against Russia being lifted.
    


            The full details of the competing versions were first reported by Reuters.
    


            Vice President JD Vance earlier on Wednesday called “to freeze the territorial lines at some level close to where they are today.”
    


            Asked what concessions Russia was offering on Thursday, Trump replied, “stopping the war,” suggesting that not “taking the whole country” is a “pretty big concession.”
    


            CNN reported this week that Trump was getting frustrated with the stalling talks and has privately told advisers that mediating a deal has been more difficult than he anticipated.
    


            Recognizing Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula Moscow ilegally annexed in 2014, as Russian would cross a major red line for Ukraine and its European allies, and would be in breach of established international law.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected the idea, saying there was “nothing to talk about” as recognizing Crimea as part of Russia would be against Ukraine's constitution.
    


            Friday's highly anticipated meeting took place soon after the announcement that General Yaroslav Moskalik, deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, had been killed in the explosion of a Volkswagen Golf in Balashikha, which lies less than 20 miles east of Moscow.
    


            Russia's Investigative Committee confirmed Moskalik's death, adding that the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device packed with shrapnel.
    


            No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The attack appeared similar in nature to previous assassination of Russian officials, including that of Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, a top Russian general who was accused of orchestrating the use of chemical weapons on the battlefields in Ukraine.
    


            Kirillov – who headed Russia's radiological, biological and chemical protection forces – was killed in December, after a remotely operated bomb planted inside an electric scooter went off outside an apartment building in Moscow.
    


            CNN has reached out to Ukrainian authorities for comment.
    


            The influential Russian military blog Rybar said Moskalik was not in the car when it exploded but was close to it after walking out of a nearby building. CNN can not independently verify this report.
    


            Little is known about Moskalik, who held the rank of Lieutenant General.
    


            Rybar described him as “competent and demanding” and said “he was not well liked” because he was “tough on his subordinates.”
    


            Russia's Investigative Committee said it has opened a criminal probe into the explosion. It added that an investigative team, including forensic experts and law enforcement officers, had begun examining the scene.
    


            Tass earlier reported that the explosive device was “homemade.”
    


            Friday's reported blast comes two days after a fire broke out at an underground car park in Moscow's business district following an explosion there.

Rodney Taylor, whose legs were amputated as a toddler, just one of many people with disabilities at risk from detention

In his three months locked up at Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, Rodney Taylor has missed meals and showers, lived with increasing pain in his hips, developed a swollen thumb on his right hand and blisters on the stumps where his two legs were amputated when he was a toddler.

Taylor's mother brought him to the US from Liberia on a medical visa as a small child. He went through 16 operations and is a double amputee. He has two fingers on his right hand. Now 46, he has lived in the US nearly his entire life, works as a barber, is active in promoting cancer awareness in his community, and recently got engaged.

Nonetheless, his immigration status is unresolved, and despite having an application for residence – commonly known as a “green card” – pending, on 15 January Ice agents arrived at his Loganville, Georgia home and took him to Stewart.

The reason, according to his attorney, who shared paperwork from his case with the Guardian: a burglary conviction he received as a teenager and which the state of Georgia pardoned him for in 2010.

His case is one of an untold number of people with disabilities and other serious health issues who are being swept up in the current administration's “mass deportation” efforts. These efforts are carried out in extreme overcrowding at the hundred-plus detention centers like Stewart across the nation.

They also happen without the benefit of two federal offices that formerly provided oversight for healthcare and other issues, and now a situation is unfolding where detainees with disabilities like Taylor are increasingly at risk of life-altering outcomes and even death, experts say.

“It's the perfect storm for abuses to occur – including negligence,” said Joseph Nwadiuko, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who researches the immigration detention system. “Deaths are much more likely … [and] we haven't thought about the healthcare implications of what's developing,” he said.

The immigration detention system was already a precarious, potentially unsafe place for detainees with disabilities, according to experts and a handful of current and former employees with the Department of Homeland Security – Ice's parent agency.

But when the current administration closed the office for civil rights and civil liberties (CRCL) and the office of the immigration detention ombudsman (Oido) last month, detainees such as Taylor were left with less protection than ever – at a time when nearly 48,000 detainees are locked up nationwide, the highest number since October 2019.

“It's all happening in the dark,” said Sarah Owings, Taylor's attorney, speaking of conditions facing her client and others like him.

Taylor spoke to the Guardian from Stewart. When he was detained in front of his house, he was only days away from picking up new prosthetic legs; the ones he was using were too tight. Then the detention center gave him shoes that didn't fit the legs and trying to walk “felt like walking on concrete on my knees”, he said.

In addition, the prosthetic legs have batteries that require eight hours of charging a day. But after being locked up at Stewart, he didn't even see a doctor for three days, and in the ensuing months, the facility has never been able to arrange for eight hours of charging, allowing only several hours at a time. The result: the batteries die and the legs don't bend, creating more pain in Taylor's hips.

Taylor and Owings sought a medical leave, in order to see the doctor who could at least fit him for the new prosthetic legs – and were denied. A second petition is “under review”, he said.

In the meantime, walking to the cafeteria to eat has proved too painful. Other detainees brought him meals for awhile, but often had to argue with guards for permission. A case manager took over the chore, often arriving at least an hour after meals.

Staff also offered Taylor a wheelchair – but he can't push it, as his right hand only has two fingers, and his thumb has swollen and become painful since he was detained.

Taylor's case was one of several featured in a CNN story about people facing possible deportation after decades of living in the US. Afterwards, he said, “the warden came to me and said, ‘Tell me what you need.'” He told him about his legs and thumb. “I haven't heard a response yet,” Taylor said. “It's stressful.”

Taylor told the Guardian he was not the only detainee at Stewart with medical issues. He met another detainee who suffered an infection and couldn't walk; the man had to wait about a month to get crutches.

“Unless you're dying or bleeding out … they're not going to come,” he said a guard told him and several others. “They think, ‘Everybody is getting deported soon … and fixing your issue is not our concern – getting you outta here is our concern. Why spend all this extra money?'” said Taylor.

The situation is the same at other Ice detention facilities, several experts told the Guardian. They mentioned Krome, in Miami, Florida, where at least three detainees have died in recent months and others with conditions such as HIV have gone weeks without medicine.

Amy Zeidan, a professor of emergency medicine at Atlanta's Emory University who has researched healthcare in the immigration detention system, said that increasing overcrowding also worsens a chronic workforce shortage. “They don't have enough qualified people,” she said. “They don't have the people they need to provide appropriate care.”

These conditions “are emblematic of the system” under the current administration, said a DHS staffer who preferred anonymity to avoid retaliation.

Michelle Brané was the ombudsman at the Oido until the office of 100-plus employees was shut down, doing away with inspections of immigration detention facilities – both announced and unannounced; responses to complaints; and policy recommendations for improving such aspects of detention as healthcare. Her office “deescalated situations that are now being exacerbated [by] … increasing detentions”, she said.

The DHS sees things differently.

“These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department's] mission,” said a DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, in March, regarding shuttering the Oido and the CRCL, which handled more in-depth investigations of healthcare and other issues. Ice did not respond to a query from the Guardian.

This attitude, said Brané, shows a “disdain for meeting basic humane conditions”, adding that her office was “created by statute and funded by Congress”.

The former ombudsman is concerned about the situation facing detainees with disabilities and other serious health issues. “Ultimately, I'm worried people will die, or suffer irreparable harm – and dying shouldn't be the point at which we start caring,” she said. “We shouldn't be a country that is willingly mistreating people.”

Owens's departure comes amid a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the company from President Donald Trump.

Bill Owens, the executive producer for CBS News's “60 Minutes” program, announced earlier this week that he would be stepping down from his position as the company moves to encroach on the show's journalistic independence.

Owens — only the third person to hold the role in the show's 57-year history — had been the executive producer of “60 Minutes” since 2019. His departure comes as the company has increasingly overseen the program's editorial decision-making, despite its tradition of being independent of the network. It also comes amid a multi-billion dollar lawsuit by President Donald Trump dubiously alleging that CBS News had wronged him as a candidate by making edits to an interview with then-Democratic candidate for president Kamala Harris. 

Owens announced his resignation to staff in a memo that was obtained by The New York Times, portions of which the newspaper printed. 

“Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,' right for the audience,” Owens said in the memo, adding:

Having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.

Owens also met with staff in an in-person meeting on Tuesday to announce his departure. Tearing up and noting the moves that CBS executives were making to hamper the program's independence, Owens told those who attended that it was “clear the company is done with me.” He then called the company's actions a “slippery slope” toward further capitulation to those who threatened the show's integrity.

In addition to moves relating to Trump's lawsuit against the company — initially a $10 billion suit, now a $20 billion suit that many legal experts have said is not going anywhere — the editorial independence of “60 Minutes” has also been threatened by Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, who is looking to sell the company to Skydance, which is owned by billionaire Larry Ellison. Such a sale would have to garner approval from the Trump administration.

Redstone complained about the editorial direction of the program in January, when it aired a segment that was critical of Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump White House has made clear that it is the policy of the administration to punish individuals and institutions that express opposition to the U.S.'s role in the slaughter. 

Amid this lawsuit and other actions by corporate media to yield to Trump, Truthout's board president and editor-at-large Maya Schenwar, editor-in-chief Negin Owliaei, and executive director Ziggy West Jeffery authored an op-ed calling for movement media to oppose the administration's authoritarianism and uplift voices suppressed by the White House.

“Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit,” the trio wrote in their op-ed, adding:

[Movement media] have a responsibility to remind people of what we have lost, and what we could still win. We highlight any potential footholds that might stabilize us as we move toward a more just world.

“As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations — either through need or greed — rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump's wishes even before his inauguration, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. … Journalism is just one tool in the anti-fascist toolbox,” they continued. “Those of us who create it must take seriously how our responsibilities intersect with and uplift the other tools that will, together, enable people to effectively organize against authoritarianism.”



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Exit comes after Joe Kasper was implicated as orchestrator of power grab that led to dismissal of three Pentagon officials

Joe Kasper, the controversial chief of staff to the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was central to a dramatic power struggle at the Pentagon, has left his post, in an unexpected departure.

Despite Hegseth's assurances just days ago in a TV appearance on the Fox & Friends show that Kasper would merely transition to “a slightly different role” within the department, Kasper confirmed to Politico in a Thursday interview he will instead return to government relations and consulting, maintaining only limited Pentagon ties as a special government employee.

A senior defense official at the Pentagon confirmed the dramatic title change to the Guardian on Friday, saying Kasper would be “handling special projects at the Department of Defense”

“Secretary Hegseth is thankful for [Kasper's] continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda,” the official said in a statement, referring to Donald Trump's protectionist policy push.

The quick exit comes after Kasper was implicated as the orchestrator of a power grab that led to the dismissal of three senior Pentagon officials – Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick and Colin Carroll – allegedly as part of a leak investigation.

The administration's first hundred days created a troubled tenure for Kasper, with anonymous sources claiming he was frequently late to meetings, failed to follow through on critical tasks, and displayed inappropriate behavior, including berating officials and making crude comments allegedly about his bowel movements during high-level meetings.

“He lacked the focus and organizational skills needed to get things done,” one anonymous insider told Politico.

The leadership shake-up coincides with separate allegations that Hegseth had an unsecured internet connection installed in his Pentagon office, which would bypass government security protocols, to use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer. This “dirty line” arrangement potentially exposes sensitive defense information to surveillance or hacking risks, according to reports from the Associated Press and ABC News.

Kasper previously worked at the Department of Homeland Security, the US navy and the air force during the first Trump administration before becoming a lobbyist.

Nearly 700 essays from around the world have been unveiled in Moscow ahead of a major global forum on the future economy, with authors sharing bold ideas for shaping a better world.

Moscow hosted a presentation on Thursday of essays submitted for a contest which is part of the upcoming Open Dialogue: ‘The Future of the World: New Platform for Global Growth'. The event, scheduled for April 28-30, will bring global experts to the Russian capital to explore what lies ahead for the world economy and society.

The National Centre RUSSIA, which organized the contest, received nearly 700 submissions from 102 countries. The countries with the most active participants included Mexico, India, China, Oman, Italy, Egypt, Vietnam, Türkiye, Colombia, Canada, and France, according to the organizers.

The essays, now compiled into four volumes, center on four themes: Investments in people, Technology, Environment, and Communication. The organizers say the goal is to identify breakthrough ideas that could inform future economic planning.

“Soon, there will be 10 billion of us on the planet, and we must decide what to do about electricity and environment in the future,” Gerald Sakuler, the president of the Austrian Business Club in Russia, said. “There are many ideas. Every proposal will be heard.”

Thursday's presentation brought together experts, contributors, and organizers to discuss highlights from the submissions and exchange ideas ahead of the main forum.

The upcoming Open Dialogue forum will gather representatives from think tanks, government agencies, universities, development organizations, media, and youth groups to debate strategies for global development.

The full event program is available in Russian, English, Chinese, Arabic, and Portuguese on the National Centre RUSSIA website.

In a clear case of racial profiling, immigration police in Florida unlawfully arrested and held a US-born citizen.

In a clear case of racial profiling, immigration police in Florida unlawfully arrested and held a US-born citizen.

For almost a decade now, Florida has served as a laboratory for hardline immigration policies that are later exported to other state legislatures across the country. The recent arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S.-born citizen who was mistakenly detained under an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) hold in Leon County, shows the threat that these persecutory laws pose for the civil rights of all people, regardless of immigration status.

Since 2019, state lawmakers, at Gov. Ron DeSantis's behest, have approved a series of anti-immigrant bills, starting with Senate Bill (SB) 168 and SB 1808. These bills mandated cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and banned sanctuary cities in Florida, even though at the time of passage, no Florida cities had enacted sanctuary city-type policies. 

That was followed by further legislation threatening licenses of nonprofit shelters that housed unaccompanied migrant children; more bills banning sanctuary policies (even though, again, no city in the state had enacted those policies); and the passage of SB 1718 in 2023. This legislation made national headlines by, among other things, establishing felony charges for crossing the state line with an undocumented person in your vehicle even if they were family; mandating that health care providers that accept Medicaid dollars ask a patient's immigration status; and requiring the use of E-Verify for private companies with 25 or more employees.

Soon after Donald Trump's 2024 election win, DeSantis started beating the anti-immigrant drum once again, convening the Florida legislature to enact a smorgasbord of policies that included making it harder for Floridians to send remittances to loved ones abroad, and repealing the state's in-state tuition law, which allows undocumented students to pay the same undergraduate college tuition rates as U.S. citizens. He also levied harsh threats to remove elected officials who obstruct cooperation between local police and federal immigration enforcement.

State lawmakers did indeed meet for a special session in February, but they did not enact DeSantis's wish list. After infighting between the governor and the legislature, Florida Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez stopped DeSantis from establishing a state agency for immigration enforcement that would be de facto controlled by him via an appointee. The compromise was instead to set up a board composed of the governor, the agriculture commissioner, the chief financial officer and the attorney general to oversee this new agency, financed with $500 million of Florida taxpayer dollars.

Along with setting up this state-level immigration enforcement agency, the legislature also enacted Senate Bill 4C, which is now the center of a new scandal in Florida that has caught nationwide attention. This law established criminal penalties for undocumented immigrants over 18 years old who “knowingly enter or attempt to enter this state after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”

The organization that I work for, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, along with others and represented by the ACLU and Community Justice Project, filed a lawsuit that successfully got Senate Bill 4C temporarily blocked in court earlier this month. This law is currently not supposed to be enforced at all in Florida, and no arrests are supposed to be made based on it. Despite this, at least 15 arrests have been made.

This lawless behavior by Florida officials was capped off by the illegal arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez on April 16. Florida Highway Patrol, a police force that has been deputized under the orders of DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement operations, arrested him. Lopez-Gomez was charged under Senate Bill 4C for having illegally entered Florida as an unauthorized alien, even though he is a U.S.-born citizen. He was detained at the request of ICE.

Lopez-Gomez was the passenger in a car and was traveling to Florida for work. He had been previously placed in an ICE hold for another traffic incident in Georgia in which his family had managed to convince officials to release him after showing proof of citizenship, which included his birth certificate. He had no such luck in Florida.

After his arrest, he was transferred to the Leon County jail and held there. Appearing virtually at his hearing, I met his desperate mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, who showed up with his birth certificate to try and convince the judge to release her son.

I met his desperate mother, Sebastiana Gomez-Perez, who showed up with his birth certificate to try and convince the judge to release her son.

Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans held and put Lopez-Gomez's birth certificate up to the light after it was silently waved in the courtroom by the family. “In looking at it, and feeling it, and holding it up to the light, the court can see the watermark to show that this is indeed an authentic document,” Riggans said.

After inspection of the birth certificate, the judge found no probable cause for the charge but argued that, due to ICE requesting he be detained, she did not have jurisdiction to order his release.

It's worth noting the depth of just how wronged Lopez-Gomez was here. He was arrested and detained under a law that was blocked by a judge and that was not meant to target him in the first place as a U.S. citizen, a double error which deprived him of his freedom. On top of that, this is all acknowledged by a judge who refuses to uphold his Fourth Amendment rights, and instead surrenders jurisdiction of a U.S. citizen who is acknowledged to have committed no crime to ICE, which is not supposed to hold jurisdiction over U.S. citizens. Lopez-Gomez's arrest was a shocking violation of basic principles of U.S. civil liberties and constitutional rights. It can be compared to Franz Kafka's novel, The Trial, in which a man must defend himself in a trial in which he does not know the crime for which he is accused by a nebulous authority. 

We were able to secure legal representation for Lopez-Gomez, and the ensuing firestorm generated by his case once news broke out helped to ensure his eventual release, even though he had been previously ordered to remain in detention under a 48-hour ICE hold.

Journalists, advocates, and elected officials desperately called ICE officials and did not hear back until about 6 pm, when his mother was contacted outside of the Leon County jail, where we had gathered along with community members protesting Lopez-Gomez's unjustified detention.

A Department of Homeland Security official met us at a Wendy's restaurant about a block away, where Lopez-Gomez finally reunited with his family. He appeared shaken after spending 24 hours in jail and told us he was not fed while detained the day before.

“I felt bad in there,” Lopez-Gomez told us as he ate a meal upon his release. “They didn't give us anything to eat all day yesterday.”

Sebastiana Gomez-Perez was immensely grateful to everyone who helped secure her son's release, saying, “I don't have a way to pay all the people who are helping us. People from other states have called us, and we don't have a way to pay them; we can only thank them.”

Lopez-Gomez's arrest was a shocking violation of basic principles of U.S. civil liberties and constitutional rights.

Lopez-Gomez's arrest is a clear case of racial profiling. He was born in Cairo, Georgia, but spent most of his life in Mexico. He does not speak English, and when stopped, the Florida Highway Patrol officers assumed he was undocumented based on his inability to speak English, and based on his appearance. What is also shocking is that arrest records show that the ICE hold was requested based on biometric evidence — but if that is the case, the officers should have known Lopez-Gomez was a citizen.

In a hearing in Miami federal court the day after Lopez-Gomez was released, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams said she was “astounded” that state authorities had continued to make arrests despite her ordering them not to. While stopping short of holding state authorities in contempt of court, she extended her initial 14-day restraining order against Senate Bill 4C for another 11 days, making it clear that Florida law enforcement was bound by her order and that the arrests needed to stop. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier finally ordered the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Florida Highway Patrol, state sheriffs and police chiefs to “please instruct your officers and agents to comply with Judge Williams' directives,” while still making the absurd argument that the court order should not apply to law enforcement officers.

Lopez-Gomez's arrest shows why the persecutory and ever-growing hostile framework of immigration enforcement in this country is a threat to every citizen and not just undocumented immigrants. We currently see student visa holders detained and ordered deported for merely writing op-eds that contradict the opinions of the Trump administration. We see legal permanent residents detained and ordered deported because of peaceful student activism. We see efforts to strip citizenship from those naturalized. We have finally arrived at the unfortunate but logical conclusion of this government overreach: U.S. citizens detained by immigration enforcement agencies that should have no jurisdiction over them, while Trump threatens to ship “home-growns” to prisons in El Salvador, where due process is nonexistent and torture is rampant.

The scope of persecution against immigrants, the enforcement practices, the surveillance tactics and the erosion of our civil rights always expand to the broader population, as Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez experienced.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Fernando Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced in 2023 after being convicted for corruption

Brazil's former president, Fernando Collor, has been arrested early and ordered to begin serving a prison sentence stemming from his 2023 conviction for corruption.

Collor was convicted of receiving 20m reais ($3.5m) to facilitate contracts between BR Distribuidora, a fuel distributor formerly controlled by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, and construction firm UTC Engenharia for the construction of fuel distribution bases. In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned.

Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest. He was arrested on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas.

Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the supreme court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals.

The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash, a sweeping corruption investigation that has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America – including the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years.

Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil.

Supreme court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president's arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president's lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals.

The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away.

Collor's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were taken into custody on Thursday after authorities raided their home in New Mexico amid reports and court papers stating that an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member was arrested living in a building behind his home.

The footage shows Cano handcuffed, speaking to multiple FBI officers outside of what appears to be a residence.

His wife, who is also handcuffed, is later led toward a vehicle by Homeland Security personnel.

“Under President Trump, we have arrested over 150,000 aliens—including more than 600 members of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang,” Noem wrote alongside the post. “If you are here illegally and break the law, we will hunt you down, arrest you and lock you up. That's a promise.”

The couple was allegedly living with Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan illegal immigrant, at their home in Las Cruces, roughly 40 miles north of the U.S.–Mexico border.

The DOJ said Ortega-Lopez, who entered the U.S. illegally on Dec. 15, 2023, and was released pending removal proceedings, was charged with being an illegal immigrant in possession of a firearm or ammunition.

Court papers filed by federal prosecutors earlier in April, which sought to block the release of Ortega-Lopez, included the names Joel and Nancy Cano and said the suspect was living in their Las Cruces home at the time of the arrest. The papers did not provide an age, occupation, or other details about the Canos.

Exhibits that were shown in a federal courthouse in April included a social media photo of the suspect posing with the judge, the Albuquerque Journal reported.

Court documents state that Ortega-Lopez was hired by Nancy Cano to “install a glass door for her” and that he “continued to do a few jobs” for her after being evicted from an apartment in April 2024, at which point she offered him a place to stay at the back of the residence she shared with her husband.

The Epoch Times could not independently verify whether immigration officials arrested Ortega-Lopez at the former judge's home. Two email accounts that appear to be associated with Cano did not return a request for comment on Thursday.

In its ruling, the court said Cano “shall never again hold, become a candidate for, run for, or stand for election to any New Mexico judicial office in the future.”

He must also never seek or accept a pro tempore position “for any New Mexico judicial office in the future,” which includes working as a judge in any municipal, probate, metropolitan, magistrate, district, or appeals court. Cano is also banned from working as a judge for the Supreme Court.

He “shall never again hold or exercise any judicial authority in the State of New Mexico,” which also includes “officiating at weddings,” according to the court order.

The Supreme Court did not state why he was leaving his position or why he was barred from being a judge in the state.

Cano, who had been a magistrate judge in Doña Ana County since 2011, resigned last month.

“Working with each of you has been a very rewarding experience for which I will remain eternally grateful,” he wrote. “All the best to everyone of you. I wish all of you a happy retirement once you are ready yourself.”

The Epoch Times reached out to the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.

The Department of Government Efficiency said on April 24 that records for millions of recipients aged 120 or older have been updated as part of a “major cleanup” at the Social Security Administration (SSA).

Another 1.4 million records are expected to be updated within two weeks, the post stated. DOGE previously reported on March 18 that 3.2 million records had been marked as deceased.

A chart shared by DOGE on Thursday showed that more than 2.7 million records of people aged 120 to 129 have been removed over the past several weeks. More than 3.4 million accounts belonging to individuals aged 130 to 139 were removed, and more than 3.3 million records of individuals aged 140 to 149 were marked as deceased.

Another 1.3 million accounts of people aged 150 to 159 were also removed this month, the chart showed. In total, 10,926,833 accounts were marked as deceased, according to the chart.

The tech entrepreneur posted on social media platform X a screenshot of a federal database showing that more than 12 million Social Security recipients were listed as older than 120.

Two of the individuals listed on the database were marked as in the age ranges of 240–249 and 360–369. More than a thousand people on the database were listed as being in the age range of 220–229.

“According to the Social Security database, these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to false!” Musk wrote. “Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.”

From 2015 to 2022, SSA paid almost $8.6 trillion in benefits and made approximately $71.8 billion, or 0.84 percent, in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, according to the report.

The report noted that improper payments have been a “longstanding challenge” for the SSA and that, while the agency has taken actions to address this challenge, “there is more it needs to do.”

“Without better access to data, increased automation, systems modernization, and policy or legislative changes, improper payments will continue to be an issue into the future,” the report stated.

According to the survey, since 2020, 24,500 individuals above the age of 115 have claimed a total of $59 million in unemployment benefits, while 28,000 claimants between the ages of 1 and 5 have received $254 million in benefits.

A further 9,700 people with birth dates more than 15 years in the future were paid $69 million in benefits, DOGE stated.

Individuals who fraudulently collect unemployment benefits face a fine of no less than 15 percent of the amount of the fraudulent payment.

Additional penalties under state unemployment insurance laws may also include criminal prosecution with fines and/or incarceration and permanent loss of eligibility for unemployment compensation.

The Epoch Times has contacted a spokesperson for the SSA for comment.

Arkells frontman Max Kerman performs at Festival d'ete de Quebec in Quebec City on July 4.Amy Harris/The Associated Press

Max Kerman is the lead singer of Arkells and the author of the new book Try Hard: Creative Work in Progress.

I had a satisfying moment the other morning: I learned a new expression.

I was reading the print edition of The Globe and Mail, taking photos of interesting articles and texting them to a group chat called “Sweet Baby Idiots.” This is my version of sharing a link. Like any noble group chat, it exists so my friends and I can talk about the news and then – as people of action! – figure out how to solve the world's problems.

After sharing one distressing article after the next, I posed a question to one specific friend, Mat. A group text is a safe platform for curious questions, and Mat is the sage of the group.

“I don't know if I've ever been as disappointed in the state of affairs as I am right now,” I wrote. “Societal inequality – the needless degree of it – drives so much chaos and hostility. What's the best way average citizens like us can reject this system? Do any of our everyday actions matter, at all?”

I don't consider myself a hysterical person, but Mat could sense I was unusually bothered, and instead of replying in the group chat, he called me. For the next ten minutes, we lamented all of the things people lament, and then we stumbled onto something useful.

I found myself wondering if the best way to open your mind and connect with people is to engage in more shared spaces. Places where real life happens – parks, schools, libraries, coffee shops, live music venues and subways are living and breathing ecosystems. Being among strangers in these vibrant public places helps us build an understanding of one another.

I mused to Mat that moving through public spaces might seem to have a passive effect on us, but the emotional impact is significant. When you share space, you begin to feel something in common with the people around you, even when your day-to-day lives are vastly different. It's why sports and music can lead to such unifying experiences. It's why I love events like free street festivals. The people watching, the smells, the sounds, the vendors. If you've been out at 10 p.m. on an Art Crawl in Hamilton or OssFest in Toronto, you know the energy I'm talking about.

Mat, who happens to be an academic, said to me gently, “There's actually a word for this. It's called collective effervescence. The feeling of energy and harmony when people are engaged in a shared purpose.”

I smiled. This is what I was after! Interconnectedness. Everyone bringing their own unique talents and spirits to a collective. Emboldening one another. Sharing in mutual appreciation of everyone's unique gifts.

A week later, I was out for a beer with Mat and were talking about the virtues of public education – one of the most important shared spaces we have in society. Mat grew up in a troubled home, and without much thought, I said to him: “If not for the diversity of your public school, you wouldn't have met the kind of families who let you sleep over when things were going badly at home. Isn't it great that you knew them? You had a warm, safe bed to sleep in.”

In his sage way, he looked at me with a sympathetic smile, and said, “But Max, isn't it kind of great that they knew me, too?”

Mat is a humble, non-attention-seeking person. I let the words sink in. Of course. Shared space is a two-way street.

I immediately felt incredibly foolish, apologized, and sent him a text the next day to apologize some more.

“Cut yourself some slack, Maxy!” Mat wrote back. “I think most people assume there's a trickle-down effect of being among the right people. I was just trying to articulate that both sides of the equation can enrich each other.”

It's near impossible these days to offer an idea that doesn't offend some part of the political spectrum, but I am going to try here: sharing space with others is good. That's it.

I have a very lucky job, alongside four of my best friends, that occasionally affords me a glitzy life – but the deepest satisfaction in my work comes from the time and space I've shared with the people of all walks of life that I've met along the way. It's opened my mind and offered me an endlessly full life.

Settings – ones that encourage observation and allow for spontaneous conversation – make me more curious, feel more connected and often put my own problems in perspective.

Now, I also get that sharing space with people can be annoying. Tranquility is important! Nobody likes a crowded subway or a loud neighbour in your apartment building. And I don't want to be near my neighbourhood Facebook group when there's a disagreement. I get that people become worn down by the world and cynicism can come easy. But nothing good ever came from worn-down, cynical people. Just because the world gets annoying doesn't mean we should opt out.

In fact, when we start to feel annoyed, we'd probably do well to find more ways to opt in.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

A copy of the peace proposal given to the U.S. by Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week includes "robust security guarantees" including from Washington, and no talks on territorial concessions until a "full and unconditional ceasefire in the sky, on land and at sea" has been implemented, Reuters reported on April 25.

The document, reprinted in full by the news outlet, contains numerous points that show the diverging viewpoints of the U.S. on one side, and Ukraine and its European allies on the other as they seek to end Russia's full-scale invasion.

The Trump administration has so far refused to offer Kyiv any security guarantees, but the Ukrainian proposal calls for an "Article 5-like agreement" backed by the U.S. while NATO membership for Kyiv remains off the table.

Earlier this week it was reported the U.S. could give de jure recognition to Russia's control over occupied Crimea, but the Ukrainian and European proposal insists that "territorial issues will be discussed and resolved after a full and unconditional ceasefire."

Reuters published details of the U.S. plan, confirming earlier reports and revealing key disagreements with Ukrainian and European positions.

The proposal also demands that sanctions on Russia only be eased after a "sustainable peace" has been achieved, a move the White House is reportedly considering implementing even before a peace deal has been agreed on.

Other points call for the "return (of) all deported and illegally displaced Ukrainian children," the implementation of the minerals deal, and that Ukraine "will be fully reconstructed and compensated financially," including through the use of Russia's frozen assets.

Washington's allies have been voicing growing alarm over the Trump administration's proposed framework to end the war in Ukraine, which would allow Russia to retain seized Ukrainian territory.

Multiple diplomatic sources told CNN that officials in Europe and Asia are bracing for the outcome of renewed U.S.-Russia talks and fear the plan sends a dangerous message.

"If one country in Europe is forced to give up parts of its legal territory... no country in Europe or elsewhere can feel safe, NATO or no NATO," one diplomat told CNN.

In high-level meetings held in London on April 23, U.S., European, and Ukrainian officials reportedly made progress in narrowing differences.

U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg called the talks "candid, positive and productive." At the same time, a European official said negotiators had "managed to convince the Ukrainians to convince themselves to get in a more U.S. administration-friendly position."

Still, the core issue — territorial concessions — remains fraught. A German official acknowledged that "the Ukrainians are coming around," but emphasized they "have red lines they cannot cross."

MOSCOW, April 25. /TASS/. Allies turn away from Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, while relations between India and Pakistan worsen in the wake of a terror attack in Kashmir. Meanwhile, Washington and Tehran are still far apart on the nuclear deal. These stories have topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Ukraine has been losing the support of its closest allies. Washington has criticized Kiev for its unwillingness to make concessions as part of the settlement process, and European partners, too, have called on Bankovaya Street (Vladimir Zelensky's office - TASS) to consider the possibility of a compromise. US President Donald Trump is especially irritated, as he threatened Zelensky with the loss of the whole country unless he agrees to conclude a deal immediately. The US leader stressed that it is much more difficult to engage with Ukraine than with Russia. On April 25, Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will make his fourth visit to Russia for full-fledged talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This could turn the tide toward resolving the conflict. In addition, work toward an in-person meeting between the Russian and American leaders is ongoing.

A foreign ministers meeting on Ukraine scheduled to take place in London on April 23 didn't happen, and in this light, the focus has clearly shifted, Vladimir Vasilyev, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, observed. "Now Washington is saying openly that Kiev, not Moscow, is the main culprit for the lack of progress toward settlement. The balance has shifted," he told Izvestia.

Among other key issues, Ukraine refuses to sign a mineral deal, the expert continued. "The Trump administration's claims to Kiev have piled up. Zelensky's personality, too, matters, for how he behaves can now be interpreted as entrenched irresponsibility. This is how his diplomacy can be described," Vasilyev said.

Meanwhile, the rhetoric in Europe which has pledged unwavering support to Kiev over the past three years has shifted, too. According to The Financial Times, Britain, Germany, and France have been secretly pressing Kiev to give up part of its territory as they fear that, should the United States abandon the negotiating process, they would confront Moscow on their own.

Discussions on lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as part of a peace deal, as reported by Politico, are yet another proof that European elites are ready to bargain, sacrificing Ukraine's interests for a stable energy market, even as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later denied this report.

The Europeans, albeit the positions of the European Commission and some individual countries, like Hungary, differ, are actually ready for bargaining and some form of compromise, however, they insist that Russia pays a higher price for the compromise, according to Ivan Loshkarev, Associate Professor of the Department of Political Theory at MGIMO University.

 

Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed South Asian nations, following a deadly attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian region disputed by Pakistan. In the attack, 26 people were killed when members of the Resistance Front, an armed wing with ties to the Pakistan-based organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (banned in Russia), opened fire on a group of tourists. Three of the five suspects identified are Pakistani nationals, the Hindustan Times reported.

Despite Islamabad denying any involvement and offering its own counterclaims, on April 24, the Indian Foreign Ministry suspended the issuance of visas for Pakistani nationals, effective immediately, and announced that visas already granted would be revoked by April 27. Around 1,500 people have been detained in Kashmir, where a specialized police operation is currently underway.

In retaliation, Pakistan shut down its airspace to Indian flights and halted all trade with its neighbor. Furthermore, Islamabad voiced strong objections to India's decision to suspend the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.

Under this agreement, New Delhi has the exclusive right to utilize water from three eastern rivers, explained Alexey Kupriyanov, head of the South Asia and Pacific Region Group at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations. Pakistan was granted the right to use water from three western rivers, which are critical to the nation's agricultural and economic survival.

Boris Volkhonsky, associate professor at Moscow State University's Institute of Asian and African Countries, suggested that while the use of force cannot be completely ruled out, it remains unlikely. The balance of nuclear weapons between India and Pakistan has so far acted as a deterrent, preventing the conflict from escalating into full-scale war, he noted in an interview with Vedomosti. Though isolated retaliatory actions may occur, it's important to consider that a non-state actor has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The closure of Pakistan's airspace has significant economic consequences for India, especially since the majority of India's international flights to Europe and the United States transit over Pakistan, Kupriyanov explained. This could lead to substantial disruptions at Indian airports in the short term, he warned.

 

The United States would agree to allow Iran to develop its civilian nuclear program provided it relies exclusively on foreign-made nuclear fuel for it as part of a potential deal, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told The Free Press online news outlet. While the two sides are still far from reviving the nuclear treaty, the White House is committed to reaching a peaceful solution that would be acceptable to all, he added.

If Iran accepts the terms outlined by Rubio, it will be able to use its nuclear reactors, but its capabilities to build nuclear weapons will be blocked under a ban on its uranium enrichment. Therefore, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote, Washington proposed the UAE model under which the Arab kingdom buys nuclear fuel abroad to operate its several reactors instead of enriching uranium on its own.

The White House resorts to the sanctions policy and rhetorical maneuvers, says Lev Sokolshchik, senior researcher with the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics. This, as Trump and other hawks on Iran view it, can force Tehran to make concessions in striking a deal, the expert continues. Using the UAE model in the Iranian nuclear dossier is the underlying condition for the United States and its ally, Israel, as, in theory, this would prevent Iran from secretly enriching uranium, Sokolshchik argues. In an interview with Vedomosti, he doubted the US and Iran can strike a deal.

Iran will not agree to use imported fuel as the Islamic republic established the nuclear fuel cycle for the production of corresponding materials decades ago, said Vladimir Sazhin, senior researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies. However, Tehran is willing to compromise on its nuclear program, as, first, it would like some of the sanctions pressure on its economy to be eased and, second, Iran would strongly oppose a major regional escalation and potential strikes on its nuclear facilities by the US or Israel, the expert emphasized.

 

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has paid a visit to South Africa and held talks with the country's President Cyril Ramaphosa. While the official goal of the trip was to bolster bilateral relations and contribute to finding a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis, in fact, Kiev attempted to persuade one of the most influential players on the continent to take sides with it, with most African nations sympathizing more with Russia than with Ukraine. However, South Africa remembers how Moscow helped it fight against apartheid, so it did not make any reciprocal steps toward Kiev. This may be why Zelensky shortened his visit.

In an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Oleg Teterin, First Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Asia and Africa Today magazine, said: "South Africa is a BRICS member, and it provides moral assistance to Russia anyway. And Zelensky is desperately looking for support now that he has been rejected by US President Donald Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Even as they cannot put it bluntly, South African leaders certainly lean toward Russia."

Professor (Honoris Causa) Vladimir Shubin at the University of the Western Cape agrees that Kiev is looking for support in the Global South, but it has failed to secure any. The majority of countries in Africa, excluding in votes on a UN resolution, does not provide any support to Kiev, he told Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

"South African President Ramaphosa headed a delegation of African leaders on a peace mission to Kiev, and they also met with President Putin in St. Petersburg, after which Russia and Ukraine exchanged POWs. Even as that mission did not yield any real results, South Africa remains committed to pushing for peace across the globe. And it views Zelensky's visit in this light, too," Shubin explained. According to him, not everybody in South Africa's ruling coalition approved Zelensky's visit, with the Communist party campaigning against his arrival. And the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) reacted negatively to his visit, he continued. "There is no unity on the issue in the country's ruling alliance. And the official position of Pretoria is that it is willing to help find a peaceful solution while pursuing the policy of non-alignment," he concluded.

 

Hungary and Slovakia will maintain the opportunity to buy Russian oil. The EU has not set an expiration date for waivers on the ban on supplies to the two countries, the European Commission told Izvestia. A temporary waiver on the general ban on Russian oil imports for pumping fuel to Central European countries that do not have the opportunity to receive it by sea was introduced in 2022. Nevertheless, in May, the EC is set to publish a roadmap for completely phasing out Russian energy sources by 2027. Slovakia supports the use of existing oil transportation routes, the republic's Economy Ministry told Izvestia. Experts, too, believe that Bratislava and Budapest will continue to purchase resources from Russia anyway.

While a specific list of countries has not been published, the number of countries enjoying the waiver is gradually diminishing. Poland and Germany stopped relying on the exemption from the oil embargo on June 23, 2023. The Czech Republic fully switched to non-Russian oil supplies earlier this month. Therefore, only Hungary and Slovakia continue to receive Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline now.

Hungary and Slovakia will be able to defend their right to buy energy from Russia using this pipeline, since the situation is less tense now than it was in 2022, when they won their exemption from the oil embargo, Igor Yushkov, an expert at the Financial University and the National Energy Security Fund, told Izvestia.

Slovakia acts appropriately in continuing to buy oil from Russia, because refusing to do so would harm the republic's economy, Peter Marcek, a former parliamentarian, told Izvestia. Slovakia would like to deepen economic cooperation with Russia, he added.

Whether Hungary will continue to buy Russian oil after 2027 depends on next year's parliamentary election. If the opposition wins, with incumbent Prime Minister Viktor Orban standing a 50% chance of being reelected, Budapest will join the EU policy, Gabor Stier, head of the foreign policy department at Magyar Nemzet newspaper, told Izvestia. Much depends on relations between Russia and the United States, he argues: if this positive trend continues, Trump will allow Hungary to buy Russian oil.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event to sign executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, on April 23.Leah Millis/Reuters

Jerry Dias is a retired national president of Unifor and helped in the negotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement in 2018. Jordan Brennan is a former chief economist at Unifor.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise the tariffs he has imposed on Canadian cars yet again. It's part of his crusade against free trade, which he blames for a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States.

But if trade liberalization is the main culprit behind deindustrialization in the U.S., we should expect globe-trotting manufacturing giants such as General Motors GM-N to have shed comparatively fewer jobs than the domestic manufacturing sector, as jobs relocated over borders. The data tell a different story.

GM's global headcount mirrors the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. Both rose steadily from the 1950s through the 1980s before plummeting. Since the 1980s, America has shed nearly seven million manufacturing jobs – one in three. GM's global work force shrank a whopping 82 per cent over the same period, though its annual output per worker soared from seven vehicles in the 1980s to 38 by 2023 – an astonishing 500-per-cent-plus increase in productivity.

That's not the result of offshoring, but rather automation. The White House understands this but is putting politics before facts.

This raises an ominous question: Are the tariffs a short-term ploy to win better trade terms or a long-term strategy to repatriate industry, raise revenue and fund tax cuts? We fear the latter. If so, Mr. Trump's tariffs are a predatory, zero-sum policy. America can only “win” if other countries lose. That includes Canada, whose auto industry is caught in the crosshairs.

Our next federal government must make it clear that Canada will not surrender its auto industry. Industry executives are nervous and need assurances that Canada will not forfeit its share of North American auto production without a fight.

We must start with the “soft,” prototypically Canadian approach that is patient diplomacy. On its own, Canada is unable to inflict enough damage on the U.S. to pose a credible threat. We account for less than 2 per cent of new vehicle sales globally, which means the countertariffs imposed by Ottawa will have a minimal impact on the U.S. What's more, countertariffs hurt Canadian consumers and mirror the self-defeating logic of Mr. Trump's approach.

If Canada can offer Mr. Trump a few symbolic “wins,” like paying more into NATO, phasing out supply management and partnering on critical minerals – things we should be doing anyway – we might defuse the situation constructively.

There is a more muscular option in keeping with the Trump playbook, however, which we keep in our pocket but should not be afraid to use: escalation.

To be sure, there is danger in this more aggressive approach. Escalation can spiral out of control, as the tariff war between the U.S. and China has made clear. In teaching the White House about this law, Canada must diligently avoid having its response backfire. 

But in conflict situations, escalation is tactically useful because it pushes the parties toward resolution.

To that end, Canada should form strong alliances with Mexico, the U.K. and Europe, which are also frustrated with Washington's actions.

Part of the strategy targets American public opinion. GM and Ford don't assemble vehicles in Canada because America is “subsidizing” Canada, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed. They do so because it's efficient. Factoring in exchange rates, health insurance costs in the U.S. and productivity, Canada is more competitive than the U.S. If Mr. Trump succeeds in forcing production south, American consumers will be left with the most expensive cars ever built. Do Trump voters want to spend more on their next vehicle?

There's another card to play in this more aggressive plan. The North American auto industry is tightly integrated. If Canada and Mexico seal their borders, restricting the export of critical auto parts, U.S. assembly lines would be instantly crippled. This would yield two results: First, no imports would mean no tariff revenue from auto parts, so no money to fund Mr. Trump's tax cuts; second, the very workers who elected Mr. Trump will be laid off – something they didn't vote for.

Mr. Trump will have inspired a united attack on the U.S. economy, sending his tariff policy into disarray and alienating the very people who delivered the White House to him. This more aggressive approach has the benefit of tacit support from the auto industry, too, which does not want to cede managerial control over production decisions to the White House.

Standing on the balcony of the White House's Blue Room, flanked by the First Lady on one side and the Easter bunny on the other, Donald Trump declared: “Religion is coming back in America.”

The president made the announcement as he kicked off the annual Easter Egg roll, this year freighted with unexpected significance, falling on the day that Pope Francis was pronounced dead.

Mr Trump paid tribute to the pontiff, describing him as “a very good man who loved the world” and taking the opportunity to say he agreed with the late Pope's message of tolerance on migrants. He did not elaborate further.

While Christianity has always been a dominant force in US politics, Protestant Evangelicalism has long been the denomination favoured by Republicans.

But with the return of Mr Trump to the White House, and his stated ambition to bring about a new “golden age” in America, Catholicism appears to be the religion most prominent among Maga Republicans.

At least a third of his cabinet are Roman Catholic, with many of his top team and followers using their faith to justify the president's policy agenda.

“For some, it's really the choice to join the last vestige of the Roman Empire,” said Massimo Faggioli, professor of historical theology at Villanova University. “We need to save the West, that's why we become Catholic,” he added, explaining the thinking.

JD Vance converted in 2019, and is seen as a trailblazer in popularising the faith in the Republican political sphere. Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, who is of Cuban heritage, is also a practising Catholic.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt's Catholic faith is so intertwined with her work that she leads her team in prayer before every media briefing. Six of the nine US supreme court justices are members of the Catholic Church, too.

A number of high-profile Trump-backers have also converted to the faith in recent years, including Russell Brand, who was baptised in the Thames last year, and launched a Christian prayer app part-funded by Mr Vance. Tammy Peterson, the wife of Canadian psychologist and academic Jordan Peterson, also converted last Easter.

Candace Owens, the far-Right media personality, converted last year, as did pro-Trump comedian Rob Schneider.

Catholicism's resurgence can be seen at a grassroots level as well, with dioceses across America seeing the number of people converting this Easter jump by up to 70 per cent on previous years.

“You have many of these who come from the Protestant Church and become Catholic because they think that Catholicism is the only possible refuge against post-modernity and the secular world,” said Prof Faggioli.

However, the surge in conversions is not just a turn towards Catholicism, but a highly specific version of it: one described as “muscular Catholicism” that casts itself in opposition to the modernising approach of the Church in Rome and progressive US politics, and emphasises American strength as a core tenet of faith.

A study published by the Catholic Project at the Catholic University of America found almost all priests ordained in 2020 or later described themselves as moderate or conservative. This marks a stark contrast to the 50 per cent of priests ordained in the 1960s, who described themselves as politically liberal.

A conservative Catholic revival has been brewing for decades in the US in response to liberalising reforms to the Church in Rome, with tensions coming to a head during Joe Biden's presidency, when Catholic concerns about culture war issues mapped neatly onto Republican talking points.

The Democrats' wholescale embrace of progressive policies issues such as transgender ideology and abortion under the Biden-Harris administration sparked fury among conservatives.

Kamala Harris's support for such policies during her presidential campaign is also thought to have contributed to large numbers of mostly Catholic Hispanic Americans voting for Mr Trump in last year's election.

Mr Trump boosted his vote share among Latino Catholics from 31 percentage points in 2020 to 43 per cent, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.

Despite Mr Biden being a Catholic himself, and Mr Trump not, the Republicans effectively seized on the groundswell of Catholic opposition to Democrat policies, publicly courting non-establishment leaders, including many on the radical fringe.

A “Catholic Prayer for Trump” dinner in March last year charged $1,000 for the chance to break bread with the president and pray for America at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

The president also accused the Biden administration of persecuting Catholics, releasing “Make America Pray Again” merchandise and vowing to create a task force to “fight anti-Christian bias”, which launched this week.

Meanwhile, Ms Harris came under heavy criticism during the election campaign for failing to attend the annual Al Smith dinner, which raises money for Catholic charities.

Brad Vermurlen, Faculty fellow at the Nesti centre for faith and culture at the University of St Thomas, attributes the swing of Hispanic Catholic towards Mr Trump to voters “feeling burned” by a “consistent stream of anti-Catholic rhetoric coming from the Biden-Harris administration”.

“They got fed up with the rainbow flags hanging from the White House.”

Where John F Kennedy felt compelled to distance himself from the Roman Catholic Church in 1960, describing himself as “the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic”, the faith has become a badge of honour for Maga Republicans.

When Mr Vance converted, he described it as “join[ing] the resistance”, while Steve Bannon, another Catholic and host of the influential War Room podcast, has cast the vice-president as a St Paul figure, spreading the gospel of Trumpism.

The growing popularity of Catholicism in the US is particularly pronounced among young men, tapping into another reservoir of support for Mr Trump.

“Catholicism hasn't made concessions to the feminist movement in the sense of access to ordained ministry,” said Prof Faggioli.

“It has become identified with a certain kind of sexual morality, with natural law, and there's the whole sense that the tradition of the liturgy, going back over a thousand years of uninterrupted continuity.”

Unlike the Church in Rome under Pope Francis, who spoke out strongly in support of migrants, appointed women to high-ranking Vatican positions and struck a more conciliatory tone towards LGBTQ people, authorising blessings to same-sex couples, US Catholicism places a greater emphasis on conservatism.

“Clearly it is a different type of Catholicism compared to Roman Catholicism of the 20th century,” said Prof Faggioli, describing the movement as a backlash against the so-called Vatican II progressive reforms of the 1960s that aimed to make the Church more relevant and accessible to the modern world.

“The new Conservative movement is really a revanchist movement against all possible updates of the Catholic Church,” said Prof Faggioli, adding that this clash became “explosive” under Pope Francis.

His papacy galvanised an existing strain of traditionalism in the American Catholic church, with critics, including some clergy, accusing him of sowing confusion over fundamental church doctrines and haphazardly rushing through reform.

The late Pope clashed with a number of prominent US Catholic leaders, and in 2023 lamented the “backwardness” of some American conservatives, warning about how “ideologies replace faith”.

A few months before he died, Francis engaged in his final high-profile skirmish with his US flock in a letter to American bishops stating that deporting migrants violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families”.

“The challenge of a nationalist Catholicism is very old – it's the story of relations between Catholicism and the rise of the modern state or empire,” Prof Faggioli said.

“The United States is just a new unknown, because once you could count on the US. Now, you don't know what to expect.”

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Ukraine may be forced to temporarily give up some territories to Russia, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in an interview with BBC published on April 25, as U.S. pressure mounts for a peace deal with Moscow. 

"Right now (there are) a lot of conversations about a possible solution. One of the scenarios is... to give up territory. It's not fair. But for peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution. Temporary," Klitschko said in a released excerpt of the interview.

He added that Ukrainians would "never accept occupation" by Russia.

Klitschko's remarks come amid renewed diplomatic activity following a deadly Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv that killed 12 people and injured almost 90 on April 24. The strike took place just a day after the Kremlin reiterated its demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory and that the West end its military aid to Kyiv.

The Trump administration's latest proposal for ending Russia's all-out war against Ukraine reportedly includes U.S. de jure recognition of Moscow's control over Crimea, along with de facto recognition of its partial occupation of other Ukrainian regions — Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

Klitschko appears to be the first senior Ukrainian politician to suggest that Ukraine may need to consider temporary territorial compromises.

Earlier this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine has not received any official proposals for territorial concessions as part of potential peace talks with Russia from the U.S. or other partners. He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv won't recognize occupied territories as Russian.

Despite his popularity abroad, Klitschko faces criticism in Ukraine for his handling of the capital. The Kyiv mayor has had a long-standing conflict with Zelensky. He claims ongoing pressure from government authorities.

Asked whether Zelensky had talked to him about any possible war settlement details, the Kyiv mayor said, "No."

WASHINGTON, April 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is probably the only world leader who recognizes the need to address the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS in an interview.

In his words, Trump "is probably the only leader on Earth, who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation."

"He said it was a huge mistake to pull Ukraine into NATO, and this was a mistake by the Biden administration, and he wants to rectify this," the top Russian diplomat said.

Fragments of the interview were published on Thursday night. The full version will be aired on Sunday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly spoken in favor of settling the conflict in Ukraine, but only if Russia's interests are taken into account and if root causes of the Ukrainian crisis are fixed. The Russian leader is convinced that this is the only way to achieve a long and lasting peace, in which Moscow is interested.

An Idaho judge ruled on Thursday that Bryan Kohberger's autism spectrum disorder (ASD) does not warrant striking the death penalty as a potential consequence if he is convicted of murdering four University of Idaho students.

The 30-year-old is accused of killing Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin, who were found stabbed to death in an off-campus rental residence in Moscow, Idaho, in November 2022.

Oral argument on the motion was held April 9. The Court then took the matter under advisement until Thursday.

Prosecutors said they intend to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted at his trial, which is set to begin in August, while Kohberger's defense team argued that the death penalty would violate the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment.

The defense asked Hippler to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment, citing two states, Ohio and Kentucky, that recently enacted legislation barring people with serious mental illness from being sentenced to death.

Hippler acknowledged that there is growing societal sensitivity to mental disorders generally, and said that evidence of evolving standards of decency must come from legislative and executive actions.

“Two states protecting individuals with severe mental illness from execution is not a national consensus,” Hippler wrote in his order. “Further, these two state statutes only apply to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and delusional disorder, not ASD.”

In addition to lethal injection, Idaho allows firing squads for executions.

House Bill 37 was signed by Idaho Gov. Brad Little on March 12 and made firing squad the main method of execution starting July 1, 2026.

Kohberger's defense team also cited Atkins v. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court ruled that those with intellectual disabilities cannot be executed for a crime.

“While intellectually disabled and ASD individuals may share some of the same adaptive impairments, the intellectual deficit—an essential feature of an intellectual disability—is not a diagnostic element of ASD,” Hippler said in the order.

Kohberger was a Ph.D. criminology student at Washington State University's Pullman campus when he was arrested at his parents' house in Pennsylvania in December 2022 after investigators linked Kohberger to the alleged murders through DNA testing.

President Donald Trump is ordering a major overhaul to the process by which agencies evaluate probationary federal workers before they can gain full employment status and job protections.

Agencies must also use probationary and trial periods, usually within a year, to assess employees' fitness and alignment with agency needs before granting them full federal employment status.

Trump's order accuses agencies of previously failing to remove poor performers, and alleges they “often retained and [gave] tenure to underperforming employees who should have been screened out during their probationary period.”

“Moving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as ‘Schedule Policy/Career,' and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance,” he said.

Trump's efforts to reshape the federal workforce have been met with multiple lawsuits contesting the legality of his policies, including his decision to fire tens of thousands of probationary workers earlier this year.

At least 60 days before an employee's probationary period ends, agencies must meet with the worker to discuss performance and continued employment that meets the agency's needs and advances the “public interest,” the order states.

Additionally, within 30 days of the end of each employee's probationary or trial period, each agency head or a designated individual must determine whether the employee should be appointed to federal service or terminated.

Employees on probationary or trial periods also bear the “burden of demonstrating why their continuation in employment through ... their appointment to the Federal service is in the public interest,” the order states.

Trump's order takes effect immediately and directs the Office of Personnel Management to create new regulations and provide guidance to federal departments.

The director of that office may also define circumstances and procedures by which probationary or trial-period employees may appeal their terminations.

The Trump administration has terminated federal employees in charge of U.S. global climate policy and climate aid as part of its reorganization of the State Department, four sources familiar with the notification told Reuters.

The career employees in the Office of Global Change, which came under the State Department's Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, played a lead role in U.S. negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

Officials from the office also represented the United States at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and their respective shipping and commercial aviation sectors.

The dismissals come after President Donald Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, as well as from IMO negotiations over decarbonization measures to enable the global shipping industry to reach net-zero emissions by “around 2050″.

The United States belongs to the ICAO and had agreed to participate in the UN agency's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Trump administration, though, has recently objected to ICAO's move to boost sustainable aviation fuel.

It is not clear how or if the United States will continue to participate in these international agreements, or whether some office functions will be folded into other bureaus. The Trump administration has been aggressively rolling back existing U.S. climate policy and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The State Department did not respond to requests for comment.

There are also changes afoot at the State's Bureau of Energy Resources, according to internal documents and a separate source familiar with the situation.

When it opened during the administration of former President Barack Obama, the bureau helped gather support from allies and partners for sanctions on Iran's oil exports. In more recent years the bureau, which has about 80 staffers, has focused on developing critical minerals and oil and gas alternatives and weaning countries off of Russian fossil fuels.

Internal documents reviewed by Reuters said the Bureau of Energy Resources would be absorbed into the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs “to ensure a laserlike focus on expanding and exporting American energy.”

A source familiar with the situation said many staffers working on issues other than critical minerals expect to be laid off in coming days.

NEW YORK (AP) — Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty Friday to a federal murder charge in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson as prosecutors formally declared their intent to seek the death penalty and the judge warned the Justice Department to stop making public comments that could spoil the case.

Mangione, 26, stood with his lawyers as he entered the plea, leaning forward toward a microphone on the defense table as U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett asked him if understood the indictment, which charges him with stalking and shooting Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel last December.

Mangione said, “yes.” Asked how he wished to plead, he said simply, “not guilty” and sat down.

A cause célèbre for people upset with the health insurance industry, Mangione's arraignment attracted several dozen people to the Manhattan federal courthouse, including former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who served prison time for stealing classified diplomatic cables.

Mangione, held in a federal jail in Brooklyn since his arrest, arrived to court in a mustard-colored jail suit and chatted with one of his lawyers, death penalty counsel Avi Moskowitz, as they waited for the arraignment to begin.

Late Thursday night, federal prosecutors filed a required notice of their intent to seek the death penalty.

Because of the many legal issues involved in capital cases, Mangione's case will move much slower that non-death penalty prosecutions. He is due back in federal court on Dec. 5, a day after the one-year anniversary of Thompson's death. No trial date has been set in either the federal or his parallel state murder case.




That came weeks after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that she would be directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for what she called “an act of political violence” and a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.”

It was the first time the Justice Department said it was pursuing capital punishment since President Donald Trump returned to office Jan. 20 with a vow to resume federal executions after they were halted under the previous administration.

Mangione's lawyers argue that Bondi's announcement — which she followed with posts on Instagram account and a TV appearance — was a “political stunt” that violated long-established Justice Department protocols, corrupted the grand jury process and deprived him of his constitutional right to due process.

After Mangione's lawyers raised the issue again on Friday, Garnett instructed Manhattan federal prosecutors to convey to Bondi and other Justice Department officials that court rules prohibit any pretrial publicity that could interfere with a defendant's right to a fair trial.

Mangione's federal indictment includes a charge of murder through use of a firearm, which carries the possibility of the death penalty. The indictment, which mirrors a criminal complaint brought after Mangione's arrest also charges him with stalking and a gun offense.

Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family, faces separate federal and state murder charges after authorities say he gunned down Thompson, 50, outside the New York Hilton Midtown on Dec. 4 as the executive arrived for UnitedHealthcare's annual investor conference. 

The state murder charges carry a maximum punishment of life in prison.

Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.

The killing and ensuing five-day search leading to Mangione's arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers deleting photos of executives from their websites and switching to online shareholder meetings. At the same time, some health insurance critics have rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. 

Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state case expected to go to trial first, but Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo said his defense team would seek to have the federal case take precedent because it involves the death penalty.

Mangione was arrested Dec. 9 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City and whisked to Manhattan by plane and helicopter.

Police said Mangione had a 9mm handgun that matched the one used in the shooting and other items including a notebook in which they say he expressed hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives.

Among the entries, prosecutors said, was one from August 2024 that said “the target is insurance” because “it checks every box” and one from October that describes an intent to “wack” an insurance company CEO. UnitedHealthcare, the largest U.S. health insurer, has said Mangione was never a client.

Newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has defiantly rejected any notion that Canada will become America's 51st state blasting the idea as "crazy." (Credit: AP)

President Donald Trump isn't "trolling" when it comes to efforts to acquire Greenland and make Canada the 51st state. 

Trump has discussed acquiring Greenland, Canada and Panama for months — and has regularly referred to Canada as the 51st U.S. state. Despite skepticism from some, Trump said in an interview with Tine magazine published Friday that he is serious about these proposals. 

When asked by Time's Eric Cortellessa whether Trump was "trolling a bit" in suggesting Canada join the U.S., Trump replied, "Actually, no, I'm not."

Cortellessa then asked whether Trump intended to "grow the American empire," prompting Trump to double down on the significance of acquiring these key pieces of territory. 

"Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity," Trump said. "Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security."

Trump also claimed that the U.S. is "losing" money supporting Canada, and that the only solution on the table is for it to become a state. 

"We're taking care of their military," Trump said. "We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state."

TRUMP REMAINS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ODDS OF ACQUIRING GREENLAND: ‘I THINK IT'LL HAPPEN'

The Time piece was published a day after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters that Trump routinely discusses Canada becoming a state, claiming that Trump brings it up "all the time." Carney has previously shut down any notions that Canada will become a U.S. state. 

Meanwhile, Trump has emphasized that Greenland is key for national security purposes. While the Danish territory has said it is seeking independence from Copenhagen but isn't inclined to join the U.S., Trump has voiced a strong desire to secure Greenland amid increase Russian and Chinese presence in the Arctic.

"If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and Russian ships all over the place, and we're not going to be able to do that," Trump told reporters in March. "We're not relying on Denmark or anybody to take care of that situation. And we're not talking about peace for the United States, we're talking about world peace, we're talking about international security."

            The Trump administration is backing down from a multi-state legal fight over sweeping actions taken by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement that potentially terminated the immigration status of thousands of international students studying in the United States.
    


            The dramatic shift was announced in court proceedings across the country Friday and follows a flurry of legal action filed by students who said their legal status was being cancelled without explanation.
    


            Department of Justice attorneys told the court immigration officials are working to create a new system to review and terminate the records for international students, known as SEVIS, that are connected to their immigration status. A statement read aloud in court and provided to the students' attorneys said that “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations.” Additionally, officials said they will not base cancellations solely on whether a student comes up in a search of the National Crime Information Center.
    


            In the meantime, officials said they would stop issuing new revocations based on those searches until the process was completed.
    


            During a hearing Friday, a Justice Department attorney said ICE was in the process of reinstating the records of all the students who had been terminated in that process, not just those who had filed lawsuits.
    


            In dozens of cases across the country, international students have sued the administration over ICE's effort to cancel their immigration records in the SEVIS database.
    


            The database, which is operated by the Department of Homeland Security, tracks the immigration status of international students and is used by universities to maintain information about the students' enrollment.
    


            The SEVIS revocations occurred alongside visa cancellations for many students, putting them ultimately at risk for deportation, multiple attorneys representing students have said in court documents. The DOJ continues to claim that SEVIS changes did not cause visa terminations.
    


 The Trump administration began to cancel visas and launched deportation proceedings in March, which initially targeted students who participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses last year.
    


            The blitz of enforcement caused panic and fear among international students, resulted in some detentions and at least two self-deportations. Weeks later, immigration officials began revoking students' immigration statuses over minor legal infractions and in some cases without any apparent explanation.
    


            Several federal judges have halted some of the revocations and issued restraining orders to make sure that students are not removed from the country.
    


            The cases revealed that ICE was justifying the records terminations by arguing that the students had an alleged “criminal history,” including students who were arrested and never charged, or who had their charges dismissed.
    


            While the restoration of student statuses is likely to calm fears among thousands of international students who worried the revocation of their status would put them at risk for deportation it does not appear to impact other international students whose visas were revoked, including Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University student who was arrested near her home in Massachusetts, and Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and legal permanent resident who was arrested near his home on campus after being accused of engaging in activities in support of Hamas.
    


            In recent weeks, ICE appeared to cancel students' SEVIS statuses for minor legal infractions including drunk driving and traffic violations, according to multiple lawsuits filed to stop the cancellations, with some students seeing records cancelled even if they had never been convicted of a crime. Students like Dartmouth University graduate researcher Xiaotian Liu, a Chinese national who is studying computer science and has been in the United States since 2016. Liu's status was changed without notice earlier this month despite him never having committed a crime or a traffic violation, according to his attorney. A judge recently issued a restraining order to prevent any government action on  Liu.
    


            The vast majority of students who have had their visas and statuses revoked have not been detained or deported, but they have said the status revocation prevents them from continuing their coursework and to work at their campus-related jobs, which in turn threatens their immigration status.
    


            Foreign students, who typically hold an F-1 visa, are required to meet specific criteria to maintain their status including full-time course work and no outside employment.
    


            Some 4,700 students saw their records abruptly changed as part of the administration's gambit, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
    


            “ICE is now officially pulling back from its disastrous and harmful actions that terminated the status of nearly 5,000 students with visas but only after AILA members and others filed dozens of lawsuits,” Gregory Chen, AILA's senior director of government relations, said in a statement. “While ICE pulling back on its massive mistake now gives some relief to thousands of people, there are still long-term harms that continue to hurt these students and their families as well as American universities, research institutions and businesses. “
    


            While the administration is arguing that its reinstatement of the records should defuse the quick-moving court fights over the SEVIS terminations, at least one judge on Friday continued to probe the administration's actions.
    


            Senior District Judge Jeffrey White, who sits in San Francisco, is requesting that the administration submit additional information about the new statement. He also grilled the DOJ attorneys on several questions he had asked them to prepare for ahead of the hearing.
    


            Attorneys for the students, meanwhile, argued that ICE's announcement did not address all the issues that had arisen because of the records' termination.
    


            One of those attorneys, John Sinodis called the new ICE statement “woefully inadequate” as he asked what it would mean for students who left the country because their records had been terminated. Would they be given a new visa to reenter, he asked. Will ICE arrest and detain those whose visas were revoked?
    


            The judge himself seemed skeptical that the issues before him had been fully resolved, pushing back when a DOJ attorney urged him to consider that there was a “new world order” with Friday's announcement.
    


            “It seems like, from this administration, there's a new world order every single day,” Judge White said.

Walter T. Blanks Jr. joins 'Fox & Friends' to detail how Ohio's EdChoice program helped him obtain a college degree.

A new study revealed the drastic benefits Ohio's school choice voucher program provided for students, specifically helping minorities, low-income families, males and struggling learners thrive in the classroom. 

American Federation for Children spokesperson Walter T. Blanks Jr., a beneficiary of the program, was two grades behind in school when his mother decided to take action. He revealed how the scholarship she found saved his life and turned his academic trajectory around during "Fox & Friends."

"It was really hard growing up. I was in an educational environment that just simply did not work for me," Blanks Jr. told Ainsley Earhardt on Friday. 

"I was severely bullied, and the principal told my mom, 'If you just give us five years we'll have the middle school turned around and the high school turned around,' and my mom said, ‘In five years Walter will either be in jail or in a body bag,' and so she found out about the EdChoice Scholarship Program, and it changed my life."

"It saved my life, and now I have the opportunity to continue that fight for other students."

The Urban Institute released a study this week indicating Ohio's Educational Choice Scholarship (EdChoice) Program boosted long-term academic outcomes for beneficiaries in terms of college enrollment and graduation rates. 

The college enrollment rate among Black scholarship recipients surged 18%. The study also found that beneficiaries were more likely to enroll in college and earn a bachelor's degree than public school counterparts.

The data also indicated that the college enrollment rate was 16% higher for scholarship recipients than for public school students and the college graduation rate was 8% higher. 

Banks Jr., who previously attended a school that was deemed failing by state standards, received a scholarship to a private Christian school, and that was ultimately the catalyst that allowed him to turn his life around. 

"It wasn't just the academics. It was a school that taught me to be a man of character, a man of great integrity," he said. "Not only was I getting the academic portion, but also the moral side of things. And so my parents trusted that when I went to this school that I would be raised in the right way, become a man integrity, which I have."

"It was a massive blessing, not just for my family, but for countless families out there in the state of Ohio," he continued. "This report is very, very clear. School choice is working."

Banks Jr. went on to continue his academic career by receiving a bachelor's degree in journalism and media production from Mount Vernon Nazarene University. 

He reiterated the need for school choice across the nation to give other kids the same opportunity he had to thrive in the classroom.

"At the federal level, President Trump is a massive supporter of school choice across the country, which is why he supports the Educational Choice for Children Act, because every single family should have the option to be in the best educational environment that works for them and their family," Blanks Jr. said. "Children can no longer wait."

Former President Joe Biden, the nation's second Catholic president, will attend Pope Francis‘s funeral this weekend in Rome.

“President Biden and Dr. Biden will attend Pope Francis's funeral,” a Biden spokesperson confirmed to the Washington Examiner.

Biden did not attend the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2023, which occurred during his presidency. Benedict served as pope from 2005 through 2013, when he took the unusual step of becoming pope emeritus at 85.

Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush will not attend the funeral.

Bush spokesman Freddy Ford said the 43rd president “did not have the privilege of knowing Pope Francis” and therefore was unlikely to attend. During his presidency, Bush attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.

Obama will also not attend, though he and his wife, Michelle Obama, released a statement in honor of the pope.

“Pope Francis was the rare leader who made us want to be better people,” the Obamas said. “In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound — embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners — he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another.”

It is unclear whether former President Bill Clinton will attend, and his office didn't respond to a request for comment. The former Democratic president released a statement saying Francis “made it clear that he would endeavor to embrace the entire world, including those of other faiths, those whom the church hadn't always welcomed, and anyone whose daily struggles reflected the enduring truth of our common humanity.”

President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that he will attend the funeral, which will be held Saturday in Rome at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern), six days after the pope's death.

“Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We look forward to being there!”

Biden and Trump were last seen together in public on Jan. 20 during Trump's inauguration.

Trump's presence has invited speculation on whether he will meet with European leaders during the trip, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hoping to speak with him in person. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal was at the White House Wednesday, the Washington Examiner reported.

Vance calls it a ‘blessing' to visit Pope Francis shortly before death

Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, will not attend the funeral, a spokesman confirmed. Vance visited Francis on Easter Sunday, less than 24 hours before his death, during a seven-day trip to Europe and India that included the vice president's entire nuclear family.

On Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced that his deputy, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), will lead a bipartisan delegation of 10 House lawmakers to the funeral, a list that includes former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

Canary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.

by  Zack Beauchamp

About nine years ago, a new organization called Canary Mission released a YouTube video describing their mission: maintaining a blacklist of anti-Israel college students.

American campuses, the video warns, had become hotbeds of anti-Israel extremism: safe spaces for students to attend “Jew-hating conferences and anti-American rallies.” To fight this, Canary Mission would build an extensive database of students and professors who engaged in anti-Israel activity. The primary intent, per the video, is to ensure that anti-Israel students cannot find gainful employment after graduation.

“These individuals are applying for jobs within your company,” the Canary Mission video warns. “It is your duty to ensure that today's radicals are not tomorrow's employees.”

Over the course of the next decade, Canary Mission — which takes its name from the expression “canary in the coal mine” — delivered on its promise. 

Its database now contains mini-profiles of thousands of students and professors, and has expanded to include professionals like doctors and nurses. People listed in the database have been harassed, disciplined, and even fired. Israeli intelligence has used Canary Mission profiles as justification for detaining listed visitors at the border.

And since the second Trump administration began, Canary Mission's targets have started to be deported from the United States.

After plainclothes officers arrested Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk on the streets of Boston in late March, Öztürk's attorneys claimed the sole reason for her arrest was her Canary Mission profile. While the Trump administration claims she had engaged in activity “in support of Hamas,” the private Homeland Security memo justifying her detention only cited an op-ed she had written in support of boycotting Israel, using language very similar to her Canary Mission page. 

The organization, for its part, is happy to take the credit (though it did not respond to my request for comment). After Öztürk's arrest, Canary Mission's X account posted a celebratory tweet claiming “sources point to her Canary Mission profile as the primary cause.” It currently maintains a list of seven other students and professors who it believes should be targeted for deportation. Two of these, Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, are currently in ICE custody. Mahdawi was arrested after his name appeared on this list (Khalil was arrested before it was published).

Canary Mission's rise is not really a story about one organization, or even the toxic climate of America's Israel-Palestine debate. Rather, it is a case study in how civil society organizations — normally seen as pillars of liberal democratic life — can become agents of illiberalism. And when such groups can align themselves with a friendly government, the danger rises exponentially.

There are many pro-Israel activist in groups in the United States, and many that focus on college campuses specifically. But Canary Mission is unusual in two respects: its opaque structure and extremely aggressive tactics.

Canary Mission's website does not list a president, board, or a staff directory. On paper, its headquarters are in Israel — specifically Beit Shemesh, a medium-sized city near Jerusalem. Yet the address listed on its paperwork is in a padlocked, seemingly abandoned building.

Over the years, reporters have identified some of the Canary Mission's revenue streams — including significant donations from some prominent American Jewish philanthropies. But much of the Canary Mission's funding remains anonymous due to its use of a pass-through group, called Central Fund of Israel (CFI). 

Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them.

American donors can give to CFI without having to disclose whether the money is earmarked for Canary Mission, and CFI can disburse funds to Canary without noting their original source. It's an unusual setup that effectively allows Canary Mission to keep its funding sources fully anonymous.

“It really stands out when you look at other similar organizations in the same ecosystem,” says Yousef Munayyer, the head of the Israel-Palestine program at the Arab Center think tank in DC. “I can't think of another one that hides their funding like this.”

The obvious irony — that an organization dedicated to naming and shaming is itself so opaque — is palpable. But it is necessary, in part, because Canary Mission has been a lightning rod for controversy even within the pro-Israel community.

No matter what you think about pro-Israel groups' views of American college campuses, they clearly have the right to express their views and organize around them. And many of these groups engage in political activity — like documenting Jewish students' concerns about campus antisemitism or creating new right-leaning Middle East studies journals — that are within the confines of legitimate debate and activism in a democratic society.

But Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. 

Lila Corwin Berman, a historian of Jewish philanthropy at New York University, dates this approach to roughly the early 2000s. During that time, pro-Israel organizations like Campus Watch and the David Project began publicly targeting professors and students that they believed had engaged in unacceptable speech. 

These efforts were haphazard at the outset, publishing specific attacks on allegedly problematic scholars rather than maintaining a full-on blacklist. Canary Mission's database, first unveiled in 2014, represented a qualitative escalation — one explicitly aimed at creating professional problems for anti-Israel activists.

This was highly controversial. In 2018, pro-Israel campus groups at five major universities published a joint op-ed calling on the movement to repudiate Canary Mission.

“We are compelled to speak out against this website because it uses intimidation tactics, is antithetical to our democratic and Jewish values, is counterproductive to our efforts and is morally reprehensible,” they wrote.

This internal criticism did not do much to stop the Canary Mission's growth, fueled as it was by unaccountable backers. Today, Canary Mission's searchable database is vast — containing entries for over 2,000 individuals across 38 states, DC, and five Canadian provinces. 

To understand why Canary Mission is so controversial, start by looking at how its blacklist works.

Each individual listing contains both a dossier documenting the target's alleged offenses and their contact information, including direct links to their social media accounts that can facilitate targeted harassment campaigns. The only official way to get an entry deleted is to release a public apology with evidence of new pro-Israel beliefs; these testimonials are then posted on the “ex-Canary” segment of the Mission's website.

Some Canary Mission targets have said or done something that many would find offensive, such as endorsing the October 7, 2023, massacre. But the vast majority of profiles I could find were individuals who either attended a pro-Palestinian rally or wrote something critical about Israel's policies towards the Palestinians.

Canary Mission will describe this banal activity in threatening terms, like “attending a pro-Hamas rally.” But the speech in question is more than just legally protected: It is exactly the sort of political activity that people in a democracy are supposed to use as a vehicle for expressing their opinion. The Mission's database isn't primarily about identifying examples of extreme anti-Israel speech or political violence — it is about trying to silence any criticism of Israel by labeling it antisemitic or pro-terrorist.

Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student facing deportation, is a case in point.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

The Canary Mission profile that reportedly led to her ICE arrest listed a single offense — an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper calling on the university to (among other things) “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide” and “divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.” Agree or disagree with these positions, advocating for them is clearly legitimate political speech. There is no plausible case that people like Öztürk constitute any kind of threat to Jews on campus. That she is listed by Canary Mission — and that the organization publicly cheered her arrest — reveals its primary interest in policing speech critical of Israel by any means necessary.

This can also be seen by the sheer number of Jewish students and professors on the Canary Mission's database.

The American Jewish community is fairly left-wing; roughly two-thirds disapprove of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government. While a strong majority supports Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, large numbers of American Jews believe its occupation of Palestinian territory is both strategically unwise and morally indefensible. There is also a minority of anti-Zionist American Jews, more prominent in younger generations, who support the dissolution of Israel and its replacement with a binational state.

If you scan the Canary Mission database, Jewish students and scholars make up many of the entries. Reading their dossiers, like the profile of eminent Holocaust historian Omer Bartov, their alleged offenses include everything from criticizing the Netanyahu government's approach to judicial reform to attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration.

If Canary Mission were truly about protecting Jews' rights to participate freely in campus life, then it wouldn't include them on a database explicitly designed to hurt their career prospects.

We don't know for a fact that the Trump administration is using Canary Mission's database to identify deportation targets. There is suggestive evidence: The wording in the State Department memo justifying Öztürk's deportation, for example, is very similar to what appeared on her Canary profile). But so far, there is no direct proof of a link.

The depressing thing is that it makes all the sense in the world.

Yet regardless of whether Canary Mission entries are currently directing policy, it's clear they wish to be seen as doing so. They do this not only by maintaining their list of seven people they wish were deported, but also posting messages in support for actual deportations with slogans like “pro-Hamas extremism has consequences” and “no more safe havens for terror supporters.”

These messages demonstrate an undeniable hostility to basic liberal values. Canary Mission has graduated from “merely” advocating professional consequences for pro-Palestinian voices to endorsing outright state repression against them. They are sliding down a slippery slope at a rapid clip.

The depressing thing is that it makes all the sense in the world. 

The idea of trying to silence political opponents rather than debate them is dangerous. There are certainly cases where speech merits consequences: If a professor says discriminatory things about Jewish students, for example, or an activist advocates violence against her peers. But these are generally seen as exceptions rather than rules in free societies: the “boundary cases” where toleration for political expression runs up against other important values.

Canary Mission was founded on the opposite principle: that an entire category of speech, pro-Palestinian advocacy, should be treated as presumptively illegitimate. They believe the cause of defending Israel is best served not by engaging in rigorous debate and advocacy, but by making a giant list of people who believe the “wrong” things and ensuring they suffer consequences for those beliefs. 

This is illiberalism as practiced by civil society — and is, necessarily, less dangerous than illiberalism enforced by the state. But when illiberalism takes root in an influential sector of society, such as pro-Israel activism, it becomes a potential ally for an illiberal regime. 

No elected leader can turn a democracy into an authoritarian regime on their own. They need partners, influential people and organizations that can operate to weaken resistance to democratic backsliding and help create a climate of fear in which anti-government activity is perceived as costly.

The go-to examples are usually people with physical power and money — generals, police chiefs, and the wealthy elite. But there's a growing recognition that other social groups, even ones that seemingly lack soldiers or billions, can assist in undermining democracy's foundations.

In 2001, the political theorists Simone Chambers and Jeffrey Kopstein warned of a phenomenon they termed “bad civil society.” This is a phenomenon that they describe as “civic participation that weakens liberal democracy” — weaponizing the tools of organizing and activism to oppose the very democratic principles that allow them in the first place. 

At the time, it appeared that “illiberal forces are small, marginalized, and contained” in the United States. However, Chambers and Kopstein warned, this doesn't mean they'll always be irrelevant. 

Even if “illiberal forces cannot destabilize the state,” the authors write, “they can still “contribute to an insidious erosion of values that leaves liberalism vulnerable to all sorts of threat.”

Canary Mission's behavior in the past 10 years shows that this warning was prescient. The organization isn't just cheering Trump on from the sidelines; they have put together a public list of potential deportation targets. They are gleefully reveling in the fact that their longtime mission of suppressing speech is now backed by force of law.

            The Trump administration is considering eliminating the 988 Suicide Prevention and Crisis Lifeline's specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth as a way to cut back on funding for next year's discretionary budget for mental health, according to an internal document reviewed by CNN.
    


            The preliminary memo, dated April 10, previews the administration's possible plans to slash discretionary federal health spending and rework health agencies as President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. consolidate many functions of the US Department of Health and Human Services into the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA.

            If the leaked budget draft is enacted, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's LGBTQ+ youth specialized services could be defunded beginning in October, according to the nonprofit The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ+ youth that has been a subcontractor to the specialized service since 2022, serving as one of seven call centers within the subnetwork that provides specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth.
    


            The White House Office of Management and Budget did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            In October 2020, Trump signed a bipartisan bill making 988 the universal telephone number to reach the national suicide prevention hotline.
    


            In July 2022, the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched under the Biden administration, transitioning what was a 10-digit number to an easier-to-remember three-digit number. People seeking emotional and mental health support can dial 988 for help in the same way they might dial 911 for medical emergencies.
    


            Soon after its launch, the 988 Lifeline included a subnetwork for LGBTQ+ individuals to connect with specialized services. Now, when people dial 988, they are given the option to press 3 to reach crisis counselors trained to work with LGBTQ+ youth.
    


            There have been some discussions within the Trump administration around ending the 988 Lifeline's LGBTQ+ subnetwork, according to a person in HHS who has worked closely with the 988 Lifeline team and who asked for anonymity because they were recently given a Reduction in Force notice but hope to keep their job.
    


            “From what I gathered, and just talking to others, these decisions are made without input from anyone involved with the 988 team or project,” the source said, adding that if leadership on the 988 team was consulted, they probably would recommend against removing the LGBTQ+ subnetwork.
    


            “Suicide rates are four times higher among LGBTQ youth than others,” the person said. “There is data to show that rates of suicide among the LGBTQ community are higher, which is why there is a dedicated number to press if you are from that community, because there is such a critical need.”

            As of mid-March, more than 14.5 million people have called, texted or sent chats to the 988 Lifeline and been transferred to a crisis contact center since July 2022, according to data from the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 1.2 million of those were routed to the LGBTQ+ specialized service.
    


            “Suicide prevention is about risk, not identity. Ending the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's LGBTQ+ youth specialized services will not just strip away access from millions of LGBTQ+ kids and teens – it will put their lives at risk,” Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, said in a news release.
    


            “These programs were implemented to address a proven, unprecedented, and ongoing mental health crisis among our nation's young people with strong bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by President Trump himself,” he said. “We urge the Administration to maintain its long-standing commitment to ending suicide among high-risk populations, especially our nation's young people.”
    


            Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, who served as HHS's assistant secretary for mental health and substance use in the Biden administration, said she worries about how the agency's restructuring may affect 988 as a public health resource as well as other services and programs that fall under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
    


            “There's been some discussion and questions about whether the LGBTQ+ line will remain, and so I am concerned about that part of 988,” she said. She's also concerned about the 988 Veterans sub-lifeline, which is accessed by dialing 988 and pressing 1, and the Spanish subnetwork, which is accessed by dialing 988 and pressing 2.

            Since 2022, the federal government has invested some $1.5 billion in the 988 project, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing by creating sub-lifelines or subnetworks for those groups.
    


            Delphin-Rittmon said she worries about how certain staffing and funding support for 988 could shift or be eliminated under the HHS restructuring.
    


            The leaked memo notes that the budget would maintain the $10 million for specialized services for Spanish speakers seeking access to 988 services and eliminate the set-aside for specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth.
    


            According to the document, the budget does not include funding for the LGB Center of Excellence, the African American Behavioral Health Center of Excellence, the Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Behavioral Health Center of Excellence, the Hispanic/Latino Behavioral Health Center of Excellence and the LGBTQ Youth Family Support Program.
    


            “I'm concerned about SAMHSA overall,” Delphin-Rittmon said. “Certainly, there have been a lot of questions.”

Swole of body, swole of mind.

by  Dylan Scott

Creatine — yes, the favorite of gym rats everywhere, a supplement many of us have taken ourselves — is a naturally occurring compound that is already found inside each person. Scientists have been studying creatine since the 1830s and, for more than a century, we have known that it was pivotal for producing energy in our muscles. 

That, as anybody who was alive in the '90s may remember, is how creatine first exploded as a consumer product. Swedish researchers published influential research in 1992 demonstrating creatine supplementation's effectiveness in improving stamina and recovery during the short bursts of physical exercise. It didn't take long after that for creatine supplements to hit the shelves of drugstores and workout gyms nationwide. And it was popular. Not only was it cheap — a 10-ounce jar of creatine costs $17 on Amazon — but it was also an easy way for bodybuilders and exercise enthusiasts to improve their performance. Today, as many as one in four adults say they have used creatine; $400 million worth of it is sold in the US every year.

And this was a supplement that really worked: A 2018 meta-analysis of the available research concluded that creatine is “the most effective nutritional supplement available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.” Across years of studies, no dangerous side effects have been detected. 

But the most surprising use of creatine supplements is in a setting that could not be further from the image of jacked-up bodybuilders pumping iron: treating depression.

In the early 2000s, scientists established creatine's importance not only for muscle use but also for brain function. The compound helps your brain to convert nutrients into energy and scientists concluded that poor metabolism could help to explain various psychiatric disorders, including depression. In layman's terms, if your brain wasn't processing energy efficiently, it could have these negative side effects. 

If that were true, it would follow that more creatine could improve a person's brain metabolism and thereby ease their depression. 

A decade ago, the first clinical trials began testing whether creatine supplements improved depression among people who were also receiving antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. The results have been impressive: A 2024 meta-review concluded that creatine had proven its effectiveness in supplementing those other treatments, leading people to feel better more quickly and be less likely to experience depression again.

Now comes a new study, out of India, suggesting creatine could be helpful in treating depression without antidepressants being involved — a preliminary but potentially important finding as we search for cheaper and easier ways to provide help to more people who need it.

The study, published earlier this year, was tiny and flew under the radar: 100 participants, in Dehradun, a city of 800,000 in India's far north. Lead researcher Nima Norbu Sherpa of Glasgow Caledonian University received a grant from an India-based charity, the Universal Human Rights and Social Development Association, to run the experiment.

The setting is telling: Part of creatine's appeal in mental health treatment is not only its potential efficacy but also that it's cheap and doesn't require a professional clinician; patients can take it on their own. That made Dehradun, a developing city with a lot of low-income patients and relatively few mental health clinicians, a logical place to test whether creatine could improve people's well-being without antidepressants, said Riccardo De Giorgi, a clinical lecturer in psychiatry at Oxford and co-author of the paper.

The 100 participants, recruited from the city and small surrounding villages, were split into two groups. Both groups took part in talk therapy sessions. One group also received 5 milligrams of creatine every day, while the other got a placebo.

After eight weeks, both groups were improving — cognitive behavioral therapy itself is, of course, a well-attested treatment for depression. But the patients who took creatine on top of their therapy were doing better still.

The participants answered a nine-question survey at the beginning of the study, which provided a one-number score of the severity of their depression symptoms. People in both groups started a little below 18 on average, indicating moderately severe depression. At the end of the study, the patients taking creatine reported a score of 5 on average, while the control group registered at 11. Eleven people who were taking creatine throughout the study reported going into remission, meaning they could effectively return to normal life; only five people taking placebos said the same. 

Both groups had about 20 people discontinue their treatment — not uncommon for people with depression, the authors noted. The reported side effects for people taking creatine were mild.

It is an eye-catching result, even as De Giorgi emphasized repeatedly that the findings were “incremental and preliminary.” The inevitably sensational nature of the finding — a bodybuilder supplement can help with depression? — warrants being clear and cautious in how we interpret the findings.

“Previous sensationalist messages in this research area, e.g., creatine, physical exercise, keto diet, have caused more harm to the science than benefit,'” De Giorgi told me over email.

For one, the high dropout rate is reason for skepticism about the precise size of creatine's effect. More research that replicates the same results is needed before we can be confident that creatine plus therapy is a winning combination.

But it's an area of research worth watching. Peter Attia, a physician who writes about longevity and health enhancement and was not involved with the study, wrote in covering the study's findings that “since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes.” Its affordability and ubiquity could also make it appealing for people with fewer resources, like those who participated in the India study.

He did, however, also caution that more evidence would be necessary before we can figure out whether and how creatine fits into “the therapeutic toolbox.”

As we grapple with a global mental health crisis, we need all of the tools we can find. More than two-thirds of the world's population can't get access to conventional mental health treatments. If we really have an alternative as cheap and available as creatine, it could make a real difference.

These days, customers who visit a restaurant to pick up a carryout order, or even a fast-food drive-thru, may be greeted by a prompt on the screen asking how much they'd like to tip.

In some cases, it's just a kiosk making the request, but other times the cashier might be waiting for the customer's response.

"It usually catches me off-guard," Chris Nordstrom, a commercial real estate executive in Kansas City, Missouri, told Fox News Digital.

"It's not that I mind tipping in the right context," he said. "It's just that fast food, by nature, has traditionally been a non-tipping experience."

Just 12% of U.S. adults tip when eating at a "fast casual restaurant," according to a Pew Research Center survey.

About 77% said the quality of the service they receive is a "major factor" in deciding whether to tip and how much.

"I don't tip if I pay before I eat," wrote one person on Reddit.

"Unless they make less than minimum wage, no need to tip."

Another user wrote that if there's a tip option at a fast-food restaurant, "it should be an instant zero … unless they make less than minimum wage, no need to tip."

Most fast-food restaurants are required to pay the federal minimum wage, and some states have an even higher minimum wage.

Tipped restaurant employees also earn at least their state's minimum wage, according to the National Restaurant Association.

"More often than not, I don't tip at fast-food places unless the staff has gone above and beyond – or if it's a locally-owned spot that I want to support," Nordstrom said. "Tipping is tied to service – not just the act of handing over an order that was pre-prepared."

"Tipping is tied to service – not just the act of handing over an order that was pre-prepared," one customer said. (iStock)

But people who work in the service or retail industry may have a different perspective.

"If the option comes up, I'm always happy to tip," Blair Dubinsky, a client advisor at a luxury-brand retail store in New York City, told Fox News Digital. "Working with the public isn't easy, and if that's the way I can thank them, I don't mind doing it."

DO YOU SPEND MORE AT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS THAN YOU WANT TO? CONSIDER THIS

The custom of tipping is strictly American, according to Sarah Aynesworth, a Texas-based etiquette consultant who trained at the Protocol School of Washington. 

"'TIP' is an acronym for 'to insure promptness,' which began during Prohibition," she told Fox News Digital. "People would get their alcohol delivered faster if they gave a little bit of extra money."

Blair Dubinksy, a client advisor at a luxury-brand retail store in New York City, said she's always happy to tip.  (Blair Dubinsky)

Aynesworth said she does not always tip the customary 20% when dining at a casual or fast-food restaurant.

"That's really for more of a seated, served meal, where someone is refilling your water and giving you an experience," she said. "At a fast-food restaurant, you're paying for fast food."

FAST-FOOD MENU ITEMS THAT CHEFS LIKE TO EAT

For those who do decide to tip, pay attention to the numbers on the screen before tapping, said Aynesworth. 

"Sometimes they are prompting you to pay even more than a normal percentage," she said.

If asked to leave a tip, it's important to pay attention to the percentages, an etiquette expert advised. (iStock)

Nordstrom said he has noticed auto-tip options creeping higher, sometimes starting at 25%.

"When I'm being prompted to tip for things like grabbing a water, it seems a bit excessive, especially when the cashier is staring at you," he said. "It feels as if the social guilt aspect has overtaken the spirit of tipping."

Dubinsky said she often tips fast-food workers – not out of obligation, but simply as a courtesy.

"I don't think people should necessarily feel like they need to tip at a fast-food restaurant … however, people put in the effort to take the order and make the food, so I think it's very polite to tip."

If picking up takeout food and there's an option to tip, she said she will usually leave one, but not if picking up food from a window, "because I'm not interacting with anyone."

"If tipping becomes an expectation everywhere … then its meaning as a reward for above-and-beyond hospitality is lost."

Nordstrom said he believes it should not always be expected.

"If tipping becomes an expectation everywhere, regardless of the level of service, then its meaning as a reward for above-and-beyond hospitality is lost — and it becomes more of an additional tax."

            The National Institutes of Health's sweeping cuts of grants that fund scientific research are inflicting pain almost universally across the U.S., including in most states that backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
    


            A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.

Uncertainty around NIH funding leaves Alzheimer's studies in limbo



            The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation's foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas.
    


            The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump's executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025's “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump's second term.
    


            Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
    


            KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
    


            Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
    


            Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
    


            “We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn't make sense to us.”

NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
    


            Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            “It's science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don't think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
    


            HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn't respond to requests for comment.
    


            “As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it's important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
    


            The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
    


            Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation's public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.

            Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH's roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH's website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
    


            Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I'm gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We're going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,'” according to NBC News.
    


            For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
    


            KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
    


            Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
    


            For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network's funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
    


            “This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don't have access to something that men have.”
    


            Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.

            “It's important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
    


            He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
    


            They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That's when he got the notice from the NIH.
    


            “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
    


            Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
    


            Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren't immune to the NIH's terminations.
    


            Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn't receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children's vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
    


            Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
    


            “States like Montana don't get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we're able to do.”
    


            Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH's Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
    


            The NIH's grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
    


            The NIH's research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant's money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
    


            Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
    


            Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
    


            Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
    


            The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported over 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that's more acute in rural communities.

            After pushback from the university — the institute's projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
    


            Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state's congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers. “We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
    


            Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
    


            Other researchers haven't had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
    


            “Even if there are changes in the next administration, we're looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It's not as easy as like, ‘OK, we'll just do it again later.' It doesn't really work that way.”

Theologian and Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss what's to come in the wake of Pope Francis' death.

Viewership of the movie "Conclave," which depicts the choosing of a new pope, has spiked in the days since Pope Francis died. But how much of the Academy Award winner is accurate to the real event about to take place? 

The Rev. Bryan Pham, a Jesuit priest and associate director for Catholic Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, told Fox News Digital he believes the movie was accurate according to the "timeline and sequence of events of how to handle the death of a pope, the relaying of information, the gathering of the cardinals, and general procedures of getting the new pope elected."

Pham, who was a graduate student in Rome during the last conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013, also said the "side conversations among the cardinals as they try to identify the challenges and the needs of the church when considering the qualities of the next pope" rang true. 

HOW POPE FRANCIS' EXAMPLE 'SOUNDS A LOT LIKE JESUS'

"Although, in real-life, these conversations happen in what is called ‘general congregation' and is much more formal," he said. "But of course, cardinals are also mere mortals, so gossips and side-conversations do happen."

"Conclave," which came out last year and won the Oscar in March for best adapted screenplay, stars Ralph Fiennes as the cardinal in charge of the conclave after a fictional pope dies. It also stars Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow. 

Pham said the real conclave was an "extraordinary experience," adding that some parts of the movie sensationalized the centuries-old ritual. 

"Where ‘Conclave' was clearly a Hollywood movie that wants to be sensational, create potential scandals for shock value in order to make money and perhaps perpetuate the anti-Catholic sentiment (especially in the United States)" was "everything else that played into the negative aspect of the Catholic mystique that perpetuate the Catholic Church as primitive and byzantine," he said.

"That said, I thought the movie was done well," Pham said. "There were beautiful imageries, and the cinematography was excellent. The actors were also top-notch. I only wish Isabella Rossellini had a more prominent role (or lines); she is such an accomplished actor to be cast in such a relatively minor role."

Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, who has personally witnessed three conclaves and is heading back to Rome for this one, said viewership of the movie spiked because it's "in the zeitgeist. Anytime you have a pope die, you know, the visuals, the rituals of the church and the ceremony that accompanies the election of a pope is fascinating."

Amazon Prime made "Conclave" available for free on its streaming service on Monday after the pope died. 

Arroyo said he thinks a superior movie to "Conclave" is 1968's "The Shoes of the Fisherman," starring Anthony Quinn, which also depicts a conclave and is "more gripping and dramatic and interesting."

Arroyo agreed with Pham that the movie gets "some of the details of the ritual, which is evocative and beautiful and fascinating" right. 

"And frankly, that's the best part of ‘Conclave,' which is otherwise a very boring, draggy movie," Arroyo said. 

He noted that "the writing of the ballot, the going up and swearing before Michelangelo's last judgment," raising their ballots and making an oath to the last judgment, placing the ballots in a vessel and having them counted by counters was all accurate.

"They count votes, and then they run a needle and string through them," he continued. "So, all of that is correct. What's wrong is kind of the surrounds of the thing. The politics, the conversations playing out. It was very cartoonish, melodramatic dialogue."

"None of that happens in that way," he said, "and the intrigue, I wish it were that interesting and fascinating, all the intrigues and people dying, having kids out of wedlock and all that, that's not happening. 

Arroyo said all the potential choices for pope are already vetted.

"That's one dysfunctional Vatican," he joked of the movie. "That's all I can say on the screen. And the real one is dysfunctional enough. It doesn't need any assistance."

He said that during the conclave, the cardinals are all housed in a hotel across the street from St. Peter's Basilica. 

"And they would, as depicted in the movie, if memory serves, they get on a bus, and they take them over to the Sistine Chapel, and they go in, and they're locked in for the day. You know they're basically locked in."

Arroyo said that tradition goes back to one conclave when the cardinals weren't able to elect a pope for a year, "and the conclave kept dragging on, and they hadn't elected a pope, so they decided to lock them in the place and not give them food or water, pressure them to make a decision."

He said that while the traditions and ancient rituals "themselves are beautiful," why they're done is "always more fascinating."

"I thought the movie ‘Conclave' exploited the church's visuals to drive home a message and a version of the church that just isn't on point," he said. "I mean, when the nuns [were] lecturing all the cardinals while they're eating, that would never happen. I mean it doesn't happen. And look, I know a lot of cardinals. I've interviewed a lot them. I know what happens, before the conclave, during the conclave, after the conclave. This is just not reality."

He agreed with Pham that the business of meeting with the candidates "and getting comfortable with the man who might be pope or at least the major candidates" usually happens at dinners and other events before they are locked in during the conclave.

Arroyo said he will head to Rome during the nine days of mourning for the pope. 

"Those nine days are when all the business of the conclave is really done," he explains. "By the time they go into the conclave, they pretty much have at least a top one and two candidates that they're moving toward." 

He said the movie clearly had "great production designers and costumers who tried to match the locations and the places, and they didn't get that wrong. I mean, the Sistine Chapel is the Sistine Chapel."

But he said they missed "the heart of" what it's all about. 

The "biggest error" of the film, from Arroyo's perspective, is when Ralph Fiennes' character in the film, who is tasked with running the conclave, preaches that "doubt is at the heart of faith, that we must have doubt to believe. Well, this is absurd."

Arroyo said the concept "runs counter to everything the church has ever taught. You know, Jesus didn't say follow me in doubt. He said follow me and believe. So that's what you're called to do. And no, doubt is not part of that."

He continued, "The wonder of miracles is that, you know, they defy reality, they defy natural law. That's the wonder of it: it shatters reality in some ways. But there's no doubt involved in that. It either happened or didn't happen. But if it happens, it wakes a lot of people up, and that's what happened initially. And that's why these people gave their lives for what Jesus said and for Christ himself. They gave their life because he rose again."

"That idea of doubt being at the heart of faith and at the heart of the church is a stupid one," he said, "and one that people, I think a certain cast of mind, would like the church to pursue that path."

The movie, he said, "cast a certain ideological vision that they imagined the church should be, and it was an open, it's basically an open church, cut off from the very traditions that they celebrated and that the movie profits off of."

"The movie sought to propagate a version of Catholicism cut off from the very traditions and rituals that the movie celebrates, holds up and made a lot of money," he said.

Days after his death, the memory of Pope Francis remains vivid in the places he used to visit personally. Some of them—tailors, opticians, and ice cream makers—became acquaintances, almost friends, of the Argentine pontiff after years of loyal service. (AP video shot by Silvia Stellacci)

VATICAN CITY (AP) — In the streets around the Vatican, where Pope Francis used to make impromptu outings, some of the shopkeepers are mourning the man they knew, not as the leader of a church or head of state, but as an ordinary person. They prayed for him while he was hospitalized, and now they miss him dearly.

“He had been our regular customer for more than seven years,” said Sebastian Padrón, an Argentine ice cream maker whose store is located around the corner from Francis' austere hotel room in Vatican City. He recalled how close he and his family felt to Francis, who often gave gifts to his children. 

“The memory is wonderful, which is why it hurts so much,” he told The Associated Press on Thursday. Francis had a notorious sweet tooth, and Padrón's dulce de leche ice cream, a typical Argentine caramel dessert, became the pope's favorite.

When Francis became pope in 2013, he opted to live in the Domus Santa Marta hotel rather than the lavish papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace, overlooking St. Peter's Square. The choice spoke to his aversion to luxury, and an eagerness to mix with the masses. He moved around Rome in an ordinary hatchback and popped into stores to buy shoe insoles, change eyeglass lenses and buy recordings of classical music and tango from his native Argentina. He had lamented his inability to walk about freely as he did in Buenos Aires. 

“I met a man who was full of smiles, very friendly,” said Raniero Mancinelli, a Roman tailor who sold the basic pectoral cross that Francis wore for decades. Mancinelli, who was tailor to the last three popes, said that, unlike his predecessors, Francis wanted everything to be simple, practical and inexpensive. 




Mancinelli said he sold Francis a cardinal's sash before the conclave that eventually elected him pope. He recalled Francis' words upon learning the price of the garment:

“Raniero, you're a bit of a thief, you're a bit expensive.” The rest of his scarlet cardinal's outfit, Francis regularly said, was a hand-me-down from his predecessor as archbishop of Buenos Aires.

Francis caused havoc among tourists and Romans several times when he showed up at an optician's shop in Rome's historic center.

Luca Spiezia, who owns the store with his father, remembered his surprise at the pope introducing himself simply as “Francesco” when they met in 2015. Offered a new pair of glasses, Francis declined, asking only for new lenses in his old frames and insisting on paying for the work.

“He never made you feel that he was a powerful figure in the world, even though he was the head of the church,” Spiezia said. “I hope that this will be continuing with the next pope.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration is loosening rules to help U.S. automakers like Elon Musk's Tesla develop self-driving cars so they can take on Chinese rivals.

U.S. companies developing self-driving cars will be allowed exemptions from certain federal safety rules for testing purposes, the Transportation Department said Thursday. The department also said it will streamline crash reporting requirements involving self-driving software that Musk has criticized as onerous and will move toward a single set of national rules for the technology to replace a patchwork of state regulations.

“We're in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn't be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard.”

The new exemption procedures will allow U.S. automakers to apply to skip certain safety rules for self-driving vehicles if they are used only for research, demonstrations and other non-commercial purposes. The exemptions were in place previously for foreign, imported vehicles whose home country rules may be different than those in the U.S.

The decision comes a day after Musk confirmed on a conference call with Tesla investors that the electric vehicle maker will begin a rollout of self-driving Tesla taxis in Austin, Texas, in June.

It's not clear how the exemptions from National Traffic Safety Administration rules will affect Tesla specifically. The company has pinned its future on complete automation of its cars, but it is facing stiff competition now from rivals, especially China automaker BYD.




The crash reporting rule being changed has drawn criticism from Musk as too burdensome and unfair. Tesla has reported many of the total crashes under the rule in part because it is the biggest seller of partial self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

Traffic safety watchdogs had feared that the Trump administration would eliminate the reporting rule. The transportation statement Thursday said reporting will be loosened to “remove unnecessary and duplicative” requirements but that the obligation to report crashes will remain.

AP's Julia Frankel explains what's been happening in the West Bank territory.

After the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the devastating war in Gaza, a deadly new reality also took hold for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.

With the world's attention focused on Gaza, Israeli military operations in the West Bank grew in size, frequency and intensity. The army launched the stepped-up campaign to counter what it says is a growing militant threat.

Here's a look at where things stand, with data collected by the U.N.'s humanitarian office and Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement tracking group.

Since the war in Gaza erupted, the majority of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank have been shot during military raids in villages and towns.




Israel says the operations are needed to stamp out militancy. Many of the dead were militants killed in clashes, or youths throwing stones or firebombs.

But Palestinians and rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have been caught in the crossfire. Of those killed since the Hamas attack, at least 182 have been children under 18, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, some of whom Israel says were involved in stone-throwing and militancy. Rights groups accuse Israel of using excessive force.




Israel is staging a massive offensive across four major refugee camps in the north of the West Bank. The raids, at their height, pushed 40,000 people from their homes. Many are now sheltering with relatives in neighboring villages, others racking up debt renting apartments while they wait to return.

Israeli officials, meanwhile, have said those displaced will not be allowed to go back for at least a year.




Forces have ripped up roads, destroyed infrastructure and demolished hundreds of homes. Israel says it is dismantling terrorist infrastructure. But civilian homes have also been destroyed.

In another escalation, the military has resumed previously rare tactics, like drone strikes, in these densely populated areas.




Settler attacks causing injury or death to Palestinians surged in the wake of the Hamas attack. For Palestinians living in small Bedouin villages in areas under full Israeli control, the attacks have become a near-daily occurrence as settlers — emboldened by Israel's pro-settler government— build new unauthorized outposts on nearby hilltops.

Israel says it opposes settler violence and blames it all on a small, extremist fringe. Palestinians say that the Israeli army does little to protect them, and that the attacks are part of a systematic attempt to expel them from their land.

Settlers have established about 80 new outposts since the war began. Rights groups say the outposts, often populated by extremist activists, are the main drivers of violence against Palestinians. The tiny unauthorized land grabs are tolerated and even encouraged by Israel, which over the years has converted many outposts into authorized settlements as it cements its hold on the territory and moves to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.




Israel's government, dominated by settler leaders and supporters, has established 13 new settlements since the war began, at least five of which originally sprung up as outposts. That brings the total number of settlements to 140.

Most of the international community considers settlements illegal, though U.S. President Donald Trump has supported them.

Meanwhile, movement between Palestinian towns and cities has only grown more difficult. New checkpoints have further divided the territory and created choke points the Israeli army can shut off on a whim.




Crossings that had been open 24/7 started closing during morning and evening rush hours, disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and turning once-routine commutes into hours-long journeys.

As the war in Gaza continues and the West Bank seethes, Palestinians say life is only growing more difficult.

            California has surpassed Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom said, as he warned of the threat posed by President Donald Trump's tariffs to the tech powerhouse's fast-growing wealth.
    


            The Golden State's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) reached $4.1 trillion in 2024, according to preliminary data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, edging past Japan's $4.02 trillion nominal GDP in the same period as recorded by the International Monetary Fund.



            That means only the United States, China and Germany have larger economies than California, which outpaced all three countries with growth of 6% last year, according to the release.
    


            “California isn't just keeping pace with the world — we're setting the pace,” Newsom said in a news release Wednesday. “Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability and believe in the power of innovation.”
    


            But Newsom also warned that the state's economic prowess is being threatened by “the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration.”
    


            “California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected,” he said.
    


            California, America's most populous state with some 40 million people, accounted for 14% of the nation's GDP in 2024, according to government data, driven by Silicon Valley and its real estate and finance sectors.
    


            Last week, Newsom sued Trump over his use of emergency powers to unilaterally enact sweeping global tariffs, which the governor said had hurt Californian families and businesses.
    


            The lawsuit, filed in federal court on April 16, argues that Trump lacks the authority to enact tariffs against Mexico, China and Canada, or a 10% baseline tariff on imports from the rest of the world.
    


            These tariffs, Newsom said in a news release announcing the suit, are creating “immediate and irreparable harm to California, the largest economy, manufacturing, and agriculture state in the nation,” as they “have disrupted supply chains, inflated costs” and “inflicted billions in damages” on the state.
    


            The lawsuit argues that Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to enact tariffs was “unlawful and unprecedented,” and that such expansive action requires approval from Congress.
    


            Through the IEEPA, Congress in 1977 granted the president broad authority to impose sanctions on countries, export controls, regulate financial transactions and freeze foreign assets under national emergency declaration, but it requires the Executive to consult and report to Congress when exercising these powers.
    


            California engaged in nearly $675 billion of two-way trade in 2024, and counts Mexico, Canada and China as its top three trade partners, according to the state. Over 40% of Californian imports came from these countries, accounting for $203 billion of its more than $491 billion in total imports last year.
    


            Twelve more states sued the Trump administration Wednesday for “illegally imposing” tax hikes on Americans through tariffs in a lawsuit the White House called a “witch hunt.”

The Los Angeles Kings hosted the Edmonton Oilers Monday for a first-round Stanley Cup playoff game, and a pregame performance became a topic of conversation.

Members of the Korea Town Senior & Community Center performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" prior to the puck drop at Crypto.com Arena. The group used harmonicas instead of singing the American national anthem.

The majority of the crowd in attendance appeared to approve of the rendition as thousands remained standing to applaud the performers.

But some observers took to social media to voice their displeasure. 

"Whoever thought this was a good idea should probably not have a job," an X user wrote.

Once the game started, it was a hard-fought contest.

The Oilers tied the game late in third period, but the Kings celebrated a 6-5 victory in Game 1. Los Angeles was also victorious in Game 2.

The Washington Examiner's Joe Concha suggested the days of David Hogg serving as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee are numbered, adding possible new ventures could include being the first male host of The View.

Hogg was elected earlier this year to his DNC leadership role following 2024 election losses that saw President Donald Trump enter the White House for a second time and Republicans take control of both houses of Congress. 

As vice chairman, Hogg has been outspoken regarding his plan to launch a primary initiative that would spend $20 million on electing younger politicians through his organization, Leaders We Deserve. The initiative, which would seek to unseat current Democratic lawmakers, has created division within the party's leadership and talk that Hogg could be removed from his role. DNC Chairman Ken Martin, however, told the Washington Examiner that he has no “intention” of forcing out Hogg.

“You would think that if you're No. 2 at the DNC, your job is kind of to defeat Republicans and not just upset the apple cart like that,” Concha told Fox Business Network's Kudlow on Thursday. “So, he's on his way out. I'll give him a week, maybe two at this point.”

Concha has noted that Hogg's left-wing views have created a greater fracture within the Democratic Party, making progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) “look centrist.” His comments come as the party is experiencing record-low polling figures.

“This is a party that needs to go towards the center again, like Bill Clinton did in 1994. Instead they are going so far to the left. It's like Thelma and Louise — off the cliff at the end,” Concha said. “This is not somebody that you want to be the face [of the Democratic Party]. He's on TV a lot.”

Concha argued that Hogg does not have the political maturity to change course regarding his views. When asked what might come next for Hogg, should he be ousted from his DNC role, Concha suggested he could “get a job at MSNBC or be the first male host of The View.”

The senior writer for the Washington Examiner also said he believes Trump will win his current trade battle that has found his administration in negotiations with several countries after issuing new tariffs. However, Concha noted that if Trump is not successful with his tariffs, or if the economy does not improve, the Democrats' current disarray may have an opportunity to right itself.

“If he wins that,” Concha said regarding Trump's current economic and trade war, “then Democrats will be in Sherwood Forest as far as the political wilderness for a very long time. If that goes the other way, then Democrats have an opportunity because Donald Trump's failure is their gain.”

            The head of the US National Science Foundation, a $9 billion agency charged with advancing discoveries across the scientific spectrum, resigned Thursday amid sweeping changes spearheaded by the current Trump administration.
    


            NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan has led the agency since he was selected by President Donald Trump during his first term and unanimously confirmed by the Senate in June 2020.
    


            “I believe I have done all I can to advance the critical mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan said in parting remarks, which were provided to CNN on Thursday by an agency spokesperson.
    


            The director's departure comes as the National Science Foundation is grappling with demands from the new Trump administration and DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency, an effort established in January to slash government spending.
    


            “This is a pivotal moment for our nation in terms of global competitiveness,” Panchanathan said in the statement. “NSF is an extremely important investment to make U.S. scientific dominance a reality. We must not lose our competitive edge.”
    


            The federal agency announced earlier this month that it would cancel hundreds of grants totaling more than $230 million. The terminations included — but were not limited to — research related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and misinformation/disinformation,” according to information released by the NSF.
    


            The Trump administration issued a series of executive orders earlier this year demanding federal agencies cease activities related to promoting DEI.
    


            The canceled grants included those titled with phrases such as “Racial Equity in STEM,” “Antiracist Teacher Leadership” and “Advancing Gender Equity in Computing.”

            But the list also included other topics, such as the “Spread of Unsubstantiated Information” and “Addressing Vaccine Information Integrity.”
    


            In a post about the canceled grants, the NSF said that the misinformation research funding was halted to comply with Trump's January 20 executive order on “restoring freedom of speech.”
    


            The agency said it does “not support research with the goal of combating ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' and ‘malinformation' that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advances a preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.”
    


            The changes have prompted backlash from various research organizations and stakeholders.
    


            In response to the executive orders and other internal changes at NSF, some of which have taken place since DOGE arrived in mid-April, researchers have been asked to ensure funding requests comply with shifting directives.
    


            That guidance has put scientists in the “middle of a political tug-of-war, wasting valuable time and resources,” according to an April 24 statement from the Federation of Associations in Behavioral & Brain Sciences.
    


            “NSF has a tested process for evaluating the intellectual merit and the broader impact of proposed investigations and FABBS encourages NSF to honor it,” the federation's statement reads.

            The National Science Foundation may also face sweeping cuts to its roughly 1,500-person workforce, echoing how DOGE has demanded a reduction in force, or RIF, across numerous federal agencies.
    


            The NSF was established in 1950 and is tasked with evaluating the scientific merit of grant requests and doling out dollars — mostly to universities and other research institutions — to advance scientists' understanding of a wide range of topics, including artificial intelligence and the fundamental workings of the cosmos.

Country star Billy Ray Cyrus discusses his love of troops and the future of America on 'Hannity.'

Elizabeth Hurley reached out to Billy Ray Cyrus while he was in a difficult place after his divorce from singer Firerose.

The former co-stars, who recently went Instagram official with a kissing snap shared on Easter Sunday, reconnected over text, with Hurley making the first move nearly two years after they worked on the 2022 film "Christmas in Paradise."

Cyrus, who will debut his new song "Ask (Honor Song)" Friday, told "The Ty Bentli Show" their blossoming relationship is a gift from God, and he's the happiest he's been with his new romance.

"It's just been beautiful," Cyrus, 63, said, noting there's "no expectations of where we go from here other than her and her son. I do love him a lot, and it's great that God brought them into my life when he did. It's just a good thing. 

"It's been a long time since I've been this happy."

Hurley, 59, smiled widely as the "Achy Breaky Heart" singer kissed her on the cheek while wearing a festive pair of green bunny ears in a photo shared with both of their millions of social media followers on Easter.

"We did very few scenes together, but the couple times we were in the same scene, there was a chemistry there that felt … we just laughed, and it was at a time I wasn't laughing a lot. And I found out the oddest thing," he said of Hurley. 

"It's been a long time since I've been this happy."

"I've obviously, I know all about her life and career and me, a kid from Flatwoods, Kentucky, going to sit and pretend I'm an actor with Elizabeth Hurley knowing that, wait, how did this happen? And the oddest part was first how much we laughed.

"Second, I figured we were so different, but in some very strange way, we had way more in common than we had different. And then we did our couple scenes, and I left the island. And we didn't speak for two years, and the pandemic continued on. That was in 2022."

"I felt like, ‘Wow, can life get any harder? Can it get any tougher?' For me, at a certain point, it was like, ‘You can't get knocked down any flatter than laying on your back when life is kicking you,'" Cyrus said. "And, in this moment, this hand kind of reached out in a text message, not a physical hand, as in the one you saw in the picture. That'd be good. A friend reached out."

At the time, he "didn't even know the number" of the person who sent him a text along the lines of, "Hey, it looks like life might be a little bit tough and just wanted you to know I'm in your corner; you've got a friend in your corner."

Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty Friday in New York federal court to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Mangione faces a possible death sentence in the case if he is convicted in the federal case of murdering Thompson, who was gunned down on a Manhattan street in December.

The 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate is separately charged in New York state court with the slaying.

Mangione is accused of fatally shooting Thompson on Dec. 4 as the CEO was walking into the Hilton Hotel in midtown. UnitedHealth Group, the parent of Thompson's health insurance giant, was hosting an event for investors at the hotel that day.

Mangione was arrested five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

He is charged U.S. District Court in Manhattan with murder through use of a firearm, two counts of stalking, and a firearms offence.

Mangione appeared there Friday before Judge Margaret Garnett to enter his plea.

The hearing occurred a day after the Justice Department formally notified Garnett that it would seek the death penalty in the case, arguing that Thompson's killing was ideologically motivated by Mangione's anger toward the health insurance industry.

In a court filing Thursday, prosecutors told Garnett there were several factors to warrant imposing a death sentence in the case, including the allegation that Mangione "intentionally killed" Thompson, and "that the killing required "substantial planning and premeditation."

"Mangione elected to murder Thompson under these circumstances to amplify an ideologicalmessage, maximize the visibility and impact of the victim's murder, and to provoke broad-based resistance to the victim's industry," the filing said.

"Mangione presents a future danger because he expressed intent to target an entire industry, and rally political and social opposition to that industry, by engaging in an act of lethal violence; and he took steps to evade law enforcement, flee New York City immediately after the murder, and cross state lines while armed with a privately manufactured firearm and silencer."

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on April 1 first revealed that the Justice Department wanted to have Mangione executed if he is convicted.

"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America," Bondi said in a statement that day.

Mangione's lawyers in an April 11 court filing asked Judge Garnett to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, arguing that Bondi had violated the defendant's rights to due process and that the attorney general had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors with her public statement.

On Friday, Garnett warned lawyers in the case to refrain from "public commentary that could impede Mangione's right to a fair trial.

"I'm specifically directing the government to convey my directive to Mr. Clayton and request that he convey the same to Attorney General Bondi and her associates at main Justice," Garnett said. Jay Clayton is the interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney, and "main Justice" is a reference to the Justice Department and its headquarters in Washington, D.C.

The AI Race:

Microsoft Corp. is rolling out its controversial Recall feature to high-end Windows PCs, betting a record of what users do on their computers will be seen as more of a benefit than a privacy risk.

The feature, which takes searchable snapshots of a PC screen every few seconds and has added safeguards, will be available to users of Microsoft's AI-branded PCs starting on Friday, the company said in a blog post. Microsoft also announced beefed-up search and a tool that lets users quickly summon artificially intelligent assistants to help edit text or photos.

Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge on Friday after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.

FBI Director Kash Patel announced in an X post that Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstruction for allegedly assisting Eduardo Flores-Ruiz in avoiding arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week.

A U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman confirmed to CNBC that Dugan was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. local time on courthouse property.

The arrest of a judge marks a sharp escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S.

Dugan was released on bond after making her initial appearance Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee before Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries, according to her case docket. Dugan's "arraignment and plea" proceeding is set for May 15, the docket shows.

Milwaukee County Circuit Court Chief Judge Carl Ashley told NBC that the judicial code of conduct restricts him from commenting on the matter, but said Dugan's court calendar "will be covered by another judge as needed."

Patel in his tweet wrote that the FBI believes Dugan "intentionally misdirected federal agents away" from Flores-Ruiz as agents were attempting to arrest him at her courthouse.

"Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public," Patel said in the post.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Tuesday that the FBI was looking into Dugan's conduct surrounding an attempted arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at her courthouse on April 18.

On that day, Dugan "became visibly angry" after learning that ICE agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Flores-Ruiz after a hearing in his criminal battery case, according to a sworn affidavit unsealed Friday.

Dugan and another judge entered the hallway and confronted the arrest team, telling one deportation officer that he needed a judicial warrant to make an arrest instead of an "administrative warrant." Dugan then ordered them to the chief judge's office, the affidavit alleged.

After returning to her courtroom, Dugan "escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel" through a jury door, which leads to a nonpublic area of the building, the affidavit stated, citing "multiple witnesses."

Flores-Ruiz and his attorney then returned to the hallway and took an elevator down to leave the building, the special agent alleged. After being told that Flores-Ruiz was in front of the courthouse, agents ran toward him and identified themselves as law enforcement officers.

"Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued," according to the affidavit. 

"The agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended him near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained," it alleged.

Dugan's criminal complaint shows she has been charged with concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, and obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a federal department or agency.

ICE agents have previously arrested people in the courthouse hallways in March and April, according to the Journal Sentinel.

ICE did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. A person who answered a call to Dugan's chambers declined to comment.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC, "The days of actively aiding and abetting illegal aliens invading our country are over."

"The Trump administration will never waver on putting Americans and America First with a no-nonsense approach to immigration enforcement. In this administration, anyone who commits crimes exposes themselves to criminal liability," Desai said.

Federal authorities have arrested a former New Mexico judge and a Wisconsin judge in two separate cases, accusing them of interfering with Trump administration immigration enforcement efforts.

Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested Friday morning and charged with obstruction for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week.

Dugan's arrest came one day after federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico judge and his wife on charges related to them reportedly harboring an undocumented immigrant with alleged ties to the notorious gang Tren de Aragua.

Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano, who resigned last month, and Nancy Cano both face charges of tampering with evidence, jail records show.

The actions against judges mark a sharp escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to remove undocumented immigrants from the U.S.

A U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman confirmed to CNBC that Dugan was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. local time on courthouse property.

On Friday, Meta and Booz Allen Hamilton launched "Space Llama."

Llama, Meta's open-source artificial intelligence model, will help astronauts in low orbit at the International Space Station's National Laboratory with research.

"We see a future where open source AI models like Llama will play a vital role in fueling space exploration and research — enabling astronauts to undertake the next level of experimentation to solve complex scientific problems and drive innovation in entirely new ways," Ahmad Al-Dahle, Meta VP and head of generative AI, said in a release.

The announcement builds on Booz Allen Hamilton's ISS addition in August, when it deployed the first known large language model in space, per the company. Less than a year later, it is adding a tech stack with Meta's "fine-tuned" Llama 3.2, powered by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Spaceborne Computer-2 and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs.

The companies billed the new tech stack as "Space Llama" and are using it as an example of how large language models work in environments "denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited bandwidth," per a release.

The project is looking to lower costs, reduce computing power and have faster outcomes for responding to maintenance issues or "onboard anomalies" without having to rely on Earth-bound internet.

Space Llama will help astronauts replace paper documents and reduce reliance on instructions from the ground, according to the release.

Last month, NASA laid off employees and shuttered three departments due to mandated cuts from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Business Insider reported, which affected some research.

The DOGE cuts also hit a federal government office that NASA relies on to safely make moon landings, as well as land robotic probes on Mars, according to The New York Times.

In this article

Novo Nordisk scored a huge legal victory that largely restricts compounding pharmacies from marketing or selling cheaper, unapproved versions of the drugmaker's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic. 

A federal judge in Texas late Thursday rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to keep making copies of Ozempic and Wegovy while a legal challenge over the shortage of those drugs unfolds. That came in response to a February lawsuit from a compounding trade group against the Food and Drug Administration's determination that the active ingredient in those drugs, semaglutide, is no longer in shorter in the U.S.

Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments. 

During FDA-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. Many telehealth companies, such as Hims & Hers, also offered those copycats. But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs, which are essentially custom-made copies prescribed by a doctor to meet a specific patient's needs. 

"We are pleased the court has rejected the compounders' attempts to undermine FDA's data-based decision that the shortage" of semaglutide is resolved, said Steve Benz, Novo Nordisk's corporate vice president, legal and U.S. general counsel, in a statement. 

"Patient safety remains a top priority for Novo Nordisk and the extensive nationwide legal actions we have taken to protect Americans from the health risks posed by illegitimate 'semaglutide' drugs are working," he said, referring to the company's more than 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and other entities across 32 states. 

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman specifically denied the Outsourcing Facilities Association's bid for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the FDA from taking action against its members for making copies of semaglutide. 

That decision upholds the FDA's previous determination that the semaglutide shortage in the U.S. is over and means the FDA can now immediately go after so-called 503A pharmacies that are making compounded versions of semaglutide according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient.

Those pharmacies are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA.

Those pharmacies make compounded drugs according to individual prescriptions for a specific patient and are largely regulated by states rather than the FDA.

The decision also means the FDA can start targeting federally regulated 503B pharmacies, which manufacture compounded drugs in bulk with or without prescriptions, after May 22. The agency's actions can include product seizures and warning letters to pharmacies. 

The decision on Thursday follows another win for Novo Nordisk. A different federal judge in Texas earlier this week ruled in favor of the drugmaker against a 503A pharmacy, MediOak Pharmacy, permanently prohibiting the business from marketing or selling compounded semaglutide.

Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have aggressively cracked down on compounding pharmacies over the last two years as they benefit from the soaring popularity of their weight loss and diabetes drugs.

Eli Lilly has gone through a similar legal process with tirzepatide, the active ingredient in its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. The FDA declared the U.S. shortage of tirzepatide over last year, prompting the same compounding trade group to sue the FDA over the drug. 

In March, a federal judge denied the compounding group's request for a preliminary injunction on the FDA's enforcement against its members for making copies of Mounjaro and Zepbound. The compounding group has appealed.

President Donald Trump denied that a strong bond market sell-off influenced his decision earlier this month to hold off on aggressive "reciprocal" tariffs against U.S. trading partners.

"I wasn't worried," Trump said in a Time magazine interview during which he was asked about financial market tumult after his April 2 "Liberation Day" announcement.

In the decree, Trump slapped 10% across-the-board duties against all U.S. imports and released a list of tariffs against dozens of other nations. The extra levies were based on trade deficits the U.S. had against the respective countries and raised fears about inflation, a potential recession and disruption of long-held trade agreements.

Markets recoiled following the release. Treasury yields initially headed lower but quickly snapped higher. The 10-year yield rose half a percentage point in just a few days, one of its quickest moves ever, as investors also ditched stocks and the U.S. dollar.

Ultimately, Trump issued a 90-day stay on the reciprocal tariffs to allow time for negotiation. But he said it wasn't because of the market tumult.

"No, it wasn't for that reason," Trump told Time in the interview from Tuesday that was published Friday. "I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don't even want them to come in."

Yields have since moved lower, with the 10-year most recently around 4.28%, about a quarter percentage point higher than its recent low. Trump had said when he made the decision to hold off that the bond market had gotten the "yips."

"The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn't. Because I know what we have," he said. "I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running — it was running as a free spirit. This was — this was the most incompetent president in history."

Though negotiations over tariffs are ongoing, Trump added that he would consider it a "total victory" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now.

For 10 years, Aaron Cordovez has been selling kitchen appliances on Amazon. Now he's in a bind, because most of his products are manufactured in China.

Cordovez, co-founder of Zulay Kitchen, said his company is moving "as fast as we can" to move production to India, Mexico and other markets, where tariffs are increasing under President Donald Trump, but are mild compared with the levies imposed on goods from China. That process will likely take at least a year or two to complete, he said.

"We're making our inventory last as long as we can," Cordovez said in an email.

Zulay is also temporarily raising the price of some of its milk frothers, smores roasting sticks and other products. The company's popular kitchen strainer now costs $12.99, up from $9.99 before Trump announced his sweeping tariff proposal earlier this month.

Amazon merchants are hiking prices for everything from diaper bags and refrigerator magnets to charm necklaces and other top-selling items as they confront higher import costs. E-commerce software company SmartScout tracked 930 products on Amazon that have seen increased prices since April 9, with an average jump of 29% in categories, including clothing, jewelry, household items, office supplies, electronics and toys.

In a statement to CNBC, an Amazon spokesperson called the claim "sensationalized" and said the research covers "a tiny fraction of items in our store." Amazon said that, based on its view of the research, fewer than 1% "of the items studied saw an increase in price."

"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon," the statement said. "And we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items." 

The trade war with China has threatened to upend sellers on Amazon's third-party marketplace, which accounts for about 60% of the company's online sales. Many merchants are based in China or rely on the world's second-largest economy to source and assemble their products.

Sellers are now faced with the conundrum of raising prices or eating the extra costs associated with Trump's new tariffs. It's an existential threat for many sellers, who subsist on razor-thin margins and have, for the last several years, dealt with rising costs on Amazon tied to storage, fulfillment, shipping and advertising fees along with pricing pressure from increased competition.

CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC earlier this month that the company was "going to try and do everything we can" to keep prices low for shoppers, including renegotiating terms with some of its suppliers. But he acknowledged some third-party sellers will "need to pass that cost" of tariffs on to consumers.

Amazon's stock price is down 15% so far this year, sliding along with the broader market. The company reports first-quarter earnings next week.

Goods imported from China now face import duties of 145%, though Trump said Wednesday his administration is "actively" talking with China about a potential deal to lower tariffs. Chinese officials on Thursday denied that trade talks are taking place.

About 25% of the price increases observed by SmartScout were initiated by sellers based in China, said Scott Needham, the company's CEO. Last week, stainless steel jewelry maker Ursteel hiked prices on four of its products by $6.50, while apparel brand Chouyatou raised the price of some of its dresses by $2. Both businesses are based in China's Zhejiang province.

Anker, a Chinese electronics brand and one of Amazon's largest sellers, has raised prices on one-fifth of its products sold in the U.S., including a portable power bank, which went up to $135 from $110, SmartScout data shows.

Representatives from Anker, Ursteel and Chouyatou didn't respond to requests for comment.

Zulay, headquartered in Florida, is one of many U.S.-based sellers raising prices. The company is also cutting costs. Cordovez said he's been forced to lay off 19% of his workforce and slash online ad spending by 85%.

Desert Cactus, based in Illinois, is also taking action. Joe Stefani, the company's president, has been looking to move production of some of his brand's college-themed merchandise out of China and into Mexico, India and Vietnam. About half of Desert Cactus' goods come from China, while the rest are made in the U.S., Stefani said.

One of the company's top products is a customizable license plate frame that's manufactured in China. At the start of Trump's first term in 2016, Stefani's company paid import and shipping fees of 4% on the license plates. That rate has since skyrocketed to 170%, he said.

"The tariffs can't stay this high," Stefani said. "There's so many people that just aren't going to make it."

Stefani said he expects Desert Cactus will end up raising prices on some products, though he's worried shoppers might be put off by sticker shock.

"Will someone be willing to pay $50 for a hat on Amazon?" Stefani said. "You know it's going to be expensive at the ballpark, but on Amazon we don't know."

Dave Dama, co-founder of health and beauty business Pure Daily Care, said the price to manufacture one of his skin-care products in China jumped to $25 from $10. Most Amazon sellers will have no choice but to raise prices, he said.

"If you were selling something for $40 and making a $7 or $8 profit at the end of the day, with these tariffs, those days are gone," Dama said. "You can't do that anymore. It's unsustainable."

Pure Daily Care plans to stagger price increases over several weeks, and only on products "we absolutely need to," to keep Amazon's algorithms from ranking it lower in search results or losing the valuable buy box, he said. The buy box determines which listing pops up first when a shopper clicks on a particular product, and the one that gets purchased when they tap "Add to Cart."

An Amazon spokesperson said the company's pricing policies continue to apply.

"As always, sellers set their own prices, and we regularly monitor how we highlight great prices as Featured Offers to provide customers with low prices across a wide selection," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Dama said his company has enough inventory for some products to last up to six months, which it aims to "stretch as long as possible" in the hope that China and the U.S. can reach a trade deal. The company is also forgoing some sales promotions and discounts, while pausing spend on some display and video ads.

Regarding his inventory, Dama said, "We can try to stretch that seven, eight, nine months, which buys us a lot more time for this thing to work out, hopefully."

Donald Trump

President Donald Trump said he would “absolutely” sign a bill banning congressional stock trading, saying he was concerned lawmakers could be using insider information for an advantage.

“I would be okay with it,” Trump said in an interview with Time Magazine that published Friday. “If they send that to me, I would do it.”

Foreign investors have sold $63 billion of US equities since the start of March, Goldman Sachs strategists estimate, noting that the data from high-frequency fund flows suggest that European investors have been driving the selling, while other regions have continued to buy US stocks.

“This dynamic poses a substantial risk to equity valuations because foreign investors entered 2025 with a record 18% ownership share of US equities,” the portfolio strategy team lead by Daniel Chavez writes in a note to clients.

Anti-Elon Musk and anti-Tesla protesters are celebrating a win after the automaker's earnings miss on Tuesday.

"Today's earnings report sends a very clear message," the Tesla Takedown organization wrote in an email on Tuesday. "The Tesla Takedown grassroots pressure is beginning to hit Tesla where it hurts — the company's bottom line."

Tesla's first-quarter earnings report showed that the automaker fell short on revenue and earnings per share. In the follow-up call, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that vandalism and anti-Tesla hostility "had an impact in certain markets." Musk also announced during the call that he plans to take a significant step back from his role with DOGE starting next month.

The apparent impact of the protests seems to have spurred more interest in organizing efforts.

Tesla Takedown told Business Insider that its post-earnings email announcement had an open rate of over 53%, an increase from the roughly 30% average open rate it had in its four previous emails. The organization also said that more than 30 new protests were added to its Action Network page within about 24 hours of the earnings release. During the same period, it said its follower count on Bluesky rose by 10% to 15%, compared to its typical weekly growth on social media of less than 5%.

The group, which has organized hundreds of protests in the past few months against Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, also said in a press release that "the movement to hold Musk accountable for attacks" on public services will move beyond Tesla.

"Tesla Takedown has already started laying the groundwork to expand Tesla Takedown efforts to target other Musk businesses including SpaceX, Starlink, X and xAI," the organization said in the statement.

Other similar protest movements against Musk show little sign of slowing down. Just a day after Tesla's earnings release, climate activists staged a demonstration at a San Francisco dealership, accusing the company of "greenwashing" and calling for Musk's removal as CEO. Some of the protesters were arrested.

A representative for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

BEIJING — China plans to help struggling businesses with targeted measures in the face of "increased external shocks," according to a readout of a meeting chaired Friday by President Xi Jinping.

The meeting of the Politburo, the second most powerful political body in China, comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated this month with new tit-for-tat tariffs of more than 100%. Major Wall Street banks have cut their China GDP forecasts for the year as a result, while the country still strives to achieve its lofty goal of "around 5%" growth set in March.

Authorities called for "multiple measures to help businesses in difficulty," such as financial support, according to the Chinese-language readout, translated by CNBC.

The Politburo also called for "timely reduction” of interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio — the amount of cash banks need to have on hand.

Policymakers are sticking with their stance from earlier this year, while indicating flexibility for targeted measures, said Zong Liang, chief researcher at Bank of China. For mitigating the impact of tariffs, he expects China will do more research on specific businesses, and consider how to support them.

In a rare move, China in March raised its deficit target to 4% of GDP. Finance Minister Lan Fo'an indicated at the time that China had more room to act on fiscal policy.

Since the escalation in U.S. trade tensions this month, local Chinese governments and major businesses have announced efforts to help exporters redirect their products to the domestic market for sale.

The Politburo meeting readout emphasized the need to increase the income of middle and lower-income groups, and boost services consumption. The leaders also called for further tech development, including the integration of artificial intelligence.

"The press release shows the government is ready to launch new policies when the economy is affected by the external shock," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.

"It seems Beijing is not in a rush to launch a large stimulus at this stage," he said. "It takes time to monitor and evaluate the timing and the size of the trade shock."

The CSI 300 briefly turned lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index trimmed gains after the meeting statement was released.

China's Politburo, composed of high-level members of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, tends to lay out broad policy directives.

The latest meeting reaffirmed policies from the State Council — the top executive body — and government ministries, "underscoring high-level commitment and collaboration," said Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School.

"While they may not offer many unexpected and ground breaking surprises, these measures equip policymakers with tools to navigate external uncertainties," he said, adding he expects a forthcoming private sector law to further improve the business environment.

The standing committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, is scheduled to meet from Sunday to Wednesday, and review a new law to support the private sector.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia markets rose after Wall Street gained for a third straight day as tech stocks rallied, with investors assessing the trade climate as the U.S. tones down tariff rhetoric and China reportedly mulls suspending tariffs.

China may waive its 125% tariff on certain U.S. goods, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the matter. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.24% higher, closing at 21,963.09 while mainland China's CSI 300 traded flat to close at 3,786.99.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.9% to close at 35,705.74 and the Topix added 1.37% to end the trading day at 2,628.03. South Korea's Kospi climbed 0.95% to close at 2,546.3 while the small-cap Kosdaq rose 0.5% to close at 729.69 as South Korea also reportedly inches closer to striking a trade deal with the U.S.

Australian markets are closed for a holiday.

Futures linked to the S&P 500 were 0.3% higher, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered around the flatline.

Overnight stateside, the three major averages closed higher thanks to strong gains in megacap tech names, as investors continued to look for signs of progress on the global trade front.

The S&P 500 ended up 2.03% at 5,484.77, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 2.74% to finish at 17,166.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two indexes, weighed down by a 6.6% drop in IBM, but still added 486.83 points, or 1.23%, at 40,093.40. 

Shares of Nvidia, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Microsoft all closed higher, propelling the major averages to their third day of gains in a row

"Investors are becoming more comfortable with the uncertainties of tariffs as earnings roll in," said Louis Navellier, chairman and founder of Navellier & Associates. "The market seems to be positioning itself for a near-term reduction in the current sky-high China tariffs," he added.

— CNBC's Lisa Kailai Han and Pia Singh contributed to this report.

Asia has the "room to ease monetary policy," said Krishna Srinivasan, Head of Asia & Pacific Department at the International Monetary Fund, as inflation in many countries in the region is at or below target.

In the case of Japan, the IMF forecasts that the country will reach its 2% inflation target by 2027, Srinivasan added.

India markets fell Friday amid a broader rise in the region as tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad rise following a deadly attack in Kashmir that reportedly killed 26 tourists.

The Nifty 50 fell 1.27%, while the BSE Sensex was down 1.35%.

India downgraded its ties with Pakistan following the attack and suspended a water-sharing treaty with the neighboring country. It has reportedly pointed the finger toward Pakistan, which has denied involvement in the attack.

South Korea has asked for "calm" and "orderly" discussions with the U.S. on trade issues, as Asia's fourth largest economy reportedly seeks to work out a deal with the U.S. by July to avoid tariffs.

In the so-called "2+2" talks in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Ahn Dukgeun met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

According to South Korean media outlet Yonhap, Choi told reporters that further talks will focus on four categories: tariff-and non-tariff measures; economic security; investment cooperation; and monetary policies.

A readout from South Korea's Ministry of Finance said Choi proposed to seek mutually beneficial solutions for both countries, as well as communicated South Korea's concerns about tariffs, according to a CNBC translation.

China is mulling the suspension of its 125% tariff on certain U.S. goods, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the matter.

The government is considering scrapping the extra duties on items including medical equipment and industrial chemicals such as ethane. Authorities are also reportedly debating scrapping the tariff on aircraft leases.

The offshore yuan strengthened slightly to 7.284 against the greenback.

Most Chinese consumers remain pragmatic in their spending decisions amid U.S.-China trade tensions, Goldman Sachs wrote in an April 24 note. 

"There appears to be limited direct correlation between Chinese consumer sentiment towards U.S. brands and the U.S.' tariff policy", the investment bank's team said. The report added that based off sales data from select categories like automobiles, mobile phones and sportswear, U.S. brands did not "meaningfully deteriorate."

Boycott news or search volumes initiated by consumers have been far below previous accounts of geopolitical strife, Goldman also observed.

"We believe brand momentum/product cycle play a relatively more important role in market share shift patterns," the economists wrote, adding that brands with higher pricing and lack of innovation tend to be more vulnerable.

China is expected to post its April PMI figures next week, which will be the first available factory activity data from the country to evaluate the U.S. tariff shock.

ANZ economists said in a report published Friday that they expect manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs to dip to 49.5 and 50.5 respectively. This would compare against March's official purchasing managers' index which came in at 50.5 in March, while non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, was at 50.8.

"The first order impact brought by the U.S. tariff will likely be on the new export orders, not the broad domestic demand and production," wrote ANZ.

Shares of South Korea's shipbuilders rose after the Asian country and the U.S. have agreed to work on a trade package.

HD Hyundai Heavy Industries was up 5.32% after earlier surging over 7% to a record high. Hanhwa Ocean, which has a shipyard in Philadelphia, rose 6.06%, while HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering climbed more than 4%.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described Thursday's meeting between the U.S. and South Korea as "very successful."

According to a South Korean news outlet Newsis, a Korean minister said that a consensus on shipbuilding cooperation between South Korea and the U.S. has been reached.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and Topix led gains in Asian markets on Friday, climbing 1.73% and 1.43% respectively.

This follows Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's unveiling of a package of emergency economic measures to counter the adverse effects of U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, according to Japanese media outlet Kyodo News. Kyodo said the package included measures such as corporate financing support and ways to increase domestic consumption. The government also pledged to reduce fuel prices and increase subsidies for energy bills.

Separately, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reportedly said on Thursday that the BOJ will continue to raise interest rates if underlying inflation approaches its 2% inflation target.

The BOJ will also see how the potential economic fallout from higher U.S. tariffs could affect the likelihood of achieving its price goals, which are a prerequisite for further interest rate hikes.

Tokyo's core CPI rose 3.4% in April from a year earlier, marking the first time since 2023 that its core CPI, which strips out volatile fresh food costs, rose over 3%.

The reading outpaced Reuters' expectations of a 3.2% climb, and compares against 2.4% in March.

Just last week, Japan's inflation rate in January climbed to 4%, hitting its highest level since January 2023.

The figures were released just before the Bank of Japan's policy meeting scheduled for April 30 to May 1.

Stocks rallied on Thursday, notching their third day of gains in a row.

The S&P 500 rallied 2.03%, closing at 5,484.77. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.74% to settle at 17,166.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 486.83 points, or 1.23%, finishing at 40,093.40.

In a Thursday note, UBS strategist Sean Simonds wrote that the U.S. is increasingly approaching a recessionary regime.

"Markets pricing rapidly in a 'recessionary' direction," he wrote.

Simonds added that tariff-sensitive stocks are being "aggressively repriced" and are now down 20% relative to the market.

Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks could take an even bigger hit going forward.

"Consumer discretionary stocks are typically sensitive to growth slowdowns/recessions and have underperformed recently as the market pushes quickly in this direction. Earnings expectations have also been rapidly revised lower and hedge fund positioning has adjusted significantly," Simonds said. "Our models suggest more consumer discretionary downside momentum (eg. Kohls) and relative outperformance coming from communication services and utilities (eg. Live Nation and Ameren)."

— Lisa Kailai Han

The International Monetary Fund lowered its Asia economic growth forecast to 3.9% in 2025 from a 4.6% forecast made last year.

Uncertainty surrounding trade policy is a major headwind for the region, Krishna Srinivasan, the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department director, told reporters Thursday.

However, Srinivasan noted the central banks in the region have some scope to ease monetary policy that can help protect against some of the damage from trade policy.

Major U.S. tech names reported their first-quarter results Thursday, offering markets something more to chew on besides all the tariff-related news. 

U.S. stock indexes rallied: the Dow regained the 40,000 level and the S&P500 and Nasdaq posted gains of over 2%.

While tech appears to be at the forefront of investors' mind for now, tariffs and trade tensions still lurk in the shadows, with Intel CFO David Zinsner warning that tariffs and retaliation from other countries has increased the likelihood of a recession.Also, the optimism that both the U.S. and China were going to de-escalate the trade war has been watered down by China saying there were no ongoing trade talks with the U.S. 

U.S. President Donald Trump refuted China's claims, saying that trade talks were underway, but declined to reveal any details on the nature of the talks, adding to the uncertainty around trade.

Oh well, seems like it's a case of he said, she said — only at the highest levels of diplomacy between the world's largest economies. That's got to keep markets on tenterhooks.

Alphabet shares climb after better than expected resultsAlphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter growth on Thursday after the bell. Alphabet's search and advertising units are still showing strong growth despite AI competition heating up, according to its first-quarter earnings report. The company's overall revenue grew 12% year-over-year, higher than the 10% Wall Street expected. Shares rose more than 5% in after-hours trading. 

Intel also posts results beat, but warns of tariff impactIntel reported first-quarter results Thursday that beat analysts' estimates, but also issued disappointing guidance. Second-quarter revenue will come in below estimates due to elevated uncertainty driven by the macro environment, the company warned. Separately, Intel CFO David Zinsner said President Donald Trump's tariffs and retaliation from other countries had increased the likelihood of a recession.

Trump asserts trade talks with China are underwayU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday refuted China's claims that there were no ongoing trade discussions between Beijing and Washington. "They had a meeting this morning ... It doesn't matter who 'they' is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we've been meeting with China," Trump told reporters. The statement followed China's denial of any talks with the U.S. and calls for abolishing "unilateral" tariff measures for resolving trade issues.

South Korea calls for 'calm, orderly' talks with the U.S.South Korea has asked for "calm" and "orderly" discussions with the U.S. on trade issues, as Asia's fourth largest economy reportedly seeks to work out a deal with the U.S. by July to avoid tariffs. According to South Korean media outlet Yonhap, South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok told reporters that further talks will focus on four categories: tariff-and non-tariff measures; economic security; investment cooperation; and monetary policies.

Tech gains power markets Stocks popped Thursday thanks to strong gains in megacap tech names. The S&P 500 ended up 2.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 2.74%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged the other two indexes but still added 1.23%, and retook the 40,000 mark for the first time since April 15. In Asia, markets rose, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up almost 2% and leading gains.

[PRO] The Mag 7 isn't so mighty anymore

The market's leading tech stocks don't hold the same sway they once did, and that may change the ingredients needed for a Wall Street rally. The Roundhill Magnificent 7 ETF (MAGS) — which holds shares of the Mag 7 in roughly equal measure — is now down 17% for the year. That's more than double the drop of almost 7% in the S&P 500.

China denies tariff talks are underwayChina on Thursday said that there were no ongoing discussions with the U.S. on tariffs, despite indications from the White House this week that there would be some easing in tensions with Beijing.

"At present there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.," Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He added that "all sayings" regarding progress on bilateral talks should be dismissed.

Gwyneth Paltrow, 52, is ditching her strict paleo diet.

On the Tuesday episode of her "Goop" podcast, Paltrow spoke about how her relationship with food has changed over the years.

"I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time. That was an interesting chapter where I got kind of obsessed with eating very, very healthily," Paltrow said.

Part of it was because of her dad's health, she said: "I think that I was really trying to heal my dad by proxy, and he just didn't really want anything to do with it." Her father died in 2002 after battling throat cancer.

The Goop founder started thinking more critically about the types of food she was putting into her body.

"But the beauty of it, for me, was that I really deepened my connection with food and this whole philosophy around macrobiotics, which is essentially just how they eat in the mountains of Japan," Paltrow said. "So, very local, very seasonal, lots of fish and vegetables, rice, no dairy, no sugar, et cetera."

Although the "Shakespeare in Love" star says that she "might have gotten a little didactic about it," all she wanted to do was share her eating philosophy with everyone she knew.

"I think I was just so amazed that, you know, we had this power in our hands that if we treated ourselves well, hydrated, and ate whole foods, we could just feel so much better," Paltrow said.

She added that she was "intoxicated" by that idea, and still feels the same to this day.

"But it's the reason Brad and I became paleo a few years ago now, although I'm a little sick of it, if I'm honest, and getting back into eating some sourdough bread and some cheese," Paltrow said. "There, I said it. A little pasta, after being strict with it for so long."

"But again, I think it's a good sort of template, right? Eating foods that are kind of as whole and fresh as possible," she added.

A paleo diet is supposed to be based on the way ancient human ancestors ate and includes foods such as lean meats, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. It emphasizes eating unprocessed foods, and grains and dairy are off limits.

Paltrow's comments come months after her company, Goop, told Women's Wear Daily that it was restructuring. 

The company was moving away from wellness, home, and travel and focusing on beauty, fashion, and food instead. It will double down on its Goop Beauty and Good Clean Goop beauty brands, its G. Label clothing line, and Goop Kitchen.

Paltrow has previously detailed her strict diet and wellness routine during an interview for "The Art of Being Well" podcast in 2023.

Her restrictive diet, which drew widespread criticism from internet users and dietitians, included coffee in the mornings, bone broth for lunch, and a paleo diet for dinner.

A representative for Paltrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

Investor and CEO Cathie Wood's ARK Invest firm projects that Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million per coin by 2030, according to its newly released Big Ideas 2025 report.

The forecast, detailed this week, highlights institutional adoption, Bitcoin's role as a "digital gold," and emerging market demand as the key drivers behind the potential surge.

Bitcoin is currently trading near $95,000, after reaching a record high of approximately $108,000 in December. ARK's prediction, if realized, would represent a more than 1,400 percent increase from today's levels.

The release comes as President Donald Trump, newly returned to the White House, has pledged to boost cryptocurrency adoption and proposed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the United States.

ARK Invest's primary bull case places Bitcoin at $1.5 million by the end of the decade. Wood's firm also laid out alternative scenarios: a base case of $710,000 and a bear case of $300,000, according to CCN.

These projections were modeled based on Bitcoin's penetration rates into various total addressable markets (TAMs), including institutional portfolios, digital gold markets and use as a safe haven asset in emerging economies.

In its most optimistic supplementary modeling, ARK suggested Bitcoin could rise even higher—up to $2.4 million—under more aggressive assumptions about adoption rates, according to Cointelegraph. However, this $2.4 million figure was not the central forecast presented in the Big Ideas 2025 report.

"Institutional investment contributes the most to our bull case," said ARK research analyst David Puell, explaining that a 6.5 percent penetration rate into the $200 trillion global market for financial assets could propel Bitcoin's price dramatically.

Bitcoin's growing appeal as "digital gold" was also emphasized, with ARK estimating Bitcoin could capture up to 60 percent of gold's $18 trillion market cap under favorable conditions. Additionally, Bitcoin's role in protecting wealth in emerging markets suffering from inflation could be a major driver of demand, contributing substantially to future valuation growth.

Strike CEO Jack Mallers also weighed in on Bitcoin's prospects, suggesting that Bitcoin could climb to between $250,000 and $1 million by 2030, citing rising dysfunction in traditional financial systems as a tailwind, CCN reported.

Newsweek reached out to ARK for comment via email.

Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: "With bitcoin, no matter what prediction you read, the answer for where the price is going should always be 'Nobody knows.' Bitcoin has had a mixed track record over the last five years. Sometimes it follows market trends, rising and falling as the S&P does. Other times, like recently, some investors look at it as a safe haven like gold from a chaotic currency situation."

Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: "She has current investments within the crypto-currency space so it is very difficult to take these predictions seriously, especially when ARK Invest has exposure for on and off chain Bitcoin holdings."

"Investors have soured on Cathie Woods ever since she has failed to replicate the magnificent returns she enjoyed during the pandemic rally. She has experienced significant outflows given her underperformance of the S&P 500 over recent years. To be honest, I often see many pundits bashing her as sort of envious of what she has become in a male dominated industry."

Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, told Newsweek: "You know what's fascinating about Bitcoin predictions? They're essentially financial astrology wrapped in technical jargon. Cathie Wood's $1.5 million forecast is fueled by institutional FOMO, not fundamentals. Why are smart investors still chasing these moonshot predictions? Because nobody gets famous for saying 'expect reasonable 7 to 9 percent returns.'"

Bitcoin's potential climb toward $1.5 million—or beyond—will depend on sustained institutional momentum, geopolitical and economic trends and regulatory developments both in the U.S. and globally.

"For investors, this prediction isn't a roadmap but more like s a Rorschach test. The true believers will see validation, the skeptics will see delusion, and the market will do whatever it wants regardless," Ryan said.

Trump's proposal for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, outlined after his return to the White House, has energized crypto advocates who see government support as a potential catalyst for faster mainstream adoption.

While ARK's models provide a roadmap for Bitcoin's potential, the firm acknowledged that risks remain significant, including adoption hurdles and market volatility. Still, Wood's team sees Bitcoin as uniquely positioned to evolve from a speculative asset into a core pillar of the global financial system.

Paul Atkins' first public event as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was a crypto roundtable on Friday, where the new agency chief devoted his inaugural speech to assuring the industry that he'll continue to remake securities policy to favor digital assets innovation.

The agency and industry have been awaiting congressional action to establish crypto market-structure oversight that will likely set guardrails, and Atkins told an audience at the SEC's Washington headquarters that the regulator will work toward delivering "a rational, fit-for-purpose framework" for crypto.

However, in answer to a question from CoinDesk after his speech, Atkins indicated that the agency may be able to act to some degree during this wait for new laws.

"It's always good to have Congress' input, and if there's a statute to back up what we're doing, I think that's all the better," Atkins said. "But we have ample room to maneuver under existing rules and laws."

Atkins further suggested that he thinks the concept of special-purpose crypto broker dealers, a little-used registration most prominently represented by Prometheum, has been very successful and may need to be reconsidered, and he said the agency will look at whether custody rules need to be changed to "accommodate crypto assets and blockchain technology."

Atkins previously appeared at a swearing-in ceremony earlier this week in the White House, where Trump said "he's the perfect man to lead this agency" at a time when the digital assets sector needs regulatory clarity, and Atkins said a "top priority of my chairmanship will be to provide a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets." But Friday's event at the SEC's headquarters represented his first full-fledged engagement with the public.

The crypto sector has high hopes for Atkins, though his stand-in for the past few months — Commissioner Mark Uyeda — already took a number of decisive actions to reverse the regulator's earlier crypto reluctance under former Chair Gary Gensler. As interim chairman, Uyeda reversed or sidelined a number of crypto policy efforts pursued under Gensler and has abandoned most of the regulator's prominent enforcement actions targeting the industry.

Until now, industry expectations for Atkins' leadership were based on conjecture rooted in his experience advising and investing in digital assets firms, especially since his Senate confirmation hearing failed to explore his crypto views.

Atkins had served as an adviser to crypto entities such as the Digital Chamber and as a board member of tokenization firm Securitize, and his ties to Off the Chain Capital had previously linked him to its investment stakes in big crypto companies like Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Kraken.

Friday's roundtable was the third in a series the agency has held on crypto matters, this time focused on custody in the industry. Crypto custody has been a particularly dicey topic at the agency, which under Gensler's reign had sought to approve a policy demanding investment advisers put their clients' digital assets only with certain qualified custodians. Gensler had argued that the rule was meant to exclude most of the existing crypto platforms as suitable custodians, but the effort was put on ice.

Atkins was asked by reporters on the event's sidelines about President Trump's own crypto interests and whether Trump's memecoin, $TRUMP, will rob credibility from the White House on industry policy.

"I have no comment on any of that," Atkins said.

Global bank Citi has predicted 2025 could be a possible inflection point for blockchain adoption driven by stablecoins, akin to the breakout year artificial intelligence (AI) had with popular application ChatGPT.

"2025 has the potential to be blockchain's ‘ChatGPT' moment," the bank's analysts said in a report published earlier this week.

At the center of the Citi's projection are stablecoins, a class of cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. These tokens, led by Tether's $145 billion USDT and Circle's $60 billion USDC, have seen tremendous growth recently and are increasingly being used for payments and remittances globally.

Citi sees the asset class potentially growing to $1.6 trillion by 2030 in its base case from the current $230 billion, with the caveat that regulatory support and institutional integration take hold. In the bank's more optimistic scenario, the market could balloon to $3.7 trillion, though lingering structural challenges could keep the number closer to $500 billion in the bank's bear case.

A major catalyst is the supportive regulatory stance in the U.S., with a recent presidential executive order directing the formation of a federal framework for digital assets, the report said. The clarity around stablecoin rules could allow these tokens to be more deeply embedded in the financial system, offering faster payments, improved transparency and more efficient asset settlement. 

"This could lead to greater adoption of blockchain-based money and spur other use cases, financial and beyond, in the U.S. private and public sector," the authors noted.

Stablecoins are expected to remain heavily dollar-denominated in the future. The report anticipates that around 90% of stablecoins in circulation in 2030 will still be tied to the U.S. dollar, cementing its dominance.

This has major implications for the global financial system. Dollar stablecoin issuers could become one of the largest buyers of U.S. Treasuries, assuming that regulations push toward backing tokens with low-risk, highly liquid traditional financial assets like government bonds. Citibank estimated issuers could hold $1.2 trillion in U.S. government debt by the end of the decade, potentially surpassing all major foreign sovereign holders.





Meanwhile, the central banks of countries in Europe and Asia will likely promote their own digital currencies, or CBDCs, the report noted.

The report pointed to several risks that could hamper the growth. Stablecoins de-pegged nearly 1,900 times in 2023 alone, including more than 600 instances involving major tokens, the report's authors wrote, citing Moody's data. 

In extreme cases, mass redemptions—like those following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that consequently hit USDC—can disrupt crypto liquidity, force automated selloffs and ripple through financial markets, the authors added.

Nasdaq, the operator of one of the premier U.S. stock exchanges and a crypto index, is advising the U.S. regulators to carefully focus on defining digital assets in four buckets that will clearly determine which agency acts as referee, according to a 23-page letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission's crypto task force.



"While a stock by any other word would still be a stock, the existing market ecosystem can readily absorb digital assets by establishing the proper taxonomy and calibrating certain rules to reflect what is truly new and novel about digital assets," the letter argued in response to the invitation issued by the task force's chief, Commissioner Hester Peirce, to weigh in on future regulations.



The four future categories of digital assets, in Nasdaq's view, should be:





The securities categories belong in the hands of the SEC, which will be working with its cousin agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, that will handle the commodities. Those agencies — presumably directed at some point by a new crypto law hatched by Congress — will figure out the precise border between their jurisdictions.

The letter, signed by John Zecca, the company's chief regulator executive, argued that "digital assets that constitute financial securities must trade as they do today."

Nasdaq also suggested that the two agencies should formulate a kind of crossover trading designation for platforms that can handle digital asset investment contracts, commodities and other types of assets under one roof.



In the letter, Nasdaq underlined its digital-asset credibility, saying its "trading and clearing services, market and trading surveillance, and central securities depository technology support digital assets platforms on six continents." It contended that the regulators should consider imposing safety measures or further constraints on firms that want to handle investors' activity from top to bottom, which is the common approach of existing crypto firms.

American fund manager Bitwise Asset Management has registered a trust entity named Bitwise NEAR ETF in Delaware — a move that typically precedes a formal filing with the SEC for an exchange-traded product that would track NEAR, the native asset of the NEAR Protocol.

If successful, Bitwise's proposed fund would be the first US-based ETF tied to the layer 1 blockchain focused on scalability and developer accessibility.

Prior to Bitwise's move, other asset managers such as 21Shares and Grayscale had already introduced NEAR-related investment products. 21Shares offers the 21Shares NEAR Protocol Staking ETP, providing exposure to NEAR tokens along with staking rewards.

Meanwhile, Grayscale operates the Grayscale NEAR Trust, a private placement vehicle that gives accredited investors access to NEAR, though it is not structured as an ETF.

A US-listed NEAR ETF would expand institutional access to the token as it offers a regulated, exchange-traded vehicle. The ETF structure enables institutions to gain exposure to NEAR without the complexities of managing private keys, custody arrangements, or wallet infrastructure.

Plus, by tracking the spot price of the underlying asset and disclosing holdings daily, the ETF provides real-time price transparency and a closer alignment with market value—features critical for portfolio management and compliance.

Bitwise, a pioneer in crypto asset investment products, had over $5 billion in assets under management as of October 2024, marking a 400% increase in that year, the firm said in a statement.

The company manages a wide range of investment products, including crypto index funds, thematic equity ETFs, spot crypto ETPs, multi-strategy alpha solutions, separately managed accounts, and private funds.

Bitwise's spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which launched in January 2024, has grown to $3.6 billion in assets under management, according to the latest data. Despite being on the market for just over a year, BITB ranks among the top-performing Bitcoin funds, with steady growth and strong investor demand.

In addition to NEAR, Bitwise is aiming for ETFs related to other leading crypto assets, such as XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana, to name a few.

The new registration is part of Bitwise's ongoing effort to expand its digital asset offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, as institutional appetite for altcoin exposure gains momentum.

Bitwise, as well as other fund managers, anticipate that a crypto-friendly environment in the Trump era will help accelerate the approval and adoption of crypto investment products.

Earlier this week, Trump Media and Crypto.com finalized a deal to launch America-first ETFs, including ones tied to Cronos. The parties said they aimed to benefit from pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration.

Whether the growing lineup of proposed crypto funds will ultimately reach the market depends on the securities regulator. Newly sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins, along with other Commissioners, is expected to review and rule on several pending ETF applications in the coming months.

The Fed has urged banks to be vigilant around crypto-related risks

US banking regulators announced on Thursday they were pulling back several documents that urge banks to show caution when dabbling in cryptocurrency and related activities.

The Federal Reserve said it was withdrawing a pair of supervisory letters stipulating that banks should seek advance approval from regulators before engaging in crypto-asset and stablecoin activities.

In addition, the Fed joined the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in withdrawing a pair of 2023 statements urging banks to be vigilant around crypto-related risks.

Under the prior guidance, regulators warned banks to be wary of volatility, legal uncertainty and liquidity risks when considering whether to provide crypto-related services or take on crypto companies as clients.

Scrapping that guidance marks the latest move by the Trump administration to strike a more crypto-friendly stance. In its statement announcing the changes, the Fed said regulators would be looking into whether new guidance to "support innovation, including crypto-asset activities, is appropriate."

In March, the OCC was the first US regulator to move to make it easier for banks to engage in crypto activities, similarly moving to scrap guidance adopted under the previous administration urging banks to be cautious in the space.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have roared back as a leak reveals U.S. president Donald Trump's radical plans for crypto are causing growing “panic" among the establishment.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has climbed toward $100,000 per bitcoin, up from April lows of around $75,000, as bullish traders bet the market is heading toward a $19 trillion “tipping point.”

Now, as fears swirl crypto “contagion" could blow up the financial system, the Federal Reserve has quietly rolled back rules that deterred Wall Street from engaging with bitcoin and crypto—just as institutional investors push up the bitcoin price.

The Federal Reserve has announced it is withdrawing guidance originally issued under Democratic Party president Joe Biden that deterred Wall Street banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities by requiring them to get advance approval.

"The Board is rescinding its 2022 supervisory letter establishing an expectation that state member banks provide advance notification of planned or current crypto-asset activities," the board of governors of the Federal Reserve wrote in a statement.

The move sees the Fed join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in withdrawing their own statements that called on banks to be extra vigilant around crypto-related risks.

Under the guidance, the Fed had warned banks to be wary of volatility, legal uncertainty and liquidity risks when considering whether to provide crypto-related services or take on crypto companies as clients.

“With these restrictions now lifted state member banks can pursue crypto ventures without prior approval though such activities will still be monitored through standard supervision," analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

"This move reflects the Trump administration's increasingly pro-crypto stance including reduced regulatory enforcement, support for a national bitcoin reserve and the appointment of a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, Paul Atkins, known for backing digital assets.”

The move has been welcomed as a victory over the Biden era rules that had been described as a clandestine "Operation Choke Point 2.0" by some and at least led to banks backing away from crypto. One anonymous crypto banking advocate told Decrypt the Fed is “moving in the right direction.”

"Banks are now free to begin supporting bitcoin," Strategy founder Michael Saylor, posted to X in response to the Fed's statement.

Over the last year, following the debut of a fleet of wildly successful spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wall Street, banks have been rushing to offer bitcoin and crypto to clients.

This week, the bitcoin ETFs recorded their best day since January, breaking their downward trend as trades go “risk on” in response to reports the U.S. and China are seeking off-ramps from the global trade war. The bitcoin price climbed as gold fell in the aftermath claims China is considering exempting some goods from U.S. tariffs.

However, The announcement stopped short of officially changing the Fed's policies when it comes to granting crypto-focused banks master accounts, giving members direct access to the Fed's services.

Crypto-focused banks like Custodia and Kraken Financial have for years campaigned for master accounts with the Fed.

"Looking ahead, markets will closely monitor US administration policies and Federal Reserve actions," Joel Kruger, Market Strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments, adding the market remains closely attuned to the Fed's interest rates, the risk of recession and the possibility of a return of quantitative easing.

“Despite signs of the president softening his trade stance, uncertainty persists about the U.S. economy's trajectory. Pressure is mounting on the Fed to cut rates more aggressively, which could trigger broader U.S. dollar outflows.”

Will crypto banking soon be just like fiat banking?

Or better yet, will there soon be no difference at all?

That sets up the entire crypto sector, from Bitcoin to the best altcoins altcoins and meme coins, for ever-greater success.

Here's what the latest developments mean.

Back in 2023, after the epic FTX collapse, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency all required banks and financial institutions to give prior notice to regulators before undertaking crypto activities.

‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0,' as crypto folks call it, served to limit collaborations.

But now, with the Trump administration changing the crypto landscape, that restriction has been removed. It adds another level of legitimacy and enhances the accessibility of crypto.

Importantly, the change of rules doesn't give crypto-focused banks access to so-called ‘master accounts,' required for Fed members to access the central bank's services.

So far, the Fed has refused to give any crypto bank master account access. Will the abolition of the chokepoint be a first step towards that goal?

It feels like PayPal might somehow be flying under the radar, but the company still managed to generate nearly $32B in profit in 2024, when $1.6T was spent on the platform.

Now, Coinbase is partnering with PayPal to give $PYUSD a bit of a boost. The centralized exchange will waive purchase fees for $PYUSD and make it easier for users to swap the stablecoin 1:1 for USD; that could make the stablecoin an attractive on- and off-ramp option for crypto-to-fiat moves.

If Coinbase and PayPal can help to make stablecoins mainstream, that could in turn boost broader adoption. Some analysts see stablecoins as on the verge of a ‘ChatGPT moment,' ready to move from fringe use cases to an integral part of everyday life.

There's already been considerable growth in recent months.



Continued growth could send the stablecoin market cap – currently $211M – skyrocketing to new levels.

Even their low-end estimate sees stablecoins reaching $1.6T.

With stablecoins growing and the Federal Reserve moving further towards crypto approval, are the scales tilting back towards altcoins again?

The market is certainly more favorable for non-Bitcoin cryptos than it used to be. Here are three of the best altcoins to keep your eyes on.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) brings the blockchain to the content creator economy. Relationships between creators and fans are vital for the success of content creators, and $SUBBD token brings increased clarity and ease of access to the growing SUBBD platform.

Token benefits include:

There's a flat 20% APY on $SUBBD tokens for the first year, after which staking moves towards a platform benefits model. The more you stake, the more XP multipliers you'll receive on the SUBBD platform.



Content creation is an established market sector worth over $85B; $SUBBD token could transform it entirely. The platform provides a suite of AI tools for better content management for creators and gives fans access to exclusive content such as behind-the-scenes and live streams.

Learn how to buy $SUBBD token, and see why we think the token price – currently $0.05525 – could reach $0.301 by the end of the year. The presale is heating up; the project has raised over $255M already.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers a next-gen crypto wallet with an intuitive interface and features tailored for beginners and power users alike.

The wallet allows users to quickly and easily buy, sell, and swap crypto. It's built to be the only wallet you'll ever need, and comes loaded with features to find the next big thing in crypto – such as the Upcoming Tokens section.

Ondo Finance ($ONDO) is bridging TradFi and DeFi by offering tokenized exposure to real-world assets. Aimed at institutional investors, Ondo provides exposure to short-term US Treasuries with $OUSG and yield from stablecoins with $USDY.

Those are institution-only products, but everyday investors can snag $ONDO for indirect exposure.



The altcoin is up nearly 21% in the past week, making big gains on the back of better and better news for the broader crypto regulatory landscape. As institutions increasingly look for compliant crypto exposure, Ondo is positioning itself as a go-to platform.

The project made the news recently for meetings between its CEO Nathan Allman and officials from the SEC. The discussions focused on tokenizing publicly traded US securities, offering yet another investment vehicle for major financial institutions.

The best altcoins are gaining steam, as investors look for projects that offer unique ways to get in early and potentially ride the next wave of gains.

As always, do your own research – none of this is financial advice. Crypto remains volatile, and you should only invest what you can afford to lose.

But each of these best altcoins brings major upside potential in a market looking for ways to expand crypto adoption and take advantage of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment.

 Bitcoin's growing decoupling from US equities is fueling its appeal as a safe-haven asset alongside gold, BlackRock's Jay Jacobs told CNBC. 

Central banks, particularly China, may start to shift away from US Treasurys, exploring alternatives such as gold and Bitcoin, according to Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's head of thematics and active ETFs.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Jacobs said that geopolitical tensions and rising global uncertainty are accelerating diversification strategies among central banks.

He pointed to a long-term trend where countries have been reducing their reliance on dollar-based reserves in favor of assets like gold and, increasingly, Bitcoin (BTC).

“This whole diversification away from traditional assets and into things like gold and also crypto [...] probably began three, four years ago,” Jacobs explained.

He said that recent geopolitical fragmentation has intensified the push toward alternative stores of value.

Jacobs referenced growing concerns about the freezing of $300 billion in Russian central bank assets following its invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that such events have prompted countries like China to rethink their reserve strategies.

During the interview, Jacobs said BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has identified geopolitical fragmentation as a defining force for global markets over the coming decades:

He noted that this environment is fueling demand for uncorrelated assets, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed alongside gold as a safe-haven asset.

“We've seen significant inflows into gold ETFs. We've seen significant inflows into Bitcoin. And this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently,” Jacobs said.

Notably, Jacobs is not alone in stressing Bitcoin's declining correlation with US equities. Several analysts have also observed that Bitcoin is beginning to decouple from the US stock market.

On April 22, Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of the Nansen crypto intelligence platform, said Bitcoin's price is showcasing its growing maturity as a global asset, becoming “less Nasdaq — more gold.”

He added that Bitcoin was “surprisingly resilient” amid the trade war compared to altcoins and indexes like the S&P 500, but remains vulnerable to economic recession concerns.

Echoing this sentiment, QCP Capital said in an April 21 Telegram note that Bitcoin seemed to be sharing some of gold's limelight as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

“With equities finishing last week in the red and extending an April drawdown, the narrative of BTC as a safe haven or inflation hedge is once again gaining traction. Should this dynamic hold, it could provide a fresh tailwind for institutional BTC allocation,” it wrote.

BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has just blasted through the $5 million mark in its ICO. 

This Bitcoin-linked meme coin is generating serious buzz by promising actual BTC airdrops when Bitcoin hits milestone prices.

And with one top analyst predicting “huge” returns post-listing, BTCBULL is quickly becoming a hot topic.

BTC Bull Token's setup is drawing lots of attention.

Think of it as your ticket to Bitcoin's next bull run – without needing to shell out $90K+ for a whole coin.

Here's how it works: When Bitcoin hits key price milestones (starting at $150K and moving up in $50K chunks), BTCBULL holders get actual Bitcoin airdropped to their wallets.

If you get involved in the ICO, you're first in line for these payouts.

BTCBULL's team also burns tokens at various Bitcoin price points ($125K, $175K, and $225K), permanently removing them from circulation.

This approach helps create scarcity, which tends to push prices up over time. 

And then there's the staking rewards on offer. 

Early stakers can generate an annual yield of 82%, although this yield will decrease gradually as more people get involved.

However, that hasn't stopped investors from locking up over 1.2 billion BTCBULL tokens already.

The project's Telegram channel members see BTCBULL as a way to bet on Bitcoin's price action while receiving a sort of “dividend” along the way. 

With BTCBULL's ICO price sitting at $0.00248, investors have less than 48 hours before the next price hike kicks in.

The ICO has been gaining serious momentum, with options to buy using crypto, bank cards, or directly through the Best Wallet app – making it accessible to new traders.

BTCBULL's team has also set aside 10% of the supply for initial liquidity.

Popular analyst Crypto ZEUS, who has a sizable following on YouTube, released a video about BTC Bull Token last week.



ZEUS is extremely bullish on BTCBULL's unique milestone system, believing it could create massive wealth for holders if Bitcoin goes on another bull run.

He also pointed out the lack of bull-themed meme coins in today's market.

Most meme coins focus on dogs, cats, or frogs, yet BTCBULL takes an entirely different approach that could help it stand out. 

All in all, Crypto ZEUS is optimistic, predicting BTCBULL could have a “huge 2025.”

So, what does the future hold for BTCBULL? 

If you invest in BTCBULL, you're essentially making a bet on Bitcoin's future – with some interesting twists. 

Bitcoin hitting $125K, $150K, or even $200K this year isn't some crazy fantasy. 

With institutional money still flowing in and supply getting squeezed, these milestones could happen faster than most people expect.

And that's where BTCBULL could prove lucrative.

The first time Bitcoin crosses these thresholds, tokens will be burned (reducing supply) or holders will receive airdrops (increasing demand).

It's a double-whammy that could boost gains far beyond what holding Bitcoin alone would give you.

When Bitcoin runs, investors tend to look for higher beta plays. 

BTCBULL positions itself as one of these plays, and given the size of its X (Twitter) community, it's already building the kind of momentum that could translate into serious FOMO once exchange listings are announced. 

The $5 million milestone might be just the beginning of what could become one of 2025's most talked-about token launches if Bitcoin continues to rise.

 NFT sales volumes reached $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a 61% decline from the same period in 2024. 

Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea regained its position as the leading platform for digital collectible trading, even as overall market activity declined.

Data tracker NFTScan shows that OpenSea has held the top spot in NFT marketplace trading volume for the last 30 days. According to the data, OpenSea holds more than 40% of the market's trading volume, while Blur, its largest competitor, is at 23%. NFT platform Magic Eden has a 7.69% market share, while OKX NFTs have a 5% market share. 

The data tracker also shows that in the last month, almost 70% of the wallets transacting with NFTs engaged with OpenSea. More than 610,000 wallets used OpenSea. In the last three months, OpenSea had over 2.1 million wallets engaging with its platform. 

By comparison, wallets engaging with Magic Eden, Blur and OKX NFT reached a combined market share of 17%, about 103,000 wallets. In the last three months, the platforms had a total of 380,000 wallets trading NFTs on their platforms. 

In the last quarter of 2024, OpenSea promoted the launch of its new platform OS2. OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer said they would “reimagine everything,” and that a new version would come in December.  

On Feb. 13, OpenSea launched the open beta for OS2, allowing the public to finally use its platform after a period of reserved access for private beta users. The NFT marketplace also teased the launch of the project's official token, SEA. 

Apart from launching a revamped NFT marketplace, the project ventured into crypto token trading. 

On April 19, the platform announced that it had opened its Solana trading access for all its users, skipping a scheduled closed beta phase limited to 50,000 users. The new feature allows OpenSea users to trade Solana tokens, including popular memecoins like Bonk and Ai16z. 

In addition to platform developments, the NFT marketplace had also been freed from regulatory scrutiny. On Feb. 22, Finzer said the US Securities and Exchange Commission had dropped its investigation into the digital collectible marketplace.

OpenSea is regaining its market dominance amid a slowdown in NFT sales volumes. CryptoSlam data shows that in Q1 2025, NFT sales volumes reached $1.5 billion. This represented a 61% decline compared to the $4.1 billion volume in the same period in 2024. 

Despite declining sales volumes, some metrics show that NFTs are still interesting to many traders. CryptoSlam shows over 359,000 NFT buyers in the last seven days, a 52% increase compared to the previous week. 

Furthermore, despite the volume slowdown, some collections have shown signs of life. In the last seven days, CryptoPunks surged 82% in sales. In the last 30 days, the collection reached almost $20 million in sales volumes.

The founder of the smart contract platform Cardano (ADA), Charles Hoskinson, is warning that the future of Ethereum (ETH) could be in question.

In an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on his YouTube channel, Hoskinson says he doesn't “think Ethereum will survive more than 10 to 15 years.”

According to Hoskinson, Ethereum faces existential threats both from within its ecosystem and externally.

“The [Ethereum] layer-2s will continue to suckle out all of the alpha and people will start fighting and it will get harder and harder for [Ethereum co-founder] Vitalik [Buterin] to be able to hold it together through sheer force of will.

And users will gradually migrate to other places and then they're going to get eclipsed by Bitcoin DeFi (decentralized finance). Because once that turns on, the TVL (total value locked) will be larger than Ethereum and a lot of people will start migrating in that particular direction…

…and the other thing is they're being eaten alive by Solana and Sui and these other things.

So, brilliant project. It's just a victim of its own success. Like MySpace [social network] or any of these other things that have a lot of network effect and momentum. BlackBerry [smartphone] is another example. But people have fundamentally different paradigms that over the long term are intrinsically superior. And they creep up on you.”

The Cardano creator says that Ethereum's problems can be traced to three mistakes made by the founders and developers.

“The number one problem Ethereum has is that they took an easy road out where they did three things wrong.

So first off, wrong protocols. They have the wrong accounting model, they have the wrong virtual machine and they have the wrong consensus model.

All of these were self-inflicted wounds. People told them not to do it, they did it and they got where they needed to go.

Second, what they chose to do to solve these problems is put in all these weird slashing economics and layer-twos and other things and now they're living with all of the consequences of these types of things.

And third, they really don't have a good on-chain governance system

So really what needs to happen is you need a parallel track with solving all those three things.”

As NFT adoption expands across digital markets, the blending of collectible culture, gamified incentives, and blockchain-based utility continues to deepen. This fusion is especially noticeable in platforms that rank among the highest rated casinos, where mechanics like digital ownership, scarcity-driven value, and interactive rewards closely reflect those found in many NFT ecosystems. Understanding how these systems intersect can offer NFT enthusiasts new perspectives on utility, interactivity, and value in decentralized environments.

NFTs have transcended their origins as mere digital collectibles. Today's landscape of NFTs revolves around stakeable assets, dynamic smart contracts, and real-time utility in metaverse platforms and play-to-earn ecosystems. Projects such as Sorare and Axie Infinity have set a new standard with their NFTs that allow for aesthetic ownership as well as earning, trading, and participating in a wider economic system.

Additionally, this active engagement model mirrors strategies of many high-performing digital platforms. To retain users, these platforms entice repeat participation by creating incrementally rewarding systems, tiered perks, and gamified value roll-up schemes. The passive and value-driven interactions that both industries emphasize were the innovative system that allowed for fresh methods to participate in the engagement.

NFT platforms have a wide range of features, and the most sophisticated digital casinos all have one thing in common: the loyalty program and engagement-centered recreation promote off-activity association toward predefined NFT or tokenomic value targets they need to achieve or milestones they unlock through participation. Earned, spent, or redeemable tokens propel engagement forward.

Loyalty points are allocated for every interaction; users are automatically placed in levels that can be infinitely progressed. Even more sophisticated systems allow for custom point scoring that can be set by the users themselves. Achievements are literally unlimited. The challenge comes from crafting fair engagement models that earn users' earned social capital through posted interactions and incentivize user engagement at sustainable levels while maintaining verifiably transparent token economics.

Minting events commonly use random number generators to create exciting surprises through NFT drops and listing events. Generative art and gaming equipment creation are great examples. Projects such as Capsule House and Art Blocks thrive on this mechanic, introducing unprecedented freedom into partnered user experiences.

The same aspect of likelihood determines the defining characteristics of interactive digital entertainment ecosystems. Interactive digital platforms often implement RNG to ensure fairness and uniqueness; some are even audited under regulatory scrutiny. The connected industry applies RNG in similar ways, depicting how both industries are attempting to blend randomness with value, wherein the outcome is both pleasantly unexpected and extremely desirable.

NFT platforms operate on the basis of community building. Users can participate in DAOs, vote on roadmap decisions, or create assets—all these activities contribute to shaping NFT ecosystems. It is striking to point out that leading NFT projects have focused on transparency and usefulness of value over time, which explains why they sustain community engagement.

There are examples that illustrate this participatory model: those centered around user innovation. Take, for instance, the most popular casinos and countless other platforms that use a sharpened focus on engagement. Responsibly driven engagement tools make users devoted to the brand, along with transparent communication. Such platforms often foster stronger communities and experience growth over time as opposed to those that view users as passive pieces of hardware. Success, in both spaces, relies on the amount of funding and outreach incentive provided to communities.

With the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital assets are becoming a means of personal expression. From NFT profile picture collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club to avatar skins in metaverse games, NFTs offer status and functionality to their owners. These assets can be used across various platforms and are not limited to gaming, branding, or social networking; they serve multiple purposes.

This cross-platform use comes hand-in-hand with other engagement trends, such as loyalty programs that reward user interaction in the highest-rated casinos. In every form, users are more than just players or holders: They actively participate in ecosystems where their contributions and assets matter continually.

The NFT space continuously incorporates parts from established digital sectors, creating an ever-expanding digital environment. The broader application of fundamental principles like RNG, tokenomics, gamified advancement, and participatory governance underscores the emerging innovation nexus between NFTs and other decentralized ecosystems. Studying how the highest-rated casinos engage users with transparent, fair, and value-driven policies can help the NFT domain define sustainable growth strategies.

The advancement of NFT platforms with a focus on user experience, engagement, and openness will mark industry leaders. The future does not rest in the separation of industries but rather in recognizing the cross-sections of blockchain technologies and their proven ecosystems and determining how to synergistically grow.

 Documentary directors Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple reveal how their film's mere existence is a use case for crypto in filmmaking. 

When Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple had the idea to make the documentary film Vitalik: An Ethereum Story, they were actually filming another documentary, and over the course of their filmmaking journey, they ended up capturing both a deeper, human look at the world of crypto and an end product that serves as a use case for the future of crypto filmmaking.

When crafting a documentary, filmmakers will typically start with a vision of what they'd like to explore, a vision often saddled with a set of assumptions, only to shatter that vision once filming begins, creating an entirely new direction for the project.

It's a creative evolution that filmmakers Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple also experienced while making the documentary feature This Is Not Financial Advice, during which they realized they had an entirely different film on their hands.

“While we were making that film, we wanted to interview Vitalik Buterin,” Ingrasci said to me during a recent interview. “We got connected to him, but as soon as we met him, we were really inspired by his unique form of tech optimism and how he broke stereotypes we'd had of the crypto space. He was a billionaire but very humble, funny, quirky and truly committed to his values of decentralization. That was very inspiring for us — so much so, we thought we should make a piece about Vitalik or about the Ethereum community at large.”



But Ingrasci and Temple weren't crypto-native filmmakers — rather, they were individuals interested in technology and communities using technology in new ways, and Vitalik and Ethereum just happened to check both of those boxes.

Ingrasci and Temple then went out and launched a non-fungible token (NFT) crowdfunding campaign, raising almost $2 million in 50 hours, allowing them to get started quickly in the summer of 2021 during the height of the NFT boom.

“It allowed us to own the film without being beholden to any stakeholder, platform or middleman who would otherwise be directing the content of the film,” Temple said. “It was an amazing opportunity to spend over two years following Vitalik — a global nomad — all around the world.”

Temple and Ingrasci followed Buterin to Ukraine, Montenegro, Toronto and Colombia, trying to understand the man behind the technology. They even spent time with Buterin's father and his family members, diving into the history of his family emigrating from Russia to Canada.

“We wanted to understand how Vitalik's upbringing had affected his values,” Temple said. “We spent time talking with folks in the Ethereum community, with Vitalik's friends and others, trying to paint this deeper picture and understand how the creators of crypto technologies affect the end product. How are they coding their values, blindspots and interests into the end result?”

From the beginning, Temple and Ingrasci's main goal was to create a piece that would be accessible to a mainstream audience, one that could help translate some of the values and interesting things they were seeing in the Ethereum community in a way that a non-crypto native person could understand.

But they didn't really know what that meant or what it would lead to initially since they were following different stories and different people within the Ethereum ecosystem. As they were editing the documentary together, they started testing it with people who knew nothing about crypto, who, as expected, were very confused.

“It's so difficult to create a documentary that's accessible and entertaining for people who know nothing about the crypto space, but we saw very clearly in the feedback from these early screenings that when people could connect to someone — especially Vitalik, who is so likeable and inspiring — it creates an entry point to then get into these more abstract concepts,” Ingrasci said.

“We did not set out to make the film only about Vitalik, and I don't think the film is only about Vitalik,” Ingrasci told Cointelegraph.

“Vitalik is our human hook, our human story about someone who is going to surprise you, break your stereotypes about crypto, and leave you a little more excited than you thought you would be after watching this film.”

According to Ingrasci, Buterin's favorite scenes in the film were when he was drinking tea or making breakfast — being his normal, quirky, funny self.

“That's what makes this film entertaining, watchable and human,” Ingrasci said. “When someone is willing to be natural on camera with us as filmmakers, it creates a much more human story rather than this very intellectual version of Vitalik that we were already very aware of.”

During the filming of Vitalik, Buterin's father talked to the filmmakers about how, growing up, Buterin's favorite toy was the computer, and his favorite thing was to play with Excel. 

“When he was seven years old, he actually built a 100-page manifesto that was an imaginary world for bunnies,” Temple said. “It had their financial systems, energy systems and was full of graphs and tables — an amazing creation for a seven-year-old's mind. I think to so many of the people we shared this with, it helps people connect to the world of Ethereum as a new world being built. If you can imagine Vitalik as a seven-year-old building this whole new imaginary world, that's what he's trying to build again with Ethereum.”

It's all part of Buterin's hope for Ethereum creating real utility in the world, something Ingrasci felt was epitomized when Buterin visited Ukraine.

“When he went to Ukraine, he was talking to the vice prime minister, Fedorov, and it quickly became apparent that the banking system at the beginning of the war was in shambles,” Ingrasci said. “Without crypto, thousands of lives in the military would have been lost because crypto was able to get money very quickly to the front lines and was able to mobilize across borders, raising over $130 million for Ukraine to resist this invasion. When Vitalik was there visiting Kyiv during the war, he got to see this thing he helped create being used in this incredibly important way, and that's where that world-building came into reality. It was an emotional moment to witness just how powerful it was.”

In many ways it's because Buterin is simply a child at play, tapping into his inner youthful creativity, only now with an adult mind and body and the relationships and resources to execute on his ideas.

“Vitalik has said he's a builder and a thinker first and foremost,” Temple said. “An interesting tension for him during filming was how people looked to him to be something more, to be this leader and representative of the entire crypto movement. Throughout the film, he wrestles with how much to use his voice, how much to become a leader and how much to speak out against things he doesn't always agree with. He eventually does decide to speak out against speculation and say that he doesn't think Ethereum was designed to trade million-dollar monkeys and that there's a lot more we can do to fix systems and help people.”

It's a humanizing element of a pedestaled tech founder, epitomizing how at times we all struggle with speaking up on our values — especially when those values are different or run counter to the dynamics of our own social circles and society at large.

And that's the power of Vitalik. The film is not just about crypto; it's about the human stories that can resonate beyond the immediate environment the film is in — crypto just happens to be the backdrop.

Quite a bold story to tell by a couple of “non-native” crypto filmmakers.

“We've actually used crypto for a lot of elements in the distribution process for this film, which is exciting because the documentary space is broken,” Ingrasci said. “For an independent documentary to happen, it's just so difficult these days. A lot of streamers have a lot of control over the film you ultimately make, but because we were able to crypto-crowdfund in the beginning on Mirror, we were able to have creative control over the film.”

Ingrasci and Temple executed a movie trailer drop through Zora and an early onchain release of the film this past September on Bonfire, both powered by Web3, which helped raise the funds the duo is currently using to market the documentary to mainstream audiences.

“A lot of independent filmmakers have zero marketing budget; there's very little money in documentaries. But instead [because of our crypto-crowdfunding], we're able to really make sure the trailer, the message and the film gets out there.”

In this way, Ingrasci and Temple have created a sub-narrative around the making of a film using crypto-native tools, providing a real-world use case for other filmmakers on how they, too, might find success by utilizing blockchain platforms for the creation of their own film projects.

“I think there's so much potential for these tools to have a big impact on filmmakers, though we're still at the beginning,” said Ingrasci. “It's still difficult to understand, and the complexities are not abstracted away enough. The short initial onchain release of the film — while a testament — was very difficult for people who were not in crypto to access it.”

But ultimately, the decentralized theatrical release of the film occurred in 24 countries and 30 cities all around the world, all on the same night.

“At the premiere in New York where we were, somebody came up to me and was, like, ‘I feel like I can share this with someone, and they'll finally understand what I do for a living and why I do it,'” Temple said. “Those kinds of reactions — the ‘I feel seen' and ‘I feel understood as a technologist' — as a filmmaker, hearing those reactions from people who are trying to build new systems is the dream.”



For Ingrasci and Temple, the dream continues to evolve, with their film now available all around the world on mainstream platforms such as Apple and Prime Video.

“If the goal is to be able to make a film you can send to your mom — while she might not understand what Ethereum is, she'll understand why you're interested in this thing — so I think we did that,” Ingrasci said.

“Vitalik believes technology can be used to make our lives better, especially today when there's a lot of polarization and cynicism surrounding blockchain tech and questions around if it's worth it. If we use these technologies in good ways and invest the energy into finding real use cases for them, it can make our lives better, and Vitalik showed us these are questions worth asking.”

The race for the top 10 crypto positions is gaining steam among LTC, SUI, Hedera and the new crypto star Remittix (RTX). Let's find out why top crypto analysts believe these are some of the best altcoins to buy right now.

This Ethereum-based dApp has pioneered a DeFi payment solution that connects crypto to local payment networks across the world, making it a breeze for individuals and small businesses to send/receive fiat to any bank in the world using crypto.



By merging the speed of crypto with the convenience of everyday banking apps, Remittix eliminates the delays and hidden costs associated with traditional intermediaries like banks, enabling users to enjoy same-day cross-border payments at a flat fee.

That's why market pundits believe this new PayFi kingpin is well-positioned to shake the $750 billion cross-border remittance economy. Capturing even 4% of this treasure chest of cash will be enough to send the Remittix market cap to $30 billion, making RTX a top 10 crypto asset.

In the past month, LTC dropped by 10%, bringing its yearly losses to 4%, but there's hope! In early April, LTC revisited the $63 zone, a vital weekly demand zone where the altcoin shot up in Q4 last year, reaching a new high above $140.

Recently, the LTC price has been pushing up, signalling a heavy buying presence with a 30% jump from the dip. That makes LTC one of the best altcoins to buy now for investors looking for average returns.

After reaching an ATH of $5.3, the SUI price has been crumbling for months thanks to a ruthless market-wide correction. The protracted downturn brought SUI to a vital weekly zone in the $1.7 level at the start of April, providing a killer “buy low” opportunity.

As the chart above shows, investors have been jumping in lately to slurp the dip, rotating the SUI price back up. SUI is now up over 25% monthly and appears to be holding strongly above $2 with an impressive $124% early yield.

Ranked 11th on the crypto leaderboard with a $9.5B market cap, SUI looks like one of the best altcoins to buy now.

After trickling down for months from its January high of $0.4, HBAR appears to have found a bottom in the $0.12 region. Investors appear to have been waiting for the HBAR price to enter this zone to double up.

Lately, HBAR has gained over 40% from the dip, reducing its monthly losses to a mere 8%, which is indicative of heavy buying pressure. An 88% bullish community sentiment adds to HBAR‘s bullish case, making Hedera one of the best altcoins to buy now for solid gains.

While LTC, HBAR, and SUI are strong contenders for the top 10 crypto position, RTX is the new presale gem that analysts believe will outperform them all. Investors have already poured over $14.5 million into the Remittix presale, pushing the altcoin over 400% from its entry price.

Jump in and load your RTX bag today at the $0.0757 floor price before it inches up to $0.0781 in the next presale phase.

Discover the exciting opportunities of the Remittix (RTX) presale today!

Ethereum's price has recently mirrored broader trends in the cryptocurrency market, rising to above $1,800 before retracing as part of a wider market correction.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,754, showing a 3.3% decrease in the past 24 hours, while the total crypto market cap slipped by 3.6% during the same period.

Although short-term price movements reflect shifting momentum, on-chain metrics signal deeper changes that may have broader implications for Ethereum's network health and investor sentiment.

Ethereum Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Inflows Hit Multi-Year Highs

Recent data from CryptoQuant reveals that long-term Ethereum holders are increasing their activity. These wallets, known for never selling their ETH, have seen one of their highest inflows in recent years.

This coincides with rising network activity, including a notable uptick in active addresses and transactional volume. Together, these developments suggest that behind the surface-level volatility, there may be a quiet phase of accumulation and user engagement building within the Ethereum ecosystem.

CryptoQuant contributor OnChainSchool reports a significant development among Ethereum's long-term holding addresses. In the last 48 hours, over 640,000 ETH flowed into wallets that have maintained a strict accumulation pattern without any recorded selling behavior.

This marks the largest inflow to such wallets since 2018, suggesting that entities with a long-term outlook are increasing their exposure during the current price range.

The behavior of these accumulation-only wallets is often viewed as a proxy for investor conviction, particularly among participants who are not influenced by short-term volatility.

According to OnChainSchool, this activity during a period of price drawdown may reflect strategic positioning ahead of potential future developments.

It's also notable that these inflows come at a time when Ethereum fundamentals such as its transition to proof-of-stake, L2 adoption, and evolving staking mechanisms continue to advance. If sustained, this trend could help establish a support zone around current price levels.

Network Activity Rises as Active Addresses See Double-Digit Growth

Complementing the rise in long-term holder activity is a surge in Ethereum network usage. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Carmelo Alemán, highlights that the number of active Ethereum addresses grew by nearly 10% between April 20 and April 22, jumping from around 306,000 to over 336,000.

This metric counts unique wallet addresses that were involved in transactions as either senders or receivers over a given period. While active addresses alone do not capture the full picture, Alemán notes that the metric should be viewed alongside others such as exchange volume, gas fees, transaction count, and Layer 2 activity.

The rise in address activity, especially when paired with a simultaneous price increase, is often taken as a sign of broader user engagement and growing application-layer demand.

DraftKings, the popular sports betting and fantasy sports company, has agreed to a $10 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning its now-defunct non-fungible token (NFT) platform, DK Marketplace. The lawsuit alleged that DraftKings sold unregistered securities in the form of NFTs, leaving many buyers at financial risk.

The class-action lawsuit was filed in March 2023 by lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who argued that DraftKings' Reignmakers NFTs qualified as investment contracts under U.S. securities law, specifically based on the Howey Test. This legal standard is used by courts to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security.

You can learn more about the Howey Test from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) here:🔗 https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets

In July 2024, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper denied DraftKings' motion to dismiss the case. The judge applied the Howey Test and found that the NFTs could reasonably be treated as securities, giving the lawsuit significant legal weight.

Following this decision, DraftKings shut down its NFT platform, leaving thousands of users with illiquid assets that dropped drastically in value.

The $10 million class-action settlement was preliminarily approved on February 28, 2025. According to court filings, the money will be distributed among individuals who bought, sold, or held DraftKings NFTs between August 11, 2021, and the final judgment date.

This could involve more than 175,000 investors, according to reports from Cointelegraph and SBC Americas.

After deducting legal fees and administrative expenses, the settlement funds will be shared proportionally among eligible class members. Lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe is also expected to receive a $50,000 service award for representing the class.

DraftKings cited “recent legal developments” as the reason for shutting down its NFT marketplace, a move that left Reignmakers NFTs illiquid and virtually worthless. With no platform for resale or trade, users who had invested in the NFTs were left with little recourse.

This closure also came shortly after DraftKings reached a separate undisclosed settlement in January 2025 with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), which had sued the company for using NFL player likenesses in Reignmakers without paying royalties.

More about the NFLPA can be found at their official site: 🔗 https://www.nflpa.com/

If you are a U.S. resident who purchased, sold, or held a DraftKings NFT through DK Marketplace during the defined class period, you may be eligible to claim part of the settlement.

Claimants should keep an eye on official notifications or updates via legal settlement portals. Details about claim submission deadlines and methods will be published following final settlement approval by the court.

This case adds to a growing list of legal actions targeting crypto and NFT platforms over alleged securities violations. It underscores increasing regulatory scrutiny of digital assets and reinforces the need for consumer protection in evolving financial markets.

DraftKings' $10 million payout marks a significant moment in the legal landscape surrounding NFTs and digital assets. 

While the company has not admitted wrongdoing, the settlement offers partial financial redress to affected users and sets a precedent for how courts may treat NFT-based products in the future.

As digital finance continues to evolve, this case serves as a strong reminder to investors: do your due diligence, understand the risks, and follow regulatory developments closely.

Rumors of a Pokémon Web3 entry via a Sui blockchain partnership are circulating due to recent policy updates and deleted mentions.

Sui's price and market activity have surged, fueled by speculation and positive market momentum.

While exciting, the Pokémon-Sui connection remains speculative without concrete proof.

Something curious is happening in the world of crypto – and it has Pokémon fans and blockchain watchers leaning in. A quiet update, a surprise privacy policy change, and a few fast edits to a blog post have sparked talk that The Pokémon Company might be dipping its toes into Web3 through a partnership with the Sui blockchain.

Nothing is confirmed yet, but the signs are starting to add up.

On April 23, Pokémon HOME introduced a new feature that lets users collect medals. At first glance, it seemed like a small, routine update. But the real surprise came in the updated privacy policy.

In certain regions, the policy now includes a mention of Parasol Technologies—a new name for most users. But here's why that caught the crypto community's attention: Parasol was recently acquired by Mysten Labs, the team behind the Sui blockchain.

This quiet policy change has led many to believe there could be a bigger collaboration in the works between Pokémon and the world of blockchain.

Adding to the mystery, the Sui Foundation announced on the same day that Parasol would be launching blockchain-based trading card games. In an early version of the blog post, Pokémon NFTs were mentioned—only for the reference to be quickly removed.

This move didn't go unnoticed. A well-known crypto commentator known as Shotgun pointed out that the new medals in Pokémon HOME aren't just static tokens—they could potentially be digital collectibles that are tradable, adding a whole new layer of excitement if they're connected to blockchain.

While some are hyped, others are more cautious. One user on X reminded everyone that crypto is no stranger to overhyped speculation. Without actual contracts or blockchain code to examine, there's still no solid proof that Pokémon is officially involved with Sui.

For now, the idea of a Pokémon-Sui partnership remains just that – a possibility.

rumors and speculation drive hype cycles but rarely reflect reality. show me the contracts, show me the code. until then it's just noise in the signal.

While rumors swirl, SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, is making major moves of its own. The token recently broke through key resistance levels and is now trading comfortably above $3.00.

Crypto analyst Ted Pillows noted that if this momentum continues, SUI could climb to around $3.80 to $4.00 by early May. Large holders, known as whales, have started accumulating more SUI, and daily trading volume has surged past $128 million. That's a strong sign of growing interest.

The Sui ecosystem is thriving, with its native token ranked 13th in market cap at $9.88 billion. SUI's recent price surge to over $3.00 reflects a 26% increase in a single day, driven by high trading volumes and rising investor interest. The ecosystem's total market cap has exceeded $15.79 billion, with SUI making up 90.5% of it.

Whether you're deep into crypto or a longtime Pokémon fan, the idea of Pokémon entering the blockchain world is a major headline. While there's no official word yet, the clues are getting harder to ignore.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

SUI's price is up today due to Partnership rumors between Pokémon and the Sui blockchain. Additionally, SUI has broken through key resistance levels, supported by bullish technical indicators. Increased trading volume and growth in the Sui ecosystem, especially in DeFi, have further added to the momentum.

​As of now, there is no official confirmation that Pokémon is entering the Web3 space through a partnership with the Sui blockchain. Speculation has been fueled by recent developments, including a Pokémon HOME privacy policy update mentioning Parasol Technologies, a blockchain gaming studio acquired by Mysten Labs, the team behind Sui.

Metrics details

Tracing sources and assessing intervention effectiveness are crucial for controlling atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution. Isotopic techniques enable precise top-down tracing, but the absence of long-term, global-scale multi-compound isotopic data limits comprehensive analysis. Here, we establish a blockchain-based isotopic database, compiling 34,815 isotopic fingerprints of global PM and its emissions from 1,890 pollution events across 66 countries. This allows retrospective analysis and predictions, revealing that PM sources are distinct, dynamically changing over time, and often asynchronous with interventions. Additionally, we estimate source contributions to PM2.5 and its compounds, highlighting the increasing impact of biomass burning. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2100, PM levels may decline to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m³ in the Americas and 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m³ in Asia under climate mitigation scenarios but will still exceed WHO guidelines without further controls on natural emissions. Guiding future interventions with isotopic big data is essential for addressing air pollution challenges.

Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts Earth's radiation budget1, global climate2, and public health3,4. Exposure to ambient PM, even at low concentrations, harms human health5. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the recommended annual PM2.5 (PM ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) exposure limit to 5 μg/m3 in 20216. However, recent global estimates indicate that 99.82% of the land area and 99.99% of the population are still exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding this limit6. This underscores PM pollution as a pressing global challenge, necessitating effective interventions.

Precisely tracing PM emissions and evaluating the effectiveness of past pollution interventions are essential for designing future PM strategies. However, it is difficult because PM composition is complex, including both local emissions and regional transport7. The pollution levels exhibit a complex nonlinear relationship with emissions. This introduces uncertainties in previous bottom-up emission inventories and molecular-/element-based top-down tracing methods8. Recently, isotopic techniques have provided high-precision fingerprints for top-down tracing of PM emissions9. Isotope ratios tend to show distinct signatures (i.e., fingerprints) among various sources due to different formation processes10. Importantly, these isotopic fingerprints are preserved through complex atmospheric processes11. To date, 14 elemental isotopes, carbon (fM-14C for radioactive; δ13C for stable), nitrogen (δ15N), oxygen (δ18O), silicon (δ30Si), sulfur (δ34S), iron (δ56Fe), nickel (δ60Ni), copper (δ65Cu), zinc (δ66Zn), strontium (δ87Sr), neodymium (δ144Nd), hafnium (δ177Hf), lead (207Pb/206Pb), and mercury (δ202Hg), have been utilized for source tracing of PM species12,13,14,15. Nevertheless, these applications mainly concentrate on short-term PM pollution events on a local scale. Only two global long-term nitrogen isotope studies have focused on nitrates and ammonium12,16, which is inadequate for assessing overall PM. Therefore, a global long-term analysis of PM and their emissions' isotopic big data is particularly important for tracing PM sources and interventions.

To achieve global isotopic big data analysis, we developed the Isotopic Database for Global Atmospheric Research (IDGAR). A blockchain architecture was integrated into IDGAR to ensure the accuracy and traceability of isotopic big data. Based on IDGAR, we created a comprehensive global isotopic map of 1890 pollution events across 66 countries from 1957–2023, revealing the regional-specific source-end isotopic values for PM tracing. Moreover, we identified main emissions and assessed their specific effective intervention durations for different PM species by analyzing the trends and change rates of isotopic big data. Relying on these comprehensions, we estimated the source composition of PM2.5 and its critical components, and characterize the spatiotemporal variations of these source composition. We reveal the rising impact of biomass burning and liquid fossil fuels combustion. Furthermore, we project future PM2.5 trends in scenarios aimed at meeting climate goals of 1.5 °C and 2 °C by 2100. The blockchain-based isotopic big data directly connects PM, sources, and interventions, providing important guidance for future atmospheric research.

We developed the IDGAR database (http://idgar.org/) by compiling 34,815 non-redundant global isotopic observations, including 7,053 source and 27,762 PM isotopic data published between 1957 and 2024 (Supplementary Fig. 1)17. These observations include 14 elements across 1,890 PM pollution events and isotopes such as fM-14C, δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, δ30Si, δ34S, δ56Fe, δ60Ni, δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ87Sr, δ144Nd, δ177Hf, 207Pb/206Pb, and δ202Hg (Supplementary Fig. 1). For light elements (e.g., C, N, S), the isotopic characteristics of different compounds, including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and sulfate (SO42-), have been thoroughly compiled. Moreover, we integrated a blockchain architecture into IDGAR's data management system, ensuring that the isotopic-driven tracing process is immutable and traceable.

Specifically, the curated isotopic data and their details (e.g., sampling date, site location, reference), along with user operations (including authentication information, downloads, and uploads), are transformed into unique 64-character hexadecimal strings using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA256, a cryptographic function) and stored as a block in IDGAR (Supplementary Fig. 1)18,19,20. The SHA256 function is one-way and unbreakable, making the transformed isotopic data tamper-proof. Moreover, each future user action or data update is digitally recorded with timestamps, which are input into the SHA256 function along with the previous block's string to generate a new block string. Through this iterative hashing pattern, each block is closely linked to all preceding blocks in chronological order, thereby systematically growing the blockchain. Even a minor alteration results in distinct changes in subsequent blocks, enabling precise identification of affected blocks and files by tracing back to the initial block that experienced a hash change. By ensuring data tamper-proofing and increasing trust, IDGAR facilitates the accurate and sustainable application of publicly shared atmospheric isotopic big data for researchers worldwide.

To obtain complete and definitive source-end isotopic values for accurately explaining PM origins, we developed the global isotopic map of PM sources based on IDGAR. This map includes the source isotopic fingerprints of various PM species, e.g., EC, OC, NO3-, NH4+, SO42-, and metals, across diverse global regions (from 75.10° S to 83.20° N) between 1957–2023 (Figs. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1, different PM species tend to show different source information. For instance, EC has sources such as coal combustion, C3 plants burning emissions, C4 plants burning emissions, and vehicle exhaust, while OC is not entirely the same, as it also includes emissions from liquefied petroleum gas. Therefore, PM source tracing require multi-species isotopic fingerprints. Notably, most isotopic fingerprints showed notable variations among these sectors for different species (P < 0.05), indicating their potential for PM source distinction (Fig. 1b-m and Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, a closer examination revealed regional heterogeneity in source isotopic fingerprints of certain individual species, e.g., Pb, across Asia, Europe, and the Americas (P < 0.05, Supplementary Table 1 & 2). This variability may be attributed to the diverse industrial structures and lifestyles in these regions. However, formal bootstrap testing indicated no statistical dependence of isotopic fingerprints on latitude and longitude within these regions (P > 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 1). These blockchain-based continent-specific source isotopic values enable to provide accurate reference for tracing PM and their species sources.

The isotopic composition of ammonium (NH4⁺) and nitrate (NO3⁻) sources is conventionally expressed in terms of their precursor compounds, namely the isotopic composition of NH3 and NOx, respectively47,48. The box extends from the 25% to the 75%, the center line represents the median, and the whiskers indicate the 5% and 95% of the data points. Significance levels are indicated as follows: ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. Note: the isotopic compositions of Zn (j) and Pb (m) from different sources show significant differences (P < 0.05), but there are too many statistical results to be clearly labeled in the figure. Therefore, all the data are provided in the Source Data file. Additionally, details on the number of isotopic data points in each window (b–m) are also provided in the Source Data file.

IDGAR provides an unprecedented opportunity for long-term analyzes of global PM isotopic fingerprints, enabling the identification of shifts and intervention effectiveness on main sources of PM species. The isotopic fingerprints of PM species represent a linear mixture of different sources. By analyzing their temporal trends and comparing them with the aforementioned isotopic fingerprints, the main sources during a corresponding period can be identified. If the rates of change in PM isotopic fingerprints (i.e., the slope between isotopic fingerprints and year) show a continuous decline but do not reverse direction, it indicates that the main sources' contributions are increasing, but the growth rate is slowing down. This suggests that the intervention targeting the main sources has begun to take effect. Perhaps this scenario is suspected to be due to the increase in contributions from sources with opposite isotopic compositions. However, if this is the case, the isotopic fingerprints of PM will show opposite trend changes and the corresponding change rates will also reverse direction. Therefore, analyzing the temporal trends and change rates of isotopic big data can identify the main sources of PM species, and evaluate the effectiveness and timing of interventions on these main sources.

Considering the temporal trends and magnitudes may be influenced by the selection of the start and end years, we performed formal bootstrap testing procedures and moving subset window analysis. We found that global fM-14C, δ15N, 207Pb/206Pb, δ18O, δ30Si, δ34S, δ56Fe, δ65Cu, δ66Zn, δ87Sr and δ202 Hg of PM species show varying temporal dynamics, including different trend breaks, tendencies, and change rates (Fig. 2a–h, Supplementary Figs. 5, 6). The robustness of the statistical results was verified using the Theil–Sen estimator (Supplementary Figs. 7, 8). This indicates that different PM components have distinct main sources and interventions during different periods. For instance, the global fM-14C of EC in PM increased significantly before 2014, then declined (Fig. 2a), indicating that their main emissions shift from non-fossil fuel source (i.e., biomass burning, fM-14C = 1) to fossil fuel combustion (coal or oil, fM-14C = 0)21,22 in 2014. By analyzing the EC δ13C trend and source isotopic values, we further identified whether biomass burning before 2014 was dominated by C4 or C3 plants. Specifically, the rise in EC δ13C during 2001–2008 and 2012–2014 suggests C4 plants burning (δ13C-EC = −15.4 ± 2.73‰) was the main source, while the decline from 2009–2011 points to C3 plants burning (δ13C-EC = -27.5 ± 2.69‰). Notably, the rate of increase in fM-14C slowed continuously during 2005–2007, and 2012–2014 (Fig. 2b), suggests effective interventions targeting C4 plants emissions during these periods (Supplementary Fig. 9).

a, c, e, g Temporal trends of fM-14C for EC (a) and OC (c) δ15N for NH4+ (e) and NO3− (g) were analyzed using formal bootstrap testing procedures. The abbreviations EC, OC, NH4+, and NO3- represent elemental carbon, organic carbon, ammonium, and nitrate, respectively.

Details on the amount of isotopic data in each plot are provided in the Source Data file. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05. Statistical robustness was verified using the Theil–Sen estimator (Supplementary Figs. 6 & 7). The color scale of the bars correspond to temporal trends, without specific indication. i Global distribution of atmospheric particulate matter isotopic observations and pollution levels. The global atmospheric particulate matter pollution levels are represented by the annual average concentrations of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for 2022. Isotopic observations are primarily concentrated in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The map was generated with Natural Earth, which provides free vector and raster map data available at naturalearthdata.com. j The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) map shows global atmospheric particulate matter isotopic affinities within the IDGAR. Most isotopic data form distinct clusters rather than random distributions.

In contrast to EC, global fM-14C of OC in PM dropped sharply before 2015, then rose (Fig. 2c), indicating fossil fuel combustion (oil or coal) dominated pre-2015, while biomass burning (fM-14C = 1) became dominant afterward. The OC δ13C has steadily increased, surpassing the isotopic end-member value for oil (Supplementary Figs. 5a and Fig. 1c), pointing to coal combustion as the main source before 2015, with a shift to C4 plants emissions thereafter. The slower decline in fM-14C of OC from 2009 to 2011 (Fig. 2d) suggests effective interventions on coal combustion during this period (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Moreover, global δ15N of ammonium salts in PM decreased from 2001 to 2013, then rose from 2014 to 2020 (Fig. 2e), indicating a shift in main sources of ammonium salts from isotope-depleted to isotope-enriched ones, e.g., vehicle exhaust. Notably, during 2017–2020, the rate of δ15N-NH4+ increase slowed continuously (Fig. 2f), suggesting effective interventions targeting vehicle-derived NH4+-bearing PM (Supplementary Fig. 9). In contrast, δ15N of NO3− increased from −12.0 ± 15.9‰ to 6.1 ± 6.5‰ between 2001 and 2018, suggesting coal combustion as the main source. Afterward, δ15N-NO3− declined, pointing to non-coal sources, e.g., gasoline combustion, microbial processes, or biomass burning (Fig. 2g). The rate of δ15N-NO3− increase slowed between 2013 and 2018 (Fig. 2h), indicating effective measures against coal-related NO3− in PM (Supplementary Fig. 9). Similarly, δ34S in sulfate generally declined, with a brief increase from 2015 to 2016 (Supplementary Fig. 5g). The rate of decline slowed during 2010–2012 and after 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 5h). Based on source δ34S values, we suggest that before 2015, coal or biomass combustion was the main source of sulfate, effectively controlled between 2010 and 2012. After 2020, isotopic values fell below 2‰, indicating that biomass burning (δ34S = 1.84 ± 5.41‰) became the dominant source and has been progressively managed.

In addition to these high-abundance components, a detailed discussion on the main sources of other components and the effectiveness of their interventions is provided in the Supplementary Note 2. Overall, effective interventions were only observed for the main sources of PM components, e.g., EC, OC, NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, Pb, Sr, and Hg, and their effectiveness was limited to specific periods rather than the entire study duration (Supplementary Fig. 9). These results indicate that the main sources and corresponding interventions are not synchronized. The heterogeneity of different PM species underscores the importance of considering multi-species isotopes in tracing overall PM source and interventions.

To further characterize the relationships among multi-species isotopic, we performed t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis on the isotopic fingerprints from 1890 global PM pollution events. Despite being distributed across various global regions (from 69.37° S to 85.64° N, Fig. 2i) and potentially subject to different interventions at different times, isotopes of the same components tend to cluster into unique groups rather than distribute randomly (Fig. 2j). This highlights the independent indicative capacities of these isotopes and the importance of considering multidimensional isotopes in PM source tracing.

Using the isotopic big data, the Bayesian stable isotope mixing model implemented in the R package (MixSIAR), the mass concentrations of various PM2.5 components, we conducted source tracing analyzes for individual PM2.5 compounds. By aggregating the emissions of different components, we estimated the contribution of each subdivided source to PM2.5. The uncertainty of source apportionment results was derived from MixSIAR model analysis and error propagation formula (see “Methods” for details). Noteworthy, although the isotopic fractionation correction of certain components, such as NH4+ and NO3-, during the conversion process has been accounted for in the MixSIAR model (see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 3 for details), future in-depth studies on the isotopic fractionation mechanisms of specific transformation reactions under real-world environmental conditions will further improve the accuracy of source apportionment results. Furthermore, the robustness of MixSIAR performance was verified using the other Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, i.e., MixSIR and Food Reconstruction Using Isotopic Transferred Signals (FRUITS) (Supplementary Note 4).

Significant variations were observed in the contributions of different sources to PM2.5 and its components (Fig. 3). Globally, biomass burning and coal combustion are the main sources of PM2.5, and the main component affected by these sources is most likely OC (Fig. 3a). Additionally, biomass burning and vehicle exhaust are the leading contributors to EC in PM2.5, accounting for 2.17 ± 0.09% and 2.23 ± 0.09% of the total mass of PM2.5, respectively, through EC emissions. Natural soil and coal combustion are the major sources of Si in PM2.5, with Si emissions from these sources contributing 1.99 ± 0.08 % and 1.22 ± 0.06%, respectively, to the overall PM2.5 mass. Additionally, some subdivided sources also affect PM2.5 pollution levels by emitting specific components. For instance, the combustion of liquid fossil fuels and industrial fuel oil primarily impacts PM2.5 levels by altering concentrations of OC and sulfates. Non-exhaust emissions are a key source of metal elements in PM2.5, especially Fe and Zn, with Fe and Zn emissions contributing 0.26 ± 0.02% and 0.15 ± 0.01% to the total mass of PM2.5, respectively. Waste materials, livestock waste, and volatilized fertilizer influence PM2.5 pollution levels through the NH3 emission. These refined source apportionment results are essential for the precise implementation of PM2.5 source control measures.

a, b, c, d The source composition of PM2.5 and its components in the worldwide (a) Asia (b) the Americas (c) and Europe (d). The labels CC, BB, VE, LFF, IOC, NS, BP, WM, NEE, LE, VF, and WI are abbreviations for coal combustion, biomass burning, vehicle exhausts, liquid fossil fuels combustion, industrial oil combustion, natural soil, biological process, waste materials, non-exhaust emissions, livestock emissions, volatilized fertilizer, and waste incinerator, respectively. Biological processes include plant debris, fungal bacteria, pollen, particulate matter generated by the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, microbial processes. The uncertainties for these results are provided in the Source Data file. For the specific calculation process, see the “Methods” section. Note: in the isotopic source tracing analysis of OC in PM2.5, the liquid fossil fuels combustion is classified as a subdivided source, while OC emissions from vehicle exhaust are not double-counted. Due to the absence of the δ¹⁵N values for ammonia from biomass burning in the Americas and Europe, the global source apportionment study relied on the δ¹⁵N values for ammonia from Asian biomass burning to estimate global values.

Regionally, a closer characterization revealed heterogeneity in the source composition of PM2.5 and its components across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. From 2001 to 2023, coal combustion is the dominant source of PM2.5 emissions in Asia, whereas biomass burning serves as the primary contributor to PM2.5 emissions in Europe and the Americas (Fig. 3b–d). This finding aligns with high coal consumption in Asia23. Moreover, the same type of sources, such as biomass burning, show varying contributions to PM2.5 components across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. For instance, biomass burning in Asia contributes ~1.29 ± 0.82% of PM2.5 through EC emissions, which is lower than its contribution in the Americas (6.12 ± 1.70%) and Europe (5.06 ± 4.30%). This result may be attributed to the higher frequency of wildfire emissions in Europe and the Americas24. Noteworthy, some subdivided sources show regional differences in PM2.5 components and contributions. For instance, industrial oil combustion contributes substantially more sulfate to PM2.5 in Asia than in Europe and the Americas. These differences may be attributed to the industrial structures in different regions.

We further analyzed the temporal changes of PM2.5 source composition across Asia, the Americas, and Europe. In Asia, the contribution of coal combustion has gradually decreased since 2013, probably due to interventions targeting OC emissions (Supplementary Figs. 10a–f). Since 2004, the contribution of biomass burning to PM2.5 has remained stable. Yet, vehicle exhaust emissions have improved significantly since 2018, likely due to the rapid development of new energy vehicles25. Notably, contributions from some subdivided sources—such as liquid fossil fuel combustion, industrial fuel oil combustion, and waste incineration—declined significantly after 2013–2015 but have stabilized since 2016. These results might reflect the effective implementation of targeted regional emission reduction measures. In the Americas and Europe, the contribution of most sources, e.g., coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, and livestock waste, to PM2.5 has shown a gradual downward trend (Supplementary Fig. 10g–l). In contrast, contributions from biomass burning and liquid fossil fuel combustion have either remained stable or increased, suggesting these sources necessitate greater attention and further intervention. Notably, current source-tracing analysis mainly relies on the critical components of PM2.5, where isotope fingerprints can be obtained. As more component isotopic fingerprints become available, e.g., NH4+ in the Americas and Europe, the accuracy and precision of source tracing will further improve.

In addition to current interventions, global climate actions aimed at controlling warming will lead to systemic change in PM2.5 emissions, e.g., fossil fuels26,27,28. To better plan future PM2.5 interventions, we projected the trends of PM2.5 pollution levels (Fig. 4) and isotopic fingerprints (Supplementary Fig. 11) in the Americas and Asia in climate mitigation scenarios to the year 2100. This simulation was conducted by integrating the IDGAR database, the global change assessment model (GCAM), and the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry analysis (WRF-Chem). For further details see “Method” section. In both the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1–1.9 (1.5 °C temperature control target) and SSP1–2.6 (2 °C goal temperature control target) scenarios, PM2.5 pollution levels in Asia and the Americas are projected to continuously decline. By 2100, with anthropogenic sources expected to have achieve net zero emissions (Supplementary Fig. 12), the PM2.5 concentrations in the Americas in the SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6 scenarios are projected to decrease to 5.38 ± 0.16 μg/m3 and 5.43 ± 0.15 μg/m3, respectively. These results are close to the WHO guideline limit of 5 μg/m3 but do not quite achieve it. In Asia, the projected PM2.5 concentrations for 2100 are 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m3 and 14.2 ± 1.82 μg/m3 in the SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 scenarios, respectively. These PM2.5 levels are comparable to current levels in the Americas and fall short of the WHO recommended limits. Compared to that in the SSP1–2.6 scenario, the PM2.5 concentration decreases more in the SSP1–1.9 scenario, but the difference is relatively small. Hence, we propose that, in addition to implementing stricter climate targets, designing targeted interventions remains crucial for controlling PM2.5 pollution, particularly for Asia.

Specifically, (a) the Americas, (b) Asia. Simulations were conducted with the global change assessment model (GCAM), IDGAR database, and the stable isotope analysis in R model (SIAR). The scenarios, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, combine Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which correspond to future radiative forcing and their climate impacts. Specifically, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 aim to limit global warming to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively. Error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3). For more details about the scenario settings in the PM pollution simulations, see the “Methods” section. These projected results by 2100 are close to the WHO guideline limit of 5 μg/m3, but have not yet been achieved.

Addressing the current limitations of isotope-based PM2.5 driver tracing, which primarily focused on local-scale, short-term pollution events involving single component, we constructed the global atmospheric isotopic database, IDGAR. Through global long-term temporal dynamic analyzes of isotopic big data, we identified the main sources and corresponding interventions for different PM2.5 species over the past two decades. Moreover, we achieved the source constraints on PM and its components based on IDGAR's multi-species isotopic fingerprints. However, projections indicate that WHO's recommended PM2.5 limit of 5 μg/m3 will not be met by 2100 under the current climate targets, need additional effective interventions, particularly in natural emissions.

Blockchain technology is critical for the accuracy and sustainability of IDGAR isotopic big data. It ensures each isotopic data point is unique, immutable, and traceable, thereby enhancing the accuracy of PM source tracing and intervention assessments. Given that isotopic analysis requires a high level of analytical capability and considerable time, the amount of isotopic data from a single laboratory is very limited, necessitating global trusted collaboration. Blockchain's tamper-proof and traceability features make IDGAR a trustworthy platform, encouraging researchers to enrich and utilize its isotopic data. Moreover, unlike traditional administrator-based databases, blockchain-based IDGAR implements a decentralized data management model, ensuring equal data management rights for all users.

Retrospective analysis of isotopic big data reveals remarkable intervention effects on C4 plants burning, coal combustion, or vehicle exhaust, particularly for EC, OC, NO3−, NH4+, SO42−, Pb-bearing PM. Our study have identified the main sources of most curated element species but not all, e.g., Fe-bearing PM, Zn-bearing PM, which require targeted interventions. In contrast to previous measure-specific intervention assessments based on bottom-up emission inventories29, our study provides a complementary top-down, component-level assessment, mitigating the impact of the nonlinear relationship between emissions and PM concentrations. Notably, hardly any PM species has been effectively intervened continuously in the past 20 years. This probably because the main sources of the target components have changed, but the intervention designs have not yet to respond. The asynchronous changes in the main sources and intervention effectiveness suggest that future intervention designs should be dynamically adjusted for different PM species. An ideal approach would be to develop an isotopic-guided intelligent system for designing interventions for different PM species within the IDGAR framework.

Source tracing utilizing isotopic big data reveals the specific emissions of critical PM2.5 components, which is essential for implementing precise source control. While the temporal changes in source composition highlight notable intervention effects on coal combustion, resulting in reductions of OC-bearing PM emissions in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. Additionally, we further reveal the increasing impact of biomass burning and liquid fossil fuels combustion on PM2.5 levels in these three regions. Projections of PM2.5 trends under scenarios aimed at achieving climate goals of 1.5 °C and 2 °C also underscore the importance of implementing interventions on biomass burning to meet the WHO's annual PM2.5 guideline of 5 μg/m3. This is consistent with prior projections indicating that climate-driven natural emissions, e.g., wildfire smoke, will worsen PM2.5 exposure30,31.

In the Americas, satellite observations and global climate model projections show that biomass burning, e.g., wildfire smoke, will increasingly impact PM pollution24, intensifying with ongoing climate warming32,33. Therefore, developing interventions targeting wildfire may be effective for reaching WHO recommended threshold in the Americas. However, managing wildfires requires specialized interventions distinct from those employed for regional anthropogenic emission, which are not adequately covered by current air pollution regulations34. In Asia, the projected lowest PM2.5 levels will still be 13.9 ± 1.82 μg/m3 in 2100, comparable to current levels in the Americas. In addition to wildfires, the notable increase in biomass burning emissions in Asia is largely due to extensive agricultural activities, particularly in rural South Asia8,22,35,36,37. Moreover, soil-related dust is another important driver of PM pollution, especially in Central and East Asia38. Therefore, simultaneous and intensive interventions targeting agricultural biomass burning, wildfires, and dust are necessary in Asia to achieve WHO guidelines.

In summary, we have launched the blockchain-based isotopic database for global atmospheric research. This database provides region-specific source-end isotopic values for PM tracing. Our analysis of long-term trends and change rates of isotopic big data reveals varying main sources and asynchronous interventions for different PM species. Predictions under climate mitigation scenarios indicate that controlling natural sources, e.g., biomass burning, is essential to meet WHO guidelines. Isotopic big data are critical for atmospheric research, extending beyond PM and emission tracing. The data can be used to quantify PM transport ranges and estimate deposition fluxes. Moreover, integrating isotopic big data with public health or policy factor datasets could contribute to source-specific health effect assessments and intelligent policy making.

The database developed in this study includes 34,815 non-redundant isotopic data points related to PM species and corresponding emissions, as recorded up to March 31, 2024. This database includes isotopic fingerprints for compounds and elements such as OC, EC, nitrate, ammonium, and sulfate, Si, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb, and Hg; different types of PM, e.g., PM2.5, PM10, and total suspended particulate matter (TSP); different PM sources, such as e.g., biomass burning, coal combustion, vehicle exhausts, waste materials, volatilized fertilizer, livestock emissions, microbial processes, industrial oil combustion, natural soil; and additional details such as specific components, sampling methods, locations, time periods, and analytical methods/measurement techniques. For detailed information, please refer to Supplementary Table 3–5. Briefly, the sampling of NH3 from sources is categorized into active and passive sampling. For source apportionment applications, data correction for passive sampling is performed by adding 15.4‰, following commonly used methods in the literature39. Source emissions of NOX are collected through active sampling using the standard solution absorption method40. Similarly, almost source emissions of SO2 are also collected via active sampling with solution absorption. Since only one study used passive sampling for SO2, we excluded its reported values from S source tracing to ensure data standardization and the reliability of the research findings41. Aside from NH3, NOx, and SO2, other PM components (such as OC, EC, Si, and metals) included in the database are not sampled individually but are collected through active sampling of source emissions, followed by the analysis of the specific isotopic fingerprint characteristics of the different components within the particulate matter. Additionally, different components may be analyzed using various methods. For instance, the nitrogen isotope measurement is conducted using both chemical conversion and bacterial conversion methods; for Strontium (Sr) isotopic measurement might be performed using thermal-ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), both of which undergo strict quality control. The isotopic results from different analytical methods are reported with reference to international standard reference materials, ensuring consistency and standardization. Regarding different standard reference materials, such as Zn, the Zn isotopic composition is typically expressed in per mil (‰) relative to the “zero point” of the isotopic standard reference material, IRMM-3702. Notably, some publications report the Zn isotopic composition relative to JMC 3-0749 L Lyon (another reference material). The Zn isotopic composition of JMC 3-0749 L Lyon is +0.32‰ relative to IRMM-3702. For clarity, the Zn isotopic signatures presented here have been converted to be relative to IRMM-3702. Notably, given the importance of data standardization and the emergence of more precise cross-validation methods, the data in this database needs to be standardized and updated.

The data were extracted from 804 publications (including peer-reviewed papers, conference papers.) using Web Plot Digitizer (version 4.2, San Francisco, California, USA). The publications were identified through manual searches on Web of Science (http://isiknowledge.com), Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com), and Baidu Scholar (http://xueshu.baidu.com). The specific keywords, number of samples, type of data, and specific reference are provided in Supplementary Table 3 and “References” in Supplementary Information. These information can also be found in IDGAR database (http://idgar.org/). ArcGIS Pro (ESRI; Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) was used to visualize the specific geographic locations of these isotopic data. The base map was downloaded from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/.

In addition to radiocarbon (14C) and Pb, the isotopic fingerprints of other elements are reported as delta values (δ) relative to an isotopic standard reference material (SRM) using the following formula:

where E represents a selected element and x and y describe the mass numbers of the isotopes of element E.

Notably, the isotope analysis methods used for an element may vary among publications. This expression, relative to an SRM with a “zero point”, makes it feasible to perform comprehensive analyzes based on multiple isotopes. The specific SRMs (Supplementary Table 3) and analytical accuracy of these isotopic analyzes are collected in the developed database.

Isotopic fingerprints for radiocarbon (14C) are reported as the fraction of modern carbon (fM-14C) as follows:

where the standard reference material is the oxalic acid II 4990 C from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA21,42.

Due to the lack of a unified standard reference material, Pb isotopic signatures are reported as 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb.

Additionally, the data of PM concentrations in 2021 were sourced from the public dataset of ground-level PM2.5, measured at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° from 1998 to 2022 (V5.GL.04), calculated by the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group43.

A web portal for the IDGAR including PM data and the corresponding emissions was established using blockchain technology. The IDGAR website was developed using the Spring Boot framework with the MVC architecture pattern, and MariaDB was utilized for data storage. The website is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is publicly available at http://idgar.org/. Moreover, blockchain technology is used to secure the database against data tampering and to support operations across multiple nodes. The SHA256 hashing function is used to process data: user registration details are hashed, generating a 64-character hexadecimal string. This hash string is then stored across various database nodes for security. Each user's information hash string forms a block, and the blocks are connected in chronological order to create a blockchain. The IDGAR includes a data validation procedure, in which the hash strings are continuously recalculated in real time (every 5 minutes). If any discrepancies in the hash strings are detected, we can precisely identify the affected block and tracing the origins for non-compliance.

Newly uploaded data undergo real-time hash string validation and are rigorously compared with existing strings in the database. If a conflict occurs, the system automatically assigns incremental version numbers to subsequent file versions. The irreversible nature of blockchain prohibits direct editing of uploaded data in the IDGAR. If a user makes an honest error and needs to correct the uploaded content, they can submit the corrected data with a clear statement, automatically generating incremented version numbers for the file. The old data remain intact in the blockchain at all times.

Moreover, an early warning system activates promptly if a node is attacked, transferring all the data once the network virus is eradicated. This decentralized management fosters equitable data sharing. Notably, unpublished data are not decentralized but rather controlled by the uploader using password-based key derivation encryption. Users who receive the shared key from the uploader can access it. With the development of the IDGAR, unpublished data can be uploaded with clear statements to foster academic collaboration.

One-way analyzes and Pearson correlation analyzes were carried out by using SigmaPlot version 12.5 (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the Origin 2016 statistical package (OriginLab Corporation, USA). The remaining statistical analyzes were conducted in R version 4.1.3 using the “stats” package, unless stated otherwise. Briefly, the temporal trends of the PM isotopic fingerprints were analyzed via bootstrap procedures. The method of formal testing was used to identify the breakpoints from all years. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Theil-Sen estimator was employed to test the robustness of the results. Moreover, a one-dimensional moving subset window analysis was employed to estimate the temporal trends in the PM isotopic composition from 2001 to 2022, including dependencies on longitude and latitude for source isotopic changes. For each isotope, the data were segmented into several subsets based on sampling times or locations, with each subset encompassing several consecutive years, longitudes, or latitudes. The initial subset was established as the starting point. Subsequent subsets were formed by excluding data from the earliest year or site of the previous subset and incorporating an additional step. The slope and P value of the linear regression between the isotopic composition and year or site information in each subset indicate the rate (k) of change of the isotopic composition and its significance over the respective period or geographic range.

To visualize the relationships among all the data, all the isotopic data, along with the PM type, concentration, sampling time, latitude, and longitude, are presented in a 2D figure. Briefly, all of the data are uniformly transformed into corresponding 64-dimensional vectors through a shallow neural network based on a given corpus. This process was carried out in Python version 4.1 with the “gensim” package. Then, dimensionality reduction was performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a machine learning technique for dimensionality reduction of multivariate statistical data26, after preprocessing with principal component analysis (PCA), which was carried out in R version 4.1.3 with the “tsne” package.

The relative proportions of the selected species (e.g., compounds, metals) in PM from diverse emissions are quantitatively estimated by the Bayesian MixSIAR model. This model was performed in R version 4.1.3 with the “MixSIAR” package. Considering increasing the data volume and the number of simulations can effectively improve the reliability of the analysis, we conducted source tracing analysis of PM components using IDGAR isotopic big data rather than relying on a few scattered data points. Moreover, we set the number of iterations to 1,000,000 with a burn-in of 500,000 in our MixSIAR simulation. Furthermore, the Isospace plots and Markov chain Monte Carlo diagnostic tests (including Gelman-Rubin and Geweke) have been incorporated into the MixSIAR package to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. The MixSIAR method can identify the most reasonable source composition of a mixture based on isotope mass balance5.

Moreover, the fractionation effect of some isotopes (e.g., NH4+) and the variabilities in isotopic fingerprints of measurements and sampling can be incorporated into this model (see Supplementary Note 3 for details)6. For OC, we first determined the contributions of fossil and non-fossil fuel combustion using fM14C-OC, followed by a detailed analysis of specific fossil and non-fossil fuel contributions using the isotopic chemical mass balance of δ13C44. The overall calculation principle of source tracing can be expressed as follows:

where δxEPM represents the isotopic fingerprint of the PM, δxEi is the isotopic composition of potential sources. The fi values describe the relative contributions of the emissions to the selected species in the PM.

Afterward, using the fi value multiply the mass concentration (%) of the selected compound or element (e.g., EC) in PM, we can estimate the weight of this component emitted from each source to PM2.5. The detailed mass concentrations of the curated species in PM2.5 are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2a. The calculation processes can be expressed as follows:

where F represents the relative contributions of sources to PM2.5 by emitting the selected component. The f values are source contributions to the selected component. C (%) reflects the mass concentrations of the selected components in the PM2.5.

The uncertainty in source apportionment was derived from the MixSIAR model analysis and the error propagation formula. The detailed calculation process is as follows:

where σSsum represents the standard deviation of the total contributions from source ‘S' to PM2.5. XE denotes the mass concentration of component ‘E' in PM2.5, and CES represents the relative contribution of source ‘S' to component ‘E' in PM2.5, as calculated by MixSIAR. Additionally, σXE indicates the uncertainty in the mass concentration of component ‘E' in PM2.5, while σCES reflects the uncertainty in the CES values derived from MixSIAR.

To further validate this method, we used fM-14C to evaluate the δ13C-based source tracing results of EC in PM2.5. Specifically, we calculated the fM-14C isotopic compositions of EC in PM2.5 based on the fM-14C of primary sources and δ13C-based relative contributions, and compared them with the observed values. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 13, the calculated fM-14C isotopic compositions of EC were consistent with the observed values. The largest net difference between the calculated values and observed data was 0.05, which was smaller than the observed uncertainty of 0.0745. This supported the robustness of the δ13C-based source tracing results. Furthermore, the comparison of model performance among MixSIAR, MixSIR, and FRUITS confirms the robustness of the source apportionment results in this study (see Supplementary Note 4 for details).

The framework for PM2.5 pollution simulation in the Americas and Asia comprises two sub-sections, i.e., emission projection and air quality modeling. The future emission changes of diverse sectors under climate mitigation scenarios towards 2100 were performed with the global change assessment model (GCAM). Specifically, we selected two scenarios, SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6, which integrate different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with climate projections based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). SSPs show the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation, capturing key socioeconomic factors. RCPs reflect the levels of ambition in climate policies. The scenarios SSP1–1.9 (SSP1 + RCP1.9) and SSP1–2.6 (SSP1 + RCP2.6) align with global climate goals of limiting warming to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively. These scenarios represent the most likely patterns of global development in the future. Using updated emission data, we further estimated the trends in PM2.5 pollution and their isotopic composition through the weather research and forecasting model coupled with chemistry analysis (WRF-Chem) and the SIAR model. It is worth noting that, due to noticeable uncertainty in emission inventories, the predicted PM2.5 pollution levels usually require optimization and correction. Isotopic-based source tracing results can refine the inventory from a top-down perspective, enhancing the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions (Supplementary Fig. 14).

Sethuraman Panchanathan resigned Thursday as director of the US National Science Foundation.Credit: Graeme Sloan/Sipa US/Alamy

Fresh turmoil has hit the US National Science Foundation (NSF): hundreds more of the agency's research grants were terminated today on top of the hundreds already terminated last week, Nature has learnt. The new terminations come one day after the agency's director abruptly resigned and NSF staff members were offered incentives to retire early due to “future restructuring, staffing reductions, and constrained budget environments”.

The departing director, Sethuraman Panchanathan, was appointed as head of one of the world's leading funders of basic research by US President Donald Trump in 2019 during his first term in office.

But Trump, now in office for a second time, allegedly wants to cut the agency's US$9-billion budget by 55% and its workforce by 50%, according to Science. In a farewell letter to staff, Panchanathan wrote, “I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency”, adding, “while NSF has always been an efficient agency, we still took the challenge of identifying other possible efficiencies”.

Nature spoke with seven NSF staff members for this story. All requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the press. Staffers said they were stunned by Panchanathan's sudden departure. “I respect him more for deciding to resign and not signing the agency's death warrant,” says one NSF staffer. 

Neal Lane, a former NSF director under Democratic president Bill Clinton, offered praise for Panchanathan, who goes by ‘Panch'. “Panch has done an outstanding job” amid the effort to “diminish NSF's role in science, education and pretty much everything else”, Lane says. The US National Science Board, which governs the NSF, praised Panchanathan in a statement as “fantastic”. 

Asked for comment, an NSF spokesperson referred Nature to Panchanathan's farewell letter. The spokesperson said that Brian Stone, the NSF's chief of staff, will serve as director until the White House appoints a permanent replacement and the US Senate confirms them. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, which oversees the NSF, did not respond to a request for comment.

Since Trump, a Republican, took office, the NSF has frozen and unfrozen grants, fired and rehired employees and cut its graduate research fellowship programme from about 2,000 positions to 1,000. The latest bout of upheaval began on 17 April, when NSF staff members were given guidance for receiving “VIP visitors” from the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative led by Trump ally Elon Musk to reduce federal spending and shrink the federal workforce.

The guidance said that in the event of a request that “violates or doesn't follow proper procedures”, employees were to contact Dorothy Aronson, the NSF's chief information officer. “Do not give any indication that the request will be denied,” the guidance statement noted. Two members of DOGE, Luke Farritor and Zachary Terrell, were quickly given complete access to NSF grant-management systems despite statements in the guidance to staffers that they should initially receive read-only access. The guidance to NSF employees was first reported by FedScoop, a government technology media publication, and confirmed by Nature. 

On 18 April, after the arrival of three DOGE staffers at NSF headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, the agency halted the funding of any new research grants for a week. The agency has now started issuing the grants again, but has issued only 377 for April, compared with 863 in April last year.

The same day, the NSF began terminating research grants that had already been awarded, apparently under orders from DOGE. An internal list obtained by Nature shows that the NSF has axed at least 387 awards worth $237 million, of which roughly 45% has already been spent. Over one-third of these, or 152 grants, had been awarded by the NSF's directorate of education. The numbers match crowdsourced data compiled in an online database by Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Noam Ross, a computational ecologist based in Brooklyn, New York, who is executive director of rOpensci, an open-science, global non-profit. 

About 80% of these terminated awards overlap with a list of around 3,500 grants released in February by Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas who chairs the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The list stems from a Cruz-led report saying that the grants ‘promoted Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)', a concept that it suggests is “extremist”. Last week, an analysis by Democratic staff for the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, found that the Cruz list contained a “slew of embarrassing mistakes” and used flawed methodology.

Found in a mudflat off the coast of Oregon, this organism's electricity-conducting abilities could make it ideal for bioelectric devices.

Today, human society is powered by the artificial electricity generated by turbines, nuclear reactors, and photovoltaics. But the very first investigations into the wonders of electricity were biological in origin. Thales of Miletus (considered to be the first scientist in the Western world) pondered on the cause of static electricity, and the electric prowess of eels inspired Alessandro Volta to invent the first battery. You and I are alive today because of the bioelectric field that permeates our cells. 

Although we've evolved from Volta's first fish-inspired battery, the world of bioelectricty still has a lot to offer us. That couldn't be more apparent than in a new study, published this week in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, which details the discovery of a new cable bacteria—built from rod-shaped cells attached end to end—on the central Oregon coast. Named Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis in honor of the Yaqo'n people on whose ancestral lands the discovery was made, this bacteria is particularly adept at conducting electricity.

Because of their rod-shaped bodies, these cells create filaments that can stretch up to several centimeters in length. A rare feature among bacteria, Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis's conductivity likely arises from it's optimization of metabolic processes in their environment. 

“This new species seems to be a bridge, an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade, which suggests it could provide new insights into how these bacteria evolved and how they might function in different environments,” Cheng Li, a postdoctoral researcher at Oregon State University and co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “It stands out from all other described cable bacteria species in terms of its metabolic potential, and it has distinctive structural features, including pronounced surface ridges, up to three times wider than those seen in other species, that house highly conductive fibers made of unique, nickel-based molecules.”

In other words, it's a bioelectric bacteria on steroids. This could make the bacteria particularly effective in a variety of fields, including medicine, industry, and environmental monitoring. However, its most exciting capability is its use as a tool for pollutant remediation. 

“These bacteria can transfer electrons to clean up pollutants, so they could be used to remove harmful substances from sediments,” Li said. “Also, their design of a highly conductive nickel protein can possibly inspire new bioelectronics.”

Remediation can be one of the most time-consuming and costly aspects of infrastructure projects—particularly if a former brownfield site hopes to be reclaimed as a park or another public space. Having bacteria that can actively clean up the soil thanks to its electric biology could be a huge boon for environmental efforts. 

Our understanding of electricity has come along way since Ancient Greece, but the biological world still has more than few electrifying tricks to teach us.

And it gets even trippier.

Have you ever had a dream in which you realized you were dreaming? 

When you become conscious of the fact that you are dreaming, you can take advantage of that knowledge and manipulate the dream. If you want to do something that is physically impossible in the real world, such as flying, you can leap into the air and  take flight. Someone who realizes they are trapped in a nightmare can convince themselves to wake up.

The state known as lucid dreaming is an unquestionably surreal one, and it just got even more so. A team of researchers—led by Çağatay Demirel from the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands—has discovered that lucid dreaming has now been found to be a state of consciousness separate from both wakefulness and REM sleep (the state usually associated with dreams), and is in fact associated with its own unique type of brain activity. They published a study on their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience.

“This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself,” Demirel said in a press release.

To identify what sets lucid dreaming apart from the rest of sleep, he and his team pulled previous studies—in which brain activity was measured with EEG sensors—together into what is now the most extensive dataset in this field of sleep research. The researchers then compared brain activity patterns for wakefulness, REM sleep, and lucid dreaming to find that that the eerie self-awareness experienced in lucid dreams has a connection to the electrical rhythms in neurons known as brain waves. 

Perception and memory processing in the lucid dreaming state were found to be different from non-lucid REM sleep. The consciousness of existing in a dream was associated with with beta waves in the right central lobe (which controls spatial awareness and nonverbal memory) and parietal lobe (which controls the sense of touch and spatial awareness). Beta waves are a type of high-frequency electromagnetic activity in the brain involved in conscious thought processes like solving problems or making decisions. Our consciousness is dominated by beta waves when we are awake.

This might explain why there is so much cognitive control in lucid dreams. Dreamers deep in REM sleep have no sense of control over factors like thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but those in lucid dreaming states do.

Demirel also linked gamma waves with lucid dreaming. These are the fastest brain waves, which become visible on an EEG at times when the brain is especially alert and focusing on something. When lucid dreaming begins, gamma waves increase in the right precuneus, which is involved in self-referential thinking—thoughts about ourselves and our lives. When we are awake, we often drift into this type of thinking when our minds wander. 

Maybe the most mind-bending thing about lucid dreams is that they are, according to the study, similar in the brain to the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. These types of psychedelic experiences are also associated with the precuneus, whose activity is modified when waking imagery is seen despite having closed eyes (something usually only experienced with psychedelics). Interestingly, however, lucid dreams may even go a few experiential steps past psychedelics. “While psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and decreased self-referential processing […] lucid dreams may actually harness elements of self-awareness and control,” Demirel and his team said in the study.

So if you're capable of lucid dreaming, you're in for an awesome trip.

A replication drive focused on results that lean on three methods commonly used in biomedical research in Brazil. Credit: Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty 

In an unprecedented effort, a coalition of more than 50 research teams has surveyed a swathe of Brazilian biomedical studies to double-check their findings — with dismaying results.

The teams were able to replicate the results of less than half of the tested experiments1. That rate is in keeping with that found by other large-scale attempts to reproduce scientific findings. But the latest work is unique in focusing on papers that use specific methods and in examining the research output of a specific country, according to the research teams.

The results provide an impetus to strengthen the country's science, the study's authors say. “We now have the material to start making changes from within — whether through public policies or within universities,” says Mariana Boechat de Abreu, a metascience researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in Brazil and one of the coordinators of the project.

The work was posted on 8 April to the bioRxiv preprint server and has not yet been peer reviewed.

The massive experiment was coordinated by the Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative, a collaborative effort launched in 2019 by researchers at the UFRJ. The scientists wanted to assess publications “based on methods, rather than research area, perceived importance or citation counts”, de Abreu says. And they wanted to do so on a large scale. Ultimately, 213 scientists at 56 laboratories in Brazil were involved in the work.

The project unfolded during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought numerous logistical challenges. And teams disagreed about how closely to follow the tested protocols. “It was like trying to turn dozens of garage bands, each with its own way of playing, into an orchestra,” says project coordinator Olavo Bohrer Amaral, a physician at the UFRJ.

Reproducibility trial: 246 biologists get different results from same data sets

The authors began by reviewing a random sample of life-sciences articles to determine the most common biomedical research methods used in Brazil, ensuring that any biomedical lab interested in joining the project would be capable of reproducing the experiments.

They ended up selecting three of these methods: an assay of cell metabolism, a technique for amplifying genetic material and a type of maze test for rodents. Then the authors randomly selected biomedical papers that relied on those methods and were published from 1998 to 2017 by research teams in which at least half the contributors had a Brazilian affiliation.

The collaborators initially chose a subset of 60 papers for replication, guided by factors such as whether a paper included certain statistical information. Three labs tested each experiment, and an independent committee judged which of those tests was a valid replication. The coalition performed 97 valid replication attempts of 47 experiments.

The authors judged a paper's replicability by five criteria, including whether at least half of the replication attempts had statistically significant results in the same direction as the original paper. Only 21% of the experiments were replicable using at least half of the applicable criteria.

The authors also found that the effect size — the magnitude of the observed impact in the experiments — was, on average, 60% larger in the original papers than in the experimental follow-ups, indicating that published results tend to overestimate the effects of the interventions tested.

Metrics details

Functional specialization of brain areas and subregions, as well as their integration into large-scale networks, are key principles in neuroscience. Consolidating both local and global perspectives on cortical organization, however, remains challenging. Here, we present an approach to integrate inter- and intra-areal similarities of microstructure, structural connectivity, and functional interactions. Using high-field in-vivo 7 tesla (7 T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and a probabilistic post-mortem atlas of cortical cytoarchitecture, we derive multimodal gradients that capture cortex-wide organization. Inter-areal similarities follow a canonical sensory-fugal gradient, linking cortical integration with functional diversity across tasks. However, intra-areal heterogeneity does not follow this pattern, with greater variability in association cortices. Findings are replicated in an independent 7 T dataset and a 100-subject 3 tesla (3 T) cohort. These results highlight a robust coupling between local arealization and global cortical motifs, advancing our understanding of how specialization and integration shape human brain function.

Understanding how the spatial organization of the human brain gives rise to cognitive functions is a challenging, yet fundamental goal for human neuroscience1. Complex brain networks at multiple scales arise from overlapping variations in cortical microstructure, function, and connectivity2,3. This network involves both the global integration and local specialization of cortical regions, giving rise to distributed functional communities that enable complex computations4,5,6,7. Global integration prominently manifests within higher-order systems, notably the transmodal association cortex, which engages in increasingly abstract and self-generated cognition8,9,10,11,12,13,14. In contrast, local functional specialization is more frequent in sensory and motor regions that interact more closely with the here and now6,8,15,16. The interplay between contrasting local and global motifs contributes to the hierarchical organization of the brain, underpinning segregated and integrative information processing across different cognitive functions.

Mapping structural and functional descriptors to define discrete brain areas is essential for understanding hierarchical brain organization at macroscale. Constructing precise maps of cortical areas has been a long-standing objective in neuroanatomy, as it reduces complexity and bias when studying brain regions and inter-regional relationships3,17,18,19. Cytoarchitecture, encompassing the arrangement, distribution, composition, and layering of cells, has emerged as a gold standard to define areas20. Microstructural insight from this post-mortem approach enhances our understanding of connectivity patterns and can illuminate the role of a region in cortical functioning. However, the microstructural patterns in the human brain and their relation to cortical function remain challenging to address in a systematic manner due to the constraints of invasive techniques. Recently, a 3D probabilistic atlas of human brain cytoarchitecture19 has been made available, offering valuable opportunities for examining both the micro- and macro-organization of the human brain, and for contrasting local specialization with global integration. It can, thus, help to guide investigations of structure-function association across the cortical manifold within defined areal subunits.

Gradual changes in cortical organization at macroscale have been described as well, even in early work21. While atlases of cortical areas discretize the brain into non-overlapping constituents, recent advances emphasize a potential complementary utility of using dimensional descriptions of the cortex. Such a perspective can help to account for cytoarchitectonic changes within an area (e.g., ocular dominance columns, border tuft and fringe area in the visual cortex), as well as changes occurring at macroscale between different cortical areas20. Recent work in computational anatomy has confirmed that such complementary descriptions of macroscale cortical organization can be derived from eigenvector decomposition of cortex-wide similarities in neural patterns (commonly known as cortical gradients22,23,24). These gradients differentiate cortical systems in an ordered and continuous manner, and can be applied to different types of neural data, both based on in vivo neuroimaging as well as post-mortem histology. Notably, converging hierarchical trends, spanning from sensory to transmodal regions, were observed across microstructural7,23,25,26,27 and functional gradients22,28. These multiple dimensions can effectively capture nuanced patterns of cortical organization26, and may provide synergy in understanding subregional heterogeneity and functional multiplicity of different cortical areas29. More broadly, gradient mapping techniques have robustly differentiated transmodal association cortices from primary sensory/motor systems, mirroring their hierarchical contributions to cognition. In effect, such gradients have been found to align with functionally relevant properties, including disproportionate expansion during primate evolution30,31,32, reduced heritability and increased experience-dependent plasticity27,33, increased network idiosyncrasy34, and the balance of internal vs. externally oriented processing35,36,37. Moreover, gradients may help to potentially account for recent findings showing that functional activation patterns, as well as functional connectivity, can shift across different contexts and individuals38,39,40.

Local vs. global organization can be interrogated at the level of microstructure (e.g., cytoarchitecture), connectivity, and function. In this context, MRI serves as an ideal technique to bridge structure and function across varying spatial scales41,42. T1 relaxometry is sensitive to cortical microstructure and myelination43,44, diffusion MRI tractography approximates structural connectivity45,46, and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has delineated macroscopic functional networks4,47,48. Notably, while conventional MRI acquisitions at field strengths of 3 T and below may have limitations in terms of resolution and signal, recent in vivo studies that have moved to high fields of 7 T and above have benefitted from enhanced resolution, sensitivity, and biological specificity49,50,51. In addition, imaging paradigms that combine multiple MRI datasets acquired across different scanning sessions in a given individual have been shown to further increase precision for the analysis of microstructure52, connectivity53,54, and function53,55. Several of such “precision neuroimaging” datasets have already led to an advanced characterization of functional systems56,57 or fostered enhanced microstructural modeling, but previous precision imaging datasets were either prioritizing functional or structural imaging acquisitions, and rarely both in the same subjects. Moreover, prior precision imaging investigations were mainly carried out at 3 T. In this study, we expand this work by leveraging a recently introduced precision neuroimaging (PNI) dataset58, which combines repeated high-resolution structural and functional acquisitions at 7 T, offering an opportunity to interrogate cortical organization in the living human brain with high sensitivity and specificity.

The current work examined the interplay of local cortical arealization and global integration. Leveraging probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of the recently disseminated Julich-Brain atlas19, we subdivided the cortex into 228 areas. In those, we profiled microstructural, structural, and functional gradients derived from repeated 7 T MRI scans. We then examined how multimodal gradient profiles differed across areas. As local-global cortical organization is presumably tied to cognitive functional architecture, we cross-referenced our maps to multiple fMRI tasks conducted in the same participants, and in particular studied the relation between inter-areal gradient profiles and functional diversity across different tasks acquired in the same subjects. The main analyzes were replicated using different parcellation atlases and datasets to validate the robustness and reliability of our findings. By integrating measures of cortical cytoarchitecture with multimodal high-definition MRI, our work sheds light on local-global cortical organization and advances our understanding of cortical structure-function relationships.

We constructed high-resolution cortex-wide connectomes, encompassing microstructural profile covariance (MPC)23, structural connectivity (SC)59, and functional connectivity (FC)22,60, in 10 healthy adults who underwent three repeated multimodal MRI scans at 7 T (Fig. 1A). We estimated connectome eigenvectors that characterized spatial gradients of MPC, SC, and FC, focusing on the first five gradients in each modality, which explained most of the variance (MPC: 31%; SC: 18%; FC: 25%). In line with prior work23, the principal MPC gradient was anchored on one end by primary sensory areas and on the other end by paralimbic regions. The principal SC gradient exhibited anterior-posterior axis, clearly dividing the cortex into two parts bounded by sensorimotor areas, as reported previously61. The first FC gradient differentiated sensory and motor cortices from the default mode network, recapitulating earlier work22,60. Other gradients were also in keeping with prior reports (Fig. 1A)23,59,60,61. To ensure equal contribution from each modality, we normalized the gradients within each modality and then averaged them in areas derived from the Julich-Brain atlas (Fig. 1B). The Julich-Brain atlas enables the investigation of structure-function association within cytoarchitectonically defined cortical subunits, though it does not cover the full cortex (please see the replication analyzes, where a cortex-wise parcellation was used). This process generated an area-wise gradient profile matrix. This matrix captures most of the information in multimodal connectomes, making it an ideal measure for investigating inter-areal differences and similarities.

A Cortex-wide connectomes were constructed from microstructural profile covariance (MPC)23, structural connectivity (SC)59,61, and functional connectivity (FC)22,60 at a vertex-level based on repeated 7 T MRI. We applied non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques129 to each connectome and aggregated the first five eigenvectors/gradients. B Probabilistic area definitions were derived from the Julich-Brain atlas19, a post-mortem cytoarchitectonic atlas based on the mapping of areas of ten postmortem brains, and their superimposition in MNI space. Please note that this probabilistic atlas does not cover the entire cortex. C We averaged vertex-wise gradients in each of the 228 areas, producing area-specific multimodal gradient profiles. These gradient profiles were reordered according to their principal component to assess inter-areal similarity. Left panel: the reordered gradient profiles located in the middle and at the two ends of the main axis were visualized in spider plots. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Middle panel: the reordered multimodal gradient profiles. Right panel: the first principal component from the original multimodal gradient profiles. Abbreviation: PCA principal component analysis, WM white matter.

We examined the similarity and differences of gradient profiles between different areas. To this end, we first conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) on the multimodal gradient profiles. These gradient profiles were reordered based on their principal component (which explained 29.6% of the variation), following a sensory-fugal axis anchored on prefrontal/cingulate regions on the one end and central/occipital regions on the other (Fig. 1C). This approach integrates salient features of its constituents (i.e., the individual MPC, SC, and FC gradients) in a synoptic manner, suggesting an overarching principle of cortical organization across multiple modalities. The reordered gradient profiles located in the middle and at the two ends of the main axis were examined and showed diverse patterns (Fig. 1C). Specifically, we observed that the bottom region of the PCA axis, corresponding to sensorimotor areas, exhibited lower gradient z-scores for MPCG1 and FCG1 and higher scores for SCG1 and SCG2. This pattern suggests that the sensorimotor network represents one end of the hierarchy across all modalities. At the opposite end of the PCA axis, regions in the inferior frontal sulcus showed the reverse pattern, representing the other extreme of the hierarchy. In contrast, the middle region displayed a relatively uniform z-score distribution, suggesting its role in linking higher-order and lower-order regions for multimodal information processing.

To further quantify area-to-area differences, we computed an inter-areal cosine distance matrix based on the original multimodal gradient profiles (Fig. 2A). The mean value of each row in this matrix indicates the overall dissimilarity of a given area from all other areas in terms of the multimodal gradient profiles. To identify cortical areas with significantly higher/lower dissimilarity compared to all other areas, we conducted spatial permutation tests (1000 permutations) that randomly rotated the Julich-Brain atlas on a sphere62. We found significant and highest inter-areal dissimilarity in sensorimotor regions (pspin < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) correction; Fig. 2A), indicating that these areas are the most unique across the cortex in terms of their multidimensional gradient profiles. Conversely, we observed the lowest dissimilarity in insular and fronto-temporal regions after spatial permutation tests (pspin < 0.05, FDR correction). This suggests that sensorimotor areas are most segregated within the overall cortical hierarchy, supporting functional specialization. Although inter-areal dissimilarity was found to correlate with temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) map (r = 0.66, pspin < 0.001; Supplementary Table 1), no significant correlations were observed with other technical imaging metrics, including the B1+ field map (r = −0.05, pspin = 0.22), the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) map from T1 scans (r = 0.12, pspin = 0.28), or the SNR map from diffusion scans (r = −0.11, pspin = 0.34). To investigate functional integration patterns, we estimated the participation coefficient (PC)63 and global FC strength. Positive, but non-significant, correlations were observed between these metrics and inter-areal dissimilarity (PC: rho = 0.13, pspin > 0.05; global FC strength: rho = 0.32, pspin > 0.05). Similar findings were observed when calculating these metrics based on group-level resting-state FC (PC: rho = 0.13, pspin > 0.05; global FC strength: rho = 0.36, pspin > 0.05).

A We calculated the cosine distance between each pair of cortical areas and computed the mean value for each area. To identify cortical areas with the highest and lowest inter-areal dissimilarity, we conducted 1000 permutation tests62. Regions with significantly higher inter-areal dissimilarity compared to other areas after applying FDR correction were highlighted using black boundaries (p < 0.05). B The left panel illustrates the distribution of inter-areal dissimilarity across four cortical hierarchies. To examine differences between each cortical hierarchical level, two-sided two-sample t-tests were conducted with FDR correction (correlations with *: pFDR < 0.05; correlations with **: pFDR < 0.001). Sample sizes: Paralim (45), Hetero (75), Uni (79), and Idio (29); all are technical replicates. Box plots display the median (center line), interquartile range (box bounds =  25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). Bars are color-coded as follows: blue for paralimbic, orange for heteromodal, green for unimodal, and red for idiotypic. To explore associations with the histological gradient, two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficients were computed (p = 0.001), and p values corrected using spin permutation tests62. C The gradient profile of parcel i was calculated by averaging the gradients across all vertices belonging to parcel i. The intra-areal dissimilarity of parcel i was then determined by calculating cosine distance between vertex-wise gradients and gradient profile of parcel i. By repeating this procedure for all parcels, we generated a map illustrating the distribution of intra-areal dissimilarity across the cortex. Regions with significantly higher intra-areal dissimilarity compared to other areas after applying FDR correction were highlighted using black boundaries (p < 0.05). D The distribution of vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity in four cortical hierarchies is shown in the left panel. To assess differences between each cortical hierarchy, two-sided two-sample t-tests were performed with FDR correction (correlations with *: pFDR < 0.05). Sample sizes: Paralim (789), Hetero (2,342), Uni (2,403), and Idio (1779); all are technical replicates. Box plots display the median (center line), interquartile range (box bounds  = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the IQR. To explore associations with the histological gradient, two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed with FDR correction. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Abbreviation: Paralim Paralimbic, Hetero Heteromodal, Uni Unimodal, Idio Idiotypic.

To gain a deeper understanding of these patterns, we investigated the distribution of inter-areal dissimilarity across four cortical hierarchical levels derived from a prior taxonomy of the primate brain proposed by Mesulam64. Using a two-sample t-test, we compared overall inter-areal dissimilarity between each pair of cortical hierarchical levels (i.e., paralimbic, heteromodal, unimodal, and idiotypic). The results revealed that the idiotypic system had the highest inter-areal dissimilarity compared to other systems (e.g., Unimodal vs Idiotypic: t = −4.73, pspin = 0.001, Cohen's d = −0.99, 95% CI = [−0.068, −0.028], FDR correction, Fig. 2B). In contrast, paralimbic systems showed lowest inter-areal dissimilarity (e.g., Paralimbic-vs-Heteromodal: t = −9.16, pspin = 0.001, Cohen's d = −1.46, 95% CI = [−0.089, −0.058], FDR correction), aligning with prior findings. To further explore associations between inter-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructure, we generated a MPC matrix of histological data obtained from the BigBrain dataset65, a 3D reconstruction of post-mortem human brain histology, and estimated its principal gradient. This gradient has previously been shown to closely recapitulate Mesulam's taxonomy of cortical hierarchical organization. In effect, we also observed a significant correlation between the histological gradient and inter-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.61, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.706, −0.552]), supporting a close association between regional cytoarchitecture and macroscale organization.

To examine inter-areal similarities using an alternative approach, we performed hierarchical clustering on cortical similarity matrices and found equivalent results, providing four robust clusters recapitulating sensory-fugal hierarchies (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We furthermore explored the layout within each parcel to better understand local organization. Here, we calculated the cosine distance between the gradient profile of each cortical vertex and the mean gradient profile of the area to which it belongs, as a measure of intra-areal dissimilarity (Fig. 2C). We found that intra-areal dissimilarity was considerably lower compared to inter-areal dissimilarity (which also confirms the utility of the used parcellation). The medial supplementary motor areas exhibited highest intra-areal dissimilarity (pspin < 0.05, spatial permutation tests, FDR correction), while the medial orbitofrontal cortex showed the lowest values under the same statistical threshold. Additionally, we found that intra-areal dissimilarity was positively correlated with parcel size (rho = 0.44, pspin = 0.001). Comparing vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity across hierarchical levels, we did not observe the same relationship between different levels as for inter-areal dissimilarity. In fact, there was a trend indicating that intra-areal dissimilarity was higher in heteromodal and unimodal association systems compared to idiotypic and paralimbic regions, though this difference was only marginally significant (Paralimbic vs Heteromodal: t = −6.03, pspin = 0.042, Cohen's d = −0.25, 95% CI = [−0.019, −0.010]; Paralimbic vs Unimodal: t = −6.54, pspin = 0.045, Cohen's d = −0.26, 95% CI = [−0.021, −0.011], FDR correction; Fig. 2D). Moreover, there was no significant association to the histological gradient derived from BigBrain (rho = −0.17, pspin = 0.12, 95% CI = [−0.280, −0.035]).

The cortical layout is intricately linked to cognition23,66. To investigate how functional connectivity patterns change across diverse cognitive states, we administered nine different fMRI tasks, including episodic memory encoding and retrieval, semantic retrieval, mnemonic similarity task (MST), and four passive movie watching paradigms in the same participants at 7 T. Functional connectivity for all cognitive states was constructed by cross-correlating the vertex-wise timeseries. We then calculated the cosine distance between the corresponding whole brain functional connectivity matrices to estimate cross-task diversity for each area (Supplementary Fig. 2). Focusing on overall diversity, we calculated the average of values across all tasks to generate the cross-task diversity map (Fig. 3A). We observed highest functional diversity in the medial temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex, while lower diversity in the medial frontal lobe and primary sensory cortex (Fig. 3B). To further explore how this functional diversity relates to cortical organization, we assessed associations between the cross-task diversity map and inter-areal dissimilarity. This was done by computing Spearman's correlation coefficient and correcting p values using 1000 spin permutation tests. Notably, we identified a marked correlation between cross-task diversity and inter-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.738, −0.583]; Fig. 3B). To control for potential influences from image quality, we performed partial correlation analyzes. The results remained consistent when controlling for tSNR (rho = −0.46, pspin = 0.001), B1+ field map (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001), CNR from the T1 data (rho = −0.70, pspin = 0.001), and SNR from the diffusion data (rho = −0.71, pspin = 0.001). The results were consistent when we excluded regions with lowest tSNR (rho = −0.70, pspin = 0.001). As expected, paralimbic areas exhibited more variable connectivity across different tasks, suggesting a more flexible functional integration into large-scale networks. In contrast, primary cortices showed less variable patterns, potentially supporting their more fixed functional specialization. Again, we only found a weak association with intra-areal dissimilarity (rho = −0.19, pspin = 0.065, 95% CI = [−0.254, −0.056]).

A The FC matrices were generated using time series data obtained from for nine tasks fMRI sessions in the same subjects. This was followed by the estimation of cosine distances across different tasks. This process resulted in a cross-task diversity matrix of dimensions. To quantify the cross-task diversity for the first vertex of all tasks, the average of each column in this matrix was computed. B By repeating the procedures outlined in (A) for each vertex and subsequently mapping the results to areas, we created an area-wise cross-task diversity map. Two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed, and p values were corrected using spin permutation tests. C By taking the average of each row of the vertex-wise FC within area and calculating the standard deviation (SD) across tasks, we generated the vertex-wise cross-task SD. Taking the average of all SDs within an area and repeating this procedure for all areas, we generated the intra-areal cross-task diversity map. Two-sided Spearman's correlation coefficient was computed, and p values were corrected using spin permutation tests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Abbreviation: FC functional connectivity.

We also investigated how intra-areal functional connectivity patterns changed across different task contexts (Fig. 3C). Here, we defined intra-areal cross-task diversity as the standard deviation between vertex-wise FC across different tasks, with the effect of parcel size controlled. We observed highest intra-areal diversity in the superior temporal lobe, while lower diversity was observed in paralimbic cortex. By computing Spearman's correlation coefficient, we identified a significant correlation between intra-areal diversity and inter-areal diversity (rho = −0.49, pspin = 0.001, 95% CI = [−0.603, −0.407]). This correlation remained significant when controlling for tSNR as a covariate (rho = −0.48, pspin = 0.001; Fig. 3C). No significant correlation was observed between intra-areal diversity across tasks and intra-areal dissimilarity in gradient profiles, however.

To assess robustness of our findings with respect to analysis parameters, we recalculated gradients, gradient profiles, as well as inter- and intra-areal gradient profile dissimilarity for each modality using different thresholds of the connectivity matrix (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%). Correlations between inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity derived from gradient profiles with different thresholds were assessed, revealing consistent results (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, we investigated the impact of varying the number of gradients within each modality, ranging from three to seven. Inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity was estimated, and consistent results were observed across different numbers (Supplementary Fig. 3). To assess the effect of using different parcellation atlases, the main results were replicated using the Glasser atlas3. This atlas is purely MRI-based, but aggregates information from different modalities and offers whole-cortex coverage. Again, consistent results were observed when using this atlas (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We assessed our findings at each of the ten individual participants who were scanned at 7 T. Similar results were found across all participants, including gradient profile matrices (Fig. 4A), and measures in inter- and intra-areal dissimilarity (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, we observed marked negative correlations between inter-areal dissimilarity and the histological gradient (rho = −0.58 ± 0.047, ranged from −0.63 to −0.49, all pspin < 0.001), and between inter-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.53 ± 0.067, ranged from −0.64 to −0.45, all pspin < 0.001). Inter-areal dissimilarity across participants was highly correlated (r = 0.90 ± 0.008; Fig. 4B). Also, intra-areal dissimilarity across participants was highly correlated (r = 0.76 ± 0.007; Fig. 4C). Individual-level intra-areal dissimilarity was considerably lower compared to inter-areal dissimilarity, and no significant associations to the histological gradient or cross-task diversity were observed. To examine the effect of sex, we conducted sex-disaggregated analyzes on the main results and observed consistent findings across both male and female subgroups.

A For each of the 10 subjects, we generated gradient profiles and inter-/intra-areal dissimilarity. Associations between individual inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient, as well as cross-task diversity were examined using Spearman's correlation coefficients. B Associations between individual inter-areal dissimilarity were estimated using two-sided Pearson's correlation. Distributions of rho values between inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.58 ± 0.047; sample sizes n = 10, with 10 biological replicates), and with cross-task diversity were examined (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.53 ± 0.067; sample sizes n = 10, with 10 biological replicates). Box plots display the mean (center line = 50% of the group), interquartile range (box bounds = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the interquartile range (IQR). C Associations between individual intra-areal dissimilarity were estimated using two-sided Pearson's correlation. Distributions of rho values between inter-areal dissimilarity and histological gradient (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.19 ± 0.051; n = 10, with 10 biological replicates), and with cross-task diversity were examined (mean ± SD of rho values = −0.21 ± 0.069; n = 10, with 10 biological replicates). Box plots display the mean (center line = 50% of the group), interquartile range (box bounds = 25th to 75th percentiles), and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5× the IQR.

We conducted replication analysis based on 12 healthy young adults (age: 29.75 ± 4.75 years, 7 females) with one session scanned at 7 T. We observed consistent results as for the main findings (Supplementary Fig. 6), supporting reproducibility.

We conducted a second replication analysis in an independent sample of 100 healthy adults (age: 34.33 ± 4.07 years, 47 females) scanned at 3 T61. Results were consistent, with similar multimodal gradients, gradient profiles, and inter-areal dissimilarity (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B). Notably, associations with histological gradients (rho = −0.40, pspin < 0.001) and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.59, pspin < 0.001) remained consistent, albeit with slightly smaller effects as for the 7 T dataset. Again, we observed only a marginal association between intra-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity (rho = −0.09, pspin > 0.1; Supplementary Fig. 7C), with no significant correlation found for histological gradients.

Functional specialization and integration are two cornerstones of neural organization67,68. While specialization relates to distinctive neural behavior across different contexts69, functional integration emphasizes the shared influence among regions, ultimately contributing to coherent experiences and behavior69,70. The present study combined multimodal MRI acquisitions with robust areal descriptions of cortical cytoarchitecture19, in order to identify the similarity and divergence of inter-areal gradient fingerprints. Vertex-wise multimodal connectomes were constructed from high-field 7 T MRI data, and cortical gradients were estimated, aligning with those described in prior studies22,23,59. We noted higher inter-areal dissimilarity in sensorimotor cortices and lower inter-areal dissimilarity in the transmodal system, indicating the distinctiveness of the primary sensory cortex as a functionally specialized system. Additionally, functional connectivity in the primary cortex exhibited less variability across tasks, suggesting that information processing from different tasks may converge at early stages. Significant associations were identified between cross-task functional diversity and inter-areal gradient profile dissimilarity, indicating a link between global cortical motifs and functional flexibility across different task contexts. These findings suggest a sensory-paralimbic differentiation in cortical gradient profiles, providing insights into neural motifs contributing to specialized and integrative brain function.

The availability of multimodal neuroimaging data offers opportunities for examining brain organization across different spatial scales12,41,42. In this work, we leveraged repeated MRI scanning at ultra-high fields of 7 T, which we hypothesized would result in high signal71, reliability, and precision53,54,55,56,57. The first principal component of our estimated multimodal gradient profiles demonstrated that sensory-functional axes jointly guide hierarchical patterns of cortical microstructure, structure, and function. Our work presents a converging overarching principle, extending prior work that has focused on specific modalities in isolation22,23,72. These findings suggested a convergence of organizational principles across different scales and at the level of structure and function. Notably, and in addition to harnessing a multimodal imaging approach, we leveraged a recently disseminated atlas derived from post-mortem histological data to finely partition the brain into distinct areas based on cytoarchitecture, a presumed gold standard for cortical mapping19. Our work, thereby, integrated dimensional gradient and area-based descriptions of macroscale cortical spatial patterns, providing a unified framework for understanding the cortical layout. This framework could identify key principles of between- and within-parcel heterogeneity, distinguish different zones across the cortical hierarchy, and reveal associations between these heterogeneity patterns and cross-task diversity. Given that the gradient profiles in our study represent vectors in a multidimensional space, we then measured the distance between all cortical areas using a cosine distance metric. As expected, we observed an overarching pattern of inter-areal dissimilarity, with one end featuring sensory and motor cortices that had the highest dissimilarity and the other end encompassing heteromodal and paralimbic areas in the transmodal apex. This suggests that functional specialization in primary sensorimotor areas is accompanied by a more distinctive organization pattern. Reliability analyzes indicated that this inter-areal pattern was not influenced by potential methodological biases, including the B1+ field map, SNR of diffusion data, or CNR of T1 data. While tSNR was correlated with inter-areal dissimilarity, the correlation between inter-areal dissimilarity and cross-task diversity remained significant even after controlling for tSNR. Overall, the axis of inter-areal dissimilarity is consistent with the gradients previously reported for single modalities that are, especially at the level of function and microstructure, also anchored in primary systems on the one end, and heteromodal and paralimbic regions on the other end22,23. Tract-tracing and neuroimaging experiments have documented that primary sensory and motor cortices host more short-range cortico-cortical connections than transmodal systems60, and these regions also tend to have a higher coupling between microstructure and function, and between structural connectivity and function27. Such findings are potentially in support of their more specialized functional profiles60,73. Notably, the pattern of cortical organization within the limbic system closely aligns with that of other cortical areas, extending previous findings derived from single modalities22,23,72,73. For instance, the paralimbic system with more long-distance connections was reported to have higher microstructural similarity60. Similarly, another study combining structural and functional connections revealed that less diverse unimodal regions show a preference for local communication, while more diverse multimodal regions engage in more global communication patterns74. Indeed, the degree of laminar differentiation also varies gradually across the cortex, reflecting the specialization of underlying cortical microcircuits75,76. It is highest in primary areas, such as the visual and somatosensory cortices, and then decreases in unimodal and heteromodal regions, to reach its lowest level in agranular areas7,77. Projection patterns similarly follow this gradient78,79,80. Together, these organizational patterns, spanning from the microscale to the macroscale, may support the integrative role of the limbic system, enabling it to participate in various cognitive processes81. However, it is important to note that no significant associations were observed between PC63 and either inter-areal dissimilarity or cross-task functional diversity, suggesting a more complex relationship between cortical heterogeneity, functional diversity, and different indices of macroscale functional integration.

Distance-dependence theory suggests that proximal regions are more likely to be inter-connected82,83. In addition, those areas sharing similar microstructural and neurobiological characteristics are also more likely to be interconnected than regions with distinct features78,84,85. These findings support the overarching idea that adjacent regions with short-range connections often share gene expression and microstructural similarities, contributing to their specialized functional roles. Conversely, while nearby neurons are expected to share similar microstructural properties when extending smooth macroscale topography to the microscale86, prior electrophysiological experiments in various mammalian brain regions have shown that nearby neurons can exhibit disparate response properties87,88,89,90. By examining intra-areal dissimilarity in gradient motifs in the current study, we furthermore probed intra-regional consistency vs heterogeneity in neural organization. Overall, intra-areal gradient profile divergence was relatively low compared to inter-areal divergences, confirming the utility of areal parcellations to meaningfully subdivide the cortex more generally56,91. Notably, although there was no clear difference in intra-areal dissimilarity between networks, we observed a trend towards increased dissimilarity within the unimodal and heteromodal cortices. We speculate that this may be related to their more integrative functional role and increased functional flexibility compared to primary sensory and motor areas, which deserves further verification in future work. Meanwhile, the potential effects of region size should also be considered, as larger regions are more likely to exhibit higher intra-region dissimilarity. Moreover, and in contrast to the inter-areal findings, we did not observe noteworthy associations between intra-areal variations and functional and microstructural indices of the cortical hierarchy. We speculate that intra-regional heterogeneity can support the processing and integration of inputs across a given cortical territory76. That is, for disparate types of information to be integrated, they must at minimum be present in the same brain regions. Moreover, these findings are aligned with the tethering hypothesis of cortical patterning, where a disproportionate enlargement of uni- and heteromodal systems during human evolution and the progressive decrease of genetically mediated signaling gradients may have contributed to their higher intra-areal dissimilarity and relative structure-function decoupling30,92.

There is growing evidence for flexibility in the functional organization of the cortex, even within a relatively fixed structural and cytoarchitectural layout38,39,40,93. For instance, recent studies found that functional activation and connectivity change in certain areas in the same individual across different tasks38,39,93. Another study found that graph theory measures such as clustering coefficient and nodal degree can change significantly when comparing the same subjects across different task conditions40. To explore this further, we investigated the inter and intra-areal functional diversity across different fMRI tasks in the same participants. Multiple patterns of inter-areal functional diversity were found in association cortices, consistent with prior studies39, where cortical regions specialized for the same functions were strongly coupled. However, high diversity was found in functionally flexible regions that participated in multiple functions, supporting their role in integrating specialized brain networks39. We also found a negative correlation between cross-task functional diversity and inter-areal dissimilarity, suggesting that globally more specialized regions, such as sensorimotor and visual cortices, exhibit more stable functional connectivity patterns across tasks. A recent study reported that functional connectivity in somatomotor cortex increased with age during childhood through adolescence, whereas it declined in association cortices, reinforcing the differentiation of sensorimotor and association systems in typical development94. These findings support the existence of a sensorimotor-association axis of cortical organization8,22, and may explain higher stability of functional connectivity in sensorimotor cortex across tasks. For intra-areal cross-task diversity, we identified a specific axis, indicating relatively stable patterns in primary sensory and paralimbic cortices. Interestingly, paralimbic areas exhibited the least intra-areal dissimilarity compared to other cortical regions, showing higher inter-areal diversity but lower intra-areal diversity in functional connectivity across tasks. This may be due to the involvement of these regions in a wide range of cognitive and affective processes81,95. Prior findings suggest that paralimbic cortices with a simple laminar structure are well suited to integrate a neural “workspace” for a unified conscious experience due to their position in cortical hierarchies and their connectivity96. We inferred that the low intra-areal diversity in paralimbic cortices across tasks is due to their relatively simple local connectivity structure. However, the interaction patterns between the paralimbic cortices and other brain regions are dynamic, adapting to integrate different sensory inputs and meet various cognitive demands when performing different tasks96,97. Collectively, these findings suggest that the heterogeneity in global and local cortical motifs across different regions is reflected in their diverse participation across different functional contexts. A series of robustness analyzes, exploring the influence of thresholds for gradient estimation and the number of gradients, yielded similar results, suggesting that our analyzes was not affected by variations in specific analysis parameters. Moreover, we observed consistent findings at the level of individual participants and could replicate our findings using an independent dataset of healthy participants scanned at 3 T. Nevertheless, future studies could explore additional sources of variability, both between participants and within the same participant over time, which may arise from individual differences and temporal factors98. In this study, we focus on structure-function relationships within areas with similar cytoarchitecture and how these relationships differ between areas. Using the Julich-Brain atlas offers significant benefits because it is based on ground-truth cytoarchitecture. However, a potential limitation is its lack of coverage of the entire cortex. This limitation is anticipated to be addressed with the future publication of the whole-brain probabilistic map, currently under development19. To mitigate this issue in the current work, we replicated our main analyzes using the Glasser atlas and found consistent results. As our work shows, cortical parcellation and gradient descriptions provide synergistic information to understand human brain organization. By thus reconciling local and global cortical patterns, our work provides insights into the neuroanatomical basis of specialized and integrative cortical functions.

Our study was based on three independent human neuroimaging datasets. A 7 T dataset (MICA-PNI, 10 subjects, multiple time points) was for the main analysis and cross-subject reliability assessment. A 7 T dataset (MICA-7T, 12 subjects, one time point) was used for replication analysis. A 3 T dataset (MICA-MICs, 100 subjects, one time point) was used for replication. Sex was determined through self-reporting by participants and was considered in the study design. To minimize potential biases, we aimed to collect an equal amount of data from both male and female participants.

For our main analysis, we investigated the imaging and phenotypic data of 10 unrelated healthy adults (age: 29.20 ± 5.20 years, 5 females). Each participant underwent three sessions on separate days. Data were collected between March 2022 and June 2023. This dataset is openly available at the OSF platform (https://osf.io/mhq3f/).

This dataset consisted of 12 unrelated healthy young adults (age: 29.75 ± 4.75 years, 7 females). Data were collected between May 2023 and May 2024.

This dataset consisted of 100 unrelated healthy young adults (age: 34.33 ± 4.07 years, 47 females). Data were collected between April 2018 and February 2021. A subset of 50 participants is openly available (https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/mica-mics)61.

The studies were approved by the Ethics Committees of McGill University and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, respectively, and written and informed consent were obtained from all participants. In addition, participants were compensated financially for each MRI scanning session attended as reimbursement for their time and participation.

MP2RAGE is acquires two 3D images with different inversion times (TI) to generate a myelin-sensitive map of the T1 relaxation times and a synthetic T1-weighted (T1w) image. The 3D MP2RAGE sequence parameters are the following: 0.5 mm isovoxels, matrix = 320 × 320, 320 sagittal slices, repetition time (TR) = 5170 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.44 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 4°, iPAT = 3, TI1 = 1000 ms, TI2 = 3200 ms, bandwidth = 210 Hz/px, echo spacing = 7.8 ms, and partial Fourier = 6/8. Scans were visually inspected to ensure minimal head motion, and repeated if necessary. Both inversion images were combined for T1 mapping and to minimize sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities99,100.

DWI data was acquired using a multiband accelerated 2D spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. The acquisition included three shells with b-values of 300, 700, and 2000 s/mm2, and 10, 40, and 90 diffusion weighting directions per shell, respectively. The parameters used were: 1.1 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 7383 ms, TE = 70.60 ms, flip angle = 90°, refocusing flip angle = 180°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.1 mm, multi-band factor = 2. Reverse phase encoding b0 images were obtained for distortion correction of the DWI scans.

All multi-echo fMRI were acquired with a 2D blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) echo-planar imaging sequence. The parameters were as follows: 1.9 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 1690 ms, TE1 = 10.8 ms, TE2 = 27.3 ms, TE3 = 43.8 ms, flip angle = 67°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.9 mm, multiband factor = 3, and echo spacing = 0.53 ms. During the 6-min rs-fMRI scan, participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, fixate on a cross presented on the screen, and not think of anything. Two spin-echo images with opposite phase encoding directions were also acquired for distortion correction of the rs-fMRI scans, with the following parameters: phase encoding = AP/PA, 1.9 mm isovoxels, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.9 mm, TR = 3000 ms, TE = 18.4 ms, flip angle = 90°. Based on a validated open-source protocol101, we collected multiple task fMRI scans, including episodic encoding/retrieval and semantic tasks, as well as the MST, which both lasted ~6 min. During the episodic memory encoding, participants memorized paired images of objects. In the retrieval phase, participants were shown an image and asked to identify the paired object from three options. Semantic memory retrieval involved identifying the object that is most conceptually related to a target image from three options. In all memory tasks, there were 56 trials, and the difficulty was modulated based on semantic relatedness scores102. During the MST, participants determined whether the object in images was indoor or outdoor, and then identified whether the object shown in images was old, similar, or new. We also collected fMRI data while participants watched movies, tracking hemodynamic activity during naturalistic viewing conditions103. A detailed imaging protocol is provided in the data release (https://osf.io/mhq3f/), including the complete list of acquisition parameters.

Two T1w scans with identical parameters were acquired with a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (0.8 mm isovoxels, matrix = 320 × 320, 224 sagittal slices, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3.14 ms, TI = 900 ms, flip angle = 9°, iPAT = 2). Scans were visually examined to ensure minimal head motion, and repeated if necessary.

qT1 relaxometry data was acquired using a 3D-MP2RAGE sequence (0.8 mm isovoxels, 240 sagittal slices, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 2.9 ms, TI 1 = 940 ms, T1 2 = 2830 ms, flip angle = 4°, flip angle 2 = 5°, iPAT = 3, bandwidth = 270 Hz/px, echo spacing = 7.2 ms, partial Fourier = 6/8). Both inversion images were combined for qT1 mapping to minimize sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities and optimize intra- and inter-subject reliability99,100.

DWI data was acquired using a 2D spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence, consisting of three shells with b-values = 300, 700, and 2000 s/mm2, and with 10, 40, and 90 diffusion weighting directions per shell, respectively (1.6 mm isovoxels, TR = 3500 ms, TE = 64.40 ms, flip angle = 90°, refocusing flip angle = 180°, FOV = 224 × 224 mm2, slice thickness = 1.6 mm, multi-band factor = 3, echo spacing = 0.76 ms). b0 images acquired in reverse phase encoding direction were used for distortion correction of DWI scans.

A 7-min rs-fMRI scan was acquired using multiband accelerated 2D-BOLD echo-planar imaging (3 mm isovoxels, TR = 600 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 52°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, mb factor = 6, echo spacing = 0.54 ms). Participants were instructed to keep their eyes open, not fall asleep, and look at a fixation cross. Two spin-echo images with reverse phase encoding were also included for distortion correction of the rs-fMRI scans (phase encoding = AP/PA, 3 mm isovoxels, TR = 4029 ms, TE = 48 ms, flip angle = 90°, FOV = 240 × 240 mm2, slice thickness = 3 mm, echo spacing = 0.54 ms, bandwidth = 2084 Hz/Px).

The MP2RAGE scans of each subject were reoriented using FSL104, linearly co-registered, averaged, with background noise removed, corrected for intensity nonuniformity using N4 bias field correction from ANTS105, and segmented into white and gray matter using FSL FAST104. Resulting volumes were skull stripped using FSL104,106. Cortical surface models were generated from native T1w scans using FastSurfer107. Surface reconstructions for each subject underwent manual correction for segmentation errors, by placing control points and applying manual edits. The B1+ field map and the CNR of the T1 map were calculated for each participant to assess reliability.

Regarding the DWI data, pre-processing was carried out using MRtrix108 in the native DWI space. The DWI data underwent denoising109,110, b0 intensity normalization, and correction for susceptibility distortion, head motion, and eddy currents. These corrections were performed using FSL111 and involved utilizing two b = 0 s/mm2 volumes with reverse phase encoding. Anatomical masks for tractography were non-linearly co-registered to native DWI space using the deformable SyN approach implemented in ANTs112. We computed the mean and standard deviation maps of the b0 images. For each participant, voxel-wise SNR maps were generated by dividing the mean map by the standard deviation map. These SNR maps were subsequently projected onto the fsLR-5k surface.

For the rs-fMRI scans, pre-processing steps were conducted using AFNI113 and FSL104 tools. The first five volumes were discarded to ensure magnetic field saturation. We applied Multi-Echo Independent Components Analysis114,115 to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and effect of motion correction. Spike regression was applied to remove timepoints with large motion spikes, effectively removing nuisance signals116,117. The volume time series were registered to FastSurfer107 space using boundary-based registration implemented in ANTs using linear and non-linear methods118. The tSNR maps were estimated for each participant.

The surface reconstructions for each subject underwent manual inspection and correction for segmentation errors by placing control points and applying manual edits. The qT1 scans were linearly co-registered to the corresponding subject's T1w scan.

The volume time series were registered to FastSurfer107 space using boundary-based registration implemented in ANTs using linear and non-linear methods118.

To investigate the vertex-wise multimodal connectomes, we first constructed a downsampled fsLR-5k surface using HCP's workbench tools (wb_command)120. The fsLR-32k surface templates and resampling spheres between “fsaverage” and “fs_LR” were accessed from the HCP's open-access pipeline121. Subsequently, we downsampled the surface template, registration spheres, and mid-wall mask to 5k, resulting in a mesh comprising 4432 cortical vertices for each hemisphere. All vertex-wise analyzes were performed based on this fsLR-5k surface.

We calculated vertex-wise MPC matrices for each participant. Consistent with previous work23,122,123, we constructed 14 equivolumetric surfaces between the pial and white matter boundaries to sample qT1 intensities across cortical depths. This procedure generated distinct intensity profiles reflecting intracortical microstructural composition at each cortical vertex. Data sampled from surfaces closest to the pial and white matter boundaries were removed to mitigate partial volume effects. Intensity values at each depth were mapped to a common template surface, resampled to fsLR-5k surface, and spatially smoothed across each surface independently (full width at half maximum [FWHM] = 3 mm). Vertex-wise intensity profiles were cross-correlated using partial correlations controlling for the average cortex-wide intensity profile and log-transformed. This procedure resulted in the MPC matrices representing participant-specific similarity in myelin proxies across the cortex.

To generate each individual's SC, we employed MRtrix on pre-processed DWI data108. Each surface vertex from the fsLR-5k surface was translated into a volumetric region of interest that filled the cortical ribbon using workbench tools120. This process yielded ~10 k seeds/targets for structural connectome generation. Anatomical segmentations and volumetric seeds were then mapped to DWI space, applying the non-linear registration warp-field mentioned earlier. Next, we estimated multi-shell and multi-tissue response functions124 and performed constrained spherical deconvolution to derive a fiber orientation distribution map125,126. This procedure, achieved through MRtrix, generated a tractogram with 40 M streamlines, with a maximum tract length of 250 mm and a fractional anisotropy cutoff of 0.06. To reconstruct whole-brain streamlines weighted by cross-sectional multipliers127, we applied spherical deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2). Connection weights between seeds/targets were defined as the streamline count after SIFT2.

Next, individual rs-fMRI timeseries mapped to subject-specific surface models were resampled to fsLR-5k surface. Surface-based rf-MRI data underwent spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 3 mm). An individual's FC matrix was generated by cross-correlating all vertex-wise timeseries. Correlation values subsequently underwent Fisher-R-to-Z transformations. FC matrices of all task fMRI scans were also generated using the same approach.

We converted each participant's SC, MPC, and FC matrices to a normalized angle affinity matrix, respectively, and applied diffusion map embedding on these matrices to generate multimodal gradients128. This non-linear dimensionality reduction procedure identified eigenvectors that describe main spatial axes of variance. Procrustes analysis aligned subject-level gradients to a group-level template generated from the group-average matrix of all participants. Gradients of the right hemisphere were aligned to the left hemisphere. Gradient analyzes were performed using BrainSpace (v0.1.10; http://github.com/MICA-MNI/BrainSpace), limiting the number of gradients to 10 and using default sparsity (keeping the top 10% of SC weights) and diffusion (α = 0.5) parameters129. Here, we focused on the first five principal gradients of each modality (Fig. 1A). For each modality, all gradients were normalized by dividing by the maximum value in the absolute value of gradients, with values ranging from −1.0 to 1.0.

The Julich-Brain is a 3D probabilistic atlas of the human brain's cytoarchitecture, resulting from the analysis of 10 post-mortem human brains19 (Fig. 1B). The probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps (Julich-Brain v2.9, https://julich-brain-atlas.de/) were projected onto a template fsLR-5k surface to generate a surface-based representation19. Surface-based probabilistic maps contained values indicating the probability of an area being localized in each voxel, ranging from 0% to 100% overlap, with values ranging from 0 to 1. We registered the probabilistic maps to the fsLR-5k surface template. For each vertex, we defined its area label by identifying the area with the highest probability at that position. This area label was then used to assign all vertices on the fsLR-5k surface to the 228 areas defined by the Julich-Brain.

Understanding the relationships between diverse brain regions, including their similarities and differences, is essential for investigating the spatial patterns of brain organization. In this study, we focus on exploring inter-areal heterogeneity and homogeneity to further reveal the global layout of cortical area. To quantify inter-areal heterogeneity, we computed the inter-areal dissimilarity for each area. Specifically, we calculated the cosine distance between gradient profiles of each area, resulting in a cosine distance matrix (Fig. 2A). The inter-areal dissimilarity was defined as the mean of each row in the cosine distance matrix, representing the distance between an area and all other areas. To identify cortical regions with significantly higher or lower inter-areal dissimilarity, we projected the inter-areal dissimilarity map onto a sphere and conducted 1000 spin permutation tests. An area was considered to have the highest inter-areal dissimilarity among the cortex if its original inter-areal dissimilarity value exceeded 97.5% of the permutation values. Conversely, an area was regarded as having the lowest inter-areal dissimilarity if its original value was lower than 97.5% of the permutation values. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied the FDR correction. To further investigate patterns of inter-areal dissimilarity, we conducted a network-level analysis utilizing the scheme proposed by Mesulam64, which delineates four cortical functional zones (i.e., idiotypic, paralimbic, unimodal, heteromodal; see Fig. 2B). Inter-areal dissimilarity between each pair of cortical hierarchies was compared using a two-sample t-test. FDR corrections were applied to correct for multiple comparisons, while spatial autocorrelation spin permutation tests were conducted for all tests. In order to explore the associations between inter-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructural hierarchy, we generated a MPC matrix based on histological data from BigBrain65, an ultrahigh-resolution 3D human brain model. From this matrix, we estimated the principal histological gradient as a representation of microstructural hierarchy. To examine the associations between the histological gradient and inter-areal dissimilarity, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient, with p-values corrected using 1000 spin permutation tests. To investigate the relationship between inter-areal dissimilarity and functional integration patterns, we calculated the PC63 using four cortical hierarchical levels64 as communities. Additionally, we estimated global FC strength by averaging the FC values for each region.

Differences between cortical regions are crucial to functional specialization, but at the same time, similarities between regions support the realization of higher-order cognitive functions and functional integration across brain regions. To assess the homogeneity of cortical areas, we calculated (1-cosine distance) to represent the similarity between regional gradient profiles, resulting in an affinity matrix (Supplementary Fig. 1A). To evaluate the association between inter-areal similarity and cortical hierarchy, we examined the distribution of similarity coefficients across four hierarchy levels. To identify cortical areas with higher similarity, we performed hierarchical clustering on the affinity matrix to detect groups among the areas. We evaluated the clustering performance by calculating criterion values to determine the optimal number of clusters. We scrutinized the clusters with the highest criterion value and assessed the distribution of cortical hierarchies within each cluster to investigate the association between inter-areal homogeneity and cortical laminar differentiation.

Functional segregation of distinct regions is a critical principle of the human brain. It is thus important to investigate the local organization, i.e., the layout within an area to provide insights into the wiring principle of the cortex. Given that each area was originally defined based on shared neuroanatomical features, we expect to find overall high intra-areal homogeneity. Here we quantified, however, to what extent the level of homogeneity varies across the brain. We assessed inter-areal dissimilarity at both the region-level and network-level. As previously described, we calculated the gradient profiles for each area by averaging the vertex-wise gradients within that area. For a given area i, we calculated the cosine distance between the vertex-wise multimodal gradients and gradient profile of area i, resulting in the generation of intra-areal dissimilarity of area i (Fig. 2C). This procedure was repeated for all areas, yielding the vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity map.

To visualize the patterns of intra-areal heterogeneity more effectively, we calculated the average vertex-wise intra-areal dissimilarity within each area. By controlling for the number of vertices within each area, we accounted for the effect of area size. Furthermore, we investigated the intra-areal dissimilarity at the network-level using the four cortical hierarchies proposed in a previous study64. We examined the distribution of intra-areal dissimilarity within these four cortical hierarchies and compared the differences between each hierarchy using a two-sample t-test with FDR correction and spatial autocorrelation spin permutation tests. To investigate associations between intra-areal dissimilarity and cortical microstructural hierarchy, we calculated Spearman's correlation coefficient between the histological gradient and intra-areal dissimilarity, correcting the p value using 1000 spin permutation tests.

To explore patterns of functional diversity across tasks, we constructed vertex-wise FC matrices by cross-correlating timeseries data derived from multiple task fMRI sessions. The cosine distance between each vertex from different tasks was then computed, resulting in a cross-task diversity matrix (Fig. 3A). To quantify the cross-task diversity for a specific task, we averaged all distance values between that task and others. This process was repeated for all tasks, and the outcomes were mapped to areas, generating area-wise cross-task diversity for each task. Focusing on overall diversity, we calculated the average of values across all tasks to create the cross-task diversity map (Fig. 3B). To investigate associations between cross-task diversity and inter-/intra-areal dissimilarity, we computed Spearman's correlation coefficient. The resulting p values were corrected for spatial autocorrelations using 1000 spin permutation tests.

To further investigate how intra-areal FC patterns change with tasks, we estimated the intra-areal cross-task diversity. For each area, we calculated the mean of FC strength between each vertex v to other vertices within a. We repeated this process for all tasks t and estimated the standard deviation across tasks (Fig. 3C). We summed all vertex-wise standard deviation values within the area and divided it by the number of vertices in this area to control for the effect of parcel size. We examined the correlation between intra- and inter-areal cross-task diversity by computing Spearman's correlation coefficient, controlling tSNR as a covariate, and controlling for the spatial autocorrelation using 1000 spin permutation tests.

Metrics details

A rift has occurred within the scientific community between two formerly close-knit fields: condensed matter physics and electronic device engineering. What started as a union to understand the fundamental optical and electrical properties of semiconductors has been split by divergent interests. While the partnership has produced revolutionary changes in the way that information is processed and consumed by an increasingly interconnected society, now the two disciplines rarely speak to one another. As the years have passed, condensed matter physics has become enamored with delicate electronic effects in increasingly complex materials and geometries to the detriment of realistic applications. Meanwhile, device engineering has remained steadfastly focused on room-temperature performance and overall efficiency, prizing incremental improvement over potential disruptive advances using alternative materials and physics. Recent advances in topological electronic systems—in particular those exploiting Chern insulators—while elegant, prompt a necessary reexamination of the device engineering needs and the associated metrics with the goal of establishing a commonality within the blooming field of topological electronics. The purpose of this Comment is to initiate such a reexamination in the hopes that, with a better understanding of future device needs, perhaps the two areas may reunite to usher in the next electronic revolution via the use of topological phenomena.

An uncontroversial observation concerning the trajectory of topological condensed matter research, is that the bifurcation into fundamental and applied categories has been accelerating1,2. The previous acknowledgment of applications in publications has been a slight reference to a specific use case at the end of the abstract and a second time in the concluding statements. This has been replaced by detailed and precise demonstrations of topological phenomena, with the specific intention of investigating the potential role of topological matter in future device technologies. Perhaps one of the most recent and elegant demonstrations of such applied topological research comes in the form of Chern networks3,4,5,6. Generally speaking, a Chern network, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, refers to the electrical and/or magnetic control of dissipation-free 1D chiral edge state propagation between non-local electrical contacts within a heterogeneous device design. To be clear, the definition of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a state in which the longitudinal resistivity disappears, ρxx = 0, while at the same time the Hall resistivity becomes exactly quantized as ρxy = h/e2 in the absence of a net magnetic flux penetrating the device structure7,8. By controlling the sign of the applied perpendicular magnetic field, or ultimately an applied electric field as illustrated in Fig. 1(A), the chirality of the edge state may be controlled. The roots of 1D chiral edge transport in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry may be traced directly back to the foundational work by Haldane9. Nevertheless, the functional physical principle behind Chern networks is the successful exploitation of the bulk–boundary correspondence between fabricated device regions that possess any discrepancy between regional (first) Chern numbers. Therefore, the idea of being able to use applied electromagnetic fields to alter the direction and destination of dissipationless edge current flow provokes images of a clear topological means to guide the transmission of information within interconnected and arbitrarily complex device geometries, as shown in Fig. 1B. In a short amount of time, the evolutionary arc that connects the early efforts in the fabrication of a Chern network using antiferromagnetic MnBi2Te4 layers grown via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) immersed within a strong, but non-quantizing, magnetic field3 to the most recent use of magnetically-doped topological insulators created via an in-situ MBE mask that function without the need for continuous application of an external magnetic field6, it is clear that continued refinement of Chern networks will produce quantized topological transmission of current between non-locally connected contacts. While the continued improvement of Chern networks may be a forgone conclusion, the more pertinent questions, asked from a more applied perspective, are two-fold: (1) what device need is being addressed? (2) how does the successful implementation of the Chern network compare with other proposed device engineering solutions? Questions about the form of future electronic device technologies have been a topic of heavy debate for many years. To be more specific, the most quoted proposed solution that Chern networks are cited to address is the issue of power consumption. Currently, traditional electronic information processing is accomplished using highly interconnected complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device technologies. It is well-known that within CMOS, most of the power input to a chip is consumed when the state of the device is being altered either from the “off" state to “on" state or vice versa. Given the sheer number of power dissipating transistors that comprise current microelectronic chip designs—134 billion in the Apple M2 Ultra10—it is unsurprising that even the most energy efficient device solutions will dissipate a significant amount of energy in the course of normal operation. To this end, the semiconductor industry, and device engineers more broadly, are keenly aware of the power dissipation issue and have actively sought alternative “Beyond CMOS" device technologies using new physical principles and materials. If, indeed, the Chern network or another forthcoming solution proposes a device for practical consideration then there exist well-established device metrics that may be found in the International Roadmap of Devices and Systems (IDRS) against which these proposed devices must be benchmarked11,12,13. In this Comment, I point to some of the issues related to size, temperature, and performance that may hinder Chern networks as a viable technological solution by device engineers, and I ask questions that require the attention of both physics and engineering researchers. In doing so, my goal is to take one step towards normalizing and applying the relevant figures of merit, where appropriate, to prod the nascent dialog between condensed matter physics and device engineering towards joint solutions that address real-life performance needs.

A Illustration of an electrostatically tunable Chern insulator, otherwise known as the quantum anomalous Hall insulator, shown as evolving from a Chern number of C = −2 to C = + 2 as tuned by an external gate voltage, VGATE. As the value of the Chern number changes, the number and chirality of the edge states propagating about the periphery of the system, as shown by the associated directional arrows. B An illustration of a Chern network where multiple externally tunable Chern insulators, each containing regions of distinct Chern number, are brought into close proximity to one another. The interactions change the overall direction of the flow of information in an externally controllable manner allowing for potentially complex designs. Current is input into the system and, given the pattern of Chern numbers in the network, the propagating current is directed into different remotely located voltage probes before exiting the network.

In the quest to find stronger overlap between device engineering and condensed matter physics through applied topological electronics, it is legitimate to ask to what extent the work done in applied topology originating in condensed matter addresses an identified need within device engineering. In an attempt to resolve the question with regards to the Chern network, consider first the basic building block of the Chern network—the QAH insulator—from an engineering perspective. From the perspective of condensed matter physics, one of the features of the QAH insulator is the fact that the conduction is performed completely at the interface between two regions of differing Chern numbers. From the device engineering perspective, one of the largest faults of the QAH insulator is that the conduction is performed only along a thin section of the system. To have such a wide area of the 2D bulk between the counter-propagating edge states of potential chip space left unused is unacceptable in high-performance circuit design. On the other hand, it is impossible to have only one single chiral edge state without the associated 2D bulk to support the 1D holographic edge state. Therefore, the edge state topology is only protected while there is sufficient separation between the counter-propagating edge states so as to forbid the scattering of quasiparticles from one chiral edge into the anti-chiral partner localized on an opposing edge within the device structure. The application related question of minimum device size becomes a vital one that condensed matter has started to address. To this point, in recent work, the confinement of the QAH insulator edge state has been examined in MBE grown topological insulator (TI) devices comprised of 3 quintuple layers (QLs) of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 with 4 intervening QLs of undoped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. Quantum transport measurements on these layers have been systematically conducted as a function of applied magnetic fields and gate voltages over a wide range of QAH insulator widths from w = 300 nm to w = 10 μm with a minimum width of wmin = 72 nm14. The results illustrate how the penetration of the edge state into the bulk, perhaps aided by the presence of bulk disorder, limits the width to be w ≈ 72 nm given a decay length of the edge state into the bulk of Ledge ≈ 36 nm. For comparative purposes, using the IRDS 2022 edition, the width of center-to-center distance for the first metal interconnect line, or pitch, in production year 2022 CMOS-based logic devices was already at 24 nm. Additionally, the CMOS logic technology is based on FinFET architecture, in which a nanoribbon of semiconductor is contacted on three sides to form conducting channels, that may then be stacked to form the eventual multi-billion transistor application. Put in this perspective, Chern networks would need to be scaled in size to well below currently accessible dimensions to be competitive either as logic or interconnect implementations. Furthermore, in the context of multi-billion device applications, the presence of a comparably large resistance of Rchern = 25.8 kΩ per Chern device is noteworthy. The fundamental resistance implies that significant, compared to CMOS, energy will be dissipated in Chern networks not just during switching events, but during steady-state operation. Such limitations portend questions about the overall power efficiency of large multi-device Chern networks as they are scaled by number and not only size.

From an engineering perspective, temperature is a vital quantity. Naturally, if the intended application is to be within the context of, for example, superconducting electronics15, then the energy scales of the system are expected to be small and, therefore, a path to functionality at room temperature, here defined to be TRT = 300 K, need not exist. However, if conventional computing, memory or spintronic applications are the goal, then there must necessarily be a path—regardless of the circuitry—that ends with room-temperature operation. To date, there are two separate paths that have been explored as a means to implement the QAH effect within topological materials. The first and most successful approach is to use magnetic dopants to fabricate compounds such as Cr-doped (BiSb)2Te3 or V-doped (BiSb)2Te36,16,17. Indeed, such material systems have demonstrated the QAH effect, albeit with two caveats. First, the observation of the QAH effect is at very low temperatures, typically below T ≤ 200 mK despite observed Curie temperatures that are on the order of TC ≈ 20K17. The second caveat is that the longitudinal resistance ρxx ≈ 0 only at the lowest system temperatures and in the presence of the smallest excitation currents. The difficulty in obtaining quantized transport in magnetically doped topological materials indicates that the magnetic exchange gap, ΔEX, that is opened by the ferromagnetic orientation of the dopant ions is very small compared to the system thermal energy18,19. Furthermore, the non-quantized transport at the edge of the system dictates that the system is not topological and indicates the existence of an alternative conduction path via the bulk16,17.

Nevertheless, opportunities exist to make progress towards greater thermal stability in Chern networks. Rather than appealing to an overall ferromagnetic state mediated by magnetic dopants, an alternative that may lead to higher resilience to thermal effects may be proximity-induced magnetism. From a naive perspective, the existence of a multitude of magnetic materials boasting Curie temperatures that are greater than TRT and topological materials that host topological phases at temperatures greater than TRT accommodates the possibility of engineering a high-temperature QAH insulator phase20,21. To this end, there have been a number of significant studies that have paired magnetic materials with high Curie temperatures and topological materials21,22,23,24. At this time, however, while there are clear signatures of induced magnetism in the target topological material, there is no clear evidence of a Chern insulator produced via proximity coupling of disparate magnetic and topological materials. Yet one of the most compelling implications resulting from the experimental and subsequent theoretical work25 is that the presence of an overall long-range magnetic phase—either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic—may be irrelevant to the ability to instill high-temperature proximity-coupled phases within an adjacent topological material. In this context, if high-temperature operation is to be optimized, then the choice of magnetic materials should not be predicated on the energy scale associated with TC but rather based on two criteria: (1) the median physical distance between the magnetic atoms within the host magnetic material and the surface of the topological material, and (2) the magnitude of the magnetic moment associated with the magnetic atoms in the host magnetic material.

When considering applied topology from both the condensed matter and device engineering perspectives, there is no larger separation between the disciplines as when considering the performance expectation gap between condensed matter perception and device engineering reality. Within condensed matter physics literature, the Chern network is a virtual panacea that is poised to cure the real engineering problems surrounding the reduced performance enhancements obtained by the inexorable shrinking of CMOS implementations of semiconductor logic devices. However, the performance degradation obtained with device scaling is well understood by the device engineering community and routinely updates the metrics by which they measure the performance of semiconductor logic and the constituent devices12. Furthermore, device engineering has recognized the need to find disruptive technologies that will enhance the performance of key components of digital information processing11. Thus, any proffered solution must be benchmarked against current CMOS on these key figures of merit (FoM). For instance, the use of topological materials, and even Chern networks, has long been proposed as a methodology to overcome the rise in the resistance of copper interconnects with continued scaling due to grain boundary and surface scattering12. Benchmarking the use of topological materials as interconnects has, indeed, shown benefits over copper with the caveat being that such topological benefits only become appreciable when the interconnect diameters are scaled below 6nm in width and ignores the question of how one would integrate these interconnects into the CMOS fabrication process to replace Cu26. In light of this, we apply basic benchmarking to the Chern network to determine where, as of now, this scientific development sits amongst other current and proposed technologies on two key FoM: subthreshold slope and drive current. Thus, to make a comparison between the Chern network performance and the 2022 generation, or 3nm-node logic device specifications, we use an analogy with the edge channel current to represent the drain current, IDS, with the backgate voltage being the same as the gate-to-source voltage, VGS.

We begin with the subthreshold slope (Ssub), which is a FoM that quantifies the amount of power that is required to change the current flow by one order of magnitude:

Subthreshold slope is one of the primary measures for overall comparison of effectiveness of current modulation via an external applied electric field. For a standard CMOS transistor, the subthreshold slope is limited by thermionic emission of carriers over the potential barrier that separates the origin of carriers within a transistor, i.e., the source, from the point where the injected carriers are extracted, i.e., the drain. The fundamental limit for CMOS transistors is Ssub = 60 mV/dec and state of the art transistors operate very close to this fundamental limit at between Ssub = 75 – 82 mV/dec in the 2022 production line12.

A simple calculation using published data indicates that the Chern network, currently, has a subthreshold slope of Ssub = 333.45 mV/dec5. While the calculated Ssub may be improved over successive iterations, the major difficulty is that these measurements are carried out at 20 mK and not at room temperature. Further, the voltages that are applied to the gate to modulate the conduction are several orders of magnitude larger than in the state-of-the-art CMOS transistor. However, the expressly low temperature operation may be advantageous in certain applications due to the inability of CMOS devices to operate at low temperatures due to dopant freeze-out—or the state where the thermal energy imparted to the dopant atoms is insufficient for them to become ionized. Therefore, Chern networks may find utilization in applications such as superconducting spintronics for alternative forms of low-temperature logic27,28.

The reality of the highly interconnected architecture of CMOS is that the successful operation of one isolated device is of questionable value. While such singular demonstrations are important as a means of determining basic proof of concept, it is crucial to ensure that a path exists for one singular device concept to be capable of producing sufficient current to drive subsequent stages of device architecture. In logic core devices produced for the 2022 3 nm technology node, the main MOS architecture is the FinFET, which consists of a thin Si nanoribbon that is surrounded on three sides by a metal gate12. Therefore, when the device is turned on by inverting the surface beneath the gate, three conductive channels are produced resulting in an on-state current of between Ion = 65 – 88 μA per device with a corresponding off-state current of Ioff = 0.1 – 10 nA/μm12. Given the topological nature of the current flow in the Chern network, it is natural to expect the Hall current to be quantized. Using the same topological argument, the longitudinal current may flow without dissipation, however, there is an associated active device resistance that is fundamentally limited to h/e2. For comparative purposes, consider the drive current density within a Chern network, \({J}_{on}^{CN}={e}^{2}{V}_{on}/h{L}_{edge}\), with Von being the drive voltage. Chern networks are currently incapable of approaching the current density in a CMOS transistor, \({J}_{on}^{CMOS}=874\,\mu A/\mu m\). However, additional iterations of Chern networks using different magnetic and/or topological materials may show increased current density by increasing the topological gap size, ΔEX in the Chern network. Increases in ΔEX effectively reduce the size of Ledge, thereby, increasing the resultant current density in a Chern network.

Nonetheless, the consequences of such low current flow within the device structure may best be understood by considering the device concepts of static and dynamic fan-out. Fan-out is defined as the number of logic-gate inputs that may be driven by the output of a given logic gate without degradation of the logical state. While the static—or resistive DC component—of fan-out may be improved by better mitigation of contact resistances in Chern networks, the dynamic—or AC capacitive component—is more pernicious. The speed at which a signal moves through logic gates is limited by the charging time of the inherent capacitance of the logic gates, leading to propagation delays. Propagation delays may be, in part, overcome by using higher input currents to charge the next logic gate, via

In Eq. (2), Iinput is the input current fed into the logic element from a previous logic stage, Clogic is the capacitance and Vlogic is the voltage of the current logic gate, respectively. Eq. (2) indicates that by increasing the current fed into subsequent logic stages from previous stages, the voltage across the current logic stage increases faster thereby increasing the speed of signal propagation. Cast in this light, the small output current from the Chern network will produce significant delays in signal propagation if integrated within a CMOS framework.

The advances put forth in the recent series of Chern network experiments represent a glimpse of the functionality and the variability of topological materials and responses. Given the difficulties discussed, namely scaling, temperature and performance, it is unlikely that such systems will find a home in next-generation CMOS technologies. However, while the specific expression of topological behavior may not impact the device architecture landscape, the important lessons learned within these impressive works must serve as the basis for continued exploration of topological materials from the applied or device perspective.

To me, the overarching question germane to both perspectives is “Does the presence of topology matter for enabling new technologies?". Nevertheless, many open questions remain from both the fundamental and applied perspectives. From the applied perspective, questions remain around fundamental device properties, such as understanding the electrostatic and transport properties of deposited metals on topological materials, as this relates directly to the device contact resistance—a crucial parameter in any application15,29. From the fundamental perspective, an intriguing question surrounds the importance of crystallinity to device performance. Put another way: is it necessary to have perfectly crystalline topological materials to be able to exploit topological functionality? When considering time-reversal invariant topological materials, like (Bi,Sb)2Se3, the topological nature is protected by the inversion of band ordering that is brought about by the strength of the spin–orbit interaction. However, amorphous materials, characterized by randomized hopping strengths and positions of atoms within a material possessing neither long-range or short-range order, constructed from atoms with strong spin–orbit interactions, have been shown to possess the same topological features30,31. Therefore, perhaps the consideration of a cheaper quasi-crystalline topological system may be able to produce similar behavior at lower cost and effort32, if the presence of a topological surface state is the critical requirement for device implementations.

Regardless, my perspective remains that the goal of topological technologies should be to replace functionality at the system level rather than at the level of individual devices. As we begin to look towards bringing the areas of condensed matter physics and device engineering closer, I believe that by starting the dialogue by examining some of the recent condensed matter successes and open device engineering questions to be addressed, we may collectively move towards a viable topological technology.

NASA's upcoming missions to the Moon are set to be a lot more chilly than the Apollo program, and the agency is working to figure out how to keep its astronauts snug when visiting the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole.

A team of NASA engineers is preparing to test elbow joints in a large cryogenic chamber to evaluate the fabric of the next-generation spacesuits designed to be worn by astronauts on the Moon. The Cryogenic Ice Testing, Acquisition Development, and Excavation Laboratory, or CITADEL for short, was built to test robot parts for non-crewed missions launching to places like the icy moons of the solar system. CITADEL is now being used for humanity's long-anticipated return to the Moon.

“We want to understand what the risk is to astronauts going into permanently shadowed regions, and gloves and boots are key because they make prolonged contact with cold surfaces and tools,” Zach Fester, an engineer with the Advanced Suit Team at NASA Johnson and the technical lead for the boot testing, said in a statement.

The 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide CITADEL is housed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. While most cryogenic facilities use liquid nitrogen to cool an object, CITADEL uses compressed helium to reach temperatures as low as -370 Fahrenheit (-223 Celsuis). The chamber takes several days to reach the desired temperatures, and opening it can restart the entire process. To avoid that the CITADEL is equipped with four load locks, drawer-like chambers through which test materials can be inserted while maintaining its chilled vacuum state.

CITADEL also has a robotic arm to grab test materials, as well as visible and infrared light cameras to capture the entire testing process. For simulations of the Moon missions, the team will also add abrasion testing and lunar regolith-like material to the chamber, and aluminum blocks to simulate tools that the astronauts might grab.

In the past, NASA would use its actual astronauts for thermal testing, forcing them to insert their gloved hands inside a chilled glove box, grab a frigid object and hold onto it until their skin temperatures dropped as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). The space agency now uses a custom-built manikin hand and foot for testing inside CITADEL. The manikin's extremities are equipped with a system of fluid loops to mimic the flow of warm blood through the appendages, and dozens of temperature and heat flux sensors collect data from inside the gloves and boots.

NASA's Artemis 3 mission is set to land astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time since the days of Apollo. While Apollo astronauts landed near the equator on the near side of the Moon, the Artemis crews will explore the lunar south pole. The Moon's south pole is of great interest to scientists as it may hold water ice in permanently shadowed regions, but it does present a harsh environment due to extreme temperatures and areas where the Sun's light doesn't reach. The Artemis astronauts will spend somewhere around two hours at a time inside craters that may contain ice deposits, where temperatures can reach a chilling -414 degrees Fahrenheit (-248 degrees Celsius), according to NASA.

Astronauts returning to the Moon will don new, fashion-forward spacesuits. In 2022, NASA tasked Axiom Space with developing the first moonwalking spacesuits since the Apollo missions. The company then announced the AxEMU, short for Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, which was built on the legacy of the Apollo spacesuits while incorporating new technology to allow astronauts more mobility and better protection against the lunar environment. Axiom Space partnered with Prada to draw on the brand's expertise in design and materiasl, while also trying to provide an aesthetically pleasing look for the astronauts on the Moon.

The ongoing tests in CITADEL will help NASA prepare criteria for its next-generation AxEMU spacesuits. Meanwhile, the gloves being tested in the chamber are the sixth version of a glove NASA began using in the 1980s, and a part of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit that the astronauts on board the International Space Station wear to carry out spacewalks. The gloves have so far performed poorly in CITADEL, proving that they would not meet the thermal requirements of the lunar south pole, according to NASA. Results from the testing on the boots haven't been fully analyzed yet.

Shane McFarland, technology development lead for the Advanced Suit Team at NASA Johnson, said in a statement, “This test is looking to identify what the limits are: How long can that glove or boot be in that lunar environment? We want to quantify what our capability gap is for the current hardware so we can give that information to the Artemis suit vendor, and we also want to develop this unique test capability to assess future hardware designs.”

NASA's Artemis 3 mission is set to launch in 2027, sending astronauts on a journey across previously unexplored areas of the Moon. Hopefully the astronauts can keep warm in the dark and chilly lunar south pole.

Mast cells are part of our immune system, protecting our body from viruses, bacteria, and even harmful substances released by snake and insect bites. When alerted to the presence of such invaders, mast cells can create mucus, trigger swelling and itching, and make muscles contract in our airways, stomach, and intestines. While these symptoms allow the body to destroy or expel invaders, oversensitive mast cells cause allergic reactions, including life-threatening and hard-to-treat conditions.

As detailed in a study published Monday in the journal Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy, researchers have developed a compound that blocks mast cells from triggering particularly hard-to-treat and sometimes life-threatening reactions. These include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, chronic itching, and migraines. Traditionally considered pseudo-allergic reactions, these conditions have more recently been classified as a type of allergy, according to the researchers. The compound seems to greatly reduce symptoms, and as a consequence, lower fatality risk.

“We thus see this as an extremely promising substance,” Christa Müller, a co-author of the study who researches medicinal chemistry of membrane proteins at the University of Bonn, said in a university statement.

Unlike some allergic reactions, in which immune cells called antibodies alert mast cells to the presence of invaders, these hard-to-treat conditions occur when mast cells are triggered through direct activation not involving antibodies. This triggers reactions “of a specific nature that have been difficult to treat, and remain so to this day,” Müller explained.

15 years ago, Müller and colleagues identified a receptor named MRGPRX2 in the mast cells' membrane that “switches on” these sorts of reactions when certain molecules attach to it. “To prevent this reaction, the switch would have to be blocked somehow,” Müller continued. “The question was: how?”

To address this, the team tested promising compounds from a collection of 40,000 previously gathered by Müller's department. “We used cells that light up when MRGPRX2 is activated, so we could then test whether the substances effectively block activation of the receptor, switching off the light signal,” explained Ghazl Al Hamwi, Müller's doctoral student and first author of the study. In this way, the team discovered a molecule that can attach to the receptor and block it, effectively switching it off.

They used that molecule to develop a substance that still works in very low doses, and proved its efficacy at eliminating life-threatening allergic reactions in lab mice and blocking the MRGPRX2 receptor on isolated human mast cells. They also claimed the molecule only blocks the intended receptor, which avoids the risk of side effects.

While Al Hamwi, Müller, and their colleagues have since improved the substance's efficacy and duration, more animal and eventually human trials will have to take place before it can be approved and commercialized as a drug. Nevertheless, it holds potentially life-saving implications for patients with some inflammatory conditions and those at risk of anaphylactic shock.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit. 

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.”

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.

OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

Two quarters before mass production.

TSMC exposed the defect density (D0) of its N2 process technology relative to its predecessors at the same stage of development at its North American Technology Symposium this week. According to the company, the defect density is below that of N3, N5, and N7 manufacturing nodes. In addition, the slide published by ComputerBase reveals that N2 is two quarters away from mass production, which means that TSMC is on-track to start making 2nm-class chips in late Q4 2025, as expected.

Although TSMC's N2 is the company's first process technology to adopt gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, the node has lower defect density than its predecessors at the same stage of development, two quarters before mass production (MP). The predecessors — N3/N3P, N5/N4, and N7/N6 — all relied on well-known FinFET transistors. So, despite being TSMC's first node using GAA nanosheet transistors, the N2 defect density is getting lower quicker (well, steeper) than that of its predecessors before the high volume manufacturing (HVM) milestone.



The chart plots defect density against time, spanning from three quarters before mass production through six quarters after MP. Across all nodes shown — N7/N6 (green), N5/N4 (violet), N3/N3P (red), and N2 (blue) — defect densities drop significantly as production ramps, though at different rates depending on node complexity. Notably, N5/N4 displayed the most aggressive early defect reduction, while N7/N6 showed a more gradual yield improvement. The N2 curve begins with higher initial defect levels than N5/N4 but declines sharply, closely matching the defect reduction trajectory of N3/N3P.

The slide emphasizes that production volume and product diversity remain the key drivers for accelerating defect density improvements. Larger production volumes and a wide variety of products using the same process enable faster identification and correction of defect density and yield issues, enabling TSMC to optimize defect learning cycles. TSMC stated that its N2 fabrication technology got more new tape outs than predecessors (as TSMC now risks producing N2 chips for smartphone and HPC customers), so the defect density decrease curve mostly proves that.

The fact that N2's defect reduction rate aligns well with previous FinFET-based nodes is particularly significant, given the risk factors associated with introducing an all-new transistor architecture. It suggests that TSMC has successfully transferred its process learning and defect management expertise into the new GAAFET era without major setbacks (at least based on what TSMC discloses).

Kash Patel, a far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist who just so happens to be the director of the FBI, tweeted Friday about the arrest of a judge in Wisconsin who he alleges tried to obstruct U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But it wasn't long before Patel deleted the tweet. Two hours later, Patel retweeted the exact same thing, and it's unclear why he would delete the original tweet.

“Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on charges of obstruction—after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,” Patel wrote in his tweet from 10:11 a.m. ET.

“We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject—an illegal alien—to evade arrest,” Patel continued.

Patel went on to write, “thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot,” describing the scene like he's in a cheesy 1980s cop show, and insisting that, “the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public.”  Patel ended his tweet by saying that he will “have more to share soon” and tagging the X account for the FBI in Milwaukee.

Anyone trying to visit the tweet's original URL now sees a page that reads, “Hmm…this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else.” Patel's new version of the tweet appears to have identical wording, so it's a complete mystery why he deleted it. The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to questions about Patel's tweet emailed Friday.

ICE agents reportedly arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 to arrest a Mexican citizen in Judge Hannah Dugan's courtroom, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. The newspaper says Dugan directed the ICE agents to the chief justice's office and the person ICE was trying to arrest left through a side door. The Journal-Sentinel spoke with five experts who all had different opinions on Dugan's alleged conduct, but none thought she should be charged with a crime.

The U.S. Marshals Service confirmed on Friday that Dugan was arrested around 8:30 a.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET) on courthouse property. Dugan appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen C. Dries and has been charged with two felonies, obstruction and concealing an individual, according to the Journal-Sentinel.

Dugan made no comment during the hearing, but her attorney reportedly said, “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety.” A former federal prosecutor in Milwaukee, Franklyn Gimbel, who spoke with the Journal-Sentinel, called her arrest “outrageous,” and noted that the FBI could have simply invited her to show up and surrender herself. But theatrics are obviously a big deal for the very media-conscious Trump regime.

Dugan, 65, got her bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1981 and earned her JD in 1987, according to the Associated Press. She was elected to the county court, Branch 31, in 2016 and worked at Legal Action of Wisconsin and the Legal Aid before that.

President Donald Trump prosecuted a federal judge in Massachusetts in a similar case brought in 2019, but that case was dropped in 2022 during the Biden administration. Trump has made it clear that he's going to go after judges as a way to impose his particular brand of fascism on the United States. And his billionaire buddy Elon Musk, the head of DOGE, has repeatedly called for the persecution of judges. Musk tweeted about the case Friday, writing, “More judicial corruption.”

Kash Patel was confirmed as FBI director in late February in a vote of 51-49, with every Democratic senator and two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voting no. Patel was a board member for Trump Media, the company that owns Donald Trump's Truth Social, before resigning that role to take his job at the FBI and has made at least $2.6 million from consulting and media deals, according to ABC News. Patel also wrote an absolutely unhinged children's book depicting Donald Trump as a king, titled The Plot Against the King.

The FBI director has repeatedly embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory, published a list of so-called deep state officials to target, and has promised to “come after” the media. And yet many of Patel's supporters on social media have been frustrated by perceptions that the FBI director has been slow to enact retribution against perceived enemies. We'll see if that changes now that Patel is doing his best to usher in the “arrest judges” stage of fascism.

How much are you willing to pay for a better display?

The MacBook Air is one of the most popular laptops — and best ultrabooks — around. Starting at $999 with a speedy M4 processor, strong build quality, and long battery life, it's incredibly well-liked, especially among people already in Apple's ecosystem.But the MacBook Pro, with its gorgeous display, more ports, and more performant chips is right there. You might see those upgrades and think that it's worth the extra cash.And it's true — on a pure spec sheet basis, the MacBook Pro is better in almost every way. Some people may be willing to splurge for the nicer screen, better speakers, and the promise of more performance. But should you?For many people, the MacBook Air is more than enough, especially for the price. But if you're not sure which you need, read on for a head-to-head comparison.

It's unsurprising that the MacBook Air and Pro have a family resemblance. Whichever you choose, you'll get Apple's latest design, with blocky sides, curved corners, sturdy aluminum build quality, and a mirror-shiny aluminum Apple logo.

You'll also get a notch for the webcam no matter which model you choose, as well as a haptic touchpad and a backlit keyboard with full-size function keys.

One of the bigger changes you'll notice is in size and weight. The Macbook Air comes in 13-inch and 15-inch screen sizes, while the Pro goes for modern, larger 14-inch and 16-inch sizes.

Because the MacBook Air models don't use a fan, they can be extremely thin. The 13-inch Air is 0.44 inches thick, while the 15-inch MacBook Air is just a scratch larger. The smaller Air is the lightest of the bunch at just 2.7 pounds, light enough you barely notice it in a backpack, while the 15-incher is 3.3 pounds.The 14-inch Pro is 0.61 inches thick, which is significantly bigger. This allows for more ports and for a fan to run over the M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max. The difference in cooler on the chip is the difference in weight, which starts at 3.4 pounds with M4 and tops out at 3.6 pounds on the M4 Max. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is 0.66 inches thick and is 4.7 pounds whether you chose the M4 Pro or M4 Max.

The svelte MacBook Air only has three ports: a pair of Thunderbolt 4 (USB Type-C) ports and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. The system can also charge over MagSafe 3, which attaches to the side of the system magnetically and detaches if you trip and fall over the cord.

The Pro, however, has far more ports. No matter which you get, you'll get three USB Type-C ports (Thunderbolt 5 on the M4 Pro and M4 Max or Thunderbolt 4 on M4), an HDMI output, and a full-size SD card slot, and MagSafe 3.

If you don't use a ton of peripherals on the go, the MacBook Air's selection is sparse but usable. The MacBook Pro's ports allow for lots of extra peripherals. Either can be expanded with a USB Type-C hub or dock.

The last decision you'll have to make is what color laptop you want. The MacBook Pro keeps it simple with two options: silver and space black. But the Air has four choices: silver, starlight, midnight, and sky blue.

If you get a MacBook Air, you have one chip option: M4. The entry-level version has a cut down GPU, which you likely won't notice unless you're playing games.

But despite the name, the MacBook Air's claim to fame is that it's thin because there's no fan. The system uses passive cooling, which means the system will throttle under very intense workloads.

With the MacBook Pro, you have three choices: M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max. In the Pro line, Apple uses active cooling, which means you'll have fans and heat pipes on the processor. Under light use, the fans have been silent in my experience. You really have to push these Arm-based processors to get the fans to kick in loud enough that you'll really notice them.

M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max all have similar single-core performance. But the cores scale significantly between the chips, so if you're a professional working with artificial intelligence, video editing, simulations or other multi-core workloads, the more powerful chips make a lot of sense.

For people who are primarily browsing the web, checking and sending emails, creating documents and slide decks, M4 should be plenty powerful.

For some, the display might be the top reason to upgrade from a MacBook Air to a MacBook Pro.

The MacBook Air's screen is good enough for most people. You either get a 13.6-inch, 2560 x 1664 screen or a 15.3-inch, 2280 x 1864 panel. Both are LED-backlit IPS displays, and in our testing, they get very bright.



Arguably the Air's biggest weakness when it comes to the screen is that it's stuck at a 60 Hz refresh rate, while the Pro goes up to 120 Hz and makes everything from macOS to web browsing to gaming smoother.

The MacBook Pro nets you either a 14.2-inch, 3024 x 1964 display or a 16.2-inch, 3456 x 2234 screen. These 'Liquid Retina XDR' displays use mini-LED displays that are brighter, offer more contrast, and support HDR content. And yes, these go up to 120 Hz with Apple's ProMotion and an adaptive refresh rate.

On the MacBook Pro, Apple also offers its nano-texture display as a paid upgrade. It's an extra $150, but the matte screen looks beautiful and works wonders outside.

For a thin laptop, Macbook Air is pretty good. The 13-inch model has four speakers, and they're fine for casually listening to music and even for making calls without a headset on. The 15-inch bumps up to 6 speakers with force-cancelling woofers, marking a substantial improvement, especially in the low-end. The speakers are one of the few meaningful differences other than screen size on the two MacBook Air laptops.

Of course, the thicker MacBook Pro does mean better speakers. Like the 15-inch Air, both 14-inch and 16-inch Pro models have six-speaker systems with force-cancelling woofers, but you get higher quality sound. The 16-inch MacBook Pro have the best speakers I've ever heard on a laptop, though I wouldn't pay just for that.

In fact, if you're that much of an actual pro user, you probably need some of the best PC speakers, or at least a great pair of headphones.

Ever since Apple switched to its own Arm-based chips with M1, battery life has been improving. With any of these systems, you should be able to close the lid, leave it unplugged on your desk, and find it still going a day or two later.

Chip efficiency does a lot, but bigger laptops mean bigger batteries.

In our battery test, which browses the web, streams video, and runs light OpenGL tests, the 15-inch MacBook Air with M4 ran for 15 hours and 14 minutes. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same chip lasted 18:36. A 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro lasted 21 hours and 1 minute.



All of which is to say, any of these laptops should get you through the day without a problem.

And while the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros will last longer, keep in mind that part of that is because they are heavier than the Air, so there's some give and take. I can handle less battery life if I'm getting more than 12 hours on a charge and the Air is easier to carry around.

There's a reason that the MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop, and that's because of the price. The 13-inch Air starts at $999 with a 10-core M4 CPU, 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD.

The 15-inch Air starts at $1,199 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB SSD.

In recent years, the $999 price point was reserved for a previous generation chip. For instance, when M3 was in vogue, the M2 option was $999. But with M4, Apple has eliminated that practice, making for an even better value for an excellent laptop.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599 with the same M4 chips with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU as the 15-inch Air, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. Bumping up to an M4 Pro starts at $1,999 (with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and the same 512GB SSD), while an M4 Max starts at $3,199.

And the 16-inch MacBook Pro gets even pricier, starting at $2,499 with an M4 Pro with 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of RAM and 512GB SSD. The M4 Max version starts at $3,499 and boosts to a 32-core GPU, 36GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.

Of course, those are all the lowest possible prices, and Apple's upgrades to RAM and storage are often absurd, with hundreds of dollars for storage and RAM upgrades. Be sure to get what you want at purchase, though, because you won't be able to upgrade down the line.

If you're just comparing specs on paper, the MacBook Pro is the better machine in most aspects. It has a nicer screen, more ports, stronger performance, and longer battery life.

In practice, though, the MacBook Air is a better machine for most people. It's lighter and easier to carry around, it has plenty of performance for the average person for either personal or professional use, and it lasts plenty long on a charge. While I think the 14-inch MacBook Pro is the sweet spot for screen size (and personally own one), I've used a 13-inch MacBook Air for work for awhile and adore it.

The truth is that most people don't need a MacBook Pro, even if some of the features — particularly the mini-LED display — are very nice to have. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 serves as a sort of middle of the road pick if you're looking to upgrade for the display and more ports but don't need M4 Pro or M4 Max. . If you need the Pro features or would benefit from M4 Pro or M4 Max, you probably already know it.

For most people, spending less still gets an extremely capable Mac. The MacBook Air is best for most people, but the MacBook Pro has some niceties if you can afford it, or if you're doing very intensive work.

Linux is renowned for supporting incredibly ancient hardware, but there are limits to even what Linux developers can support. Phoronix reports that Linux developers are finally proposing removing support for ancient i486 and early i586 (Pentium) CPUs to unburden developers.

Linux kernel developer Ingo Molnar proposed in an RFC patch thread to remove support for these ancient 32-bit processors due to the few people running these chips combined with the latest Linux kernels. Compatibility has allegedly reached a point where supporting these chips is causing more headaches in the codebase than it's worth.

Molnar also stated that Linus Torvalds has similar feelings and desires to "...leave i486 support behind." Specifically, ending i486 and early Pentium support will allegedly remove 14,104 lines of code inside 80 files in the Linux kernel. Removing support would bump up the minimum kernel support level to include TSC and CX8 hardware support.

Linux developers have considered removing i486 support as far back as 2022, but there now appears to be mounting pressure to execute those wishes. For reference, Linux dropped support for the i386 series in 2012, marking 13 years since the last time the Linux kernel discontinued support for a deprecated CPU series.

The i486 series is an ancient Intel CPU lineup that launched back in 1989, representing Intel's fourth generation of binary-compatible CPUs. The i486 introduced several key technologies, such as a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit, components that are used in almost every single modern CPU. Depending on the model, i486 chips took advantage of 1000nm down to 600nm process nodes, with clock speeds ranging from around 20 MHz to 100 MHz. Production of the last i486 chips was discontinued in 2007.

The i586 series, also known as Intel's first Pentium-branded processor lineup, succeeded the i486 series. The original Pentium, introduced in 1993, brought along improvements from the i486 series, including a dual-integer pipeline design and a more advanced floating-point unit. The first-generation Pentium (or P5) was built on an 800nm process with clock speeds ranging from 60 MHz to 66 MHz, depending on the model.

Kai Chen, a Canadian AI researcher working at OpenAI who's lived in the U.S. for 12 years, was denied a green card, according to Noam Brown, a leading research scientist at the company. In a post on X, Brown said that Chen learned of the decision Friday and must soon leave the country.

“It's deeply concerning that one of the best AI researchers I've worked with […] was denied a U.S. green card,” wrote Brown. “A Canadian who's lived and contributed here for 12 years now has to leave. We're risking America's AI leadership when we turn away talent like this.”

Another OpenAI employee, Dylan Hunn, said in a post that Chen was “crucial” for GPT-4.5, one of OpenAI's flagship AI models.

Green cards can be denied for all sorts of reasons, and the decision won't cost Chen her job. In a follow-up post, Brown said that Chen plans to work remotely from an Airbnb in Vancouver “until [the] mess hopefully gets sorted out.” But it's the latest example of foreign talent facing high barriers to living, working, and studying in the U.S. under the Trump administration. 

OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. However, in a post on X in July 2023, CEO Sam Altman called for changes to make it easier for “high-skill” immigrants to move to and work in the U.S.

one of the easiest policy wins i can imagine for the US is to reform high-skill immigration.the fact that many of the most talented people in the world want to be here is a hard-won gift; embracing them is the key to keeping it that way.hard to get this back if we lose it.

Over the past few months, more than 1,700 international students in the U.S., including AI researchers who've lived in the country for a number of years, have had their visa statuses challenged as part of an aggressive crackdown. While the government has accused some of these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted for minor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has turned a skeptical eye toward many green card applicants, reportedly suspending processing of requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status. It has also taken a hardline approach to green card holders it perceives as “national security” threats, detaining and threatening several with deportation.  

AI labs like OpenAI rely heavily on foreign research talent. According to Shaun Ralston, an OpenAI contractor providing support for the company's API customers, OpenAI filed more than 80 applications for H1-B visas last year alone and has sponsored more than 100 visas since 2022.

H1-B visas, favored by the tech industry, allow U.S. companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor's degree or the equivalent. Recently, immigration officials have begun issuing “requests for evidence” for H-1Bs and other employment-based immigration petitions, asking for home addresses and biometrics, a change some experts worry may lead to an uptick in denied applications.

Immigrants have played a major role in contributing to the growth of the U.S. AI industry.

According to a study from Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 66% of the 50 “most promising” U.S.-based AI startups on Forbes' 2019 “AI 50” list had an immigrant founder. A 2023 analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy found that 70% of full-time graduate students in fields related to AI are international students.

Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa.

The U.S.'s immigration policies, cutbacks in grant funding, and hostility to certain sciences have many researchers contemplating moving out of the country. Responding to a Nature poll of over 1,600 scientists, 75% said that they were considering leaving for jobs abroad.

Is TP-Link undercutting its competitors by selling at a loss?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly opened an inquiry into TP-Link, the largest consumer router provider in the country, for unfair pricing practices and whether it poses a threat to national security.

TP-Link is known for its affordable home networking products and has reportedly cornered 65% of this market. According to Bloomberg, the DOJ is investigating whether the company achieved this through predatory pricing, wherein it sells goods at a loss to obtain a monopoly. Once it achieves that goal, it would significantly raise its prices to maximize profits at the expense of the consumer.

Aside from the Justice Department's probe, the U.S. Department of Commerce is also looking into whether TP-Link's Chinese connections affect the country's national security, especially with the brand's popularity among home users. This investigation began in late 2024, especially as the company got tied to Salt Typhoon cyberattacks allegedly backed by Beijing.

TP-Link Systems, based in Irvine, California, is the company behind the routers in the U.S. It was previously owned by TP-LINK Technologies, a Shenzhen, China-based corporation, and only fully established itself as an independent organization in October 2024. The company says it is unaware of any inquiry.

"To date, TP-Link Systems Inc. has not received any inquiry from the Department of Justice regarding these matters. As a U.S.-based company, TP-Link operates with the utmost integrity and transparency, and stands ready to cooperate fully with any government inquiries, should they arise," a spokesman tells Tom's Hardware.

The company claims that its products have been manufactured in its factory in Vietnam since 2018, ensuring that it has control over its supply chain. Still, U.S. officials are concerned about whether the corporate restructuring is enough to insulate it from meddling by the Chinese government, with some experts claiming that it still has a broad presence in mainland China.

"Unlike competitors, TP-Link owns its manufacturing and R&D operations, enabling cost savings and enhanced control over the security of our vertically integrated supply chain," the spokesman told us.

Investigations like these could take months, if not years, to conclude, and they do not always lead to prosecution. Aside from the criminal proceedings, the DOJ also launched a parallel civil investigation, Bloomberg reported.

The Federal government is apparently doing this to hedge its bets, as Bloomberg says that criminal prosecution of predatory pricing is rather complicated — the government must prove that the company is selling at a loss and that it will recoup its losses by jacking up prices when it has a monopoly on the market. Civil cases have a lower evidentiary requirement, making it easier for the Justice Department to win its case.

If proven guilty, TP-Link could be fined up to a maximum of $100 million. Furthermore, its executives could be slapped with a $1 million penalty, plus possible imprisonment of up to 10 years.

The government actively pursued antitrust cases during the Biden administration, with Nvidia and Google being scrutinized. This policy has continued under Trump's leadership, with Director of Criminal Enforcement Emma Burnham of the DOJ Antitrust Division saying that the agency will focus on companies and individuals, including “everyday products we all rely on, as well as for vital goods and services the government needs to ensure our national security and provide critical infrastructure.”Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The leaked thermal gel should not affect the overall performance

Gigabyte has acknowledged the recently reported thermal gel leakage issue plaguing its latest RTX 50-series graphics cards. The company's official response comes just a few days after a forum post on the Korean PC hardware community Quasar Zone showed thermal gel seeping from a recently purchased RTX 5080 card. Additionally, it was found that the issue was not limited to a particular model but nearly the entire lineup of RTX 50-series graphics cards from Gigabyte.

In its response, Gigabyte says that its Nvidia RTX 50 series and AMD Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs utilize a specially engineered thermal conductive gel instead of traditional thermal pads. As per the company, this material is designed to provide better contact across uneven component surfaces and is applied using fully automated machinery to reduce human error.

The thermal conductivity gel solution is also said to have undergone rigorous testing and validation, including drop tests, thermal simulations under extreme conditions, and usage in both vertical and horizontal GPU orientations. That last bit is important, as the original author of the post mentioned using their Gigabyte graphics card with a riser kit in a vertical orientation.

The company explains that the thermal gel is an insulating, deformable, putty-like compound capable of withstanding temperatures up to 150°C without melting. However, Gigabyte admitted that some early production batches may have received an over-application of the gel, which could explain the visible leakage observed by users. While the company acknowledges the cosmetic irregularity, it emphasizes that the issue does not compromise performance, stability, or product lifespan.

Gigabyte also says it has since adjusted the gel application volume in newer production runs to prevent similar leakage in future shipments. Notably, the company has not announced any recall or replacement program, which isn't surprising considering the massive demand and limited supply of GPUs. Affected users are encouraged to contact regional Gigabyte customer service centers for further support.

While it is reassuring to see Gigabyte taking swift action with its response, one cannot simply overlook the incident. For most users, spending thousands of dollars on a high-end GPU comes with the expectation of flawless performance and build quality. Discovering a defect, even if cosmetic or non-critical, can shake consumer confidence, especially when it involves premium hardware.

Chinese startup Manus AI, which works on building tools related to AI agents, has picked up $75 million in a funding round led by Benchmark at a roughly $500 million valuation, according to Bloomberg.

The company will use the money to expand to new markets, including the U.S., Japan, and the Middle East, Bloomberg noted, citing people familiar with the matter.

Bloomberg's report suggests that the fresh round has quintupled the valuation of Manus, which previously raised somewhere north of $10 million from backers including Tencent and HSG (formerly Sequoia China). 

Manus came into the spotlight when the company launched a demo of a general AI agent that could complete various tasks in March. (In TechCrucnh's testing, it didn't work quite as well as advertised.) The company later launched paid subscription plans costing between $39 per month and $199 per month.

Is this a good sign for the global chip trade?

Beijing is easing retaliatory tariffs on chip and semiconductor imports from America, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) — potentially a good sign for the global chip trade.

Several industry sources shared the news with Chinese business publication Caijing, saying that eight tariff codes related to integrated circuits are exempted from the 125% tariffs it levied on U.S. goods in response to President Trump's 145% import duty on imports from China. This does not include memory chips, however, which Chinese companies manufacture within their borders. Chinese customs also told companies that have paid import duties for the exempted goods between April 10 and 24 that they're eligible to apply for refunds.

This might be a sign that trade relations between the U.S. and China are thawing. But Chinese authorities haven't made a public announcement about this announcement so far, and neither has it answered SCMP's calls to comment on the news. The China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA), representing the biggest chipmakers in the country, was also mum on the issue. Furthermore, the original report has since been deleted from the Caijing website and its official WeChat channel.

It could be that this information came from measured leaks, with the Chinese government gauging the U.S.'s reaction before making any further concrete moves. The trade war between the two economic powers has certainly upended global trade. This is especially true in the semiconductor industry, which relies on a global supply chain including the U.S. and China.

It is especially true in advanced chips, with the Nvidia H20 chip still selling well despite being watered down to comply with export restrictions. The White House recently added AMD's MI308 to its list of banned exports, leading to a more than $6-billion write-off for Nvidia and AMD, showing how dependent some Chinese tech companies are on American products.

While Trump began the trade war escalation by putting tariffs on the entire world, he was also the first to blink by exempting computers, smartphones, and other tech-related goods from China. The U.S. imports the majority of several consumer electronics from China, including game consoles, PC monitors, smartphones, lithium-ion batteries, and laptops.

This meant that American consumers and businesses would be gravely impacted by the current 245% tariff (which jumped from 145%) that Trump placed on all Chinese goods. So this exemption is crucial to the public to ensure they can continuously purchase tech goods without paying through the nose.

The Nintendo Switch 2 preorders went live last night. If you weren't one of the lucky few to score yours from Target, Best Buy, or Walmart, you'll have another shot at redemption by waiting up for the midnight release at your local store going into June 5.

However, if you respect your sleep schedule enough to not do that, you can still secure yourself a sick new gaming console. It's not a Switch 2, but it has it's own sense of awe surrounding it. The MetaQuest 3S is the best entry point for VR gaming. It's at an affordable price point and has a wide catalogue of games just waiting to be played. Right now, you can even get it on sale. It's marked down between 12% and 16% for a limited time, and it's even bundled with a carrying case. You can get the 128GB model for just $312 (down from $370) or the 256GB model for $415 (down from $470).

See at Amazon

In addition to the carrying case, you'll also get the game Batman: Arkham Shadow. Take on the cape and cowl to track down the mysterious villain called the Rat King and save Gotham on the Fourth of July. It's a narrative sequel to Batman: Arkham Origins but puts you even more in control of the Dark Knight with the Meta Quest 3S' headset and wireless motion controllers.

You'll also gain access to three months of Meta Quest+ which will allow you to play over 25 more games for no additional charge. Best of the bunch in my opinion honestly is Walkabout Minigolf. It's pretty straight forward. It's VR minigolf but it feels great to play, the course designs are super fun, and there's hidden golf balls on every course for you to find like a virtual Easter egg hunt. The multiplayer is phenomenal. Just hanging out on the putting greens with you pals across multiple states. It's a blast all the way through.

The Meta Quest 3S is a solid upgrade from the Meta Quest 2. The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset makes the whole thing run faster. The new outside sensors allow for full-color passthrough, and a new action button allows you to switch quickly between virtual and mixed reality.

Right now, you can get yourself the Meta Quest 3s bundled with a carrying case and Batman: Arkham Shadow for a good $58 off. The 128GB model has been discounted down to just $312 while the 256GB model is now down to just $415. It should hold you over hopefully until the Switch 2 is stocked on every shelf across America.

But there are a number of catches.

Startup Atum Works claims that its nanoscale 3D printing method can easily replace current production flows and reduce chip fabrication costs by 90%, according to a launch post on YCombinator. There is a catch though: its capabilities are outdated by 20 years for logic chips, but may be just fine for packaging, photonics, and sensors.

Modern chips are like buildings: they have multiple floors, different types of blocks inside, and communications infrastructure. Every advanced chip is manufactured through an intricate process involving thousands of steps and hundreds of specialized tools, so it is quite expensive.

Atum Works claims that it has developed and built a nanoscale 3D printer that is capable of fabricating multi-material 3D structures with a 100 nm resolution at a voxel level at wafer scale. Instead of following the conventional planar lithography workflow, where circuits are patterned onto silicon wafers using light exposure through photomasks, Atum Works' system deposits materials at precise locations in three-dimensional space. This enables the fabrication of integrated circuits and allows items like interconnects to be formed in a continuous, unified process, which promises to improve yields compared to conventional methods. 

Modern EUV lithography tools have a resolution of around 13 nm (Applied's Sculpta can then enhance or modify patterns made by scanners with a 1~2nm critical dimension control), whereas modern etching tools achieve a sub-10nm precision in vertical direction. A 100nm resolution was relevant for 90nm ~ 110nm process technologies used in 2003 – 2005. 

That said, Atum Works's nanoscale 3D printer is not exactly suitable for building high-performance processors. However, nanoscale 3D printer can enable direct 3D fabrication and multi-material integration potentially useful for packaging, photonics, interconnect structures, sensors, and non-logic elements where the advantages of complex 3D design outweigh the need for ultra-small features. It is unclear whether the 3D printer is compatible with existing fab tools and flows. 

The company is actively engaged in discussions with prospective customers and plans to begin actual product deliveries within the current year. Among its initial partnerships is a letter of intent for collaborative development with Nvidia.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

A new American electric vehicle startup called Slate Auto has made its debut, and it's about as anti-Tesla as it gets. 

It's affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog. It has manual windows and it doesn't come with a main infotainment screen. Heck, it isn't even painted. It can also transform from a two-seater pickup to a five-seater SUV.

The three-year-old startup revealed its vehicle during an event Thursday night in Long Beach, California, and promised the first trucks would be available to customers for under $20,000 with the federal EV tax credit by the end of 2026. 

The event comes just a few weeks since TechCrunch revealed details of Slate Auto's plans to enter the U.S. EV market, build its trucks in Indiana, and that the enterprise is financially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

The auto industry “has been so focused on autonomy and technology in the vehicle, it's driven prices to a place that most Americans simply can't afford,” chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said during the event, which Inside EVs live streamed. “But we're here to change that.”

“We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,” CEO Chris Barman added.

Slate isn't saying exactly how much its truck will cost — multiple sources have told TechCrunch over the last few weeks the company has gone back and forth on the number. And so much can change between now and a late 2026 release date.

The company is saying it will start under $20,000 after the federal tax credit (providing that still exists next year). Interested buyers can place a $50 refundable reservation on the company's website.

The base version of Slate's truck will squeeze 150 miles out of a 52.7kWh battery pack, which will power a single 150kW motor on the rear axle. For folks who get a little spooked at that number, Slate is offering a larger battery pack that it says will have about 240 miles of range. It will charge using a North American Charging Standard port, the standard Tesla established that almost all major automakers now use.

The truck comes with 17-inch wheels and a five-foot bed, and has a projected 1,400 pound payload capacity with a 1,000 pound towing capacity. Since it's an EV, there's no engine up front. In its place there's a front trunk (or frunk) with 7 cubic feet of storage space, which happens to have a drain in case the owner wants to fill it with ice for that tailgate party.

That towing capacity is lower than a more capable Ford F-150, and is even less than the smaller Ford Maverick, which can tow around 1,500 pounds. 

Speaking of the Ford Maverick, Slate's truck is smaller. The Slate EV has a wheelbase of 108.9 inches, and an overall length of 174.6 inches. The Maverick has a 121.1-inch wheelbase and overall length of 199.7 inches

Everything else about the base version of the truck is awfully spare — and that's the point. Slate is really maximizing the idea of a base model, and setting customers up for paying to customize the EV to their liking. 

Slate is deeply committed to the idea of customization, which sets it apart from any other EV startup (or traditional automaker).

The company said Thursday it will launch with more than 100 different accessories that buyers can use to personalize the truck to their liking. If that's overwhelming, Slate has curated a number of different “starter packs” that interested buyers can choose from.

The truck doesn't even come painted. Slate is instead playing up the idea of wrapping its vehicles, something executives said they will sell in kits. Buyers can either have Slate do that work for them, or put the wraps on themselves.

This not only adds to the idea of a buyer being able to personalize their vehicle, but it also cuts out a huge cost center for the company. It means Slate won't need a paint shop at its factory, allowing it to spend less to get to market, while also avoiding one of the most heavily regulated parts of vehicle manufacturing. 

Slate is telling customers that they can name the car whatever they want, offering the ability to purchase an embossed wrap for the tailgate. Otherwise, the truck is just referred to as the “Blank Slate.”

As TechCrunch previously reported, the customization piece is central to how the company hopes to make up margin on what is otherwise a relatively dirt-cheap vehicle.

But it's also part of the friendly pitch Slate is making to customers. 

Barman said Thursday that people can “make the Blank Slate yours at the time of purchase, or as your needs and finances change over time.” It's billing the add-ons as “easy DIY” that “non-gearheads” can tackle, and says it will launch a suite of how-to resources under the billing of Slate University.

“Buy your accessories, get them delivered fast, and install them yourself with the easy how-to videos in Slate U, our content hub,” the website reads. “Don't want to go the DIY route? A Slate authorized partner can come and do it for you.”

The early library of customizations on Slate's website range from functional to cosmetic. Buyers can add infotainment screens, speakers, roof racks, light covers, and much more.

The most significant are the options that let buyers “transform” the truck into roomier SUV form factors. But these aren't permanent decisions. Slate says people will be able to change their vehicle into, and back from, an SUV if they like — “no mechanics certification required.”

All that said, Slate's truck comes standard with some federally mandated safety features such as automatic emergency braking, airbags, and a backup camera.

The road to making a successful American automotive startup is littered with failures. In the last few years, Canoo, Fisker, and Lordstown Motors have all filed for bankruptcy. And that's just to name a few. Those companies that are still around, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, are hemorrhaging money in an attempt to get high-volume, more affordable models to market.

Slate is a total inversion of that approach. It's going after a low-cost EV first and foremost, and hopes to make that business viable by supplementing it with money from this deep customization play. 

But, much like Rivian and Lucid Motors, it also has deep-pocketed backers. It raised has raised more than $111 million so far (the exact figure is still not public). And, aside from Bezos, has taken money from Mark Walter, Guggenheim Partners CEO and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers, as TechCrunch reported this month. 

The company has hired nearly 400 employees in service of accomplishing all of its ambitious goals, and is currently trying to hire more. Slate arguably could not have picked a more volatile time to make its debut, but it's also focused on domestic manufacturing, and may be insulated from some of the turmoil facing other startups and established automakers. 

“We believe vehicles should be affordable and desirable,” Barman said Thursday, adding that Slate's truck “is a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own.”

Sharks might not be as responsible for rare human bites as we assumed. In a study released today, scientists argue that at least some shark bites should be considered a form of self-defense.

Marine biologists from France led the research, published in Frontiers in Conservation Science. After analyzing shark bite data from throughout the world, they estimated that about 5% of shark-on-human bites are wholly defensive, rather than sharks trying to catch their next meal. The findings should help inform shark bite prevention efforts, the researchers say.

Lead researcher Eric Clua, a shark specialist at PSL University, was inspired to look into the topic by observations he had made during his field studies in French Polynesia.

He often heard about fishermen who systematically slaughtered sharks that had unwittingly become trapped in fish pens. These sharks would sometimes bite the fishermen if they were initially unsuccessful in killing the animal. He also heard reports of accidental shark bites on underwater spearfishermen where the sharks appeared to only attack because they wanted the fisherman to stay away from their prey.

“On closer examination, the opportunity arose to model this self-defense mechanism described in the study, which insists on human and not shark responsibility in this type of accident,” Clua told Gizmodo in an email.

The researchers first analyzed data from recorded shark bites in French Polynesia—specifically, incidents that contained at least some information on the possible motivation behind the bites. Between 2009 and 2023, 74 such shark bites were documented in the area. Four of these bites, 5% of the total, were likely motivated by self-defense, the researchers found.

Clua and his team then scoured through data from the Global Shark Attack Files, which has documented nearly 7,000 shark bites since 1863. They examined bites classified as provoked, involving people placed in close proximity to sharks. Once again, about 5% of the bites they studied—322 bites overall—seemed to meet the criteria for self-defense.

These criteria include the sharks biting immediately after a human action that is, or could be perceived as, aggressive, and the bites being repeated but leaving superficial, non-lethal wounds. Paradoxically, a defensive shark bite might also be disproportionately violent compared to the human action that preceded it, such as a stranded shark aggressively biting a human trying to return it to the water. But this disproportionality might simply be a sign of the shark's desperation to survive at any cost, according to Clua.

“The results of this study show that sharks have as much right as any animal or human to defend themselves when their survival is at stake,” he said. “They also show that, counter-intuitively, it is advisable not to come to the aid of a shark in danger, as it will not necessarily perceive this human action positively and may react aggressively.”

By uncovering the many motivations behind shark bites, the team hopes to prevent them from happening in the first place. People shouldn't interact with or approach sharks, for instance, even if they seem harmless or appear to be in danger. And in general, you should be in groups of at least two people when swimming in places where sharks live, which can reduce the risk of a sustained predatory attack. Unlike some land predators, Clua adds, staying still will not dissuade a predatory shark from attacking, so you should always try to defend yourself if the worst-case scenario happens.

At the same time, the researchers note that sharks are typically afraid of humans. As a result, shark bites are very uncommon, and even more rarely are they fatal compared to other animal-human interactions.

There were only 88 shark bites recorded worldwide in 2024 and seven related deaths, for instance. By contrast, hippos are estimated to fatally attack at least 500 people a year, and the fatality numbers get even more skewed when you consider the diseases spread by certain animals (mosquito-borne malaria alone kills over a half million people each year). So while it's important to practice good safety in waters that could contain sharks, people (reporters included) also shouldn't over-inflate the risk of being bitten by them in the first place.

“In addition to reducing the number of such bites in the field, we hope that one of the major effects of our study will be to modify the vision and attitude of journalists, by suggesting that they take a closer look at the conditions in which bites occur, without systematically blaming the animals, but rather making humans more responsible,” Clua said.

The team plans to continue studying other types of shark bites, such as “exploration”-driven bites where the sharks might bite humans to test whether they're suitable prey.

The startup Slate Auto officially emerged from stealth mode late Thursday evening to debut its compact electric pickup truck. The company, which is partially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, says it will sell the most basic version of its EV truck for about $25,000. That's $5,000 less than the cheapest EVs on sale now in the US, none of which are pickups.

Slate has been keeping details about its EVs under wraps, though some models have recently been spotted in the wild by sleuths or outright teased by the upstart automaker. Now we have a wealth of information about the trucks' capabilities, Slate's manufacturing process, and the EVs' rollout plans.

It comes in one color: gray.

The basic “Blank Slate” pickup that sells for that lowest price tag gets an estimated 150 miles of range from a 52.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. It comes in only one color, a gray tone that's molded into its composite body panels, and offers only a single option: a larger 84.3-kWh battery that gives it an estimated 240 miles of range. (Slate did not quote a price for the larger battery option.)

The company is now taking refundable $50 deposits for the pickup trucks, with first deliveries targeted for the last quarter of 2026. Slate says the vehicles will be manufactured at an as-yet-unannounced site in the Midwestern US, a move which allows it to sidestep many of the country's new import tariffs.

Slate CEO Chris Barman says that both the product and its production process have been designed from the outset to keep costs low. In an interview with WIRED, she says the decision to make just one single model of pickup truck allows Slate to build the EVs more efficiently by eliminating the complexity of multiple variants—including colors. “Not having metal stamping presses [for large body panels] and a paint shop saved Slate $350 million to $500 million,” she says. Barman's numbers are based on a projected scale of up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

There's no screen on the dashboard. Instead, buyers can choose from a number of phone mounts.

It's possible, however, that no two Slates on the roads will be identical. The company is stressing that the vehicles will allow for “accessible personalization.” This is partly to appeal to younger buyers, who have been shown by surveys to be much more open to purchasing EVs than older buyers, and who also may be more eager to trick out their truck.

The $25K starting price is low, but Slate will offer more than 100 accessories—sold individually and in bundles—that buyers can install themselves or have installed by their Slate distributor for a set fee. Slate expects its average buyer to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on these accessories, with the higher costs for those who want to convert two-seat pickups into five-seat SUVs.

The new automaker expects the two accessory kits that contain new body panels and roll structure, delivered in a flat pack, to be very popular. They let the owner convert the two-door pickup into a two-door SUV or a fastback utility vehicle. The rear wall of the pickup cab is designed to unbolt so it can be reused as the SUV's tailgate. Required airbags for rear-seat passengers are built into the added roll cage that must be installed—with electronic sensors confirming its connection—before the newly converted Slate will restart. The target prices for each of these conversion kits is around $5,000, Barman says.

The rest of the Slate is stripped down, but the CEO says it will contain all required equipment to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for model year 2027. It will have standard automatic emergency braking, for example, and the mandatory backup camera—the view of which is displayed in the driver's digital instrument cluster, because there's no central touchscreen. Instead of a built-in screen, Slate offers a variety of phone and tablet mounts.

Other accessories include a console between the seats, kits to convert the standard manual window winders to electric systems, various seat covers, vehicle wraps, and of course various wheel styles to replace the standard 17-inch, five-lug steel wheels. Slate plans to produce a “Builder's Book” to show buyers how to modify and personalize their vehicles.

Slate offers an optional SUV conversion that seats five.

Barman says the battery cells, using a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry, will be supplied by Korean maker SK-On from a US production plant. They will power a single 150-kilowatt (201-horsepower) motor powering the rear wheels. All-wheel drive isn't offered. An onboard AC charger is capable of delivering up to 11 kW, with DC fast-charging up to 120 kW. The NACS connector will be standard.

The Blank Slate will have a curb weight of 3,600 pounds, with a payload capacity of 1,430 pounds. Rated towing capacity is listed at 1,000 pounds—significantly less than the 4,000-pound maximum towing capacity in the new 2025 Ford Maverick Hybrid AWD, which has a smaller cargo bed but four doors for the larger cab.

Visually, the Slate follows the upright, horizontal, square-edged profile of the classic two-seat American pickup truck—though rendered in miniature when compared to the full-size US pickups from Ford, GM, and Ram that collectively sell almost 3 million units per year. It looks something like a retro Ford Ranger from the 1980s, versus the more car-like styling of the Hyundai Santa Fe, the only other small pickup offered in the US besides the Ford Maverick.

Dimensionally, the Slate is smaller than the Maverick: It's 175 inches long, 71 inches wide (not including the mirrors), and 69 inches tall. That compares to the Maverick's 200-inch length, 73-inch width (again without mirrors), and 68- or 69-inch height. Slate offers a full 60-inch (5-foot) bed, versus the Maverick's 54 inches. (Both measurements are with the tailgate raised.) While the Maverick has no front trunk (it has an engine instead), the Slate's front trunk offers 7 cubic feet of storage on top of the 37 cubic feet in the cargo bed (or 34 cubic feet in the SUV's load bay).

Barman said Slate will target retail buyers to establish the brand and get as many personalized trucks on the road as possible to boost public awareness. Slate's EVs will also be sold to corporate customers purchasing the vehicles for fleets, Barman says, though she declined to offer a breakdown of what percentages of sales Slate estimates will go to those two sectors.

We also didn't talk about this, but it's worth mentioning: Slate trucks may conceivably also be sold to Amazon. The connection makes sense, since Slate Auto emerged from a startup lab partially funded by Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos. The online retailer already deploys tens of thousands of Rivian EV delivery vans, but a smaller EV could serve its purposes for specific uses as well.

Meep, meep.

As Mark Twain once quipped, perhaps apocryphally: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Anyone who's been following the auto business for about 20 years may have read Slate's news and sensed a faint echo, a distant and long-forgotten memory tugging at the corners of their minds.

That would be V-Vehicles (later renamed NextAuto), a low-cost vehicle startup backed by famed venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Caufield & Byers; a few of its Silicon Valley cohorts; and Texas natural-gas magnate T. Boone Pickens. The company's intent was to create an ultra-low-cost, lightweight 40-mpg “V-Car” to be manufactured at a former headlight plant in Monroe, Louisiana. Buyers could wrap its white molded plastic body panels in any color they desired. It would be built from off-the-shelf parts and sold through a big-box store like Sam's Club, with a single stock number for simplicity.

The V-Car was not a battery-electric vehicle; Pickens' participation pushed it toward natural-gas fueling. But the business model required startup funding from the US Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loan program to convert its plant. Ford, Nissan, and Tesla all received those loans in 2009—shortly followed by Fisker. When the DOE turned down the V-Vehicle ATVM loan application in May 2010, the company's fate was sealed.

Kleiner made two other automotive investments: Fisker Automotive and Think North America, a 2009 effort to manufacture the plastic-paneled, two-seat Norwegian Think electric car in the US. None of those companies exist today.

Here's hoping that Slate—whose little electric truck is an appealing size for many and seems affordable, especially to those without a burning desire to personalize their ride—fares somewhat better.

Youtube also increases ad load. More ads per video, combined with organic growth, higher engagement and wider distribution (smart TVs probably have insane metrics-- plus no real ad blockers there, either) mean they'll keep having display/video ads doing extremely well, too.[1] https://www.techspot.com/news/102765-who-prabhakar-raghavan-...

Pregnant women living with opioid use disorder (OUD) and their infants had significantly better health outcomes when treated with buprenorphine, according to a new study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. The research will be presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2025 Meeting, held April 24-28 in Honolulu. 

Pregnant women who received buprenorphine, a medication used to treat OUD, were less likely to have a preterm birth, face serious health complications, or have their infants hospitalized in the NICU compared to those who did not receive the treatment, the study found.

We know that treatment with medications like buprenorphine substantially reduces the risk of overdose death for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, but its benefits to newborns have not been well understood. We found a profound reduction in preterm birth among infants whose mothers were treated with buprenorphine, which can have a lifelong impact."

 Stephen Patrick, MD, MPH, senior author and chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health

Despite rates of OUD in pregnant women increasing more than fivefold from 1999 to 2017, more than half still do not receive treatment, researchers said. Previous research estimates that up to 20% of pregnant women with OUD may have a preterm birth, nearly double those without OUD. Preterm birth, a growing public health issue, increases the risk of health problems in children, including respiratory issues, infections, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing problems.

Researchers also noted stark disparities in equitable care. Those receiving buprenorphine were significantly less likely to be Black.

"Disparities in access to buprenorphine significantly affect vulnerable populations, including pregnant women," said Sunaya Krishnapura, graduating medical student at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and presenting author. "Our findings underscore the urgent need for policies that expand treatment access in the United States to ensure a healthy pregnancy and future for mothers and infants."

The study examined more than 14,000 pregnant women with OUD who were enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid between 2010 and 2021.

Researchers using next-generation DNA sequencing have identified four specific genes whose mutations are linked to the development and progression of lethal stomach cancers. This could potentially enable doctors to offer targeted treatments that would spare many patients from unnecessarily aggressive procedures, according to a study scheduled for presentation at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2025.

Not all stomach cancers are equal. Today, most gastric cancers are treated the same way - with surgery and chemotherapy - but we hope to identify key molecular differences so we can tailor treatment to the biology of each patient's tumor."

Ulysses Ribeiro, MD, PhD, study's lead author and professor at the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo, Brazil

Researchers analyzed 21 genes in tumor samples from 87 patients who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for gastric cancer and then tracked how the mutations related to survival. About one-third of the patients had changes in a specific combination of four genes - BRCA2, CDH1, RHOA, and TP53 - and these patients were more likely to experience a return of their cancer or die from the disease. These mutations included both well-established cancer drivers - such as BRCA2 mutations, which are famously linked to breast and ovarian cancer - as well as previously unknown variants that may be important.

Dr. Ribeiro said the findings support the idea that a more personalized approach - guided by the genetic makeup of each patient's tumor - may lead to better outcomes and, for some patients, less aggressive treatment.

To help bring this kind of testing closer to everyday care, Dr. Ribeiro and his colleagues are also working to match these genetic findings with widely available lab tests that use immunohistochemistry to detect proteins expressed by genes. That step could make it easier and more affordable to screen tumors for high-risk features in the future.

The study focused on patients from a Western population - a group that has been underrepresented in gastric cancer research. Most past studies have been conducted in East Asia, where the disease is more common.

While more research is needed before these findings change medical practice, they offer a promising path forward, Dr. Ribeiro said. "We believe that these findings move us closer to more personalized treatment based on each tumor's biology."

Dr. Ribeiro will present data from the study, "Next-generation DNA sequencing identifies somatic mutations associated to prognosis in gastric cancer patients," abstract 152, at 10:24 a.m. PDT, Saturday, May 3.

Young children with chronic conditions are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) than healthy children, according to a new study. The research will be presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) 2025 Meeting, held April 24-28 in Honolulu. 

Toddlers with chronic conditions are hospitalized for RSV at twice the rate as healthy toddlers over their first two seasons. The risk was highest for children born very prematurely under 28 weeks of gestation, or with conditions affecting multiple organs, the lungs, heart, or digestive system.

Researchers recommend that children with those specific conditions receive immunization against RSV in their first season to increase protection, even if their mother was vaccinated. Current guidelines suggest pregnant women should receive vaccination before birth to pass on antibodies.

Our research finds that many children with chronic conditions require seasonal RSV immunization beyond the period of protection that can be achieved with maternal vaccination. It expands current definitions from traditionally defined high-risk groups to other children with chronic conditions that could equally benefit from RSV immunization, up to two years of age. Our study underscores the importance of children with chronic conditions getting immunized against RSV in their second season, and in their first season even if their mother was vaccinated."

Marina Viñeta Páramo, graduate student at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine and presenting author

This study analyzed data from 431,937 infants born in British Columbia, Canada, between 2013 and 2023, including 25,452 infants with chronic health conditions.

Solenoid pumps and Fluid Metering pumps are two popular options for microfluidic management. This article examines their key differences across various application scenarios, highlighting which is better suited to different project requirements.

The key difference between solenoid pumps and Fluid Metering pumps lies in their operating mechanisms.

Solenoid pumps are driven by an electromagnet made up of a copper wire coil wrapped around a metal plunger. When electrical current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field that moves the plunger up and down, assisted by a spring.

In contrast, Fluid Metering pumps use a motor to drive a rotating, reciprocating piston to deliver fluid.

A solenoid pump's internal valves are predisposed to clogging, resulting in pump seizures and compromised precision. The solenoid's springs can also weaken and break with wear and tear, or they trap debris and contaminants. These factors adversely affect pump performance over time as the springs lose their tension.

Fluid Metering's pumps feature simpler, valveless designs able to prevent clogging while ensuring long-term reliability.

Their high-precision Cerampump® construction and patented adjustment method also afford Fluid Metering pumps the necessary boost to achieve more precise fluid delivery while enabling more accurate and consistent fluid dispensing versus solenoid pumps.

Solenoid pumps can achieve a range of flow rates depending on their size, typically from a few milliliters per minute to a few liters per minute. Fluid Metering pumps generally offer flow rates ranging from a few milliliters per minute to just over 1 liter per minute.

When it comes to flow rate ranges for microfluidic applications, solenoid and Fluid Metering pumps may seem evenly matched at first glance. However, solenoid pumps need to be manufactured in different sizes to accommodate various flow rates.

In contrast, Fluid Metering pumps can cover a wider range of flow rates with a single pump, eliminating the need to use multiple pumps for different flow requirements.

Solenoid pumps inherently produce significant pulsation due to their spring-plunger design. While Fluid Metering pumps also generate some degree of pulsatile flow, there are several effective system modification strategies that can be used to help minimize this pulsation.

The high and unavoidable pulsation levels produced by solenoid pumps make them unsuitable for certain applications. In contrast, the pulsation levels in Fluid Metering pump systems can be significantly reduced, allowing for smoother operation.

Solenoid pumps are generally manufactured from standard plastics and rubber diaphragms, while Fluid Metering pumps boast a ceramic construction that is chemically inert.

Solenoid pumps offer only limited chemical compatibility. They typically struggle with viscous fluids due to increased flow resistance and internal valve clogging. Fluid Metering pumps, however, can handle harsh chemicals more effectively, including fluids of varying viscosities.

Solenoid pumps require regular valve inspections and frequent diaphragm replacements to maintain proper operation and prevent clogging. Fluid Metering pumps, by comparison, deliver 0.5 % precision over millions of cycles without the need for maintenance or recalibration.

Solenoid pumps tend to have a lower initial cost, but their ongoing maintenance requirements and potential for downtime increase costs while yielding a lower lifespan of just a few years.

Fluid metering pumps require little to no maintenance; however, they have an extended lifespan generally equal to or longer than the life of the instrument in which they are installed. This makes Fluid Metering pumps a more cost-effective option in the long run.

Solenoid pumps can be designed to accommodate similar flow rates, but Fluid Metering pumps can handle wider ranges with the same pump, making them the ideal choice for applications requiring reliable precision, high accuracy, long life, chemical inertness, and the ability to pump viscous fluids at high pressure.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disease which, in addition to a high risk of bowel cancer, also a greatly increased risk of duodenal cancer. At present, the only treatment available is close endoscopic monitoring with removal of the precursors, known as polyps, although this is also associated with an increased risk.

But there are no specific preventive therapies. Since the severity of the disease varies greatly even among carriers of the same gene mutation, the search is on for other factors that influence the development of the disease - and the local immune system is becoming the focus of attention."

Dr. Benjamin Krämer, Co-Lead Author, Scientific Head of the Laboratory for Congenital Cellular Immunology, UKB

The Bonn researchers have now discovered that certain cells of the innate immune system, known as type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), are present in significantly higher numbers in the duodenum of FAP patients. "We found an increased number of these cells in the mucosa, particularly in the vicinity of polyps and cancerous areas," says co-lead author Dr. Robert Hüneburg, senior physician at the Medical Clinic I and the National Center for Hereditary Tumor Diseases at the UKB.

The Bonn research findings provide clues as to how these immune cells could contribute to the development of cancer: they produce a Neurotransmitter called interleukin-17A (IL-17A). "This messenger appears to stimulate intestinal cells to produce more harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species, or ROS for short. High concentrations of these ROS can damage the genetic material in the cells," says first author Dr. Kim Melanie Kaiser, who until recently conducted research as a doctoral student in the ImmunoSensation² Cluster of Excellence at the University of Bonn. Such damage to DNA, the carrier of genetic information, is a known factor that can drive the development of cancer.

"Our findings suggest that the increased number of interleukin-17A-producing ILC3 in the duodenum creates a local environment that favors the development of cancer in FAP patients," says co-lead author Prof. Dr. Jacob Nattermann from the Laboratory for Innate Cellular Immunity, Deputy Director of Medical Clinic I and Senior Physician at the National Center for Hereditary Tumor Diseases at the UKB. He is also a member of the Cluster of Excellence ImmunoSensation² and the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) "Life & Health" at the University of Bonn. "Targeting these immune cells or, in particular, blocking the messenger substance IL-17A directly in the duodenum could therefore represent a promising new approach to preventing duodenal cancer in people with FAP and offer an urgently needed therapeutic option in addition to pure endoscopic monitoring."

These results are based on a collaboration between research institutions from all over Germany. The study was conducted under the leadership of researchers from Medical Clinic I at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), with the ImmunoSensation² Cluster of Excellence at the University of Bonn also playing a key role. Also involved were the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Bonn, the German Rheumatism Research Center (DRFZ), which is affiliated with the Charité University Hospital in Berlin and cooperated as part of the DFG Priority Program SPP 1937 "Innate Lymphoid Cells", and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich, which participated in the context of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).

This reminder follows updates to product information and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for short-acting beta 2 agonists (SABAs), including salbutamol and terbutaline, which are used to relieve sudden asthma symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, coughing and breathlessness.

Patients are advised to continue using their daily preventer inhaler as prescribed, and to speak to a healthcare professional if they find themselves needing their blue inhaler more than twice a week.

If asthma symptoms, such as chest tightness, wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing, worsen or are not relieved by the blue inhaler, patients are advised to seek urgent medical help. Any suspected side effects should be reported to the MHRA via the Yellow Card scheme.

Patient safety is our top priority and we continue to monitor all medicines to ensure their benefits outweigh any risks.

Patients should use their preventer inhaler as prescribed by their doctor, even if their asthma feels under control. Blue inhalers are important for treating symptoms during an asthma attack, but should not be used as the only treatment to manage asthma.

We advise patients to speak to a healthcare professional if they find themselves needing their blue inhaler more than twice a week. Preventer inhalers should be taken as prescribed, even when symptoms appear under control.

If asthma symptoms worsen or are not relieved by their blue inhaler, such as chest tightness, wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing, patients should seek urgent medical help. Any suspected side effects should be reported through our Yellow Card scheme.”

Huo Xue Tong Luo Capsule (HXTL) has been clinically used to treat osteonecrosis of the femoral head, osteoporosis, and other bone and joint diseases with promising effects. Our previous study has shown that HXTL can promote osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting lncRNA-Miat expression through histone modifications. However, the mechanism by which HXTL treats postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) remains unclear. In this study, we used network pharmacology-based mechanism prediction, molecular docking, and pharmacological validation to investigate the mechanism of HXTL in treating PMOP.

The key candidate targets and relevant signaling pathways of HXTL for PMOP treatment were predicted using network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis. RAW264.7 cells were used for Western blot to validate the predicted mechanistic pathways. The ovaries of mice were surgically removed to simulate PMOP. The effect of HXTL on PMOP was evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunohistochemical assays in vivo.

Network pharmacology analysis suggested that HXTL interacted with 215 key targets linked to PMOP, primarily affecting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that the main components of HXTL exhibited strong binding affinity to NFATc1, p-PI3K, and p-AKT1. Furthermore, our in vitro results confirmed that HXTL suppressed the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. In vivo, HE and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining results showed that HXTL inhibited osteoclast formation and protected bone mass.

This research demonstrated that HXTL could inhibit osteoclast formation and prevent bone loss induced by ovariectomy in mice by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings provide important evidence for the clinical application of HXTL in treating PMOP.

Even without accounting for veterinary or pharmaceutical waste, human antibiotic use alone is pushing rivers past ecological tipping points, putting global water systems and health at risk.



Contaminant pathways of antibiotics in the global aquatic environment. Modeled contaminant pathways and mass balances of antibiotics by path. Values in parentheses indicate total amounts of the top 40 antibiotics consumed worldwide in tonnes year−1; percentage values are relative to the total excretion amount (20,500 tonnes year−1).

In a recent article published in the journal PNAS Nexus, researchers estimated the quantities of the 40 antibiotics most commonly used by humans that reach oceans and rivers, with a focus on domestic sources.

Their analysis underscores the urgent need for global strategies to control pollution. It suggests that 8,500 tons of antibiotics reach river systems each year and that six million kilometers of global rivers exceed safe levels for promoting resistance and harming ecosystem health.

Antibiotic contamination in natural waters is increasingly reported in sediments, groundwater, and surface water, raising concerns for both human and environmental health. Even at low levels, antibiotics can facilitate the development of resistance genes, reduce microbial diversity, and have a negative impact on aquatic life.

Understanding antibiotic pollution is critical because antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to become a leading global health threat. Antibiotics enter the environment due to incomplete human metabolism, insufficient removal in wastewater systems, and widespread use in animal farming, aquaculture, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Industrial sources are somewhat regulated, but household and hospital wastewater, both important point sources, are often inadequately treated. An estimated half of the wastewater from these sources is released without treatment globally.

Since global human antibiotic use has surged, increasing by 65% between 2000 and 2015 and by 114% in low-income countries, concerns about the growing environmental load are intensifying. Advanced treatment technologies exist but are not widely implemented. Moreover, some antibiotic residues may persist in sediments or transform into other biologically active forms.

Direct global monitoring of antibiotics is limited by high costs and complexity, making regular tracking difficult. As an alternative, contaminant fate models can simulate the environmental fate of chemicals, helping identify high-risk regions.



Environmental exposure levels of antibiotics in global rivers. Total risk quotient (RQtot) is calculated as the sum of individual risk quotients of all 40 antibiotics in the global river system under low-flow conditions. Rivers in gray present insignificant risk (RQtot < 0.01). Only rivers exceeding a long-term average flow of 0.1 m3 s−1 are shown.

In this analysis, researchers used a contaminant fate model called HydroFATE to assess whether antibiotics from human use alone pose a threat to river systems globally, based on data from 23.8 million kilometers of river networks.

They estimated the antibiotic emissions from human activity by combining population distributions, per capita antibiotic use, and human metabolism rates. The fate of these substances was modeled based on their pathways, including treated and untreated wastewater, as well as natural land attenuation.

River networks were simulated to track contaminant transport by calculating how antibiotic loads accumulated downstream, incorporating instream decay and lake removal. Concentrations in rivers were computed as the total load divided by local river discharge.

The research team then validated the models by comparing the results with measured antibiotic concentrations at 877 global sites for 21 compounds. The model used the lowest monthly river flow between 1971 and 2000 to simulate risk under plausible but impactful conditions.

Environmental exposure was assessed using risk quotients (RQi), calculated as the ratio of modeled concentrations to ecological or resistance-promoting thresholds. These were summed into a total risk quotient (RQtot) to capture cumulative impacts.

The exposure faced by humans in terms of health impacts was evaluated using the equivalent dose concentration as a proportion of the defined daily dose and assessed against chronic exposure thresholds. The highest percentile of dose concentrations was used to estimate high-risk human exposure scenarios, assuming untreated water consumption.



Annual consumption of the 40 antibiotics selected for inclusion in this study, aggregated by country. Reported values are from Klein et al. (20), and extrapolated values were calculated based on the methodology described in the paper.

The researchers estimated that global antibiotic consumption was 32,200 tons per year, with 29,200 tons attributed to the top 40 most commonly used antibiotics. After accounting for additional countries, the estimate rose to 30,300 tons.

Of this amount, 68%, or 20,500 tons per year, is excreted, and approximately 29%, or 8,500 tons per year, is estimated to be released into the river system. Only 43% of domestic antibiotic loads are treated through wastewater systems.

Centralized plants eliminate 72% of incoming antibiotics but still contribute 17% of emissions. Decentralized and untreated systems contribute 29% and 54%, respectively. Most removal occurs through instream decay (48%) and lake retention (13%).

Under conditions of low flow, 49% of the global river length posed no risk, 9% had a low risk, 17% had a medium risk, and 25% had a high to very high risk. About 3.8 million kilometers of rivers had one or more substances that exceeded individual risk thresholds, and 0.7 million kilometers were contaminated by ten or more high-risk antibiotics.

Countries like India, Pakistan, and China showed extensive river lengths at high risk, largely driven by common antibiotics such as amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime, which were the main contributors by river length exceeding individual high-risk thresholds, although other antibiotics like ciprofloxacin were also significant contributors in specific regions or for human health risk assessment.

For human health exposure, 1.4% of global rivers fell within the highest antibiotic dose percentile, potentially affecting over 750 million people under conditions where untreated water was consumed.

The study finds that human antibiotic use poses significant risks to rivers globally, with even greater risks likely in areas where veterinary use, pharmaceutical waste, and inadequate wastewater treatment are also present.

While industrial discharge, aquaculture, and agriculture are key contributors, these were not included in the models due to limitations in data availability. Seasonal peaks and extreme weather events could also lead to higher local concentrations.

Despite its constraints, the model reliably estimates long-term risks and highlights the urgent need for improved wastewater management, stricter regulations, and responsible antibiotic use. Policies should prioritize high-risk regions, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and adopt a OneHealth approach in drug approval to protect ecosystems and public health.

A new study, published in BMC Nutrition, demonstrates that providing medically tailored meals (MTM) to patients with heart failure (HF) and malnutrition risk following hospital discharge significantly improves their nutritional status and keeps hospital readmission rates well below local and national averages.

The study compared the impact of delivering seven versus 21 MTM per week over a four-week period. A research team, led by Penn Nursing's Charlene Compher, PhD, RD, LDN, FASPEN, the Shearer Chair of Healthy Community Practices, Professor of Nutrition Science, and Director of Nutrition programs in the Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, enrolled 46 patients discharged from the hospital with HF and malnutrition risk. The research team conducted telephone surveys at baseline, 30-, and 60-days post-discharge to assess changes in malnutrition risk, adherence to American Heart Association (AHA) dietary guidelines, sarcopenia risk, and 30-day readmissions.

In collaboration with the Metropolitan Area Neighborhood Nutrition Alliance (MANNA) and the Clinical Nutrition Support Service at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania – the study revealed that patients receiving at least seven MTM per week experienced a significant reduction in malnutrition and sarcopenia risk. Notably, adherence to AHA diet goals improved over time, regardless of whether patients received seven or 21 meals. The 30-day readmission rates were significantly lower than the national average, at nine percent for those receiving 21 MTM and 12.5 percent for those receiving seven MTM.

Our findings suggest that even a modest intervention of seven medically tailored meals per week can have a profound positive impact on the health and recovery of heart failure patients. This intervention not only improves nutritional outcomes and diet adherence but also keeps hospital readmissions low, which translates to better patient care and lower healthcare costs."

The researchers concluded that the provision of at least seven MTM per week in the immediate post-discharge period is a promising strategy to improve malnutrition and sarcopenia risk, enhance diet adherence, and maintain readmission rates below national averages for patients with HF and malnutrition risk.

Indiana University School of Medicine scientists have developed a powerful new imaging technique to study bone marrow in mouse models. By overcoming key challenges unique to imaging this complex tissue, this advancement could support future drug development and therapies for conditions involving bone marrow, including cancers, autoimmune diseases and musculoskeletal disorders.

The new method was made possible by the multiplex imaging tool Phenocycler 2.0, which enabled researchers to visualize a record number of cellular markers within intact bone marrow tissue from mice. The findings were recently published in Leukemia.

Bone marrow is difficult to study because it is gelatinous and encased in hard bone. Since bone marrow plays an important role in blood and immune cell formation and houses valuable stem cells, our unique imaging approach offers a useful tool for a variety of research applications."

Sonali Karnik, PhD, assistant research professor of orthopedic surgery at the IU School of Medicine and co-lead author of the study

Traditional tools like flow cytometry and standard fluorescence imaging are considered the most established methods for tissue analysis. However, flow cytometry requires disrupting complex tissues to study and quantify cell populations, and standard fluorescent imaging is limited to detecting only three cellular markers at a time. In contrast, the new methodology allowed the researchers to visualize 25 different cellular markers in intact bone marrow tissue without disruption, providing a more comprehensive view of the bone marrow to enhance the understanding of disease behaviors and the development of more effective treatments.

While the tool has previously been used to study organs like the spleen and kidney, the IU Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology team is the first to successfully apply it to mouse bone marrow. 

"Because mouse models are widely used to study human diseases, this technique offers a promising new method for investigating a range of conditions like autoimmune diseases, leukemia and other disorders involving bone marrow," said Reuben Kapur, PhD, a co-senior author on the study, director of the IU School of Medicine's Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research and co-director of the IU Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology.

The IU Innovation and Commercialization Office has filed a provisional patent for the new imaging methodology, and the team is now working to expand the marker panel to include additional features such as bone, nerves, muscle and more immune and signaling cell types.

Additional IU study authors include Connor Gulbronson, Paige C. Jordan, Rahul Kanumuri, Baskar Ramdas, Ramesh Kumar, Melissa L. Hartman, Izza Khurram, Drew M. Brown, Karen E. Pollok, Pratibha Singh and Melissa A. Kacena.

This research was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health.

In a powerful natural experiment using Australian health data, researchers found that being eligible for the shingles vaccine may reduce dementia diagnoses, strengthening the case for preventive strategies in brain health.

In a recent study published in the JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association), an international team of researchers determined whether eligibility for herpes zoster (HZ) (virus that causes shingles) vaccination based on date of birth influenced the likelihood of receiving a new dementia (memory loss and thinking problems) diagnosis.

Dementia affects over 55 million people globally, posing a growing public health crisis. While age remains the strongest risk factor, infections may also play a role. One underexplored link is between HZ and dementia. HZ results from reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, a neurotropic virus that can affect the central nervous system. Vaccination against HZ might not only prevent shingles but also lower dementia risk, possibly through immune modulation. A previous quasi-experiment in Wales found this association, but replication is essential across diverse populations and health systems. Further research is needed to validate these findings globally.

To ensure the finding was specific to dementia, researchers checked if vaccine eligibility affected 15 other common conditions like heart disease or diabetes; it did not show a significant impact on those diagnoses.

The present study employed a quasi-experimental design using primary care data from 65 general practices across Australia, facilitated by the health informatics platform PenCS. The analysis leveraged a natural eligibility cutoff created by the National Immunisation Programme, which began offering the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax) free of charge on November 1, 2016, to individuals aged 70 to 79 years. Eligibility was determined by birthdate: individuals born on or after November 2, 1936, were eligible, while those born before were not. This setup allowed for a comparison between groups that were nearly identical in age and baseline health, differing primarily in vaccine access.

Patient records included diagnosis histories, immunizations, prescriptions, and demographic details. Dates of birth were coded by week, and all diagnoses, including dementia, were identified using open-ended text fields provided by general practitioners. Patients aged 50 or older as of November 1, 2016, and with at least one clinical visit between 1993 and 2024 were included.

The primary outcome was the first recorded diagnosis of dementia during a 7.4-year follow-up period. The main exposure was eligibility for HZ vaccination based on birthdate. Statistical analysis centered on regression discontinuity (RD), comparing individuals born just before and after the eligibility threshold. This method controls for both observed and unobserved variables, assuming no abrupt changes other than vaccination status. Secondary analyses used time-to-event models, including accelerated failure time and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, along with robustness checks across multiple bandwidths and modeling strategies. All analyses were conducted using R statistical software.

It is important to note that the effect measured in this study is for eligibility for HZ vaccination, not for confirmed receipt of the vaccine, because vaccination status is likely underreported in the primary care data used. Due to this underreporting, the study authors did not attempt to estimate the effect of actually receiving the vaccine, as this could overstate the results.

Additionally, the study population was drawn from practices that agreed to participate and use the PenCS platform, so the data are not fully representative of all Australian primary care patients. The effect estimate is also "local," applying most clearly to individuals who were around 79 to 80 years old at the time the HZ vaccination program began.

The protective effect observed in this study specifically pertains to the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax), as the newer recombinant vaccine (Shingrix) was not widely used in Australia during the study period.

The study confirmed that the effect wasn't just a statistical fluke tied to the year, as testing the same analysis method on birth dates in surrounding years (1933-1935, 1937-1939) revealed only the actual 1936 vaccine eligibility date showed a significant link to lower dementia rates.

Data from 101,219 patients were analyzed, focusing on 18,402 patients born within 482 weeks of the November 2, 1936, eligibility threshold. The mean age in this subset was 77 years, with 54.3% of the participants being women. The probability of receiving the HZ vaccine jumped from 6.5% among ineligible individuals to 30.2% among eligible individuals, confirming that the date-of-birth rule effectively differentiated vaccine exposure.

Importantly, no differences were observed in prior health conditions, uptake of other preventive services, or dementia risk factors across the eligibility threshold, supporting the validity of the natural experiment. Regression discontinuity analysis showed that eligibility for HZ vaccination led to a statistically significant 1.8 percentage point reduction in the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis over 7.4 years (95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 3.3; P = .01). The protective effect was consistent across alternative follow-up durations, grace periods, and model specifications.

Additional checks, including those limited to frequent primary care users and time-to-event models, supported the primary findings. No effects were observed on other common diagnoses or preventive health behaviors, indicating the result was specific to dementia. Comparative RD using an additional ineligible cohort yielded a similar effect size of 1.5 percentage points. Kaplan-Meier plots and cumulative incidence curves further showed the delayed onset of dementia in vaccine-eligible individuals.

The study ruled out confounding by confirming that no other interventions used the same date-of-birth eligibility rule and demonstrating that the effect was unique to the 1936 birth threshold. Analyses shifting the threshold to nearby years showed no similar effect, further validating the causal interpretation.

It is also important to note that dementia diagnoses are substantially underdetected in the primary care data analyzed. For example, only about 1.4% of patients older than 65 in the PenCS dataset had a dementia diagnosis, compared to an estimated 8.4% prevalence in the general Australian population. This underdiagnosis means that the absolute effect size observed may not fully reflect the impact of HZ vaccination on dementia risk in the broader population.

These findings, when combined with similar research from Wales, provide consistent and compelling evidence that HZ vaccination may help prevent or delay the onset of dementia.

To summarize, this study demonstrated that individuals eligible for free HZ vaccination due to their date of birth had a significantly lower likelihood of being diagnosed with dementia over a 7.4-year follow-up period. The use of a quasi-experimental design allowed for a comparison between nearly identical groups, minimizing confounding and providing stronger causal inference than traditional observational studies. These findings highlight the potential for HZ vaccination to serve as a low-cost intervention for dementia prevention. However, further studies in additional populations, as well as mechanistic and clinical research, are needed to explore the biological pathways, generalizability, and policy implications of these promising results.

Morgan announced her pregnancy last September, while sharing the news of her retirement. 

Former United States Women's National Team (USWNT) forward Alex Morgan has taken to social media to share the first images of her second child.

The 35-year-old announced her pregnancy last September, at the same time she shared her heartfelt decision to retire from football.

This week, Morgan posted images of newborn son Enzo, alongside daughter Charlie and husband Servando Carrasco.

“Adjusting to life as a family of four has been a beautiful whirlwind,” she told PEOPLE.

“Watching Charlie step into the big sis role has been so special… we're soaking in every second.”

It comes following the birth announcement last month, where proud parents Morgan and Carrasco posted an image on Instagram with the caption: “Welcome to the world, baby Enzo.”

She has been documenting the journey post-retirement to share with fans, including a subtle gender reveal in January.

The importance of family has been a cornerstone of Morgan's career.

Back in her retirement announcement, she said of the pregnancy: “As unexpected as this came, we are so overjoyed.

“To me, family means everything. I wouldn't be here without my husband and my family uplifting, motivating, encouraging, and supporting me and sacrificing for me for the last 15 years as a professional athlete.”

Her nation's fifth-highest goal scorer, she is still heavily involved in the progress of women's football off the pitch – but for now, she is busy ‘soaking' in the joy of becoming a family of four.

With just over a year until World Cup 2026 – which will be played across the US, Canada and Mexico – tournament organizer Fifa has run a poster campaign that's seen host cities each commission a local artist to celebrate football and regional culture.

Across March and April, a new poster was unveiled every two days and now they're all live. It comes off the back of a similar project that saw each host city reveal its own sonic identity.

The posters are arguably the most striking communication yet to roll out ahead of the tournament. Many offer a simple, effective glimpse into how the games might feel in each city and generate some tangible excitement.

We've shared some of our favorites in this article, which we think best capture the spirit of what Fifa is trying to achieve.

Interbrand, which designed the visual identity of the tournament which was first revealed back in 2023, says it has had nothing to do with either the poster or sonic ident projects, while a Fifa spokesperson says the organization worked with the host cities directly on both.

The World Cup 2026 identity is the first ever to feature an image of the World Cup trophy in its true likeness and, according to Fifa, will form a template for future tournament identities.

The main World Cup logo features the trophy and the year and, although we are some way off the tournament, we are beginning to see how a broader identity may behave more dynamically nearer the time.

The ‘26' in the logo will be used as a framing device as the identity rolls out further and photography, pattern and color are starting to reference host cities, as you can see in the image at the bottom of the page. 

An official tournament song has been remixed by producers in each host city, including Houston, San Francisco and Mexico City.

Although nothing's really captured our imagination quite like the underwater football scene imagined in the Boston poster by John Rego, which depicts a lobster attempting a scorpion kick not seen since Colombia keeper René Higuita tried it.

	RIYADH: Hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2034 is expected to transform Saudi Arabia's tourism sector and accelerate the nation's economic diversification, experts said. 


	The Kingdom was awarded the competition by the sport's international governing body in December, and is set to hold the event in 15 stadiums across five cities. 


	Saudi Arabia's sports tourism sector has been witnessing rapid growth since the launch of Vision 2030 nine years ago, with the Kingdom drawing 2.5 million visitors through 80 international events in the last four years, Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said in February. 


	Bolstering the tourism sector is one of the crucial goals outlined in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, as the Kingdom is steadily diversifying its economy by reducing its decade-long reliance on oil revenues. 


	Saudi Arabia's ambitious National Tourism Strategy aims to attract 150 million visitors by the end of this decade.

	Speaking to Arab News, Federico Pienovi, chief business officer and CEO of New Markets at Globant, said that the mega football event presents immense opportunities for the Kingdom to develop multiple sectors.


	“Hosting the FIFA World Cup is a game-changer for Saudi Arabia's tourism sector. For Saudi Arabia, FIFA World Cup 2034 represents a key milestone in its Vision 2030 strategy, accelerating economic diversification beyond oil by boosting tourism, hospitality, infrastructure, and smart city development,” said Pienovi. 


	He added that the tournament accelerates the Kingdom's tourist number ambitions by putting Saudi Arabia on the map for future leisure and business tourism.


	Guillaume Thibault, partner and head of sports and entertainment at Oliver Wyman for India, the Middle East and Africa, echoed similar views and said the football gala will be a major catalyst for Saudi Arabia's economic diversification, attracting over 10 million international visitors.


	Thibault added that the event is also expected to accelerate Saudi Arabia's national strategies in tourism, transport, and quality of life, creating opportunities in construction, hospitality, fan engagement, and talent development — all while mobilizing private sector investment.

	The Oliver Wyman official further said that hosting events such as the FIFA World Cup could boost the gross domestic product of Saudi Arabia, as well as creating immense job opportunities. 


	“On a macroeconomic level, past World Cups have contributed up to 10 percent GDP growth, as seen in South Africa 2010, while creating tens of thousands of jobs. Saudi Arabia can maximize its investment impact by aligning with local businesses and PIF-backed companies, ensuring long-term economic gains and positioning itself as a global sports and business hub,” said Thibault. 


	Max Klante, managing director and partner of Boston Consulting Group, said that major sporting events such as the 2034 World Cup, Formula 1, and the upcoming Asian games, will serve as an entry point for global audiences, showcasing Saudi Arabia as a travel destination.


	“They provide a platform to highlight the Kingdom's culture, heritage, and landscapes to the world while showcasing new and exciting entertainment and cultural experiences such as eSports and adventure extreme sports. The integration of sports, media, entertainment, and culture boosts international visibility and fosters long-term tourism growth,” said Klante. 


	Saudi Arabia has already hosted several major sporting events, including the WWE Super Showdown, the Saudi Pro-Golf Championship, Battle of the Champions, and Formula E. 


	The Kingdom has also witnessed E-Prix, the International Handball Federation Super Globe and the Saudi International Meeting for Disabilities Sport, as well as organizing the auction of players for the 2025 Indian Premier League, a major cricketing event which features 10 professional clubs. 


Long-term impacts


	According to Pienovi, hosting major sporting events will not only boost tourism in the Kingdom but will also support the country's infrastructure growth for the long term. 


	“Beyond the tournament, the country will benefit from long-term infrastructure improvements, smart venue advancements, and the rise of new entertainment hubs that will attract visitors for years to come,” said Pienovi. 


	Thibault said that hosting such events will help Saudi Arabia establish itself as a premier sports destination globally, strengthen global ties, attract international business, and enhance the Kingdom's geopolitical influence. 


	 “When executed strategically, major sporting events leave a lasting impact beyond the tournament itself. Mega-events drive billions in tourism, investment, and job creation. The 2012 London Olympics, for example, contributed $17 billion to the UK economy, proving their long-term financial impact,” said Thibault. 


	He added: “In terms of urban transformation, such events accelerate infrastructure development and reshape cities. The Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics revitalized an entire region, turning legacy resorts into prime real estate. Saudi Arabia's smart city and transport investments will ensure similar long-term benefits.” 


Elevating diplomatic and bilateral relationship


	The Oliver Wyman official further said that hosting such global events could help Saudi Arabia strengthen its bilateral relationship with several countries. 


	Saudi Arabia is already a diplomatic leader, ranking 18th in the Global Soft Power Index 2024 and has already hosted key forums including the G20 Summit and the World Economic Forum. 


	“Mega-events further enhance global ties by bringing nations together through sport, fostering cultural exchange, trade, and investment partnerships. By attracting global leaders, Saudi Arabia can deepen international collaborations, expand economic alliances, and position itself as a key player in global sports diplomacy,” said Thibault. 


	Klante also expressed identical views and said that successfully hosting global tournaments will enhance Saudi Arabia's standing as a reliable and capable partner on the world stage.


	“The ability to deliver top-tier sporting events creates unique opportunities for diplomatic engagement and strengthens economic and cultural ties with other nations. Stronger ties promote global understanding, security and prosperity,” added the BCG official. 


	Klante added that hosting major international events will establish Saudi Arabia's credibility in sports management and global event organization, while also opening opportunities for developing long-term partnerships with international teams, leagues, and sports federations.


	He further said that such events in Saudi Arabia could also boost the morale in the Kingdom, and the country will see more sporting heroes in the coming years. 


	“The ability to host major events inspires our youth to follow in the footsteps of their sports heroes. This strengthens engagement in sports, be this football, eSports, athletics or formula car racing. By inspiring the youth of today we lay the foundation for the top athletes of tomorrow,” said Klante.

Potential challenges


	Experts who talked with Arab News also talked about the potential challenges Saudi Arabia could face as the Kingdom gears up to face global sporting events. 


	According to Pienovi, the challenge for the Kingdom lies in integrating cutting-edge technology for seamless fan interactions — whether it's AI-driven crowd management, frictionless ticketing, or hyper-personalized digital experiences. 


	“Fans now expect an immersive, waitless, and contactless experience, powered by AI, AR/VR, and digital personalization. Implementing biometric entry, tech-driven loyalty programs and real-time engagement solutions will be key to delivering a next-level experience,” said Pienovi. 


	He added: “The challenge is not just in adopting these technologies but in making them intuitive, frictionless, and scalable across multiple venues.”


	The Globant official believes that ensuring seamless connectivity across all platforms — from real-time streaming to AR-powered second-screen experiences — will be crucial for reaching international audiences and keeping fans engaged beyond the stadium. 


	Klante underscored the vitality of strengthening the transport systems in the Kingdom, as well as, bolstering the logistical prowess, and said that “world-class events require complex logistical planning, complex integration and seamless execution.”


	He added: “Ensuring global accessibility, efficient transport, and a smooth visitor experience will be critical to success. A focus must always be placed on how the visitor journey interacts with the various city and intercity transport solutions — creating a unified experience like no other.” 


	Thibault also expressed similar views and said that logistics, crowd management and infrastructure development are crucial for Saudi Arabia to seamlessly host mega events like FIFA World Cup. 


	The Oliver Wyman official added that managing transport, security, and emergency response requires advanced planning, with mega-projects including NEOM and Qiddiya integrating AI-driven security and real-time crowd monitoring. 


	“The challenge lies in balancing speed with sustainability. Legacy planning is key to avoiding underutilized venues, ensuring stadiums transition into training hubs, community centers, or professional league facilities,” added Thibault.


	SINGAPORE/NEW YORK: Oil prices rose for a second session on Friday buoyed by potential de-escalation of the US-China trade war, but the market was headed for a weekly decline amid concerns about oversupply.


	Brent crude futures gained 43 cents to $66.98 a barrel by 7:33 a.m. Saudi time, on track to fall 1.4 percent for the week.


	US West Texas Intermediate crude rose 42 cents to $63.21 a barrel but was set to decline 2.3 percent for the week.


	“For today, oil prices are slightly up as the market responds to signs of easing tensions around Trump's tariffs and a potential shift in the Fed's policy stance, contributing to a broader market recovery,” said LSEG senior analyst Anh Pham.


	“On a weekly basis, however, prices are down as concerns over oversupply from OPEC+ persist, while the demand outlook remains uncertain amid ongoing trade tensions. A stronger US dollar has also added pressure to crude prices,” he added.


	US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that trade talks between the US and China were underway, pushing back against Chinese claims that no discussions had taken place.


	China is considering exempting some US imports from its 125 percent tariffs and is asking businesses to provide lists of goods that could be eligible in the biggest sign yet of Beijing's concerns about the economic fallout from the trade war.


	China hiked its tariffs after Trump announced higher levies on Chinese goods.


	Oil prices tumbled earlier this month after the tariffs sparked concern about global demand and a sell-off in financial markets.


	Worries are growing about excess supply. Several OPEC+ members had suggested the group accelerate oil output increases for a second month in June, Reuters reported earlier this week.


	The US and Russia are moving in the right direction to end the war in Ukraine, but some specific elements of a deal remain to be agreed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with CBS News.


	A halt to Russia's war in Ukraine and the easing of sanctions could allow more Russian oil to flow to global markets. Russia, a member of the OPEC+ group that includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is one of the world's biggest oil producers along with the US and Saudi Arabia.


	And Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Thursday he was ready to travel to Europe for talks on Tehran's nuclear program.


	Successful talks with Europe and the US would probably result in the lifting of sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Iran is the third-biggest oil producer in OPEC behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq.


	BEIRUT: Lebanon's parliament on Thursday granted regulatory bodies greater access to bank account information, a key reform demanded by international creditors before the crisis-hit country can unlock bail-out funds.


	Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called parliament's approval of changes to banking secrecy laws “a necessary step toward the desired financial reform that our government promised to achieve, and a fundamental pillar to any recovery plan.”


	Adding that the decades-old culture of financial opacity was no longer the boon to investment it once was, Salam said the reform was fundamental to “restoring the rights of depositors and the confidence of citizens and the international community.”


	Lebanon was once a booming regional financial hub dubbed the “Switzerland of the Middle East,” with strict banking secrecy laws a key attraction, but the economic crisis that began in 2019 shredded its fiscal reputation.


	Since then, authorities have come under local and international pressure to amend the laws amid accusations that influential figures spirited large sums abroad while regular depositors were locked out of their life savings and the local currency's value plummeted.


	Lebanese rights group Legal Agenda said the amendments allow “banking supervisory and regulatory bodies” including the central bank “to request access to all banking information without linking the request to a specific objective.”


	These bodies will now be able to audit customer accounts by name, access deposit details and look into possible suspicious activity, the group said.


	The changes are among several major reforms Lebanon needs to make to unlock billions of dollars in aid to restart the economy after the collapse, which was widely blamed on mismanagement and corruption.


	Finance Minister Yassine Jaber told local broadcaster LBC that the amendments “opened greater space” for Lebanon's central bank to access accounts.


	But “we should not think that with this law, anyone can enter a bank and demand account details” for whoever they like, added Jaber, who is in Washington with other senior officials for meetings with the IMF and the World Bank.


	Alain Aoun, a member of parliament's finance committee, said the move followed 2022 banking secrecy amendments that the IMF had viewed as “insufficient.”


	Now, regulatory bodies will be able to request “the information they want” on bank accounts, he said.


	The cabinet, which approved the amendment earlier this month, said it would apply retroactively for 10 years from the date of request, meaning it would cover the start of the economic crisis.


	WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund plans to work with Syria to help it reintegrate into the global economy, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday, citing a meeting on the war-scarred nation held this week.


	Georgieva told reporters that Syria's central bank governor and finance minister attended the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank this week for the first time in over 20 years.


	“Our intention is to, first and foremost, help them rebuild institutions so they can plug themselves in the world economy,” she said.


	Officials from the IMF and World Bank met with Syrian officials and other finance ministers and key stakeholders to discuss the country's reconstruction on the sidelines of the meetings in Washington.


	The high-level Syrian government delegation's Washington trip marked the first US visit by Syria's new authorities since former President Bashar Al-Assad was toppled in December.


	Much of Syria's infrastructure has been left in ruins by nearly 14 years of war sparked by the government authorities' deadly crackdown on protests against Al-Assad.


	The government that took over after Al-Assad was ousted has sought to rebuild Syria's ties in the region and further afield and to win support for reconstruction efforts.


	But tough US sanctions imposed during Al-Assad's rule remain in place.


	In January, the US issued a six-month exemption for some sanctions to encourage humanitarian aid, but this has had limited effect.


	Reuters reported in February that efforts to bring in foreign financing to pay public sector salaries had been hampered by uncertainty over whether this could breach US sanctions.

	JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia has launched a major dairy industrial cluster in Al-Kharj, reinforcing its ambition to become the region's leading hub for dairy production and food manufacturing.


	Announced during the Saudi Dairy Forum in Al-Kharj — located approximately 90 km southeast of Riyadh — the initiative is a strategic component of the Kingdom's broader National Industrial Strategy. The cluster spans 1 million sq. m and is equipped with advanced infrastructure tailored to support dairy manufacturing and related industries.


	Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar Alkhorayef, speaking at the forum, underscored the project's role in attracting high-value investments and enhancing the Kingdom's food security.


	He revealed that the dairy sector reached a market size of SR22 billion ($5.87 billion) in 2024, with exports totaling SR4.8 billion and imports at SR8.9 billion.


	According to the IMARC Group, the market is projected to grow to $8.4 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.8 percent from 2025 to 2033.


	“This project aligns with the goals of the National Industrial Strategy to position Saudi Arabia as a regional hub for food industries,” Alkhorayef stated, as reported by the Saudi Press Agency.


	He said it will offer investors access to fully developed industrial land, modern facilities, storage solutions, and a comprehensive support system.


	In a statement on social media, Alkhorayef expressed gratitude to Riyadh Governor Prince Faisal bin Bandar for his patronage of the forum and for inaugurating the country's first dairy industrial cluster in Al-Kharj Industrial City.


	The minister noted that Saudi Arabia has achieved 129 percent self-sufficiency in dairy production, underscoring the sector's resilience and capacity for growth. Al-Kharj alone contributes over 70 percent of the Kingdom's total dairy output, supplying both local and regional markets.


	The new cluster is part of a broader initiative by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones to establish specialized food industry hubs throughout the Kingdom. The project is expected to foster synergies across the value chain, including animal feed, food additives, packaging, and machinery manufacturing.


	The Saudi Dairy Forum, hosted by the Al-Kharj Chamber in cooperation with the National Industrial Development Center, brought together industry leaders, policymakers, and agricultural stakeholders. It was held under the patronage of Riyadh Gov, Prince Faisal bin Bandar and attended by Al-Kharj Gov. Prince Fahd bin Mohammed bin Saad bin Abdulaziz.


	As Saudi Arabia accelerates its push to diversify the economy and achieve food security, the Al-Kharj dairy cluster stands as a milestone in the Kingdom's industrial and agricultural evolution.

Saturday's Clasico showdown might end up being a measuring stick of just how far Carlo Ancelotti's side have fallen

This wasn't supposed to happen. Things aren't really going to plan for Real Madrid. Los Blancos, who were tipped to win the lot this season, have been miles off it. In fact, this, right now, is a football team on a steep decline. Madrid are out of the Champions League, slipping up in La Liga, and scraping narrow wins on moments of brilliance - as well as the odd slice of luck.

It is a fine thing, then, that Los Blancos are facing Barcelona this weekend. Clasicos are always tense occasions, and even the ones that don't mean as much always feel big - by virtue of rivalry alone. This one, though, holds a certain gravitas. There is not only a trophy on the line but also the sense of two teams at different junctures. Madrid are on the way down, broken when they were supposed to be chugging through the season. Barcelona, meanwhile, are on the ascent - and only likely to get better.

And after all of the pre-season talk about how Madrid were the ones to watch, and Barca were set up to fail, Saturday's final might well end up showing just how far Carlo Ancelotti and his troops have gone backwards.

Messi and Miami had no answer for Vancouver's speed and athleticism and paid for it with a 2-0 defeat

Vancouver Whitecaps fans reportedly paid close to three times face value to catch a glimpse of Lionel Messi at BC Place in the CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinals against Inter Miami on Thursday night. They were not disappointed.

Not only did they get a 90-minute showing from the Argentine maestro, but they also saw their hometown side pull off a stunning 2-0 upset - sparked by a brilliant headed goal from Brian White. It was all Vancouver needed in the first leg, but the job isn't done yet. Leg 2 is set for April 30 at Chase Field in Florida.

Still, this is a result that will live long in the memory of Whitecaps supporters, especially considering what happened when these two teams met last season. During Inter Miami's previous visit to BC Place, then-manager Tata Martino rested stars Messi, Luis Suárez, and Sergio Busquets due to fixture congestion - a match Miami still won 2-1. The decision sparked backlash from the Vancouver crowd and prompted Martino to publicly defend his call.

This year, with a spot in the Champions Cup final on the line, both sides fielded full-strength lineups - and it was Vancouver who seized the moment. Following a playbook that has given The Herons issues before, the Whitecaps ceded possession and waited for their chance to strike. White gave an early warning, just missing a through ball in front of goal in the third minute. About 20 minutes later, he made no mistake.

Despite Miami holding 73 percent of the ball in the first 20 minutes, it was caught out on the counter. Sebastian Berhalter picked out White with a perfectly weighted aerial pass, and the striker nodded home in the 24th minute.

Inter Miami looked flat in attack, with Messi leading the team in shots (three) but struggling to find space. Vancouver effectively denied the 37-year-old access to the box, forcing him into long-range attempts and set-piece opportunities. Two of his shots were on target, but Yohei Takaoka was up to the task with a stellar showing in goal.

Berhalter wasn't done, either. In the 85th minute, the midfielder capped another swift counter with a rocket, sealing the match. Unless Miami can fix its persistent issues against athletic, counter-attacking sides, its Champions Cup run may be over next week.

Amid all the injuries at Real Madrid this season, the absence of Dani Carvajal has perhaps hit them the most.

The veteran right-back, who picked up an ACL injury earlier in the campaign, has been out of action for 300 days now, missing as many as 53 competitive matches in the process.

The impact of Carvajal's absence has been significant as Real Madrid have lacked anyone to properly replace him at right-back.

A recent report from MARCA has offered a fresh update on the fitness of Dani Carvajal, confirming that the veteran moving closer and closer to returning to the pitch.

Real Madrid recently shared a photo of Carvajal back on the ball at Valdebebas. That update was followed by a video of the Spaniard engaging in ball exercises at moderate intensity – an encouraging sign in what has been a long road to recovery.

Carvajal himself seems optimistic. Speaking at the Laureus Awards, the 32-year-old confirmed his main target is to return in time for the FIFA Club World Cup. 

“The goal is clear,” he told MARCA, “I want to be ready for the Club World Cup.”

Real Madrid kick off their Club World Cup campaign on June 18 against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal. Both the player and the club hopeful of Carvajal's involvement in this game, though the club remain unsure about who will lead the team.

In any case, Carvajal's potential return to action in the summer could go a long way in boosting Real Madrid's chances of winning the inaugural edition of the FIFA Club World Cup.

A while ago, Real Madrid issued an official statement lashing out against the comments made by referees Ricardo De Burgos Bengoetxea and Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes and asked the RFEF to take action against the pair. 

Real Madrid have been pushing for the Spanish Football Federation to replace the match officials for tomorrow's Copa del Rey final following their comments earlier in the press conference.

In fact, Los Blancos cancelled their press conference, training, and other official pre-match events today in protest and are even said to be considering walking away from the final.

However, now, RFEF president Rafael Louzan has come out and offered an update, stating that there will be no change of referees and that the final in Seville will go ahead as planned.

“The CTA [Technical Committee of Referees] has appointed a refereeing team, and that's the way it is,” said Louzan (h/t SPORT).

“I appeal for calm, responsibility, and common sense. I've already spoken with Real Madrid.” he added.

On being asked if the final will go ahead according to plan, Louzan replied: “Of course, yes.”

It now remains to be seen how Real Madrid respond to the situation and whether they are willing to play the game or opt to walk away.

Jim Courier has suggested a player who Carlos Alcaraz may not want to face at the French Open.

In a month's time the 21-year-old is set to commence the defence of his title at the clay court Grand Slam.

Carlos Alcaraz conquered Roland Garros a year ago by reversing a two sets to one deficit to defeat Alexander Zverev.

The World number two will aim to repeat his accomplishment in 2025, but Alcaraz could face some pretty stiff competition from the outset.

Alcaraz will be the player to beat at the French Open when he enters as the defending champion.

He will have to be on his game from the outset, especially if he were to face someone like Reilly Opelka.

The American is currently ranked outside the top 100, and if he were to compete at the Grand Slam, he would likely be unseeded, meaning a top player could face him early.

With his monstrous nerve, it could cause players like Alcaraz problems and Jim Courier, a two-time French Open winner in his own right, thinks this is something the Spaniard would want to avoid.

While reviewing Alcaraz's chances at the French Open, Courier said: “I wouldn't be concerned about his tennis level because the best of five gives these players more time, they are protected from a seeding standpoint from playing anyone inside the top 32.

“Unless you run into someone like Reilly Opelka who can make it not about the tennis and about reactions, that would be worrying if I was on Team Alcaraz. But other than that I think he will have time to work his way into the tournament.”

“The question is if he gets into week two, as we all think he would, assuming he is healthy. Does he have the legs and the stamina to stay in and make the right decisions or is he forced to make compromised choices?

“When you have to do those in the latter stages of a major and up that risk profile, that's when things can get a little skewed.”

Alcaraz is experiencing some deja vu as injury has played a role in his clay court season once again.

He played just one event on clay prior to the 2024 French Open, and a year later, Alcaraz will watch his home tournament from the sidelines.

The World number two did some damage to his hamstring and groin in the second set of Sunday's Barcelona Open final.

He was able to finish that match, but now the Spaniard will have to watch his home tournament from the sidelines. Alcaraz has since taken to Instagram to apologise for not being able to play in Madrid.

“Hi everyone, I just wanted to say that it's a real shame for me not to be able to play here in Madrid,” Alcaraz said. “The support I get here is incredible—truly indescribable.

“All the people who come to the tournament, the locals from Madrid, and those who travel from afar to cheer me on.

“I wanted to take this moment to thank you for the support, for the encouragement—just know that I hear you, I read so many of your messages, and we'll come back stronger. I'll be back here in Madrid very soon. Sending you all a big hug.”

CARLOS ALCARAZ has revealed how he was almost banned from Wimbledon, because of his UNDERWEAR.

The Spanish ace is already a two-time champion on the grass courts of the tournament in SW19, having won the tournament in both 2023 and 2024.

On both occasions the 21-year-old managed to topple tennis superstar Novak Djokovic.

However, Wimbledon's strict all-white kit policy applies to absolutely everyone without exception.

And that fact almost cost Alcaraz his spot at Wimbledon as he revealed how wearing colour briefs landed him in hot water.

Speaking on the Netflix docuseries, My Way, Alcaraz said: "I think Wimbledon is one of the most elegant tournaments in the world, if not the most elegant one, be it for its prestige or its rules. 

"You can't step onto the court unless you're dressed in all white.

"I was wearing colour briefs and you could see them through my shorts, and they called me out on them, saying, ‘Next time, we won't let you play.'

"I mean, this really goes to show you just how strict they can be!"

That lesson was enough for the World No3 to learn his lesson.

Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles across his career so far, with only the Australian Open continuing to allude him after winning the 2022 US Open and 2024 French Open on top of his Wimbledon titles.

He also lost in the Olympic god medal match at the Paris Olympic Games last year.

Earlier this week Alcaraz was forced to pull out of the ATP 1000 Madrid Open due to a right leg injury and struggles with a left hamstring issue.

He required treatment on his right groin during his Barcelona Open defeat to Holger Rune last weekend and underwent MRI tests which revealed a problem with his right leg adbuctor.

In a statement during a press conference, he said: "I couldn't practice the entire week and found out I had hamstring and groin injuries. I needed to listen to my body and make the right decision.

"On Monday I'll have more medical tests and after that we will have a better idea on how long I'll be out.

"It hurts me not to be able to play here in Madrid in front of my people, my friends and my family."

The injury blow comes ahead of his title defence at Roland Garros which starts in just over a month's time.

He was also scheduled to play at the Rome Masters but could now be forced to sit out.

Alcaraz said: "It hurts me not to be able to play here in Madrid in front of my people, my friends and my family.



"It's not an easy decision because Madrid is the first tournament I have ever been to as a young kid, it's the most special place for me to play.

"But (prioritising Roland Garros) was a big part of my decision to stop and recover properly.”

Day 4 at the ATP Madrid 2025 edition promises to be an action packed day of tennis. As ever, we preview and predict the matches scheduled for you.

Head-to-head – Draper 0-1 Griekspoor

This should be an exciting match. Jack Draper is having a solid 2025 and currently stands at 6th in the world while Tallon Griekspoor has had a lot of wins under his belt this year. They met each other once, almost two years ago, and a lot has changed since. Draper will like to have a good week here to build up momentum for the French Open and while Griekspoor impressed in the first round, expect the Brit to be at his aggressive best and start strong.
Prediction: Draper in 2

Head-to-head – First Meeting

Karen Khachanov played well last week in Barcelona and that should give him confidence heading into this week. He faces Reilly Opelka, who is under protected ranking, and maybe clay is not his favorite surface to play on. The American relies on his serve but his baseline game is not lacking either. That being said, Khachanov is a solid baseliner and on clay he should be able to create more chances on Opelka's serve.
Prediction: Khachanov in 3

Head-to-head – Nishikori 2-1 Shapovalov

Neither player enters this match with great results in clay court tournaments this year. Kei Nishikori did struggle in his first round match here but the Japanese is highly experienced and he knows these courts very well. He takes on the flamboyant Denis Shapovalov who would love a good week here. Expect Nishikori to absorb Shapovalov's power well and and counter punch when needed.
Prediction: Nishikori in 3

Head-to-head – Dimitrov 2-2 Jarry

Grigor Dimitrov had a mixed week in his last clay court tournament in Monte Carlo. He reached the last eight but was double bageled in that match. Lucky for him he faces Nicolas Jarry, a player he beat in that very tournament. Jarry won his first match on clay this week but Dimitrov is a big step up in quality. Expect Jarry's woes to continue.
Prediction: Dimitrov in 2

The first WTA Madrid round of 32 contests will be played on Day 5. Teenage prodigy Mirra Andreeva and US Open semifinalist Emma Navarro are among the top players scheduled to compete. We here at LWOT predict all the matches in two articles, including Coco Gauff vs Ann Li in the other.

Head-to-head: First meeting

Starodubtseva was helped by not having to play Karolina Muchova in the last round due to the Czech's withdrawal, but she still deserves credit for taking advantage against Elisabetta Cocciaretto. There will not be much variety in this matchup against Samsonova. Both players try to hit hard and flat through opponents and do not deviate from their styles. On a clay court, I trust Samsonova to implement that game more consistently.
Prediction: Samsonova in 3

Head-to-head: Bencic 2-1 Haddad Maia

Haddad Maia ended the worst run of her professional career in the last round against Bernarda Pera, the Brazilian's first singles win since January. While Haddad Maia's win was scrappy, Bencic performed excellently against Zeynep Sonmez and the 20th seed, Clara Tauson. Although clay is Bencic's worst surface and Haddad Maia's best chance of beating the Swiss, the ugly win against Pera did not inspire enough confidence to back the 2023 French Open semifinalist to overcome Bencic.
Prediction: Bencic in 2

Head-to-head: Vekic 2-0 Navarro

Neither player has reached the heights of last season so far in 2025. That is especially true of Vekic, but an exception was her impressive performance to beat Navarro at last month's BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Predicting the winner in their first match on clay is a challenging task. Navarro's level on the dirt is more consistently reliable, but Vekic winning a silver medal at Roland Garros last year proved her capabilities. The American is backed to beat Vekic for the first time by utilizing her more complete game, but it is a 50/50 matchup.
Prediction: Navarro in 3

Head-to-head: Andreeva 1-0 Frech

Andreeva did well to stay solid against Marie Bouzkova, who is tough to hit through on clay, in the previous round. Frech's style is similar to Andreeva's. The Pole tries to be aggressive from the baseline when possible, and her backhand is her stronger groundstroke. Andreeva's best level is simply much better than Frech's. The teenager needs to have a bad day to give her opponent a realistic chance of causing an upset in Madrid.
Prediction: Andreeva in 2

The ATP Mutua Madrid Open enter the fourth day with some mouth-watering encounters lined up, including the third clay court meeting this season between Sebastian Baez and Damir Dzumhur. Will the Bosnian end the rout? We analyse the match and several other matches to predict who will make it to the next round.

Head–to–Head: Baez 3 vs 0 Dzumhur

Sebastian Baez rightly enters as the favourite against Damir Dzumhur, being the better clay-court player, having defeated the Bosnian in all three of their encounters on the surface, with two wins in straight sets. His recent form on clay, including a title in Rio and a final in Santiago, gives him an edge.

Dzumhur, despite a solid 2025 (21-12 overall, 11-7 on clay) and a gritty win over Matteo Bellucci in the first round, struggles against Baez's consistency and defensive prowess.

Baez will enter the match in confident mood, but we expect the Bosnian to be motivated enough to deny his more illustrious opponent a fourth consecutive win.
Prediction: Dzumhur in 3

Head–to–Head: First Meeting

Alexandre Muller, coming off a first-round win via David Goffin's retirement, has shown resilience on clay with a Hong Kong title and Rio final this season but struggles with consistency against top players and this will even be exarcebated against his compatriot Humbert who has possesses a more potent serve and aggressive baseline game, and will benefit from Madrid's high-altitude conditions that favour power players.

Despite a hand injury, Humbert's recent form, including a title in Marseille, gives him an edge; however, as this is their first career meeting, it will add a bit of unpredictability to the outcome.

Muller came out all guns blazing in his first round, and if he can replicate his performance, the upset bells will be set off.
Prediction: Muller in 3

Head–to–Head: First Meeting

Eleventh seed Tommy Paul has had a solid 2025, boasting a 15-6 record, including semifinal appearances in Adelaide, Dallas, and Houston. However, his 2-4 record in Madrid and limited clay success suggest vulnerabilities. His teenage opponent, Joao Fonseca, is the rising star in the sport, with a clay-heavy background, having won his maiden ATP title in Buenos Aires and dominated his first-round encounter against Elmer Moller. His aggressive baseline play and comfort on clay will undoubtedly give him an edge.

While Paul's experience and fitness make him a formidable opponent, Fonseca's momentum and clay-court prowess tilt the scales. If Fonseca maintains his aggressive consistency and exploits Paul's weaker clay movement, he will win in a competitive match. Give me the Brazilian to advance.
Prediction: Fonseca in 2

Head–to–Head: Tsitsipas 5 vs 4 Struff

Tsitsipas, despite a recent dip in form and a retirement in Barcelona, holds a 5-4 head-to-head edge, though Struff leads 2-1 on clay. Tsitsipas' strong 11-6 record in Madrid and defensive prowess on clay should counter Struff's powerful serve and groundstrokes, which benefit from Madrid's altitude. Struff's poor 4-10 record in 2025 and eight-match losing streak before his first-round win suggest he's struggling. Expect Tsitsipas to capitalise on his experience and recent clay-court form to secure a gritty victory.
Prediction: Tsitsipas in 3

It's rare to find a player who's been in the Top 30 that Djokovic hasn't played, but such is the case with Arnaldi. The main reason is that the 24-year-old's breakthrough season was one of Djokovic's worst. Last year, Arnaldi reached the fourth round of Miami and made the semis in Canada, a tournament Djokovic skipped after winning his only title of 2024, Olympic gold. On dirt, Arnaldi got into the sweet 16 at Roland Garros, so his clay-court acumen is there.But 2025 has been a comedown for the Italian, who is just 9-9. He's also just 1-2 on clay, but his first-round win in Madrid was notable. First, it was 7-5 in the third, after a pair of three-set losses on clay; second, it was against Borna Coric, who has been winning plenty of late.At this point for the 37-year-old Djokovic—just 12-6 this season—any relatively accomplished opponent should present some caution, and I think Arnaldi will give him a serious test. But Madrid's faster clay should aid the Serbian's game, and the fact that Roland Garros is right around the corner should see Novak more focused than ever this season.

MADRID (AP) — Joao Fonseca needed to rest his mind and reflect on everything happening to him.

It was all too new for the young Brazilian tennis player — the media requests, the new fans, the praise from the top players.

“We felt that it was time to take a pause and reflect about everything that happened,” said the 18-year-old Fonseca, who has been quickly rising through the ATP rankings and is considered one of the sport's most promising players.

“A lot has changed. I needed time to rest my mind. It was an important break.”

Fonseca, who is up to No. 65 in the world, paused for nearly a month after reaching the third round in Miami. He went back to Rio de Janeiro to practice and try to recharge after playing several tournaments in a row late last year and early this season.

He is playing at the Madrid Open this week, where on Saturday he is scheduled to face Tommy Paul in the second round of the ATP 1000 clay-court tournament.

“Now there are a lot of people talking about me...in the media, the Internet,” Fonseca said. “I have to stay grounded and keep working hard to achieve more in tennis. I have to keep focused on my things and not on the expectations from other people.”

Former players Andy Murray and Boris Becker, as well as four-time Grand Slam champion Carlos Alcaraz, were among those praising the Brazilian recently.

Fonseca won his first tour title in Buenos Aires in February, becoming the first man born in 2006 or later to win an ATP trophy. He was the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history and the youngest South American player to win a title in the ATP Tour era (since 1990).

Fonseca started attracting more attention after winning the Next Gen ATP Finals last December, a tournament that brings together the season's best players who are 20 or younger. He also made headlines after reaching the second round at the Australian Open this year.

“A lot changed since the Next Gen and the Australian Open,” he said. “I became more well known around the world.”

Fonseca comfortably defeated Elmer Moller, 21, in the first round in Madrid in a match played on center court.

“I'm getting more used to those kind of tournaments and the stadiums,” he said. “Today I was a little bit more experienced than the other guy. It's difficult to say that because I was younger than him, but I already knew how it was to play on big stadiums, and I think it was his first time and he was a little bit more nervous. I'm feeling a little bit more like of a routine, feeling more adapted on those courts.” 

Fonseca is already an idol to Brazilians, who haven't had much to cheer in tennis since former world No. 1 Gustavo “Guga” Kuerten, who won the French Open in 1997, 2000 and 2001.

Loud Brazilian fans have been following Fonseca closely across the world, with big crowds at his matches both in Madrid and in Miami this year.

Fonseca said he doesn't want to be considered the new Guga, though. Instead, he is just trying to stay focused on training hard and on improving.

“Thankfully I have a great foundation, with relatives, friends and coaches who have been helping me keep my feet on the ground and stay humble to keep on working,” he said.

Juan Martin del Potro has proclaimed that Novak Djokovic will be “the best” for as long as he continues playing and expressed his belief that the Serb can win more majors.

Djokovic holds the all-time men's Grand Slam singles title record, having secured his 24th and most recent major at the 2023 US Open.

The Serbian has won 10 titles at the Australian Open, seven at Wimbledon, four at the US Open and three at the French Open.

The closest Djokovic has come to claiming a 25th Grand Slam crown was at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships, where he was a runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz. He was also a semi-finalist at the last two editions of the Australian Open.

The next stop on Djokovic's major quest is this year's French Open, which will be held from May 25 to June 8.

Djokovic, who will turn 38 on May 22, won his 99th and most recent title at the 2024 Paris Olympics in August.

In an interview with Olympics.com, del Potro was asked if the young generation of Joao Fonseca, Jakub Mensik and Learner Tien has the potential to be the best since the Big Three.

“Joao's generation could be a good generation, but it's too early to say if they will be as good [as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz],” said the Argentine.

Novak Djokovic reveals ‘priority' as he gives insight into work with Andy Murray

“There is potential, but often talent is not enough. It takes work, discipline, being healthy. Besides, Djokovic is still playing and, as long as he's active, he's the best.

“Winning a Grand Slam is something very personal for him, I believe. I believe he can win more Slams. In tennis terms, he is the best. He has a lot of experience.

“If he can be in good physical shape, he will keep trying and possibly succeed. It would be a great thing for the world of tennis if he manages to win again after some time, as he did in Paris with the gold medal.”

The 2009 US Open winner and former world No 3 also revealed he would coach Djokovic if his friend and former rival offered him the opportunity.

“I have my tennis academy in Boynton Beach, Florida. That excites me a lot, coaching kids, all kinds of people,” del Potro added when asked about coaching on the tour.

“To be a full-time coach, you have to travel a lot again, be all over the world. I did that for 20 years and I'm tired. But of course, if Novak asks me to work with him, I'll be happy [laughs]. I couldn't say no to him, but now I think so. The door is not 100% closed, but I think that moment [to be a coach on the circuit] will come.”

Del Potro officially retired in December after sharing the court with Djokovic in an emotional farewell exhibition match in Buenos Aires.

Novak Djokovic has played the very best in men's tennis over the years, winning over 1,000 singles matches.

The Serbian legend enjoyed rivalries with some of the ATP Tour's greatest-ever players on his way to a record-24 Grand Slam titles.

20 times, Djokovic has played either Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, or Andy Murray in a Grand Slam final, coming out victorious on 13 occasions.

However, during that period, Djokovic came unstuck against another of his biggest rivals in their two Major finals.

Speaking ahead of this year's Madrid Open, Djokovic has heaped praise on the three-time Major champion, whom he considers to be ‘very underestimated'.

During his pre-tournament press conference, Djokovic was asked for his thoughts on three-time Grand Slam champion, Stan Wawrinka.

“He is an incredible player. Someone I really admire as a person as well,” said Djokovic.

“I think he is very underestimated in the discussions.

“He has won a Gold medal at the Olympics, three Grand Slams. He has had an amazing career.”

The Serbian was particularly impressed with the Swiss star's longevity, as he continues to compete on the ATP Tour at the age of 40.

“He is 40 years old with God knows how many surgeries on the knees, and he is still pushing and still coming in early in the tournaments, one of the first people who show up in the club and practices early and does everything he needs to do,” said Djokovic.

“That is super impressive. I really admire him and envy him for that.

“Going to the Challenger level and trying to build your rankings and get matches. I have never done that, never been in that position that I have to, and hopefully don't need to build rankings again and need to go to Challenger level, but I really admire that.

“It says a lot about champion spirit and mentality that these guys have.”

The world number 158 has won just one ATP Tour main draw match in 2025, but reached the quarterfinals of a Challenger Tour event in Napoli last month.

Wawrinka is scheduled to return to action at the Challenger level for the tournament in Francavilla, Italy, on May 5.

Appearing in his second Career Grand Slam final, Wawrinka beat Djokovic to win the French Open title ten years ago.

The 37-year-old now reflects upon the defeat that saw him miss out on the one Major title that then eluded him.

“On the big stage, yeah, of course – that was one of the toughest losses for me,” said Djokovic.

“By that time, I still had not won Roland Garros, and that was I don't know which final for me already [3rd].

“I thought I am not playing Rafa [Nadal] for a change in the final and I liked my chances to win my first French Open title but then Stan [Wawrinka] stole it from me, and he played some incredible tennis.”

Djokovic said that he and Wawrinka still joke about the aftermath of the final to this day.

“We still joke around and I tell him that the reason why he played so well was because of the shorts,” he said.

“I don't know how many of you remember those famous shorts he was wearing, and he came up to the post-finals press conference with those shorts, and I really hated him since then.”

Djokovic then lost another Major final to Wawrinka at the US Open in 2016, as the Swiss continued to find success at the Grand Slams.

At Major tournaments, Wawrinka has won 44% of his matches against Djokovic (4-9), whereas throughout the remainder of the ATP Tour, the 40-year-old has won just 11% (2-16).

Always one to step up for the big occasion, it'll certainly be interesting to see what would happen if the pair faced off at any of the three remaining Grand Slams in 2025.

The 2025 French Open is set to begin on Sunday, May 25.

Novak Djokovic is the first to admit that his level of tennis has been patchy recently, but there is no reason to be overly concerned as his main aim is to peak at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

After his run to the semi-final of the Australian Open, Djokovic suffered a couple of early defeats as he lost in the first round of the Qatar Open and followed it up with a second-round defeat at the Indian Wells Open.

Those losses sparked concerns that it might be the beginning of the end for the tennis great, but he bounced back at the Miami Open as he reached the final, losing against teenager Jakub Mensik. That was followed by a second-round exit from the Monte Carlo Masters.

Djokovic concedes his standard has not been at the desired level, but he is using the ATP Tour events to prepare for the French Open and Wimbledon.

“The priority is obviously trying to take the level of tennis that currently is maybe not where we want it to be to the higher level, so that I can peak at [the] French Open,” the 24-time Grand Slam winner told Sky Sports.

“That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

“Of course, we're in Madrid, we came in early. We're putting in a lot of hours in the court and in the gym, trying to perfect the body and the game and basically every aspect of my game to be a few per cent better than it was in the previous weeks.

“If I can reach that desired level this tournament, that would be amazing. I don't have really high expectations and I really hope I can get through the first hurdle and then we'll take it from there.”

Three-time Madrid Open champion Djokovic is seeded fourth at this year's ATP 1000 event in Spain and he will kick his campaign off against Matteo Arnaldi in what will be a first career meeting between the two.

He has been putting in the hard work with coach Andy Murray in the past few weeks with the main focus on the physical side of things.

Djokovic, though, admits that motivation is sometimes lacking during practice, but that is where Murray comes into the picture.

“The priority for us is always trying to approach the training session with the right kind of mentality – it's not always easy,” Djokovic added.

“Some days I feel excited and really motivated, some days less. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy.

“Then it's obviously about specific elements in the game with certain shots that are happening in a certain pattern for days or weeks already.

“It's really a combination of things, I would say. As we are coming closer and closer to the first match, we're working on more of the specifics to fine-tune the game. To be ready to play points and matches, not just from the game standpoint but also mentally and emotionally.

“The first four or five days of being here was more about the physical aspect of trying to build the endurance and strength and get a feel for the different conditions that are here.

“It's high altitude, so the ball is flying and it takes some time to get used to it. Things are going in the right direction. Obviously, that it's not a guarantee that I'll play very well in the match, but we're generally happy with where we're going.”

Tennis legend Björn Borg has long been a symbol of stoic brilliance on the court, but in a rare moment of introspection, the Swedish icon recently shared the deeply personal reasons that led to his early departure from professional tennis. Known for his calm demeanor and incredible success—11 Grand Slam titles, including six at Roland Garros and five consecutive Wimbledon crowns—Borg's retirement at the age of just 26 shocked the sporting world.

In his own words, Borg revealed that the constant spotlight became overwhelming. “I think if you lose motivation, because in my time, few years ago or many years ago,” said Bjorn Borg with a chuckle. “If I go somewhere I could not be by myself. I had the media, the photographers-I could not be myself- to be private, to feel good about life in that way”, said Bjorn Borg to the media at the Madrid Open

For Borg, the tennis court remained the only place where he felt a sense of solitude and control. “The only time when I felt really good was when I went to the court, the tennis court,” he said. “I was by myself, no one disturbing me. That was satisfaction for me.”

“And I think I'm Swedish to be private, but for me it's more important to have a life, to feel good,” continued Borg. “But I'm very satisfied with what I did in tennis. Very Very happy.”

His career may have been brief, but it was glorious and his legacy remains etched in history as one of the sport's greatest champions, and a master of multiple surfaces.

World No 5 Novak Djokovic chats to Sky Sports in Spain ahead of the Madrid Open, touching on his aims for 2025 and his coaching relationship with Andy Murray; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Novak Djokovic has told Sky Sports his priority working with Andy Murray as his coach is to peak for the French Open and Wimbledon, following a disappointing couple of months. 

The 37-year-old will play at the Madrid Open this week for the first time since 2022, live on Sky Sports Tennis, looking to rebound from a shock opening-round exit in Monte-Carlo earlier this month to Alejandro Tabilo.

That defeat followed a loss in the Miami Open final to Jakub Mensik, denying Djokovic a chance at securing his 100th tour-level title.

The 40-time ATP Masters 1000 champion remains on the brink of joining Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books, but admitted his priority after performances in recent years is to peak for the Grand Slams.

"The priority is obviously trying to take the level of tennis that currently is maybe not where we want it to be to the higher level, so that I can peak at French Open," Djokovic told Sky Sports in Madrid.

"That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

"If I can reach that desired level this tournament, that would be amazing. I don't have really high expectations and I really hope I can get through the first hurdle and then we'll take it from there."

Britain's Murray has formed part of Djokovic's coaching team since November, with the Serbian revealing the Scot plays a major role in managing his motivation for training, and that both are happy with the arrangement at the moment.

"The priority for us is always trying to approach the training session with the right kind of mentality - it's not always easy," Djokovic added.

"Some days I feel excited and really motivated, some days less. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy.

"Then it's obviously about specific elements in the game with certain shots that are happening in a certain pattern for days or weeks already.

"It's really a combination of things, I would say. As we are coming closer and closer to the first match, we're working on more of the specifics to fine tune the game. To be ready to play points and matches, not just from the game standpoint but also mentally and emotionally.

World No 5 Novak Djokovic chats to Sky Sports in Spain ahead of the Madrid Open, touching on his aims for 2025 and his coaching relationship with Andy Murray; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Novak Djokovic has told Sky Sports his priority working with Andy Murray as his coach is to peak for the French Open and Wimbledon, following a disappointing couple of months. 

The 37-year-old will play at the Madrid Open this week for the first time since 2022, live on Sky Sports Tennis, looking to rebound from a shock opening-round exit in Monte-Carlo earlier this month to Alejandro Tabilo.

That defeat followed a loss in the Miami Open final to Jakub Mensik, denying Djokovic a chance at securing his 100th tour-level title.

The 40-time ATP Masters 1000 champion remains on the brink of joining Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) in the history books, but admitted his priority after performances in recent years is to peak for the Grand Slams.

"The priority is obviously trying to take the level of tennis that currently is maybe not where we want it to be to the higher level, so that I can peak at French Open," Djokovic told Sky Sports in Madrid.

"That's where I really want to play my best tennis, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

"Of course, we're in Madrid, we came in early. We're putting in a lot of hours in the court and in the gym, trying to perfect the body and the game and basically every aspect of my game to be a few per cent better than it was in the previous weeks.

"If I can reach that desired level this tournament, that would be amazing. I don't have really high expectations and I really hope I can get through the first hurdle and then we'll take it from there."

Britain's Murray has formed part of Djokovic's coaching team since November, with the Serbian revealing the Scot plays a major role in managing his motivation for training, and that both are happy with the arrangement at the moment.

"The priority for us is always trying to approach the training session with the right kind of mentality - it's not always easy," Djokovic added.

"Some days I feel excited and really motivated, some days less. He [Murray] as a coach also has to manage that, which is not always easy.

"Then it's obviously about specific elements in the game with certain shots that are happening in a certain pattern for days or weeks already.

"It's really a combination of things, I would say. As we are coming closer and closer to the first match, we're working on more of the specifics to fine tune the game. To be ready to play points and matches, not just from the game standpoint but also mentally and emotionally.

"The first four or five days of being here was more about the physical aspect of trying to build the endurance and strength and get a feel for the different conditions that are here.

"It's high altitude, so the ball is flying and it takes some time to get used to it. Things are going in the right direction. Obviously, that it's not a guarantee that I'll play very well in the match, but we're generally happy with where we're going."

World number one Aryna Sabalenka was beaten for the fourth time in the Porsche Grand Prix final on Monday when she fell 6-4, 6-1 to former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko and missed out on the sports car from the main sponsor yet again.

"I think you hate me now, you wanted the car so badly. You will get it another time," Ostakenko told Sabalenka in a light-hearted exchange.

Sabalenka said "enjoy your beautiful car" and quipped "I will order one now" after failing like in 2021 against Ash Barty, and 2022 and 2023 against Iga Swiatek, to claim the Porsche by winning the final of the star studded indoor clay court event in Stuttgart.

"Congrats Jelena you were the better player than me," Sabalenka added on a serious note after she found no answer against her 24th-ranked opponent and went down in 1 hour 25 minutes.

Ostapenko broke Sabalenka in the opening game which set the tone, and was undeterred when Sabalenka tied at 4-4.

She went on to win eight of the remaining nine games and allowed Sabalenka a mere five points in the last five of them en route to victory with a return winner on first match point.

Ostapenko finished with 21 winners and just eight unforced errors.

It was Ostapenko's first win over Sabalenka in their fourth meeting, and a first clay court title for her since the surprise Roland Garros success in 2017.

The Latvian beat the two top ranked players in the world to get a ninth career title in what she named "an amazing week," having ousted second ranked triple French Open champion Swiatek in the quarter-finals.

For the first time in years, Juan Martín del Potro has acknowledged the possibility of returning to the ATP Tour—but not as a player. That chapter officially closed last December during his farewell match, where he was joined by tennis legends like Gabriela Sabatini and Novak Djokovic.

Interestingly, it's Djokovic who could entice del Potro back to the circuit. In a recent interview, the Argentine was asked about becoming the coach of the former World No. 1, and his response was surprisingly open.

“To be a coach, you need to dedicate yourself 100% and travel the world again. I did that for 20 years, and I'm tired. That said, if Novak asked me to work with him, it would make me very happy,” del Potro told Olympics. “I couldn't say no to him, but I don't think it will happen. The door isn't 100% closed, but I believe my time as a coach will come later”.

Currently, Djokovic's primary coach is Andy Murray, a retired tennis icon. This marks an intriguing difference between the two legends, who are both 37 years old and faced each other on some of the biggest stages in tennis history.

With 24 Grand Slam titles, Novak Djokovic holds the record for the most major wins in tennis history, ahead of Rafael Nadal's 22 and Roger Federer's 20. According to del Potro, that tally could still grow.

“I think winning a Grand Slam is something personal for him. He can win more. In terms of tennis, he's the best. He has so much experience. If he stays physically fit, he can handle it all and succeed,” del Potro said. “It would be great for tennis if he could win another, like when he claimed Olympic gold in Paris. As long as he's active, he's the best”.

Djokovic's most recent Grand Slam victory came at the 2023 US Open, a year in which he captured three of the four major titles, falling short only at Wimbledon. Since then, younger stars like Jannik Sinner (23) and Carlos Alcaraz (21) have claimed the subsequent five majors, though Djokovic reached the final of the 2024 Australian Open, a tournament he's won a record 10 times.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are two of the top players in the world right now, and given their young age, both have the potential to dominate the ATP Tour for years to come. However, US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro believes another star still holds the title of the best player in the game today.

“Djokovic is still playing. And for me, as long as he's active on the tour, he's the best,” Del Potro said in a recent interview with Olympics.com. “Tennis-wise, he's the best,” said the Argentine legend, who believes Nole still has the energy and talent to compete at the elite level and win major titles.

“He has so much experience, and if he's physically in good shape, for me, he's going to keep trying—and he just might do it,” said Juan Martin, who also speculated about Djokovic's main motivation to keep competing on the ATP Tour at 37: “I think he can still win more Grand Slams… Achieving that is something very personal for him.”

At the same time, the 2009 US Open winner made it clear he hopes to see Novak claim at least one more major title before retiring. “It would be something really beautiful for the tennis world if he wins again,” he said. “Like he did in Paris, winning the gold medal,” he added, referring to the 2024 Olympic Games.

Serbian superstar Novak Djokovic.

During his prime, Juan Martin Del Potro competed against Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray. That made his chances of reaching the top of the ATP rankings nearly impossible. “A lot of us played well, but they make a small difference in the smallest details,” he reflected.

“It's not just tennis—it's mentality, physicality, character, the way they handle pressure. And for many years they did it better than all of us, especially in key moments or at big tournaments,” added Juan Martin. “If they're playing at an 8 or 9 level on the tour, in Grand Slams they play at 10, and that's where we couldn't catch up because they are just that good.”

Novak Djokovic is the last remaining member of a generation of players that dominated its era. Now, many young talents are competing to take that mantle, including Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, and Del Potro weighed in on what the future may hold.

“It could be a good generation, but they're still very young and it's too early to say whether they'll be that good,” explained Juan Martin. “What's important is that they play really well and have the potential, but often potential and talent alone aren't enough. You need hard work, discipline, and good health.”

Finally, the Argentine legend spoke about how the retirement of the sport's biggest stars is creating opportunities for the next wave of talent. “Before, there were only six spots left in the Top 10 because the Big 4 was impossible to break,” he said. “Now that the Big 4, David Ferrer, Stan Wawrinka and I are no longer there, the Top 10 is changing a lot. There's a big opportunity for everyone.”

The French Open is quickly approaching as both the ATP and WTA Tours continue to gear up for the second major of the year.

Rafael Nadal will not be competing at Roland Garros in 2025, with it being the first year that the clay court major takes place since his retirement.

However, Nadal will receive a tribute from Roland Garros to commemorate his 14 record victories at the tournament this year.

While Nadal is now retired, his former rival Novak Djokovic is set to make his 21st appearance at Roland Garros this year.

However, an ATP player that has beaten Djokovic twice has taken to social media to provide an update on his own Roland Garros status that has been put in doubt.

Alejandro Tabilo has beaten Djokovic twice over the past year, with their most recent meeting coming on the clay of the Monte Carlo Masters.

However, after losing his subsequent match to Grigor Dimitrov, Tabilo revealed he had a bone edema in his left wrist.

This forced him to withdraw from the BMW Open, before Tabilo confirmed he would miss the Madrid Open as well.

Following this, there were reports that he had withdrawn from Roland Garros, but Tabilo has now responded to say that these rumors are false.

“Totally false that I won't be playing RG [Roland Garros] let alone aspire to rank protected,” Tabilo said on his Instagram story.

“That was never an option with my team, on the contrary, we're working hard to get to the next Grand Slam.

“Know to understand this moment, because this kind of fake news affects and hurts a lot. Thank you to those who continue to support me.”

Although Tabilo has confirmed he is still intending to play at Roland Garros, it is not yet clear whether he will play his scheduled tournaments in Aix-en-Provence and the Italian Open.

The current world number 35 will hope that he can recover in time, as he has 575 points from his success at these tournaments last year.

Tabilo won the Challenger tournament in Aix-en-Provence last year, before beating Djokovic en route to reaching the semi-finals at a Masters 1000 tournament for the first time in his career in Rome.

If he is unable to recover in time for these events, Tabilo could fall to outside the top 60 of the ATP rankings.

Tabilo has just days to recover in time for his first scheduled event, with the Aix-en-Provence Challenger beginning on Monday April 28.

The French Open is quickly approaching as both the ATP and WTA Tours continue to gear up for the second major of the year.

Rafael Nadal will not be competing at Roland Garros in 2025, with it being the first year that the clay court major takes place since his retirement.

However, Nadal will receive a tribute from Roland Garros to commemorate his 14 record victories at the tournament this year.

While Nadal is now retired, his former rival Novak Djokovic is set to make his 21st appearance at Roland Garros this year.

However, an ATP player that has beaten Djokovic twice has taken to social media to provide an update on his own Roland Garros status that has been put in doubt.

Alejandro Tabilo has beaten Djokovic twice over the past year, with their most recent meeting coming on the clay of the Monte Carlo Masters.

However, after losing his subsequent match to Grigor Dimitrov, Tabilo revealed he had a bone edema in his left wrist.

This forced him to withdraw from the BMW Open, before Tabilo confirmed he would miss the Madrid Open as well.

Following this, there were reports that he had withdrawn from Roland Garros, but Tabilo has now responded to say that these rumors are false.

“Totally false that I won't be playing RG [Roland Garros] let alone aspire to rank protected,” Tabilo said on his Instagram story.

“That was never an option with my team, on the contrary, we're working hard to get to the next Grand Slam.

“Know to understand this moment, because this kind of fake news affects and hurts a lot. Thank you to those who continue to support me.”

Although Tabilo has confirmed he is still intending to play at Roland Garros, it is not yet clear whether he will play his scheduled tournaments in Aix-en-Provence and the Italian Open.

The current world number 35 will hope that he can recover in time, as he has 575 points from his success at these tournaments last year.

Tabilo won the Challenger tournament in Aix-en-Provence last year, before beating Djokovic en route to reaching the semi-finals at a Masters 1000 tournament for the first time in his career in Rome.

If he is unable to recover in time for these events, Tabilo could fall to outside the top 60 of the ATP rankings.

Tabilo has just days to recover in time for his first scheduled event, with the Aix-en-Provence Challenger beginning on Monday April 28.

The fest opened on Thursday with a screening of ‘Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back' and a discussion with the filmmaker covering his work with Francis Ford Coppola and Yoda's speech patterns.

	The 2025 TCM Classic Film Festival kicked off with a screening of the 1980 hit Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, featuring a rare pre-movie discussion with director George Lucas.


	The Star Wars sequel, currently celebrating its 45-year anniversary, was the festival's opening night programming at Hollywood's TCL Chinese Theatre. TCM's primetime host Ben Mankiewicz led Lucas in a just over 30-minute conversation, touching upon a wide variety of topics.




	Fellow director Francis Ford Coppola, who's set to receive the AFI Life Achievement Award on Saturday, was a big topic of conversation throughout Lucas' remarks. Lucas is presenting Coppola with his AFI honor alongside Steven Spielberg, as Lucas and Coppola have a long history of friendship and collaboration. Lucas shared the pair's origin story throughout the conversation.

	Lucas and Coppola met working on the latter's 1968 film Finian's Rainbow, where Lucas was essentially interning at Warner Bros. after winning the Samuel Warner Scholarship. Lucas, who was 22 at the time, said it was “so boring” sitting on set, as he had no interest in making theatrical films, and he recalls a 27-year-old Coppola approaching him.

	“I'm watching you make a movie, but it's really boring. I don't want to make these kind of movies,” Lucas recalled telling Coppola when asked why he was on set, which kicked off a friendship and long partnership between the two. Lucas also shared the start of his San Francisco-based film production company American Zoetrope with Coppola, which they founded in late 1969. “We both didn't want to really be down here,” he said to a laughing crowd.


	Mankiewicz joked throughout as Lucas would continue talking about his work with Coppola instead of answering the question at hand. “I can't do 20 minutes with George Lucas,” he joked after expressing he was afraid he wouldn't get a question in about The Empire Strikes Back, or Star Wars in general. 


	Lucas did eventually venture into Star Wars territory, sharing the discussions he had with the film's studio, 20th Century Fox, around his contract. The director, who was coming off his Oscar-nominated film American Graffiti, said the studio was concerned he'd try to ask for more money. “I'm not going to do that here,” he recalled telling the studio. “I get the deal memo, I signed it. I'll do it for $50,000 [to] write, direct, produce.”

	











	“I do want the sequels because I've already got ‘em, and the standard practice in film is called indentured servitude. In order for your film to get off the ground you have to sign for two or three other movies. And I didn't want that to happen because it didn't happen on American Graffiti,” he added. Lucas said he told the studio he wanted to make the sequels no matter what the outcome of the first movie was.


	“Beside that, I'd like licensing,” he remembers telling the studio. Lucas said the studio talked about it and decided that they'd give them to him because there's no way he'd make a profit from it.

	Lucas also spoke about Yoda, one of Empire Strikes Back's most notable additions to the Stars Wars universe, and his distinctive way of speaking. “It was done purposely because if you [are] speaking regular English, people don't listen that much. But if you have an accent or it's really hard to understand what he's saying, they focus on what he's saying,” the director explained.


	“He was basically the philosopher of the movie, so [he had] longer talking scenes, where I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen,” Lucas said. “Especially 12 year olds.” 


	The TCM Classic Film Festival crowd was treated to a big screen viewing of The Empire Strikes Back following Lucas' remarks. The festival runs through April 27 with viewings around Hollywood.

EXCLUSIVE: Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) has joined Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Phoebe Dynevor in horror Pendulum, which is now underway in New Mexico.


	Darren Aronofsky is producing for Protozoa and Black Swan scribe Mark Heyman is directing. 


	Also producing are Jacob Jaffke (MaXXXine) and Élan Klein Jaffke for Motel Mojave and Dave Caplan (Longlegs) for C2, which will also fully finance. Black Bear is handling international sales and will continue shopping the project at the Cannes market. UTA Independent Film Group, CAA Media Finance, and WME Independent hold domestic rights. 

	











	Described as a “terrifying new genre film”, Pendulum follows young couple Patrick (Gordon-Levitt) and Abigail (Dynevor) on a journey to a new-age retreat in New Mexico, drawn by the possibility of healing after a traumatic event. Patrick is willing to do anything to help his wife but becomes distrustful of the retreat's enigmatic leader even as Abigail falls under her spell. As paranoia builds, the couple must determine if the group's unconventional spiritual practices offer genuine healing or mask a terrifying truth that threatens to consume them both. Reedus will play the couple's friend who introduces them to the retreat.

	Reedus' casting in the movie explains his absence from this week's Canneseries event in France where he was due to serve as head of the jury.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar nominee Jesse Plemons has been cast as Plutarch Heavensbee in Lionsgate's The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping, its adaptation of the bestselling book by Suzanne Collins. He joins  a cast that already features Joseph Zada As Haymitch Abernathy, Whitney Peak As Lenore Dove Baird and Mckenna Grace as Maysilee Donner.


	A future Head Gamemaker and rebellion leader, Plutarch Heavensbee was previously played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman; his performances in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Parts 1 and 2 were his final film roles. Sunrise on the Reaping opens with the young Plutarch Heavensbee in District 12, capturing the reaping of the Tributes there.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Sunrise on the Reaping sold 1.5 million copies in its first week on sale in the U.S., UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand after it hit shelves in March. The 1.2 million copies sold in its first week in the U.S. are twice the first-week sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and three times those of Mockingjay.


Sunrise on the Reaping revisits the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.


	The film adaptation of The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will be released on November 20, 2026. Francis Lawrence will direct from a screenplay adaptation by Billy Ray. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will produce. Cameron MacConomy will executive produce. The five films in the franchise have taken in over $3.3 billion at the box office.


	Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien are overseeing the project for Lionsgate. Phil Strina negotiated the deal for the studio.


	“Jesse is one of the most talented actors of his generation, with a proven record of picking his roles selectively,” said Erin Westerman, co-president, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “We are honored that he has chosen to bring his own take to one of the most fascinating figures in Panem, and feel that his previous collaboration with Philip Seymour Hoffman makes it all the more special. His Plutarch will be both a tribute to the character fans have already come to know and a portrayal he makes his own. We can't wait for audiences to see it.”

	











	Added producer Jacobson of Color Force, “Jesse has been one of my favorite actors since I first saw him in ‘Friday Night Lights.' We knew from the start that only an actor's actor could play a young version of Plutarch. Jesse was the dream from the start and we couldn't be prouder to have him join the Hunger Games family.”


	Plemons was most recently seen in the Netflix series Zero Day opposite Robert De Niro. Other past credits include being nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in The Power of the Dog, Kinds of Kindness and Killers of the Flower Moon. His upcoming credits include a reteaming with Yorgos Lanthimos in Bugonia and a role in an untitled film from director Alejandro G. Iñárritu.


	He is represented by TalentWorks and Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof and Fishman.

The '30 Rock' star returns to TV with an eight-episode adaptation of Alan Alda's 1981 rom-com.


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	After largely writing and producing for the past few years, Tina Fey is back onscreen, this time headlining new Netflix series The Four Seasons.


The show is an eight-episode remake of the 1981 rom-com of the same name, directed by Alan Alda and starring Alda, Carol Burnett and Rita Moreno. Fey — who also served as the series' co-creator — has loved the movie since she was 11, and “that was so thrilling to me as a kid, to see these people I love from other things come together. I thought, ‘Oh, could I assemble an ensemble like that?'” she told The Hollywood Reporter at the Los Angeles premiere on Thursday.

	“And also not going to lie, there are some of the practicalities of it of like, oh my god, what if it's just six or seven actors in nice locations, wearing flat shoes and sweaters — could we get away with it?” she continued, confirming she followed “the Sandler model,” with Adam Sandler often filming with his friends in vacation destinations.

	Fey has had a longtime relationship with Alda after he appeared on 30 Rock, and she “expressed to him that I loved the movie and wanted to pursue remaking it. I think he was amused and surprised that as a little kid I watched this movie,” she added, with Alda also making a cameo appearance in the series.

Steve Carell, Colman Domingo, Will Forte, Marco Calvani and Kerri Kenney-Silver star alongside Fey in the show, as she joked that when it came to casting, she was looking for “people who are happy to be there and know their lines — there's nothing better.”  


	Carell was “the first person that I called because from the moment we talked about doing this,” Fey said, after the two had worked together on 2010 comedy Date Night. His character Nick “makes some obnoxious-seeming choices in this show but you have to have an actor that you love him through it, that you see the human inside these choices that could make you mad. And Steve is that guy,” calling him “the Jimmy Stewart of our generation” because of that ability.


The Four Seasons starts streaming May 1 on Netflix.

The actor stars in the Looney Tunes film, which was recently saved by Ketchup Entertainment after being scrapped by Warner Bros. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	A few weeks after Coyote vs. Acme was officially saved by Ketchup Entertainment and is headed to theaters, star Will Forte is still in shock. 


	The Looney Tunes film, featuring Forte and John Cena opposite an animated Wile E. Coyote, became the most talked about movie in Hollywood in late 2023 when The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Warner Bros. intended to scrap the movie as part of a $115 million writedown. It appeared it would never be released, but a social media campaign to save the project helped lead to an acquisition deal between Ketchup and Warners for the worldwide rights.

	At the Los Angeles premiere of his new show The Four Seasons on Thursday, Forte told THR that “words cannot describe” how he's feeling about the movie's changed fate.

	“I never thought it would happen so it just came out of nowhere and I'm so thrilled,” he said. “Thank you Ketchup Entertainment, I'm so excited for people to see this movie. I'm gonna promote the crap out of it, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll go, I'll do whatever — go to the top of Mount Everest, I'm there.” 


	Forte had previously been vocal about the shelving, telling MovieWeb earlier this year, “My thoughts were that it's a fucking bullshit,” before adding, “It is such a delightful movie. It deserves so much better … I can't tell you possibly why the decision was made to not release it, but it makes my blood boil.”  


	The film — directed by Dave Green and produced by Chris deFaria and James Gunn — does not yet have a release date.

When “American Idol” judges Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie delivered their decision on which four contestants would round out the top 14 on April 21, 2025, Baylee Littrell did not make the cut after performing John Legend's “All of Me.”

That was a shocker for lots of Backstreet Boys fans who've been cheering on the son of BSB member Brian Littrell since he confirmed his 22-year-old son had auditioned. Baylee made it all the way to the top 20, but both Underwood and Bryan acknowledged that his elimination is likely tough on his dad and his fans. 

A post shared by Baylee Littrell (@bayleelittrell_music)

Moments after the top 14 was finalized, Underwood acknowledged to “Entertainment Tonight” that she was aware Brian, who attended and even sang during his son's audition, was likely a bit upset with the judges over their decision. 

When the outlet asked Underwood about him possibly being upset, she replied, “Um, don't think it didn't cross my mind!” 

Bryan also weighed in, telling “ET” that “there may be a Backstreet Boy that's a little disappointed, and a lot of Backstreet Boy fans.” 

Baylee, meanwhile, told “ET” after he got cut, “It's been a very long journey, a lot of pre-judgment, and now, uh, these guys gave me my chance. Just blessed to be here. Backstreet's back.” 

Though Baylee received tons of support from BSB fans, he also faced a great deal of criticism from “Idol” viewers who labeled him a “nepo baby,” riding on the coattails of his famous dad. 

Baylee's famous dad responded to his son's April 22 Instagram post about being cut from the competition, writing, “Bubba I am and always will be in your corner. You'd are so strong and so very talented, and inspire me every day. It's never the end, only the beginning for so many to be blessed by your gifts….. you killed it last night. 🔥❤️”

Brian's wife, Leighanne Littrell, also weighed in on their son's post, disappointed that “Idol” didn't upload his final performance to its social media pages. 

“I wish they would have posted last nights performance,” she wrote. “You killed it bubba! SO SO VERY PROUD! You are a true artist, no bells and whistles needed! Keep on keepin on! I can't wait for what's to come!”

Another Backstreet Boy, Kevin Richardson, wrote on Baylee's post, “So glad you got to experience this. Proud of you young man. Your journey has just begun… ❤️”

BSB fans also flooded Baylee's post with support, including one who wrote, “So proud of you Baylee! It got your name and music out for the world to see! 😍 You killed it! Here's to much success and more music! 😍”

Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said.

In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen.

“I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. “No matter what happens with PK and I, he's always been my best friend, my husband, we're family. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.”

A post shared by PK (@paul_kemsley_pk)

In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began.

Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. But when he was invited to attend the reunion taping, he declined and sent a statement instead.

Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion.

“I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com.

“Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. “That statement is both heartbreaking and false. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.”

“Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. “Many have wanted to speak out, but I have asked them not to because the truth should never need a champion. I refused to stoke a fire I did not ignite. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. That woman embodied kindness, integrity, and grace. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.”

A post shared by Dorit Kemsley (@doritkemsley)

PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. Am I correct?” Dorit responded that she was wrong.

In a confessional, Kemsley explained, “There are times that I think PK's the greatest father in the world. But is he the most hands-on father? The truth is, no. He would disappear and be gone for weeks and weeks without even calling the kids. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.”

Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. She explained that her comment came as she was still reeling from a multi-page email her ex had sent her.

Speaking with Rollacoaster, Kemsley said she never wants to go  “toe to toe” with PK.

“I know his feelings about what I had said in the moment about him not being a great dad, I not only apologized to him, but I – in my confessional and in the after show – immediately took it back and explained that this is after a couple of months of not speaking, I was really worried about the kids,” she explained. “I felt very, very bad. It was in a weak, vulnerable moment after a seven-page vicious email. You can only take the high road for so long.”

While her marital problems are still being sorted out, Kemsley said she is looking forward to her next chapter. “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.

Last Thursday night, moviegoers across this godforsaken land rabidly made their way to the nearest multiplex — or pilgrimaging across state lines to the closest theater capable of projecting 15-Perf IMAX 70mm film — in order to see early screenings of the first original blockbuster from a gifted filmmaker whose fame has been predicated upon his ability to put a strong personal stamp on increasingly generic Hollywood franchises.

At that very same time, halfway around the world, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and chief creative officer Dave Filoni took the stage at Star Wars Celebration 2025 in Chiba, Japan to announce that the next chapter of cinema's most iconic saga would be directed by a filmmaker whose fame has been predicated upon his ability to be friends with Ryan Reynolds.

The movie business has always been held aloft by the tension between genuine pop artistry and mass-produced slop, two separate but hopelessly entwined ambitions that have proven even harder to balance than the Force. While both have their value, those values are in a constant state of flux, and they can only be determined with any real accuracy by measuring the difference between them. 

Seldom has that difference ever seemed more dramatic than it did at the fateful moment when “Sinners” mania overlapped with the reveal of “Star Wars: Starfighter.” 

On the one hand, you have an ultra-personal multiplex event that could not and would not have been made by anyone else — a music-driven genre mash-up that reworks age-old vampire tropes into a fresh, thoughtful, and deliciously hot-blooded period saga rooted in the specifics of Black history. On the other hand, you have a nakedly anonymous attempt to salvage a franchise that produced one of the most radical legacy sequels in the history of that concept, only to spend the last eight years selling itself out to the lowest common denominator in a futile bid for forgiveness. 

While “Sinners” was offering one audience something they had never seen before, “Star Wars: Starfighter” was pitching a different audience a movie so generic and familiar that even its title sounds like it's repeating itself. 

Of course, “Sinners” has the advantage of being a finished product that people have seen and loved, whereas “Star Wars: Starfighter” is still just a graphic designed to rile up the fanbase and appease whatever portion of Disney shareholders have already forgotten the great “Lightyear” debacle of 2022. (Just to be clear, this isn't Starfighter the ship. This is the origin story of the human Starfighter that the ship is based on.) And, while anything's possible, I'm not suggesting that Coogler's movie will ultimately outgross the first “Star Wars” feature that promises to pick up from the saga where “Episode IX” left off. 

 










All the same, the enthusiasm gap between these two projects — the reality of one, and the promise of another — has been tellingly immense. So far as the national water cooler is concerned, “Sinners” has ousted the Chicken Jockey as the biggest film story of the year, and stoked the rare kind of excitement that leads to $8.6 million Tuesdays and people scalping IMAX tickets on eBay. It's also cemented Coogler's status as a brand unto himself, and proved that Warner Bros. doesn't have to sell its soul to “A Minecraft Movie” in order to stave off financial ruin. Conversely, there may not be a single person on Earth who's more optimistic about the future of the galaxy far, far away now that a significant portion of its fate has been entrusted to the director of “The Adam Project.”

The serendipitous timing of these announcements was a bit on the nose. You couldn't have scripted a better way of confirming the reality that studios have been trying to prevent ever since they offered mid-budget movies as a blood sacrifice at the altar of mega-tentpole franchises: Mediocrity is losing its grip on the public imagination. (Cookie-cutter as “A Minecraft Movie” might have been in the end, I maintain that getting the “Napoleon Dynamite” guy to adapt a plotless video game about blocks was less of a slam-dunk than it seems, and the Chicken Jockey phenomenon speaks to a degree of novelty that was missing from recent short-fallers like “Captain America: Brave New World.”) 

 










I trust that Levy is a nice guy, and I suppose it's possible that the sheer gravity of “Star Wars” might inspire the “Free Guy” auteur to up his game (I'd entertain the argument that both “The Force Awakens” and “The Last Jedi” are the best movies their respective directors have ever made), but I'm not the only one who finds Disney's lack of faith in its signature IP disturbing, and I struggle to imagine that it will work out well for them. 

Levy's hiring only seems to deepen the sense that Jon Favreau's forthcoming “The Mandalorian and Grogu” — possibly the worst movie title I've heard since “Star Wars: Starfighter,” in addition to being an outgrowth of a TV show that lost most of its luster two seasons ago — isn't just a stop-gap to buy the franchise some time, but also a reflection of the studio's apprehensiveness to make any decisions it can't take back. 

But, as I recently wrote about in the context of Disney's “Thunderbolts*” trailer and what it means for the MCU to restyle itself in the vein of A24, “the future belongs to movies that people actively want to see,” and the decision to go with someone as flavorless as Levy reeks of the “let's coast off a love of the brand and not offend anyone” approach that simply doesn't work anymore.

 










I know that Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand weren't exactly the most idiosyncratic directors of their day either, but the second and third “Star Wars” movies didn't have to justify their own existences in the same way that “Starfighter” will; they didn't come out at a time when people could watch a variety of aggressively mid “Star Wars” TV shows from the comfort of their homes. 

And, not for nothing, but even the relative passivity of television isn't safe from the numbing glut of streaming content. Case in point: The buzz around “Starfighter” was immediately eclipsed by the electric reaction to the new season of “Andor,” which just so happens to be the only “Star Wars” project since “The Last Jedi” that defies expectations as to what its franchise can be and do.

“Sinners” isn't based on pre-existing IP, but its success depended upon a brand of a different kind. Not only is the film about pop art's power to preserve cultural memory as part of an intergenerational song of pain, hope, and the pursuit of freedom, it was sold on the strength of Ryan Coogler's self-evident passion for telling this particular story (a story whose origins trace back to his late uncle James, who once seeded the young filmmaker's imagination with vivid details about growing up in the Delta). 

 










Warner Bros. didn't hide the fact that audiences would get two Michael B. Jordans for the price of one, or that both of them would square off in a blues-soaked battle royale against a horde of white blood-suckers at the height of the Jim Crow South, but it's no accident that the most effective piece of marketing — by far — was a 10-minute Kodak video in which Coogler talked people through his new movie's various screening formats. 

Today's audiences have grown somewhat accustomed to the concept of shifting aspect ratios and the benefits of large-format theaters (every new Christopher Nolan film comes with its own infographic explaining the difference between IMAX, lieMAX, and the sub-human poverty of a standard DCP), but it something very different to see a cool young filmmaker so enthusiastically nerd out about the perforations on the side of an Ultra Panavision frame. Cutting between exclusive “Sinners” footage and film school-worthy clips of Coogler standing in front of the diagrams he'd drawn on a white board, the video went viral because it clearly illustrated how much this shit means to him, and how much attention he and his team paid to making the experience special for moviegoers. 

As the director said in a recent interview: “I want people walking out of the theater and thinking, ‘Man, I had a full meal. They really care about the medium.' Everybody on the project knew that this was going to theaters. They all care about seeing movies on the big screen and what it feels like when you see a good one.”

 










That enthusiasm proved contagious. You don't need to care about the difference between 2.76:1 and 1.90:1 to feel it in your bones when the screen widens during the film's climactic siege, and you sure as hell don't need to care about it in order to appreciate a director making so earnest an appeal to our attention at a time when most studio movies feel like they were made with the same casual indifference that audiences have been conditioned to watch them. 

While Coogler's first original project was always going to command a certain amount of hype, the decision to lead with its importance to him galvanized people around the notion that “Sinners” was more than just another movie they could watch at home in three weeks (rave reviews from basically every critic in the country didn't hurt either). 

It lay the groundwork for the film to feel like an event, it teed the film up to deliver on that promise, and it set the stage for audiences — especially Black audiences, who continue to be starved for mega-budget studio movies that provocatively engage with race as something more than a temporary branding initiative — to unpack the layers of its meaning on social media with a much greater degree of thought and wonder than the likes of “Snow White” or “The Amateur” managed to inspire. 

 










It's good that “Sinners” is great, but I tend to suspect that even a somewhat less successful version of the same film would have triggered a broadly similar response, which is to say that “Sinners” is sparking so much real excitement because it palpably came from such a real place. 

While it's not a coincidence that “Nope” was the last completely original movie to hit at this level (another self-aware spectacle that interrogated the blind spots of Black representation on screen, and will be dominating best of the decade lists in a few years' time), the fervor around “Sinners” also puts it in a category that Jordan Peele's creature feature shares with “Oppenheimer,” “Avatar,” and “Nosferatu.” 

Which is to say: Films that connected with audiences because they dared to emphasize an idiosyncratic creative vision over the safety of selling people on something they'd already seen before. Hollywood is soiling itself at the thought of a director (eventually) owning the rights to his work? Hollywood should be kissing Ryan Coogler's feet for creating a film that already feels like it belongs to him.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Marvel Comics and Marvel Studios are teaming on a Fantastic Four: First Steps comic which is launching on July 2. Here's why this is a big deal: It's the first time that the comics side and the studio side have worked together on a comic set in the world of a specific MCU movie. 


	Matt Fraction  (Hawkeye, Fantastic Four) wrote the Fantastic Four: First Steps comic with drawings by Mark Buckingham Fantastic Four, Fables)  and cover art by Phil Noto. It's a one-shot comic book that's published by Future Foundation. 


	The one-shot comic book is designed to be an artefact from the world of the upcoming movie and confirms a few things that fans have speculated about, including that The Fantastic Four: First Steps is not an origin story, but will pick up four years after they become heroes. Marvel Comics worked closely with filmmakers on the comics, pulling in the tone and feel of the pic's feel from production designer Kasra Farahani. Fraction and other talent from the comic even visited the set of the film.

	These superheroes are hugely significant to Marvel; the publication of The Fantastic Four in 1961 kicked off the Marvel Era in comics, and Marvel's First Family introduced what would later become hallmarks of Marvel storytelling: relatable characters with real, human drama.


	Marvel Comics Editor in Chief C.B. Cebulski said, “As Marvel's First Family, the Fantastic Four and their stories have always been at the very center of the Marvel Universe. With The Fantastic Four: First Steps coming later this summer, we at Marvel all felt this was the perfect opportunity to bring our teams together in honor of their legacy in both the world of the film and within our comics. It's been a blast to have our teams in Publishing and Studios bounce ideas back and forth to create something truly special and one-of-a-kind, and we can't wait for fans to be able to dive in to this comic—squarely in the world of the MCU—and experience the Fantastic Four like we've never seen before this summer.”

	











	He added, “The heart of Marvel has always stemmed from the comics, and Kevin and the team have been bringing those pages to life in extraordinary ways with each and every film. With this comic, we're bringing those two worlds together in a way we think fans will love.”

When Joe Apollonio, the 33-year-old New York internet comic with a wild coif of reddish hair, names River Phoenix as one of his favorite actors, it all makes sense. They have a similar countercultural vibe — not to mention fashionably unkempt hairstyle — and a hunger to take on roles that scare them, and often put their own autobiography front and center.

“I get shit sometimes from my friends for not watching certain movies,” Apollonio told IndieWire at a brewery in Bryant Park (though Apollonio is five years sober). “I would say that I'm a huge fan of River Phoenix's work and Gus Van Sant's work. And then also movies that Michael Pitt's been in the 2000s, like ‘The Dreamers.' I would say those are the two actors that I look up to the most. Interestingly enough, they're not comedians.”

Apollonio broke out from his long-running Instagram feed of quippy queer characters and outsize personalities with a solo show at Joe's Pub in New York's Noho in summer 2023, one that put his very close relationship with his single mom front and center. He now stars in his friend Amalia Ulman's quirky ethnocentricity satire “Magic Farm,” which premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, followed by Berlin, and opens from MUBI in theaters this Friday.

In it, he plays Justin, the flamboyantly gay cohort of a Vice Media-like documentary crew chasing an influencer in a small town in Argentina. Or, where they think is Argentina anyway, until they end up in the wrong South American country in a town also called San Cristobal. 

Apollonio grew up in the town of Babylon, Long Island, before moving to New York City after high school, training at Stella Adler and finding small roles on series like “Betty,” “Hacks,” and “Young Sheldon.”

“In ‘Hacks,' I played a circuit twink with Owen Thiele. It was just two scenes in one episode. ‘Betty,' I played a skater,” Apollonio, a longtime skateboarder himself, said. “Then, I did ‘Young Sheldon.' I played some angsty younger brother to Mandy, and it was fun. They turned that character into a main character on the spinoff of ‘Young Sheldon' [‘George and Mandy's First Marriage'], but they cast someone else.”

Was he disappointed? “At the time, yeah. Now, I'm over it. If I try to play the tape forward, being in something like ‘Magic Farm,' it's an edgy enough thing for me to still be myself with things that I create, and it makes sense because it's on par. It's under the same umbrella. To be in something that mainstream and just for nuclear families in middle America [like ‘Young Sheldon'], maybe I would have to censor myself and dilute myself down.”

 










Indeed, Apollonio makes his queerness the focal point of his Instagram comedy, where he has more than 14,000 followers and self-made video posts dating back a decade, often outré-costumed and hilariously, grotesquely Facetuned, dating back to 2014.

“I don't place as much value on [social media] as I used to,” he said. “I would say that's how it really started, and then I think where it's going to continue is stuff like this and taking my writing and putting it up on stage, or making longer-form videos or movies. Instagram is so oversaturated now with people who think that they're funny, and they can just make a joke about something going on in the zeitgeist. I don't really want any part of that. I want to make things that are valuable to me, and I also don't want to make a bunch of shit for no money and just have it completely sidelined in this thralling crazy pool of the comedy algorithm, so I'm kind of over it.”

Apollonio's solo show back at Joe's Pub more fully expressed his particular brand of comedy, which is often all about his closeness with his mom. “She had a knee replacement last year where I took care of her. It's kind of a vignette into what my life is going to look like at some point, which is a bit scary, but I can't be doing a cross-country move right now unless I have enough money to take her with me,” he said of the thought of moving to L.A. 

 










“The only relieving thing is everyone has to deal with this shit. She's a single mom, and I'm an only child. It's always been just us my entire life; no real semblance of blood family has been in the picture. It's just an added heaviness to it,” he added.

“She thinks my comedy is a little weird. I impersonate her sometimes. It's a central part of my work,” he said. “It's weird, though, because she's a Baby Boomer, and their notion of Hollywood and acting is far different from what it is now. I've been on TV and stuff, but she's always like, ‘When are you going to make it? I wish someone would just discover you.' That's not how it works, though.”

Argentine-born Spanish artist-turned-filmmaker Amalia Ulman — the director of 2021's “El Planeta,” also about an only child's too-closeness with their mother — has been good friends with Apollonio for a few years now, which made it easy to cast him in “Magic Farm” among an ensemble that includes Chloë Sevigny, Simon Rex, and Alex Wolff. “People thought Amalia and I were dating,” Apollonio said. “Maybe we look good together. I don't know.” (In real life, Apollonio is dating trans star Bianca Leigh, who stars on Broadway's “Oh, Mary!”)

That friendship eventually led to Chloë Sevigny, with whom Ulman had connected and whom Apollonio met at a Maison Margiela party before they got to work on the script with producer/filmmaker Eugene Kotlyarenko (a producer alongside Riccardo Maddalosso and Alex Hughes). That was not, in fact, the first time Apollonio had encountered the New York City icon.

 










“I was a barback at this place called Peel's in the Lower East Side. I was like 22, and she was sitting at a table and I had to pour her hot water into her tea, and I was so starstruck that my hands were shaking like fucking crazy as I'm pouring the hot water. She was just kind of looking down. I left the table and was like, ‘Wow, I fucking blew it.' I brought that up to Chloe. She didn't remember it,” he recalled.

Once production on “Magic Farm” got underway in 2023, “We were filming in this town called San Antonio de Areco, which is two hours northwest of Buenos Aires. People go there to vacation; it's kind of like a resort town. It's very small, a lot of horses, a lot of street dogs, a pretty desolate landscape. That's where we shot the whole movie. Then we shot some stuff in New York about a month or so afterward,” he said. “I don't speak Spanish, so any sort of broken horrible Spanish I would use to order food made me feel super American. I remember the first day I got there, I was feeling pretty good about myself. I was strutting down the street with my aviator glasses on, listening to music. I quickly got out of my own head and realized everyone was staring at me like an alien.”

While “Magic Farm” drummed up buzz at Sundance and then Berlin (“the Germans loved it”), Apollonio said, “I'm still waiting to see what will come from this,” though he's working on yet another personal project aimed for the stage. “I don't want to get too much into what it's about, but it's going to be another mother-and-son dynamic show, but it's going to be much more fictional and much more over-the-top and ridiculous,” he said.

 










One thing he's not doing any time soon, and one thing he has in common with his co-star Sevigny? He's not moving to Los Angeles. “I would need a swimming pool, and a really loving partner, which I do have right now, and a lot of money for me to enjoy L.A. I don't want to deal with the in-betweens of the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. It's excruciating enough to be between jobs. L.A. is really cool when you have something to do. I subletted there a few times, and you don't have anything going on and your friends are busy, it can get dark. And you're getting gaslit by the weather to be happy,” he said.

“Magic Farm” is now in theaters from MUBI.

	President Donald Trump is on the cusp of completing the first 100 days of his second presidency, and things are feeling a little more lawless than the first time around. The initial months of the second Trump presidency have been marked by his administration's attempts to force their agenda down to the gullet of the country, even if it means breaking the core founding principles of the nation in the process. 


	On Friday, Time magazine published an interview with Trump discussing his first 100 days, and the president wasn't convinced that the United States was a country run by laws, not by men. 


Time senior political correspondent Eric Cortellessa and editor-in-hief Sam Jacobs asked the president — who has redecorated the Oval Office to align with the gaudy gold-plated trappings of his golf clubs and penthouses — about a portrait he added of John Adams. 


	Adams once “we're a government ruled by laws, not by men,” the interviewers asked. “Do you agree with that?”

	Trump — who initially couldn't even remember where the painting was — wasn't so sure. 


	“We're a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law,” he responded. “So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100 percent. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me.” 


	Honest men like Trump — who are already exploring ways to bend laws to their benefit. Earlier in the interview, Trump teased to Time that while he didn't know anything about the possibility of serving a third term, people were begging him to and he knew of options to make it happen. “There are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes,” Trump claimed, adding that he's being “inundated with requests” to serve a third term.

	But if Trump wants to claim that he doesn't believe in the exploitation of loopholes, the evidence is stacked against him. Particularly on matters of immigration. The president and his advisers have gone to great pains to reinterpret centuries-old wartime powers like the Alien Enemies Act to conduct mass deportations without due process for migrants, dumped hundreds of men in brutal prisons in El Salvador without trial or conviction, and defied the federal courts at every turn. 

	











	When asked about the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador, and whose return to the United States the Trump administration was ordered to “facilitate” by the Supreme Court — the president didn't want to talk about it. He told Time that he wasn't in charge of complying with the court's orders or making the decision to secure Abrego Garcia's return. “I leave that to my lawyers,” he said. 


	When pressed, the president added that he hadn't requested that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele return Abrego Garcia because Bukele had “said he wouldn't,” and repeated spurious accusations that Abrego Garcia was a violent gang member belonging to MS-13.

	Trump then stated that he was still open to the possibility of deporting American citizens to foreign prisons. “I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases,” he said. “If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law.” 


	Donald Trump occupies the most powerful political office in the country, and the world. While John Adams may have said that the United States is a land of laws, it may only take the work and will of one man to dismantle them.

L
ike all good children of immigrants, Charlene Kaye greets me with a gift. The shirt is emblazoned with neon-pink lightning, the title of her comedy show, Tiger Daughter, in a Def Leppard font, and a collage of images — including a photo of her mother, Lily, well, naked as the day she was born.


	“These are nude portraits that my mother made of herself. This is my mother's shadow looming over me,” Kaye explains, dragging her nails over the collage. “When I was making this, it was so funny, because it occurred to me how similar we are. Oh! And this is us both showing our ass, because it runs in the family.”


Tiger Daughter: Or, How I Brought My Immigrant Mother Ultimate Shame slots neatly into the trend of storytelling that fuses comedy and personal testimony. Previous big-name entries, like Jerrod Carmichael's Rothaniel and Mike Birbiglia's The Good Life, have mastered the formula. Kaye's version, if the full title isn't clear enough, has a familiar outline: First-gen immigrants become parents in the West, hoping their sacrifices will be rewarded with a doctor or lawyer child; child goes another way; conflict ensues. Over the course of about 60 minutes, Kaye uses photos of her and her mom, as well as real texts between them, blown up and projected behind her onstage, to chart her life and career milestones and her mother's response to them. Ultimately, she tries to answer the question of whether you can truly love someone without ever fully understanding them. It's a PowerPoint presentation that plops the crowd directly into Kaye's inner turmoil and asks if they relate. And based on the applause she receives at the end, it seems they do.

	











	“Everyone has disappointed their parents in some way,” Kaye tells me, one hand lazily stirring her coffee at a cafe in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood. “You're never gonna be that ideal. You have to figure that out for yourself.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The vast majority of people who've heard of Kaye know her not from Tiger Daughter but from the wildly popular music parodies she puts out online. Think “Every Chappell Roan Song” and “Every Charli XCX Song” — affectionate riffs that poke fun at an artist's musical and lyrical tendencies while celebrating their work all the same. (The Taylor Swift one has more than a million views.) But the reason she's so adept at breaking down what other musicians do is that she is one herself — a really, really good one.

	Kaye's Mad Libs CV goes something like this: While attending the University of Michigan, the classically trained piano and guitar player toured with Team StarKid, the musical theater troupe that shot to internet stardom in 2009 with its viral Harry Potter musical parody, A Very Potter Musical. After, she released solo pop-rock music under the moniker KAYE (the surname of her step­father, Marty). There were also the five years she fronted the indie-rock band San Fermin, where, she says, she evolved into an “outrageous, ballsy performer.” She did her solo work on the side, singer-songwriter stuff she calls “very deep and dark and earnest.”


	“I wanted to be a Mitski or Phoebe Bridgers,” Kaye says. “But it wasn't taking off. Music is so youth- and beauty-obsessed. That's something I got tired of, because I feel like the music industry tries to keep you 25 forever.”


	All along, Kaye's internet presence grew, especially as she showed off more of her comic instincts. In 2022, she posted the first video in her now-legendary Guitar Center series, where she grabs merchandise off the wall and, in her words, “terrorizes” male employees and shoppers by purposely butchering popular riffs, like the opening notes of “Smoke on the Water” or “Sweet Child O' Mine.” In some clips, a man approaches and corrects her. “Rock music is such a boys' club,” Kaye says. “I want to just take it down in seriousness.”

	The irony, as some commenters on those posts have pointed out, is the amount of music theory and technical know-how you'd have to have to fuck up these songs just so. At 38, all of Kaye's intensive musical training has led her to a completely new sphere of entertainment. “I'm a total music-head, and it's probably why I've had a lot of success in the short-form comedy space,” she says. “Because I understand the tropes of different artists, so I'm able to map it out academically in this way that's very satisfying to me. And it turns out, it's satisfying to others as well.”


	One of those fans is the trailblazing comedian Margaret Cho, who found Kaye through TikTok and has since become “obsessed.” Last fall, Cho launched a yearlong residency as a curator at the iconic New York venue Joe's Pub with Kaye's show. “She's an absolute rock star! She shreds!” Cho tells Rolling Stone in an email. “She's a captivating performer, hilarious and exciting to watch! [Tiger Daughter] is a show that's been a long time coming.”

	











	Kaye traces her love of comedy to the stars of her youth — Tenacious D, Flight of the Conchords, Adam Sandler — “basically just a bunch of funny white dudes” she and her sister enjoyed watching as kids growing up in Arizona. Back then, comedy, and even theater, felt like a club she was on the outside of because she was Asian American. “I auditioned for Peter Pan when I was in third grade, and I got cast as an Indian,” she says. “The same thing happened to my sister, and I internalized that as there are no roles for me.”


	But performing was in her blood. As Kaye discusses in Tiger Daughter, her mother — who clearly has a dramatic flair, and her own signature rock & roll style — entered the biggest reality-show singing competition in Singapore three times; twice she placed second. When her mom signed up Kaye for all kinds of musical lessons, it activated that performer's DNA.


	Playing guitar from a young age “taught me how to connect and to be bodily aware of myself on a stage,” Kaye says. The StarKid years took that stage presence to a whole other level. “If you were on Tumblr in 2012, and if you were a Harry Potter fan or a Glee fan, then you were hysterical about this,” she says, running her hands through her candy-apple-red-streaked hair. “The venue capacities [were] thousands and thousands of people, and the fans were frightening. One girl showed up and she had the signatures of all seven StarKids on the tour tattooed on her calves, wrapped in plastic and bleeding. We had one girl who faked a seizure at the VIP meet and greet so that one of the guys would catch her. Later she tweeted, ‘best seizure ever.'”


	During the pandemic, Kaye took acting classes at a studio that specializes in the Meisner technique, a practice that prioritizes the emotion in a performance (and performer) over the words. When a classmate invited her to join a theatrical showcase, she turned a Google doc of “all the crazy shit” her mom has done into the skeleton of a show. “I didn't have experience doing stand-up,” Kaye says. “It was just this very specific story I had. That was my segue.”


Tiger Daughter traces Lily's antics, like asking her daughter to urgently Photoshop her face onto other women's bodies. It also includes painful moments that bring the audience to a hush, such as Kaye's discovery of an interview her mother had given calling Charlene a “spoiled and entitled” disappointment who brought the memory of her late father Marty shame. Kaye acknowledges in the show the hardships her mother faced as a young woman in Singapore: food scarcity, poverty, and the dream of being a famous singer that never materialized. This dream, abandoned in Lily's life but pursued by her daughter, is at the core of their push-pull relationship.

	











	“Perfection has always been a form of safety for me. If I didn't achieve then I was afraid I'd be loved less,” Kaye says. “How can I possibly repay [my parents] for the monumental sacrifices they made? Is it selfish to pursue my own joys, even if they are kind of outrageous? How do I choose myself over and over again if it's hurting somebody else?”

Tiger Daughter — which Kaye recently toured in Melbourne, Australia — doesn't pretend to have answers. Instead, Kaye rehashes every hurt, fight, deranged Whats­App request, and crying voicemail onstage, in the hopes that sharing it with an audience will bring her closer to some form of healing.


	In the meantime, she's keeping the musical comedy coming. She's started a femme Radiohead cover band called Labiahead, and has ideas for plenty more sex-pun bands. (These include “Sister of a Down,” “Limp Biz Clit,” and “Twink-182,” which she says should only be made up of gay artists.) And if, even after pouring her heart out night after night for years, she's still best known for her parodies, she's OK with that. “The irony is that now I'm doing Tiger Daughter, but when I get stopped on the street, it's because I'm the Taylor Swift girl from TikTok,” Kaye says. “Which is hilarious. That's my legacy.”

	Capping a week of earnings calls with CEOs in many industries slashing forecasts and warning of dire impact from Donald Trump‘s tariffs, Charter Communications‘ Chris Winfrey advanced a different view.


	Speaking to Wall Street analysts on the company's first-quarter call Friday morning, Winfrey characterized the tariffs in favorable terms, though he gestured to the uncertainty gripping corporate America.


	“Charter's an American company offering services to more than 57 million U.S. families and businesses,” he explained about the Stamford, CT-based provider of Spectrum broadband and pay-TV. “We have a 100% U.S.-based workforce, so naturally our preference is to buy American-made products when they're available and when they're priced competitively.”

	He continued, “Saying the obvious, tariff imbalances are by definition unfair. Clearly, President Trump has taken a strong stand that, at least from the outside, it appears to be creating an important opportunity for other countries to lower their tariffs and eliminate trade barriers and, from our perspective, to benefit U.S. workers like ours and our U.S.-based customers. But again, stating the obvious, we hope it can all happen soon and we're hoping that's the case.”

	CFO Jessica Fischer addressed how the tariffs would factor into Charter's financial outlook. “I don't expect tariffs to have a meaningful overall impact on our capital expenditures,” she said, noting that the company has reiterated its guidance of $12 billion in spending “even including what we expect for the impact of tariffs today.”


	CEOs at Procter & Gamble, American Airlines and PepsiCo have told analysts in recent days that the on-again/off-again tariffs are rattling consumers and making it difficult for companies to plan. Media companies have been decidedly more sanguine, with Comcast, Imax, TelevisaUnivision and Netflix all indicating few concerns as of now.


	Winfrey was CFO of Charter when Trump was elected for his first term in 2016. The following year, after he was inaugurated, former CEO Tom Rutledge visited the White House to announce the company's commitment to $25 billion in spending on broadband infrastructure. 


	“They created a culture of customer service and excellence,” Trump said during the Oval Office meeting with Rutledge and other officials. “Most importantly, they brought back many jobs that had been shipped overseas, something that is happening far too often. But we're changing that.”

	











	Charter stock rose 8% in early trading Friday on the company's earnings report, which included better-than-expected total revenue of $13.74 billion. The company shed 60,000 internet customers in the January-to-March period, partly due to the L.A. wildfires. It also saw a decline of 181,000 video customers, which was a marked improvement from the prior-year quarter's loss of 405,000. Winfrey and Fischer cited the benefits of integrating streaming services like Max, Disney+ and Peacock into Spectrum plans, pegging the net value per month to customers at upwards of $80.


	The bottom line was a blemish on the quarterly numbers. Earnings per share came in at $8.42 per share, well below the compared with consensus outlook by analysts of $8.69.


	Media companies thus far have insisted they are not vulnerable to the tariffs, which were ramped up significantly after the March 31 end of the first quarter. Comcast execs on Thursday said they have not seen any impact in their theme park or ad businesses. Tech companies will report earnings next week, notably Apple next Thursday. With China leading the list of countries with which the U.S. has escalated trade conflict, investors are eagerly awaiting the views of Apple CEO Tim Cook and other CEOs.

	It's not easy being a woman streamer, and the last few months have made it even harder. Social media accounts that target and denigrate high-profile Twitch streamers (who are often women or people of color) were once relegated to the more obscure corners of the internet; now they're pushed to the top of the X algorithm. In March, three high-profile women streamers were stalked while streaming at the Santa Monica Pier, igniting a conversation about the dangers and difficulties of being so visible in a world increasingly dominated by misogyny. 


Imane “Pokimane” Anys and Leslie “Fuslie” Fu are two wildly popular Twitch streamers (with 9.4 million and 1.2 million followers, respectively) who are both women of color and got their starts streaming Riot Games' multiplayer online battle arena, League of Legends. For them, existence is an act of resistance, and success is a sign that they have overcome the odds stacked against them — their Twitch streams never delve into drama content or rage bait, offering instead a steady flow of sweetness, like a content chocolate fountain. 

	











	With nearly 10 million followers on Twitch, 6 million on Instagram, and a spot on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, Imane “Pokimane” Anys is the most successful female Twitch streamer ever. She's been creating content for over a decade and leveraged her success to start a talent management and brand consulting firm (RTS) and a healthy snack line called Myna. Speaking with Anys, it's clear that the 28-year-old has had some impressive media training — she is bright, peppy, and positive for most of our chat, effortlessly threading the needle between addressing the issues women streamers face and preaching positivity.

	She compliments other female streamers who have supported her journey, discusses how she finds a happy medium when expressing herself on streams, and brings up Hazelight Studios' co-op game, Split Fiction (which both she and Fu have played on their streams to promote the game's limited-time Friend Edition). As for attempts by the more reactionary corners of the internet to label the game “woke” because of its two female protagonists, named after Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares' daughters? Anys calls the entire ordeal “kooky beans.”

	“If that was on Twitter, I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes people just be saying stuff,” she says cheerily. “But I freakin' love that Josef felt comfortable to express his thoughts in regard to this. I can only imagine the pressure on any developer or any game company in responding to comments like that. So, I really appreciate that he was so outspoken about it.”


	Outspokenness is not often appreciated online, especially when the person speaking is a woman of color (even if that woman is as Disney-Princess-sweet as Anys). Couple that with the increased visibility of Twitch streaming, which can (and has) resulted in truly scary situations, like the man who accosted Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter, Brittany “Cinna” Watts, and Emily “Emiru” Schunk during an IRL livestream in March. It's easy to wonder if Anys has ever felt overwhelmed by it all. 


	“There are moments where I was like, ‘This is a lot, but I can feel the support of people online and in my close circle, that makes me feel like I can overcome this,'” Anys says. “As crazy as it might sound, I felt like I had no choice but to overcome those difficult moments, especially because I had certain financial goals in terms of taking care of my parents or repaying them for their sacrifices, or wanting to achieve something. It felt like, yeah, this might suck, but what other choice do I have?' There have also been moments, especially in the last two years, where I'm like, ‘this is just too much for one brain and one heart to handle. Maybe I should take a step back.'”


	Anys has taken steps back before — in 2022, she announced a hiatus from streaming, and just a few weeks ago, she said on X (formerly Twitter) that she needed “a little break from the internet.” For her, the ability to take these moments to self-reflect away from the spotlight is a privileged position, one that's only come thanks to her success.

	“I'm really grateful,” she says. “I have the power to pick and choose, as opposed to just feeling forced to make a certain decision. I can take all the knowledge that I've gained and know when to push forward and push through, and maybe fight for certain causes and things that I believe in … it doesn't get so overwhelming that I want to quit everything and move to some random farm.” 


	When asked if she ever gets exhausted, Anys cuts in before the question is finished, saying, “Although it can be exhausting, I wanted to interject and say, it can be equally fulfilling. Nothing hits harder than someone saying you inspired me.” 

	











	Speaking of inspiration, Leslie “Fuslie” Fu, owes part of her success to Anys and the Pokimane brand. Though the Chinese-American Twitch streamer is more off-the-cuff than Anys and slightly goofier, with a tendency to go on tangents (something she herself warns me of), it was Anys that inspired her to begin streaming League of Legends on Twitch.


	“I can't believe it's been 10 years,” Fu, who started her stream career while getting her Master's degree in education, says. “There's been so many highs and so many lows — which is kind of how I define streaming.”


	Fu's highs include establishing a core group of “streamer friends” and following in the footsteps of Asian-American content creators like Ryan Higa and Michelle Phan, whom she looked up to as a young woman, long before she became a Twitch streamer.


	“I grew up watching their content and realizing they were like me, they looked like me. I felt safer and more inspired to put myself out there because they did first, they paved the way,” Fu says. “As a child, I saw their faces. I saw that it was okay to do what they're doing, that I could be successful at it. Without them, I never would have tried what I'm trying.” 


	Fu's full-circle moment came when members of her Twitch community said, “Leslie, that's how you are for me,” and she realized that she had become a role model for so many young Asian Americans.


	“Sometimes I forget that I'm a woman, I forget that I'm Asian. And then someone will be like, ‘Thank you for doing this. You make me feel safe.' If I can create a space where they feel safe and show them somebody that looks like them, it's really special,” Fu explains. 


	But what about the lows? How does she reckon with being such a visible woman of color in a space still dominated by people who don't look like her?


	“It's been pretty brutal, especially the past year,” Fu admits. “I want to say, with my whole heart, that it's gotten easier and it's great to see more representation, but, sadly, I think it's gotten worse, especially social media, especially Twitter. It has been nothing short of draining. My solution has just been to kind of get off of it entirely, which is sad.”


	That solution protects her somewhat from the rage-bait accounts like Drama Alert, which often focus on painting popular women streamers like Anys and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter in a negative light.

	











	“I used to be able to use so many platforms and feel safe, and find my people there, and now half the time it's just rage-baiting, there are a lot of people just saying things to get you to say something back,” Fu laments. “I face less harassment because I'm not there as much, so [the harassment] kind of falls on deaf ears. It takes a special kind of mind to see everything online and continue to engage or to stay online with a positive attitude. I can't say there's a solution. It just sucks.” 


	Whenever she does get harassed, Fu reminds herself of how hard she's worked to get here. “Sometimes it just feels like you want to give up, but then I realize, ‘No, I have spent 10 years building a career, creating a community, online, offline — there is way too much here that's actually positive,'” Fu says.


	Though Anys and Fu are very different women with different personalities, interests, communities, and more, they share similar sentiments about their path to Twitch fame and how others can follow in their footsteps (yes, they do think streaming is a viable option for young women and people of color, even in the current climate). 


	“Lean on those that are either similar to you or that you feel comfortable with, because I would not have made it as far as I have in streaming if it wasn't for my female streamer friends or my male streamer friends who were supportive and kind and understanding,” Anys suggests For her, a solid support system is crucial when facing the seemingly endless criticism of people on the internet, as is doggedly refusing to give up on a dream.   


	“It's good to remind yourself that you can still accomplish anything you want … try to be the one who proves everyone else wrong.”

	Fu looks to fellow women to act as a lighthouse in the stormy sea.


	“While [harassment] sucks, there is a form of empowerment that comes with finding other women in this space,” Fu says. “Sometimes I'll even queue into an all-girl lobby, and those are magical.”

	The Oscar-nominated 2020 movie Greyhound saw Hanks play an inexperienced U.S. Navy commander who, soon after the U.S.' entry into the war, is tasked with leading an Allied convoy being stalked by a German submarine wolf pack. It was based on the 1955 novel The Good Shepherd. Cast also included Rob Morgan and Elisabeth Shue.


	The well-received pic was inspired by events during the Battle of the Atlantic, which took place in the earliest months of America's alliance with Great Britain and the Allied Forces against Nazi Germany and its allies. 


	The sequel is the latest Apple Original to hail from Hanks and Goetzman's Playtone. The partners previously teamed with Amblin on WWII series Masters of the Air.


	The partners on the sequel declined to comment.

Megan Thee Stallion is locked and loaded on her latest single “Whenever.” The record arrives alongside a chaotic music video that finds the rapper twisting into contortions on top of a reception area desk, dancing in the desert, and posing in a fish tank. When she raps “It's whenever, bitch, it's whatever, ho/We can do it right now, we can take it out the door,” she means it. Name the time and place.”


	“Whenever” marks the first music release from Megan since last year's Megan: Act II, an extended edition of her third studio album, Megan. Last month, the Houston native teased plans for an Act III project, too. “I'm really just trying to figure out who do I want to do features with at this point in life,” she said. “I only want to do features with people that … one, I haven't done a feature with yet, and two, that I listen to on my own time — people that I actually, you know, fuck with.”

	











	She also noted that Doechii is on her “album wish list,” adding: “I feel like Doechii would be the type of person that you would have to be in the studio to make a song with. I would like to hear a beat that she would like to rap over and also I'm like challenging myself to rap over beats that I wouldn't normally rap over without losing myself.”

	Megan recently took the stage at both weekends of Coachella 2025, though her weekend one set was cut short due to timing restrictions at the festival. Across both performances, Megan delivered the live debut of “Bigger in Texas,” “Miami Blue,” and “Rock Steady.” She also welcomed Victoria Monét to the stage for “Spin” and “On My Mama,” plus Ciara for “Goodies” and Queen Latifah for “U.N.I.T.Y.” and “Plan B.”

"Los Angeles and the Oscars were of an entirely different world from the one I know," the 'No Other Land' filmmaker said in a piece for The New York Times. "But my life is still at the mercy of the settlers and the occupation."


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Palestinian co-director of No Other Land Hamdan Ballal has penned a candid op-ed in The New York Times detailing the extent of his West Bank assault last month: “Our movie won an Oscar, but our lives are no better than before.”


	Ballal, a co-director of the Academy Award-winning documentary, as well as two other men, Khaled Mohammad Shanran and Nasser Shreteh, were attacked and arrested late March. Another co-director of the film, Israeli creative Yuval Abraham, said Ballal “had injuries to his head and stomach, bleeding” after being assaulted by a group of settlers in his home village of Susiya.

	After the Academy “refused” to publish a statement in support of Ballal after his Oscar win, according to Abraham, the organization was swift to apologize. “We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances,” it later said in a statement.

	Now, Ballal is talking about the experience in his own words. On what was a typical evening on Mar. 24, Ballal says he was quickly confronted by a group of men at his home and believed he and his wife would be killed that night. “It is difficult for me to write about this moment now,” Ballal wrote in the piece published Friday. “After I was beaten, I was handcuffed, blindfolded and thrown into an army jeep. For hours I lay blindfolded on the ground on what I later learned was an army base, fearing that I would be held for a long time and beaten again and again. I was released a day later.”


	The filmmaker said that winning the Oscar just three weeks earlier was “one of the most incredible moments of his life”. He said: “I had a taste of power and possibility… Los Angeles and the Oscars were of an entirely different world from the one I know: I was struck by the enormous buildings, the rushing cars, the wealth all around me. And suddenly there we were, me and my three other co-directors, on one of the world's most important stages, accepting the award.”


	But even though the movie received global recognition, Ballal confesses that he feels the group had failed in their attempt to make life better for his fellow community. “My life is still at the mercy of the settlers and the occupation,” he said. “My community is still suffering from unending violence. Our movie won an Oscar, but our lives are no better than before.”

	











	The attack on him and his community was “brutal”, Ballal continued, but occurs frequently in the region. “Just a few days later, dozens of settlers, many of them masked, attacked Jinba, a village nearby. Five people were hospitalized, and more than 20 were arrested. Later the army raided the village and ransacked homes, the mosque and the school.”


	With the press attention received because of the Oscar victory, Ballal finishes the op-ed by urging the public not to “turn away” from the violence happening in Susiya and further afield. “I know that there are thousands and thousands of people who now know my name and my story, who know my community's name and our story and who stand with us and support us. Don't turn away now.”


	The IDF had offered a different version of events surrounding the incident in its own statement released after the incident, saying the violence started after “several terrorists hurled rocks at Israeli citizens, damaging their vehicles.” Both sides began throwing rocks at one another, and as IDF and Israeli police arrived at the conflict, “several terrorists began hurling rocks at the security forces.” Both parties agreed that three Palestinians were detained.


No Other Land, capturing the budding friendship between a Palestinian activist and Israeli journalist, was directed by four filmmakers — two Israeli, two Palestinian. It took home the prize for best documentary at the 97th annual Academy Awards on March 2.

The filmmaker gave his blessing to Abrams Books to craft the book, which he says is "a sibling of the film, rather than just an echo."


							By

Megalopolis was one of the big swings of 2024, with Oscar-winning filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola putting decades of his life into its development and betting tens of millions of his own money on a project that he hoped would become an enduring part of his legacy.


	It told the story of an obsessive architect Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver), who wanted to create a utopian city, but finds himself at odds with Mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). The film was polarizing, to say the least. It failed to light up the box office and earned mixed reviews, but it certainly sparked conversation, becoming one of the most talked about movies in Hollywood last year.

	Now, the Godfather filmmaker's work will get a re-interpretation with Francis Ford Coppola‘s Megalopolis: An Original Graphic Novel.


	Writer Chris Ryall penned the book, after building a career adapting the works of authors such as Stephen King, Clive Barker and Harlan Ellison. Jacob Phillips, known for That Texas Blood and Newburn, is behind the art, with Abrams ComicArts plotting an October launch for the book.


	“I was pleased to put the idea of a graphic novel in the competent hands of Chris Ryall with the idea that, although it was inspired by my film Megalopolis, it didn't necessarily have to be limited by it,” said Coppola in a statement. “I hoped the graphic novel would take its own flight, with its own artists and writer so that it would be a sibling of the film, rather than just an echo. That's what I feel Chris, Jacob Phillips and the team at Abrams ComicArts have accomplished. It confirms my feeling that art can never be constrained, but rather always a parallel expression, and part of the bounty we can make available to our patrons, audiences and readers.”


	Ryall said that “Coppola's storytelling challenged and inspired me at every turn,” adding that “collaborating with Jacob Phillips brought new depth to the narrative. With Abrams ComicArts, we've created something that both honors and expands the world of the original film.”


	Phillips stated, “Megalopolis is a giant, awe-inspiring tale which insisted I pushed my artwork to new levels to meet the challenge.”


	Abrams publisher Joseph Montagne said, “Coppola's storytelling genius, paired with Ryall's writing and Phillips' dynamic artistry, makes Megalopolis a true landmark in the graphic novel literary canon.”

	











Megalopolis had an ensemble cast, including Nathalie Emmanuel, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne and Aubrey Plaza. It bowed at Cannes last year to a ten-minute standing ovation.


	At a press conference the morning after it debuted, Coppola addressed putting his own money into the $120 million project: “The money doesn't matter. What is important are the friends. A friend will never let you down. The money may evaporate.”

Political Editor


	This year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner will be focused on “journalists and journalism” and in a departure from the past, will include speeches from the association's annual award winners, according to this year's president, Eugene Daniels.


	The evening at the Washington Hilton not only looks to be a departure from tradition, as there will be no POTUS and no comedian, but will “match the moment that we are living in right now,” Daniels said. 


	The moment is a fraught time for the press corps and the WHCA itself.

	As president, Daniels presided over the transition from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, and while things generally went smoothly in the first couple of weeks, that quickly changed on Feb. 14 when the president's team announced an indefinite ban on the Associated Press from its slot in the White House pool. The AP sued, with the WHCA supporting the case via a friend of the court brief. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The day after the first hearing in the case, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the administration, not the WHCA, would take charge of who is in the pool and of other logistics, taking over duties that the independent non-profit has handled for decades. 


	Although the AP has had some access restored following a judge's determination that the White House was in violation of the First Amendment, the White House has indicated that it wanted to take other actions, like control over who sits where in the briefing room.


	Daniels, who recently moved from Politico to MSNBC, said that there may be unexpected moments of the evening, but cautioned that he didn't “want to oversell a bunch of surprises.” 


	“When [the WHCA board was] sitting down, and as the dinner has kind of shifted, and as the world has shifted, the focus [was on] ‘You know what, we should hear from the people who actually do all the work. We should hear from the people who have for years pushed and prodded the presidents, and who are the apex of their careers in getting this award, and we should honor them by giving them center stage.”


	Deadline spoke with Daniels on Thursday about what to expect on Saturday, and how he and the WHCA have handled Trump 2.0. 


DEADLINE: So a very simple question: What can we expect to see at the dinner?












EUGENE DANIELS: Everyone can expect a dinner that tries to match the moment that we're living in, that works to match the mood of the press corps, and that is working to fit the need of celebrating the First Amendment, celebrating the award winners, celebrating the scholarship students that are there, and at its core, celebrating the people that go to the White House every single day, holding the most powerful leaders in our country accountable. It's going to look a little different for folks. … Will there be moments of levity? Maybe. Probably not. Even the videos that we have are more earnest and in a defense of journalism and a celebration of the work that the WHCA does everyday.


DEADLINE: When did it become clear that you had to drop plans for a comedian? [Amber Ruffin was originally set for the dinner.]


DANIELS: Those conversations, that thought process started happening around the time that the White House started blocking the AP. And the reason was because the mood of the press corps, and the feelings that that we felt on the board and that we heard from some of our members. And that just became very obvious as time went on, that at the end of the day, the focus needs to be on the journalists and journalism, and uplifting the folks in that room at a time when not everyone's feeling uplifted because of the attacks on the press.


DEADLINE: The White House was also out there attacking the comedian as well. Was that a factor?  


DANIELS: No. That wasn't a factor. The White House's objections to the comedian had nothing to do with our decision. We stand up to the White House all the time. When they make wrong decisions, like kicking the AP out or taking over the pool rotation or getting rid of the wire positions in the pool, the board, the association, our members are not scared of going toe-to-toe with any White House.


DEADLINE: Did you have any advance warning before the press secretary announced that the White House would be taking over the pool selection?


DANIELS: No, no, not at all. When she got behind the lectern and said that she they were taking over the pool, that was the first time that the board had heard of it, that they'd come to that decision.


DEADLINE: I heard some people say, Why didn't the press just boycott the briefing? Why wasn't more of a show of unity?


DANIELS: I think that, as a board, because I can speak for the board, we are a member-based organization, and we can do what the members want to do. And so I think I'll probably maybe leave it there…Many people in the press corps felt like we have to continue to do our jobs, being in the rooms, asking the tough questions, and that won out at the end of the day. … We represent our members, and we, as a board, cannot do things that our members don't want to do.


DEADLINE: Is there anything that you would have done differently before the White House made this move?


DANIELS: I don't know what we could have done differently. They didn't come to us and ask us. They didn't tell us, ‘Hey, you know, let's talk about this pool. Let's see what we can do here.' We were just as surprised as everyone else. So there was nothing else for us to do.


DEADLINE: There were some members who said it feels like everyone is just on their own. What was your response to that? [Andrew Feinberg, correspondent for The Independent, expressed concerns over print outlets' access to accurate and timely pool reports].


DANIELS: I don't want to talk about my response to Andrew Feinberg. What he was talking about was a print pool email. He wasn't talking about whether folks wanted to protest. And people never missed out on the print pool notes, so folks were never on their own. The board has worked diligently, all nine members, on a volunteer basis to fight for more access, and that has continued even as the relationship has changed with the White House.

	











DEADLINE: What other issues, the seating. Do you know what the status of seating in the briefing room? 


DANIELS: That's a question for the White House.


	[As reports surfaced that the White House was considering such a move, the WHCA board released a statement saying that the administration was trying to “cynically seize control of the system through which the independent press organizes itself, so that it is easier to exact punishment on outlets over their coverage.”]


DEADLINE: The thing about the pool is there are incredible amount of logistics involved in that. What's your assessment on how the White House has handled that? 


DANIELS: The reason that for years, the White House Correspondents' Association board, and …  people who are our pool chairs have been operating the pool logistics and all of the other logistics, is because it's important. And if White Houses have believed this too, that the people that are being covered do not choose who covers them. I'm not going to kind of judge how good or bad the White House logistics are. What I will say is that the no one understands the needs of the correspondents, videographers, audio techs, radio correspondents, producers, wire reporters, like the people who are their actual colleagues. Anyone who would suggest that the WHCA's control of the logistics was bad is just completely inaccurate. We have for decades, been able to see beyond the next angles, knowing all of the institutional knowledge that's on the board and within the membership, knowing what could happen on any type of trip, and there's no replacing that.


DEADLINE: What do you think the impact has been with the White House in control the pool? At the court hearing for the AP's case, Zeke Miller was asked that question and said, Oh, there is a difference in the type of questions that the president is getting.


DANIELS: I am not going to speak to what my friend Zeke said. But what I will say is that the board stance has always been a question of addition and not subtraction. So the White House has been adding people for years into pools that they maybe liked more than us, who are going to ask different questions. And we never fought that. It's addition, not subtraction. What we're talking about here is something completely different. And so what you have is the government choosing the people who ask the questions of the president. What I have been heartened by is that despite all of these attacks, the members of our association continue to ask hard-hitting questions, probing questions, questions that the American people deserve to have answers to, to the president of the United States, to his aides, to the people who you know walk down the driveway of the White House and do gaggles, members of the President's Cabinet. That has not stopped. But yes, there is a sprinkling of other types of questions but I will let other people speak to that.


DEADLINE: The administration keeps saying this is the most transparent White House in history. I hear that from Karoline Leavitt a lot. Do you agree with that?


DANIELS: I'm 36 years old, and I was not here when George Washington was president, so I can't speak to that. We see President Trump a lot, right? We hear from President Trump a lot. That isn't a question, and that's not something that the WHCA has opposed in any new way, shape or form.


DEADLINE: Leavitt also has made a point of having a new media seat and more reporters, more podcasters in the briefing room. What do you think has been the impact of that?












DANIELS: As you can see every single day that they have a press briefing, our folks still ask the same tough questions, no matter who else is in the room. I don't really know how to answer that question, because at the end of the day, again, it was a question of addition, not subtraction. Our folks are still in the room asking the tough questions, and that's what matters.


DEADLINE: You also moved from Politico to MSNBC, which has been a target of the president, has that had an impact at all on on how the administration treats you. 


DANIELS: The president attacked Politico as well, just to be very clear, on Truth Social and otherwise. I think at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. What people say about me and how they treat me is not my focus. My focus is on making sure that folks within the membership do what they need to do the jobs that they wake up every day to do. Personal pot shots at me are never going to stop me from advocating, supporting and defending the members of our association and the association itself.

	We already know an awful lot about the fates of many of the characters on Andor, but the show's second season is nevertheless some of the most gripping television of the year so far. As the timeline barrels toward the beginning of Rogue One, leaping a year ahead every three episodes, both the stakes and the scale of the narrative are escalating rapidly. With the show's first block of episodes now available, showrunner Tony Gilroy was ready to break down some burning questions and take a broader look at the season — including a reveal of two major characters who definitely won't be appearing on the show. (Some spoilers for the first three episodes lie ahead — but for the record, Disney does not consider the information about the absent characters to be a spoiler.)


What was the process of breaking the stories for this season, especially given you were essentially making four mini seasons?Consider the advantages that we had. First of all, we'd done a season, so we knew how to do it. We knew what we were into. I also canonically have to stick to certain items on the calendar. I have to do Mon Mothma‘s speech from the Senate on a certain date. Now, there was a lot of mess about the Ghorman massacre. There was a lot of confusion in canon about what it meant. It had never been resolved. And then beyond all that, we know where we're ending. We know where we're going.

	So, the breakthrough was going, “Oh, my God, we're not gonna do five years [worth of seasons]. We're gonna do another year where each block of three will represent a year.” And literally, I think I probably went back upstairs to my hotel room and started sketching that night or the next day. 


	And the next revelation was, “Oh, my God, it would be so cool and elegant and smart if when we came back, we only came back for two or three days — if we came back in these really concentrated periods of time. And to really help people with the time thing, if we really came back and said, ‘Man, we're just gonna drop the needle and drop and move away.'”

	Then the final piece of that puzzle was, with the help of knowing where I have to go, I wrote the in and the out — the scenes at the top and the end of each block, as proof of concept that it could really work and we wouldn't have to do a lot of naked exposition. Could we really elegantly let that negative space work in our favor? And then I wrote my three episodes at the top to get that sharp. And then we went into the room and then we divvied it up. 

	











Even more than the first season, there's so much that feels topical. You have undocumented people working in farms. There are things later on that seem to tie very directly into things in the real world. How much were you thinking about current events and how much were you just letting it play out?The sad truth is, I did not write this with a newspaper. We were sketching this out four or five years ago — it'd be impossible. I think you'd lose your mind trying to make a gigantic show [that tries] to catch up with current events. History has its own relevancy, and the repetition and the rinse and repeat of history is something that a lot of people don't really seem to be aware of. If you go on Wikipedia and look up rebellions and revolutions, it's one of the longest entries I've ever seen. It just goes on and on. And by the time they get to the 16th century, they just start listing them. And I've been reading about this stuff, the ones that interest me — whether it's the Haitian Revolution or the Russian Revolution or Thomas Paine or Oliver Cromwell — I've been reading about all this stuff for my whole life because it interests me.


	The idea that there's something completely unique about what we're going through is a bit naive. There's that old curse, “May you live in interesting times.” And I think what's cool about the show is it's really about ordinary people, just regular people who are just going about their lives. And all of a sudden history is knocking on the door. What happens when the shit comes to your neighborhood? I'm trying to be timeless, really. So any similarity is a very unfortunate repetition of all the shit that's happened in the past that I'm basing this on.

The scope of it all, and the tragedy, it's a little bit like a Russian novel or something.Yeah. I really think of it as a novel in two parts. I think of it as, like, you had the opportunity to take a shot at doing War and Peace. That's the opportunity. When are you going to get this chance again?


	That's really why I don't think I knew this when I started. Some part of me probably was feeling it, but I was so underwater and so overwhelmed for so long on the show, and so anxious about it until we really found [our] footing. And as we said before, Covid just saved the show and gave me a chance to take a deep breath and sit in this room and not direct, and really do what I'm supposed to be doing. The opportunity that was here for me to talk about things I would never have a chance to put in any other script must have been always in the back of my mind, because when I finally hit it and realized that was what was happening, I felt at home.

	











We get again and again a taste of Luthen's absolute ruthlessness. It gets ramped up. You realize he really will do anything. He's a truly complex character, and many things in this show resist tidy moral lessons. Cassian argues that the rebellion wouldn't really exist without him. How do you see him? Every revolution has people like that. What he's told you flat out, he wasn't bullshitting: “I've given everything, I've sacrificed everything.” The accelerationist political theory that he espouses is a classic in the repertoire of insurrection and revolution. Make things really bad and up the pressure — that's a legitimate tool. I think that where he fails is, the human resources part of it is really bad [laughs]. He's so warped by his commitment, and by what's happened to him, by where he finds himself, and the desperation to see some sort of activity, that he shoots himself in the foot along the way and makes things worse. He clearly is not a friend to any romantic relationship. He's careless with the people that he should be taking care of more. He manipulates them in ways that are complicated.


	He's a guy who built a startup in his garage. He built a revolution in his garage, and now he's gonna go public and he's got VC funding. And man, how do you scale up a revolution when paranoia and secrecy and all the things that got you there, that's your basic code — how do you work with others?


	All revolutions have these firebrand, deeply committed, terrifying people that get shit done that are not there at the goal line. They don't make it to the end. They don't get to see it. They become a liability. The original gangsters are not always rewarded with a halo until they write the history. Maybe.


Then you have Syril and Dedra, your Imperials in love — it's a unique thing this season. Tell me about having these two bad guys and watching the relationship that way. I never think of them as bad guys, first of all. They're so juicy. And the idea that two people can be so beholden to an end goal of the Empire, the support of the Empire, and yet have such completely different approaches… They seem so much alike, don't they?


	They both overstepped their boundaries in investigations, and they both appear to be completely beholden to the empire. But in truth, one of them is a romantic and fantasist. Syril is a romantic, really. His inner conversation must be very loud and very extreme.


	Dedra, on the other hand, is a zealot. I think her imagination is like a Formula One driver. I think it's just, keep on going and get it done. It's so fascinating to me what happens between the two of them and how they interact, and I don't have anybody else for them to be with.

	











	They started to fall together in our mind in Season One. I think Denise Gough [who plays Dedra] was upset a little bit that we were gonna do that in the beginning, but I think she's overjoyed now with what she gets to play. 


Mon Mothma's hedonistic husband, Perrin, seemed a bit more rounded out this season. I felt some sympathy for his point of view this time.Totally. It peeved me the way that people in chat rooms just hated him and talked about how horrible he was. And I thought, that's not what I envisioned. And I told [actor Alastair Mackenzie, who plays Perrin] that we would do some things to complicate it. Perrin is clearly no saint, and he's certainly no rebel. But he has a very legitimate point of view and one that I think the show benefits from having.


	Why shouldn't somebody represent hedonism? Why shouldn't somebody represent pleasure? Why shouldn't somebody represent living in the moment? What the fuck is wrong with everybody else who's running around doing all this other stuff? So, getting to do the wedding speech for him, we really worked hard on that. We really wanted that to be special. I'm very happy that's in there.


My guess is that in this moment in history, people will suddenly find themselves a lot more sympathetic to someone who just wants to live their life while all this crazy stuff is happening in the world.Yeah, I know. They'll be going the other way now. We'll have Perrin suddenly being everyone's favorite. I also wanted to explain their marriage… If you get married at 15, and it's two beautiful people and they're rich and complicated and sophisticated, they've been through all kinds of things. Marriage is not a monolith. And the scene where they have the breakfast where he calls out Tay Kolma to her that next morning — I just love the way that Ariel Kleiman directed that scene. I think it's so beautifully directed. I'm just in awe of the blocking and everything. It was nice on the page, but the two actors and Ari — that scene is just so much about a complicated marriage of people that have had all kinds of trouble, but yet no one else knows their story the way that they do. And the affection that comes from that and the comradeship that comes from that is something that the show benefits from.


Syril's mother again reveals herself as, in a galaxy full of terrifying creatures, one of the most terrifying. Her passive-aggressiveness is the most powerful force in the Star Wars universe.[Laughs.] Yeah, man, she's an alpha, an emotional alpha predator for sure.

	











She's gotta be a fun character to write.It really is. It took a long time to get it right. Danny [Gilroy] worked on it and got really close. And then we have to do all these mock scenes. Whenever we're auditioning actors, we have to write all the scenes for 400 actors. We have to write the scenes because of secrecy. We can't let the scripts go out. So we have to write a scene that approximates what the scene's about.


	And her stuff came alive in the mock scenes. And then as [Eedy actor] Kathryn Hunter came in, it took a lot of people dialing in to try to get the right voice for her. But now I can hear it. Now I can do it. She's just so much fun to write. We wanna do a supercut of just her. That's what we gotta do. Just the Eedy Show.


Let me ask about the first three episodes where Cassian's on Yavin with these really amateur rebels who are embroiled in deadly infighting. What were you trying to show there? How did that end up being a big part of the first three episodes?I wrote the opening. I had the whole opening with him talking to the woman [before stealing a Tie Fighter], which was really good for me to do, because it shows Cassian as a leader. It really fills in the last year — obviously, he's been stealing things for Luthen and the revolution is evolving.


	It's a really powerful speech that he's giving to her. There's a little bit of Luthen — is he manipulating her a little bit? You don't know. And so I had this really elegant-feeling speech. And then we knew that the visual effects department was really excited. I just gave them free hand and said, “OK, this is what I want to have happen in the hangar when he goes to steal this thing and it goes wrong.” And I knew they were working away and it was gonna be really cool and he's gonna fly off. So the show starts very proper. And it's very regal what he says to her.


	And honest to God, I went to dinner, a big family dinner, and my son and my niece's husband, who's also an actor, were at my end of the table and everybody's drunk and whatever, and they were like Heckle and Jeckle, and all night long, they were just going at it.


	I went to work and I was like, I really wanna have some stupidity in here. [Laughs.] The rebellion has to have some idiots. I've started so elegantly and it's gonna seem so prissy if I just leave it on that [level]. What would it be like? So I wrote the parts for them and they ended up playing the two parts. That's my son and my niece's husband, the two guys on opposite sides. And it comes from a drunken dinner. And they're not dumb men! They can behave dumb. They're very entertaining at dinner. So I wrote it for them.

	











You do a reveal that this has all been in Yavin, the future home of the Rebel base. What are we supposed to take away from that reveal? It's a rebel hideout that certain people know about the way pirates used to have a certain island or something like that. Cassian Andor is a bit like Zelig in a way. Not that he's invisible or anonymous, but he's in all these places where things happen. 


	And no one had ever done the origin of Yavin. And the only thing they really know is there were these beasts there. That's already in canon. The beasts are canon. I don't know, it just felt like a cool thing to do. Why not?


I'm allowed to say at this point that Darth Vader doesn't ever appear in this show. Was that ever something you thought about?No, that was never on my agenda. Writing for Darth Vader is really limiting. I've done it. He doesn't have a lot to say.


The Emperor never shows up either, but the way he's spoken about makes me picture the more original Lucas conception of him: more like Richard Nixon, as Lucas once said, than the cackling villain we see in the movies. You have to picture him on the day-to-day management side.He was too big a piece of meat for me to introduce. It was too heavy a lift. I thought about it at one point, but it was too heavy a lift.


But when we speak about the Emperor on the show, he's more like a president or something. The offscreen character feels more like a politician rather than the full-on Sith.One of the fascinating things that I realized when I started the show in the very beginning is how many billions of beings are in the galaxy. Nobody knows about the Jedi, nobody knows about the Sith. It's just a tiny percentage of people that have any notion of it at all. It's not in the culture. And I remember being really surprised as it was explained. I thought it was something that everyone knew about, but no, it's very secretive and small.You're moving on from the Star Wars universe to do other things. Given that you're not moving forward in this world, what kinds of things can be done in the Star Wars universe that haven't been done? I don't know. You gotta be really careful. I was riffing [in one interview] about a three-camera show — there's not a lot of irony sometimes in some of the chat rooms. It doesn't help you to riff about Star Wars. I was goofing a little bit, but I was legit.


	I think it was the very first conversation with [Lucasfilm president] Kathy Kennedy way back when she was like, “After Rogue One we could do anything. What do you want to do with this?” And I literally was like, “Could you do Inherit the Wind? Could you do a courtroom drama in Star Wars?” Why couldn't you? It'd be fascinating. You'd have to invent the legal system, but you could. Why not? That would be interesting.

The 16th annual TCM Classic Film Festival got off to a roaring start Thursday night, screening one of the greatest movies ever made in one of the greatest venues in the country with one of the most influential filmmakers of all time in attendance. 

The movie: the 1980 sci-fi classic “The Empire Strikes Back.” The venue: the glorious TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. The filmmaker: George Lucas, appearing for a rare pre-show Q&A to discuss the making of his “Star Wars” sequel and why he felt financial — but not creative — pressure following up what was then the most commercially successful film in history.

 










In a conversation with Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, Lucas explained that he never felt intimidated by the prospect of failing to live up to “Star Wars,” because he had written the story for “Empire” long before the first film became an unexpected hit. “When I write, it's like a blueprint — there's not great deal of detail in it,” Lucas said. “As it turned out, when I got the ‘Star Wars' script done, there were 180 pages. So I cut it into three parts and said I'll focus on the first one, because we'd never get enough money to make the whole thing.”

Lucas credited Fox executive Alan Ladd Jr. with giving “Star Wars” the green light at a time when no one — including Lucas himself — knew exactly what the movie was going to be. Ladd just wanted to be in business with the guy who had directed “American Graffiti,” which Lucas said was the most profitable movie ever made at that point in relation to its cost. “It cost $700,000 and it made over a hundred million. Alan Ladd said, ‘You're really talented. I want to make a movie with you.' This never happens.”

Lucas was determined to make all three of his “Star Wars” stories no matter what, and negotiated a deal in which he kept the sequel rights so that he could produce “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi” elsewhere if the first movie wasn't successful or Fox just wasn't interested in continuing the series. Lucas took a lower fee than he would ordinarily have gotten as a filmmaker coming off of a huge hit in exchange for the sequel and merchandising rights — a gamble that not only allowed him to make the sequels on his own terms, but ultimately made him a billionaire.

 










“I said, ‘I want the rights for these things because I'm going to make those movies no matter what happens,'” Lucas said. “‘And besides that, I want the licensing.' They said, ‘What's licensing?'” Lucas' idea was to use merchandising to help promote the movies, with kids wearing “Star Wars” shirts that would help spread the word. “Fox was shocked when on the first day the lines were all around the block. ‘Where'd these people come from?' Because they hadn't really run a campaign.”

Indeed, amazingly enough, no one at the studio but Ladd really believed in the movie, which Lucas said wasn't unusual for “Star Wars,” which even his friends thought was a strange film for him to be making. “I certainly didn't think it was going to make any money,” Lucas said, but he added that when it did make money it put him in an unusual position maintaining ownership of the sequels. “I said, I'm going to do it myself. I'm going to go to the bank, I'm going to get the money.” 

Lucas self-financed “Empire,” with Fox staying on as a distributor, and that's where the real risk came in — he wasn't worried about the movie measuring up to “Star Wars” creatively, but had it bombed financially he would have been ruined.

Luckily, “The Empire Strikes Back” was a huge hit as well as an artistic success, one of the few sequels to a classic film that is commonly agreed upon to be as good as if not superior to its predecessor. The film's power was on full display at the Chinese Thursday night, with a packed crowd (one that included many of Lucas' directing peers, like his USC classmate Randal Kleiser, Joe Dante, John Landis, Ernest Dickerson, and Alexander Payne) enthralled by the spectacle, and audibly entertained by the sequel's new characters like Yoda and Lando Calrissian.

 










Mankiewicz wrapped the discussion up by asking Lucas why Yoda “talks backwards,” and Lucas had a simple answer. “Yoda had a very distinctive way of speaking, and that was done purposely,” Lucas said. “If you're speaking regular English, people don't listen that much. But if it's hard to understand what someone is saying, people focus on it. Yoda was basically the philosopher of the movie, and I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen to these long talking scenes, especially 12-year olds.”

Lucas concluded by talking about how difficult writing is, and what his friend and mentor Francis Coppola taught him about the importance of a good screenplay. “He said, ‘Look, the first draft's gonna be horrible. You're gonna want to commit suicide. The second draft will be bad. The secret to doing a good script is to rewrite, rewrite, rewrite. Don't stop and say it's good enough. Because there's nothing that is good enough.”

The TCM Classic Film Festival continues through Sunday with more in-person appearances, including Michelle Pfeiffer with “The Fabulous Baker Boys,” Rob Reiner with “Misery” and “The American President,” and Al Pacino and Michael Mann with “Heat.”

Jennifer Aniston‘s favorite workout is hitting the road.


	Pvolve is bringing its star-backed, low-impact sculpting classes to eight cities across America, starting with Los Angeles on April 27 and ending on May 18 in New York. The Sculpt Anywhere Tour will be led by Pvolve head trainers Dani Coleman and Maeve McEwen Myers and features the fitness company's 50-minute “Train Like Jen” body sculpting class inspired by its celebrity investor's signature routine.




	The company is known for its strength training workouts that use resistant equipment (such as ankle bands, Pilates balls, gliders and hand weights) to tone and sculpt the arms, abs and glutes. Per Pvolve's website, the workouts “enhance mobility, stability, balance and flexibility to help you move better and reduce pain and injury.” The company recommends doing at least four workouts per week for the best results.

	For those who can't make it IRL, the brand is offering a virtual way to join the tour with its Sculpt Anywhere Challenge online from May 1 to 14. To help fitness lovers gear up for the series Pvolve's Sculpt Anywhere Travel Bundle includes five fitness tools, three free months of unlimited streaming access to more than 1,500 classes and a free one-on-one trainer consultation. Regularly $315, the fitness kit is on sale for $247 when you use code SPRING10. 


	Pvolve members who complete eight workouts (either in studio or online) get an exclusive tote bag, too.


	Aniston joined Pvolve in 2023 and revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that a close friend introduced her to the fitness company's resistance-based movements. The Morning Show actress previously told InStyle that she was impressed by how Pvolve “completely transformed” her friend. 


	“My girlfriend, who I hadn't seen since the pandemic, had completely transformed her body. Her body was beautiful, but she also said her energy was like it had never been before,” she explained to InStyle, adding that it has transformed how she thinks about exercise. “When you're in a mindset of, ‘I need to do 45 minutes of cardio or I won't get a good workout,' it's daunting. I believed it for so long. I just burnt out and broke my body.”


	The 56-year-old Friends star and entrepreneur launched her first ad campaign last year for Pvolve, for which she also contributes to product development and marketing and programming strategy. 

	











	The omnichannel fitness brand was co-founded in 2017 by entrepreneur Rachel Katzman and personal trainer Stephen Pasterino (who is no longer affiliated with the company), whose clients included Victoria's Secret Angel Romee Strijd, Madelaine Petsch, Vanessa Hudgens, Bethenny Frankel and others.


	The Pvolve Sculpt Anywhere Tour will also make stops in Arizona, Texas and Georgia. Attendees will be gifted gear from Beyond Yoga and enjoy bites from Daily Harvest; see all of the dates below and book online here.

The Catalyst of Change honor was presented to her by Lily Allen on Thursday night (April 24).


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Every night on tour, Olivia Rodrigo performs for countless women and girls – but when they all funnel out of the arenas and festival grounds at the end of each of her shows, she worries constantly for their futures.


	That's why she's spent almost her entire career advocating for reproductive rights, using her platform to speak out against oppressive policy changes and raising money through her concerts for abortion funds. And on Thursday evening (April 24) at Planned Parenthood of Greater New York's Spring Into Action Gala in New York City, those efforts were honored by the organization with the designation of 2025's Catalyst of Change award to the 22-year-old pop star, who asked during her speech, “When I play shows, I look out at crowds filled with young girls and the bond I feel with them is profound… I often wonder, ‘What happens to those girls when they leave those venues? What are their dreams? What kind of world are they returning to?'”

	











	Rodrigo was one of two guests of honor at the night's celebration at Cipriani South Street in lower Manhattan, with Amanda Zurawski — the Texas woman who sued her home state in 2023 after she nearly died due to pregnancy complications and was denied an abortion — also getting a moment of recognition as this year's Champion of Change award winner. Past winner Laverne Cox was on hand to present Zurawski with the honor, while the “Vampire” singer's friend and fellow activist Lily Allen (with whom she chanted “F–k you” to the Supreme Court at her Glastonbury set three years prior, shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned), gave Rodrigo a heartfelt introduction.

	“Olivia, my love, you're the realest,” the British singer-songwriter gushed after commending Rodrigo for not “[straying] from her values to make powerful people comfortable.” “You use your platform because you actually give a s–t about reproductive freedom and justice. And in this world, genuinely giving a s–t is revolutionary.”


	After taking the stage and giving Allen a hug, Rodrigo used her speech to highlight the work of Planned Parenthood and shout out Zurawski — “You deserve this award far more than I do,” the singer said, singling out the activist in the audience — before paying tribute to Cecile Richards, the healthcare organization's former president who died earlier this year after battling brain cancer.

	











	“It's a privilege to be here tonight to support an organization that, despite countless obstacles, continues to show up with compassion, hope and dignity for women,” Rodrigo told a crowd of donors and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York board members, who clung to every word. “My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.”


	“[Richards] led at a time of relentless attacks on care and constant efforts to silence and shame women into submission,” the three-time Grammy winner added. “She reminds us that standing up for what's right doesn't mean we have to be fearless. We can be scared, we can be angry, we can feel hopeless. We just have to fight anyway.”


	The event honoring her comes after years of Rodrigo being one of the most vocal and hands-on modern pop stars when it comes to advocating for reproductive freedom. Back in May 2022 at a Sour Tour concert in Washington, D.C., just after the overturning of Roe, she made headlines for telling her crowd, “Our bodies should never be in the hands of politicians … I hope we can raise our voices to protect our right to have a safe abortion, which is a right that so many people before us have worked so hard to get.”


	On her next tour in support of 2023 Billboard 200-topping sophomore album Guts, Rodrigo launched her Fund 4 Good, which funneled proceeds from her shows on the trek to local abortion funds. Through the initiative, the Grammy winner also had local abortion funds set up tables at her venues, allowing young fans to learn about reproductive health and resources. In December, she announced that she'd donated more than $2 million in ticket sales from her 2024 Guts Tour — which continues this year with shows in Latin America and Europe as well as a run of global festival dates — to 10 organizations around the world championing girls' education, reproductive rights and the prevention of gender-based violence.

Um, first of all, huge thank you to Lily. I absolutely adore you and I'm so grateful that you're here tonight, thank you. And a huge thank you to Planned Parenthood of Greater New York for this incredible honor. 


I feel very fortunate for so many things in my life and my career. Over the past few years, I've gotten to live out dreams that I had as a little girl. I've traveled the world, I've written music that inspires me, and I've met so many of the people I grew up worshiping, like Miss Lily, for example.


But perhaps the greatest privilege this career has given me is connection with women through my music. When I play shows, I look out at crowds filled with young girls and the bond I feel with them is profound. To be in a space where we can all feel safe to be wild, emotional and carefree is incredibly powerful, and even though we're not speaking one on one, those moments where we sing together and lock eyes, something real forms. It feels like we're part of each other's lives. I often wonder, ‘What happens to those girls when they leave those venues? What are their dreams? What kind of world are they returning to?


We live in a world that politicizes our bodies and uses harmful ideologies to deny us safety and healthcare, and it breaks my heart to think that, because of oppressive laws and outdated policies, some of those girls may not get to follow their dreams the way I was able to follow mine. Just a year ago, fueled by heartbreak and anger over what was happening in the world, I launched my Fund 4 Good, a global initiative that supports local nonprofits, championing reproductive freedom, girls' education and the prevention of gender-based violence. A portion of my tour proceeds went to the fund, and I'm proud to share that we've raised and donated over $2 million to organizations around the world.












I'm so, so incredibly humbled to be here amongst so many real-life heroes in the fight for freedom of choice. Amanda, wherever you are – where are you? Oh, hi Amanda! I'm absolutely floored by your story. Your ability to turn something so heartbreaking and painful into such powerful activism is so incredibly inspiring. I'm just so in awe of you. You deserve this award far more than I do, and I'm just very honored to stand with you tonight and celebrate your bravery.


I can't express how much I admire Planned Parenthood and the life-saving work that they do. Providing affordable healthcare, cancer screenings, birth control, STD testing, and abortion care, amongst so many other things, gives women the autonomy to care for themselves and shape their futures. It's a privilege to be here tonight to support an organization that, despite countless obstacles, continues to show up with compassion, hope and dignity for women. My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.


Before I go, I want to honor Cecile Richards. She led at a time of relentless attacks on care and constant efforts to silence and shame women into submission, but Cecile stood her ground, and in doing so, she stood up for millions of us. I never got the chance to meet her, but her legacy of resilience and decency continues to impact me. She reminds us that standing up for what's right doesn't mean we have to be fearless. We can be scared, we can be angry, we can feel hopeless. We just have to fight anyway. Thank you again, so much.

“The Valley” star Brittany Cartwright is opening up about co-parenting her son, Cruz, 4, with her estranged husband, Jax Taylor. 

In an April 2025 Access Hollywood interview, Cartwright referenced that their son was diagnosed with autism in late 2024. According to Cartwright, the diagnosis was “a little bit harder for Jax to accept than it was for [her] to accept.” She clarified that Taylor adores Cruz. 

“He loves his son,” said Cartwright, who filed for divorce from Taylor in August 2024. 

She also said she “deal[s] with all the doctors and the therapists” for Cruz. She said while Taylor “doesn't see as much as [she] see[s] that goes into it,” he is “learning” about autism. 

“We're both learning. It's brand new. It hasn't always been easy. It hasn't been but I wouldn't change anything about Cruz. Ever,” said Cartwright to the publication.

While speaking to Access Hollywood, Cartwright explained why she went public with her son's diagnosis. 

“I can use my platform for something amazing. And I can help other families that are going through this,” said Cartwright during the interview. 

In addition, she said she wants to spread the message that “early intervention is so important” for children with autism. 

“With other families that are going through it, they need to realize that early intervention is so important to give their child the best life they can have,” said Cartwright. 

During an April 2025 interview with People magazine, Cartwright said her son attends preschool with a therapeutic companion and goes to speech and occupational therapy. Cartwright stated that she is “trying to do everything [she] possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever.” 

“I just make sure that he never misses a class, never misses a therapy session. If I have to work, I have the most amazing nanny in the entire world, she is literally my family. I don't know what I would do without her. Sometimes Jax will take him,” said Cartwright to the publication. “I want him to learn things as well, but the majority of the time, it's me. And I feel like I need to be there, I need to be learning what's going on, so that I can really work with him at home as well.”

In a different April 2025 interview with Access Hollywood, Taylor spoke about his son. He said he decided to receive mental health help and get sober for the sake of Cruz. He then referenced his child's autism diagnosis. 

“My little boy needs me more than ever. And I feel like it's just a sign from God. Brittany and I are really coming together about this. Our little boy is our priority and making sure that he has the best life possible. And knowing that me and his mom will love him more than anything,” said Taylor to Access Hollywood.

OUAI's Jen Atkin honored the Rhode guru as beauty innovator of the year and dished that “what really gets her heated” is old episodes of ‘Grey's Anatomy': "I kind of wish Ellen Pompeo was here today.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



The Daily Front Row presented its 9th annual Fashion Awards in Los Angeles on Thursday night during a starry ceremony at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The well-known fashion publication revealed its roster of fashion and beauty winners in advance, a starry list of names that included Tyra Banks, supermodel Adriana Lima, stylist Brad Goreski and designer Betsey Johnson. 


	But upon arrival, attendees learned that another trophy had been added to the list and its intended recipient would be on hand to accept. In a surprise move, Hailey Bieber, model, influencer and Rhode founder, turned up in the 90210 as she was feted as beauty innovator of the year.

	After stepping into the lights on the Beverly Hills Hotel's Crystal Ballroom stage, Bieber kicked off her acceptance speech with an apology. “My speech is going to be very generic in comparison to all the beautiful speeches before me,” referencing heartfelt words shared by honorees Banks, Lima, stylist duo Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald, hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos, makeup artist Alexx Mayo, and presenters Lizzo, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Dixie D'Amelio and more. “It's amazing to be in this room surrounded by so many talented and amazing people.

	Bieber then explained that when she founded Rhode, she wasn't looking to “start a brand for the sake of starting a brand.” She had much bigger ambitions. “I really wanted to create an entire world, and something that I say often is, ‘Welcome to the world of Rhode.' Because to me, Rhode isn't just products. It's a feeling. It's a lifestyle. It's a place. It's a world that is open to everyone and anybody that identifies with it. To see so many people gravitate toward it and become a part of our world is so humbling and so beautiful.”


	She singled out members of the Rhode team, including her fellow founding partners Michael and Lauren Ratner, and thanked “our incredible customers and supporters.” She also credited her friends for “being the best test subjects and biggest cheerleaders, and shouted out OUAI founder Jen Atkin for teaching her about beauty and brand building. Atkin was standing steps away behind the podium after offering the honoree tribute. Bieber then saved her final shout-out for her husband, pop superstar Justin Bieber.

	











	“And lastly, I want to thank my husband for supporting the dream of mine from the beginning and for always cheering me on,” she said. 


	Her acceptance speech came after a loving tribute from Atkin, who dished some personal details about their friendship and even fought back tears in the process. 


	“I am so excited to be here tonight to talk about my dear friend of over a decade, the glazed donut turned beauty mogul, Hailey Bieber. We traveled the world as I got to watch her slay the biggest red carpets. I got to watch her shoot major campaigns and on her biggest day, her wedding day, we hid in a tent from the paparazzi while I sobbed uncontrollably. But through everything she has remained truly the perfectly moisturized calm in the storm.”


	Atkin then teased that she was going to break her nondisclosure agreement by spilling “a big secret” and “the real drama behind closed doors.”


	“What really gets her heated is old Grey's Anatomy episodes,” Atkin dished. “I'm talking seasons one through four. She's obsessed and I kind of wish Ellen Pompeo was here today with us.”


	Back to Rhode. “The idea of Rhode really was a dream of hers for so, so long. She talked about it constantly. She wasn't interested in following trends or creating pricey products with this complicated routine. She wanted really great formulas, beautiful packaging because she also wanted to create really engaging and authentic content because she wanted us all to be alongside her journey of creating this. I was there for Rhode's very first campaign shoot, and immediately you guys, I felt so bad for her entire team. The woman is a detail fanatic. I'm talking from formulas to fonts, creative to catering. She is so incredibly hands-on. She shows up. She works so hard, and she knows exactly what she wants.”

	











	Atkin praised that level of dedication for pushing Rhode not only into the center of all things beauty, “but culture at large” through viral lip treatments, cellphone cases, photo booths and pop-ups around the world. “Hailey, I am so proud of you, you're a boss. You are a style icon and a skin-care guru, but your success is not just limited to your career. You are the most loving wife, daughter, sister, friend, and now you're a mom to the cutest little boy I've ever seen — besides my son.”


	Breakout actor, comedian and Las Culturistas podcast host Matt Rogers hosted the Daily Front Row's Los Angeles ceremony, which was presented by Lagos, Moroccanoil, DAOU Vineyards, Milly and Casamigos. The program also saw Banks honored as fashion icon by presenter Beverly Johnson, Lima feted as comeback of the year by UFC champ Amanda Nunes, Alexx Mayo named makeup artist of the year with a tribute by Lizzo (who also sang him “Happy Birthday”), Betsey Johnson honored with a lifetime achievement award presented by Selma Blair, Dimitris Giannetos named hairstylist of the year with an introduction by Dixie D'Amelio, Brad Goreski honored as style curator of the year presented by Ashley Park, stylist duo Wayman Bannerman and Micah McDonald feted as men's stylists of the year with a tribute by Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Genesis Webb handed the breakthrough music stylist of the year trophy by client and close friend Chappell Roan.

Blake Lively, currently embroiled in a headline-generating feud with Justin Baldoni and others, has revealed that her mother was assaulted years before she was born. 


	Accepting her honoree nomination at last night's Time100 Gala, the It Ends With Us star said that at her mother's “urging and unwavering bravery, she wanted me to share with you that she is a survivor of the worst crimes someone can commit against a woman.” 


	Delivering a toast last night at the gala, Lively said her mother, Willie Elain McAlpin, who was present, had “never got justice from her work acquaintance who attempted to take her life when she was the mother of three young kids—years before I was born.” 

	











	According to Lively, her mother was saved from the experience by an assault survivor who she had previously heard speak about her pain on the radio. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“The woman painfully and graphically shared how she escaped, and because of hearing that woman speak to her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today,” said Lively. “She was saved by a woman whose name she'll never know. I am alive, and standing with you all here today, being honored, because of a woman whose name I'll never know. I am here, my mom is here, because that woman not only survived, but she told others how.” 


	Lively described this experience as a “silent torch of womanhood that we come to know—a pact that privately we must show others how to survive, literally or spiritually.” 


	She paid tribute to “incredible” fellow Time100 Honoree Gisèle Pelicot, the French woman who attended every day of the trial of her husband and dozens of men accused of drugging, raping and assaulting her late last year.


	Lively swerved the elephant in the room, Baldoni, only briefly alluding to the saga by noting: “I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum.”


	A few hours prior, Deadline revealed that Lively and her publicist had been accused by Baldoni and his PR team of a “ploy to obtain subpoena power.” The overwhelming dispute began late last year when Lively filed a suit accusing Baldoni of harassment and strategizing to “destroy her reputation” on the It Ends With Us set.

	Prior to “Money on Money” hitting streaming services, Thug has laid low for much of the first four months of 2025 outside of appearing on Lil Baby's “Dum, Dumb, and Dumber” with Future. 


	Future and Thug have an extensive collaborative history as two of the rap titans calling Atlanta home. They previously joined forces for the Super Slimey joint album in 2017, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. 


	Other standout collabs from their catalogs include “Relationship,” Gunna's “Pushin P,” Drake's “Way Too Sexy” and “Sup Mate.”


	After serving more than two years behind bars as part of the longest-running trial in Georgia's history, Thug secured his freedom when he was released after reaching a plea deal on Halloween that saw the rapper sentenced to 15 years of probation.


	Earlier in April, Thug announced UY SCUTI on X and launched the album's official online shop equipped with vinyl records, CDs and merch bundles. 


	“It's Time. Red Planet,” he wrote alongside the link to the UY SCUTI store. According to Nine Planets, Uy Scuti is a supergiant red star that's located in the constellation named Scutum.

Adam Scott won't be hosting “Saturday Night Live” this season (his “Innie” won't get the chance either), and Ben Stiller thinks that's a shame. But Scott seems willing to take Lorne Michaels' call should there be one for Season 51. 

“SNL” on Thursday announced its final three hosts for Season 50, starting with Quinta Brunson, followed by the hosting debut of Walton Goggins, and concluding with Scarlett Johansson. Shortly after the cork board announcement from the show was posted, Stiller responded to a comment saying it was a “missed opportunity fr” that Scott wasn't among them, simply saying, “I agree.”
 










IndieWire spoke with Scott on the red carpet where he's being honored for the annual Time 100 gala (his old “Parks and Recreation” co-star Nick Offerman wrote up the blurb naming Scott one of the 100 most influential people of the year). When asked if he was interested in hosting the legendary variety show, Scott said “Of course. It would be amazing.”

“‘SNL' is, I think it's hard to argue it's not the greatest show on television because of its longevity and because of its influence on culture,” Scott said. “50 years of really kind of guiding culture in a lot of ways but also reacting to culture at the same time. The cast right now is unbelievable. They're really in one of their peaks, I think. So yeah, of course. It would be amazing.” 

While “SNL” lampooned buzzy series and films like “The White Lotus” and “Anora” and even brought Oscar winner Mikey Madison on to host, “Severance” has gotten the short shrift, but we'd love to see what they can do with all the inscrutable goat stuff on the Apple TV+ show. And we'd love to see Scott reunite with “SNL” great Amy Poehler; we bet she could do a great Harmony Cobel. 

“SNL” returns May 3 with the return of Brunson to Studio 8H, and Season 50 concludes on May 17. “Severance” will also return for a third season after receiving critical praise and dominating streaming charts in its return for Season 2.

If the musical acts at Coachella skew too young for you (or if that festival has become overly commercialized and overly expensive), fret not. For Gen Xers and Elder Millennials - plus younger folks who internalized their taste from those groups - you have festival options. The top choice would be Best Friends Forever because, well, look at this incredible lineup:

A post shared by Best Friends Forever (@bestfriendsforeverfest)

I mean, c'mon! Knapsack and Hey Mercedes are so good and look how deep into that list they are! However, maybe that weekend in October you're busy. Or, perhaps, Vegas isn't for you but you like the idea of hanging out in a small town inland from Seattle? Or, say, why not both?

A new festival is debuting this September, and it's being fronted by none other than Modest Mouse. Behold, the, um, Psychic Salamander Festival.

A post shared by Modest Mouse (@modestmouse)

Psychic Salamander is taking place September 13 and 14 at, in an old-school fashion, a farm. Specifically, a farm in Carnation, Washington. As for the lineup, it's not as robust as Best Friends Forever, but it will definitely appeal to Gen Xers looking for something to do in September. Some artists, such as Australian indie act Courtney Barnett, aren't of that era, that is where much of the drive is. Beyond Modest Mouse, there's Sleater-Kinney, Yo La Tengo, and Built to Spill. Also, The Flaming Lips, who on the second night of the festival are playing the 1999 album "The Soft Bulletin" in full. Nothing says "Gen X" like "The Flaming Lips playing their 1999 album in its entirety."

This is a solid lineup and not one that threatens to get unwieldy. Tickets go on sale Friday, May 2 at 10:00am PT.

Conspiracy beliefs often take hold because it is easier for our brain to comprehend one explanation, one villain, or one horrific theme, rather than a multitude of competing theories, which can be more disorienting. 

The grotesque murders on August 8-9, 1969, shocked the country and the Western world. "Helter Skelter," a phrase from the Beatles' White Album, written the year before, was taken as an apocalyptic vision intended for Charles Manson and members of his so-called "family." The phrase was written in blood on the walls of the murdered LaBianca couple. Vincent Bugliosi used "race war" as the theme of his prosecution case against Manson.

Morris's documentary, Chaos: The Manson Murders, is based on Tom O'Brien's 2019 prodigious book CHAOS: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties. O'Brien and Morris give prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi's theory short shrift. They explore the idea that Charles Manson was involved with the CIA's experiments on mind control. The MK-ULTRA and Manson connection is credible. However, there is no definitive proof, just a lot of speculation and innuendos.

Did the MK Ultra psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Jolyon West, who was running a CIA-funded Haight Ashbury medical clinic, influence Manson during their overlapping time in the Haight Ashbury, the two years before the murders? It is a fact that Manson had his "family" go for treatment of STDs and pregnancy at the same clinic. It is a fact that the CIA and Manson were both interested in LSD. Dr. West's files from this period and others have gone missing. 

As a U.S. Air Force medical director during the Korean War, Dr. West undertook the study of 36 out of 59 U.S. airmen returned from North Korean prison, convinced they had exposed Korean civilians to germ warfare. Speculations were that the soldiers had been brainwashed. MK Ultra, a new CIA program, contracted Dr. West to develop experiments using hypnosis and psychotropics to protect our soldiers from mind control. The program enlarged and funded universities and private psychiatrists with the task of developing techniques for mind control, especially the use of LSD, which was given to subjects without their knowledge. Another goal of the research was to convince people to kill with no remorse. The MK Ultra program closed down in 1964.

Errol Morris's previous documentary, Wormwood  (2017), examines issues surrounding the death in 1952 of MK Ultra scientist Frank Olsen and the role that LSD played in his murder, initially attributed to suicidal depression. It took dozens of years for Frank Olsen's son to solve this case.

Charles Manson was a drug dealer who used LSD, the mind-altering counterculture drug of the 1960s. His "family" was perpetually stoned, though Manson less so, to maintain absolute control. 

According to Dr. Jodi M. Lane, who recently published her assessment of Charles Manson, he fits the criteria of Dr. Robert Hare's definition of a psychopath: glibness or superficial charm; grandiose sense of self-worth; conning; manipulativeness; lack of remorse; shallow affect; callousness; and lack of empathy. Manson failed to accept responsibility for his actions. He had a need for stimulation, a proneness to boredom. He led a parasitic and deviant lifestyle and had no realistic long-term goals.

His "family" primarily consisted of the rootless, young, very impressionable women who left home to partake in the 1960s hippy counterculture—a far cry from the homebody female of the 1950s. Their rootlessness primed them for a magnetic attachment to a manipulative, grandiose man such as Charles Manson. Generous LSD supplies cinched the deal.

Kenneth Walsh, an award-winning historian, said of the 1960s, "It was a decade of extremes, a decade of transformational change and bizarre contrasts: flower children and assassins, idealism and alienation, rebellion and backlash. For many in the massive post-World War II baby boom generation, it was both the best of times and the worst of times."

No surprise that Woodstock followed just a few days after the murders.

The APA listed brainwashing under dissociative disorders, though it was not an official diagnosis until 1980. "While "brainwashing" is a term often used to describe coercive persuasion, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) includes "Identity Disturbance due to Prolonged and Intense Coercive Persuasion" under its "Other Specified Dissociative Disorder" (OSDD) category, which can be a result of experiences like brainwashing."

Mind Control was not new: In 1950, author and authority on psychological warfare Edward Hunter (1902-1978) coined the word brainwashing from the Chinese. In the military classic "The Art of War," written by the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu around five centuries ago, the primary message is to avoid war. "All warfare is based on deception."

Centuries later, "Mao Zedong's Red Army used terrifying ancient techniques to turn the Chinese people into mindless, Communist automatons. “Brainwashing” was a literal translation from the Mandarin words for wash (xi) and brain (nao). Hunter warned of its dangers. The process was meant "to change a mind radically so that its owner becomes a living puppet—a human-robot—without the atrocity being visible from the outside."

The newfound tomb of an Egyptian prince has a false door, which ancient people viewed as an "entry" and "exit" for souls in the afterlife, researchers say.

Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered the 4,400-year-old tomb of a prince whose burial has a giant "false" pink door to enable souls to enter and exit.

The tomb belongs to Prince Userefre, also spelled Waser-If-Re, the son of King Userkaf, also spelled Wserkaf a pharaoh who reigned around 2465 to 2458 B.C. during Egypt's fifth dynasty (circa 2465 to 2323 B.C.).

The newly discovered false door has inscriptions that say that he was a "hereditary prince," as well as a "judge," a "minister," a "governor" of two regions, and a "chanting priest," the statement said.

"Previous to this discovery, we didn't even know he existed," Ronald Leprohon, professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Toronto who was not involved with the excavation, told Live Science in an email. Leprohon noted that the prince's name may have meant "Re is powerful." Re (also spelled Ra) was a sun god in ancient Egypt.

The giant false door, which is made of pink granite, is about 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) high and 3.8 feet (1.2 m) wide, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. In ancient Egypt, false doors are commonly seen in tombs, as the Egyptians believed that the souls of the deceased could enter and exit through them, according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The door's immense size and construction from pink granite is remarkable, experts said.

"This is the first time that a false door like this was found in Saqqara" Zahi Hawass, a former antiquities minister who is leading excavations at the tomb, told Live Science in an email. The man's status as a prince with important titles explains why a false door like this was built for him, Hawass said.

Melanie Pitkin, a senior curator at the Chau Chak Wing Museum at the University of Sydney who was not involved with the excavation, said in an email that "at this time, false doors are most commonly made from limestone, which was a ubiquitous resource in Egypt. Since pink and red granite was quarried and transported from Aswan [about 400 miles or 644 km south], it was more expensive and reserved for royalty and the high elite."

A red granite offering table was found near the false door. Leprohon noted that in ancient Egypt, people sometimes left food offerings on offering tables and believed that the deceased could "magically" eat "the offerings deposited on the so-called offering table in front of it." In reality, it was the funerary priests and their families that actually ate the food, he noted.



The tomb appears to have been reused at some point during the 26th dynasty (circa 688 to 525 B.C.). At this time, a statue depicting King Djoser (reign circa 2630 to 2611 B.C.) along with his wife and children was placed within it, the statement said. Djoser ruled during the third dynasty (circa 2649 to 2575 B.C.) and built ancient Egypt's first known pyramid, the step pyramid at Saqqara. Analysis of the statue and its design indicates that the statue was made during king Djoser's rule and may have been from the step pyramid itself or a building near it. Why it was moved into the tomb at that time is unclear, the statement said.

The statue shows a seated Djoser putting his right "hand with love on one of his daughters," while his queen is to his left and "is also putting her hand on one of her daughters," Hawass said. In front of them is a black granite statue that also dates to the third dynasty, Hawass said.



Ann Macy Roth, a clinical professor of Egyptology at New York University who was not involved with the excavation, said that the sculptures from the third dynasty are remarkable as "there is very little sculpture from that era." Roth noted that prior to this discovery, "I can only think of one piece that represents a woman," so the statue depicting Djoser's wife and daughters is extraordinary.

Excavations are ongoing, and the prince's burial chamber has not yet been found. "We only found a part of the tomb," Hawass noted.

Lara Weiss, the CEO of the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Germany who was not involved with the excavation, said that the discovery of the tomb "adds to the growing evidence that Saqqara remained a prestigious burial site during the Fifth Dynasty, even as royal tombs moved to Abusir."

She told Live Science in an email that "it's "a nice puzzle piece for understanding a transformative moment in ancient Egypt's political and religious history — between the centralized power of the Fourth Dynasty and the perhaps more diversified elite power structures of the Fifth."

The detection of life beyond Earth would be one of the most profound discoveries in the history of science. The Milky Way galaxy alone hosts hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets. Astronomers are using powerful space telescopes to look for molecular indicators of biology in the atmospheres of the most Earth-like of these planets.

But so far, no solid evidence of life has ever been found beyond the Earth. A paper published in April 2025 claimed to detect a signature of life in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. And while this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers – including the paper's authors – aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists. A detection of life would be a remarkable development.

The astronomer Carl Sagan used the phrase, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” in regard to searching for alien life. It conveys the idea that there should be a high bar for evidence to support a remarkable claim.

I'm an astronomer who has written a book about astrobiology. Over my career, I've seen some compelling scientific discoveries. But to reach this threshold of finding life beyond Earth, a result needs to fit several important criteria.

There are three criteria for a scientific result to represent a true discovery and not be subject to uncertainty and doubt. How does the claim of life on K2-18b measure up?

First, the experiment needs to measure a meaningful and important quantity. Researchers observed K2-18b's atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope and saw a spectral feature that they identified as dimethyl sulfide. 

On Earth, dimethyl sulfide is associated with biology, in particular bacteria and plankton in the oceans. However, it can also arise by other means, so this single molecule is not conclusive proof of life.

Second, the detection needs to be strong. Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons. The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise.

The K2-18b detection has a significance of 3-sigma, which means it has a 0.3% probability of arising by chance. 

That sounds low, but most scientists would consider that a weak detection. There are many molecules that could create a feature in the same spectral range.

The “gold standard” for scientific detection is 5-sigma, which means the probability of the finding happening by chance is less than 0.00006%. For example, physicists at CERN gathered data patiently for two years until they had a 5-sigma detection of the Higgs boson particle, leading to a Nobel Prize one year later in 2013.

Third, a result needs to be repeatable. Results are considered reliable when they've been repeated – ideally corroborated by other investigators or confirmed using a different instrument. For K2-18b, this might mean detecting other molecules that indicate biology, such as oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. Without more and better data, most researchers are viewing the claim of life on K2-18b with skepticism.

In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life much closer to home, on the planet Mars.

Over a century ago, retired Boston merchant turned astronomer Percival Lowell claimed that linear features he saw on the surface of Mars were canals, constructed by a dying civilization to transport water from the poles to the equator. Artificial waterways on Mars would certainly have been a major discovery, but this example failed the other two criteria: strong evidence and repeatability. 

Lowell was misled by his visual observations, and he was engaging in wishful thinking. No other astronomers could confirm his findings.

In 1996, NASA held a press conference where a team of scientists presented evidence for biology in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Their evidence included an evocative image that seemed to show microfossils in the meteorite. 

However, scientists have come up with explanations for the meteorite's unusual features that do not involve biology. That extraordinary claim has dissipated.

More recently, astronomers detected low levels of methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Like dimethyl sulfide and oxygen, methane on Earth is made primarily – but not exclusively – by life. Different spacecraft and rovers on the Martian surface have returned conflicting results, where a detection with one spacecraft was not confirmed by another.

The low level and variability of methane on Mars is still a mystery. And in the absence of definitive evidence that this very low level of methane has a biological origin, nobody is claiming definitive evidence of life on Mars.

Detecting microbial life on Mars or an exoplanet would be dramatic, but the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations would be truly spectacular.

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has been underway for 75 years. No messages have ever been received, but in 1977 a radio telescope in Ohio detected a strong signal that lasted only for a minute.

This signal was so unusual that an astronomer working at the telescope wrote “Wow!” on the printout, giving the signal its name. Unfortunately, nothing like it has since been detected from that region of the sky, so the Wow! Signal fails the test of repeatability.

In 2017, a rocky, cigar-shaped object called ‘Oumuamua was the first known interstellar object to visit the solar system. ‘Oumuamua's strange shape and trajectory led Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb to argue that it was an alien artifact. However, the object has already left the solar system, so there's no chance for astronomers to observe it again. And some researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that it's just a comet. 

While many scientists think we aren't alone, given the enormous amount of habitable real estate beyond Earth, no detection has cleared the threshold enunciated by Carl Sagan.

These same criteria apply to research about the entire universe. One particular concern in cosmology is the fact that, unlike the case of planets, there is only one universe to study.

A cautionary tale comes from attempts to show that the universe went through a period of extremely rapid expansion a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Cosmologists call this event inflation, and it is invoked to explain why the universe is now smooth and flat.

In 2014, astronomers claimed to have found evidence for inflation in a subtle signal from microwaves left over after the Big Bang. Within a year, however, the team retracted the result because the signal had a mundane explanation: They had confused dust in our galaxy with a signature of inflation.

On the other hand, the discovery of the universe's acceleration shows the success of the scientific method. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was expanding. Then, in 1998, evidence emerged that this cosmic expansion is accelerating. Physicists were startled by this result. 

Two research groups used supernovae to separately trace the expansion. In a friendly rivalry, they used different sets of supernovae but got the same result. Independent corroboration increased their confidence that the universe was accelerating. They called the force behind this accelerating expansion dark energy and received a Nobel Prize in 2011 for its discovery.

On scales large and small, astronomers try to set a high bar of evidence before claiming a discovery.

 Jennifer Abel, who is also entangled in the ongoing legal drama involving Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, is now facing new claims. Read on to learn more about the latest developments. 

It seems Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal feud is getting more dramatic than ever. Now, Stephanie Jones, who was Justin Baldoni's former publicist, is facing 14 new claims that are raising eyebrows, according to the Daily Mail.

Baldoni's Wayfarer company and his publicist for the It Ends With Us movie, Jennifer Abel, have filed new allegations against Jones. These include violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, fraud, and defamation, according to the outlet.

Jones has reportedly been accused of snooping on Abel's private messages until January of this year and planning a “flagrant abuse of process” with Lively to create a subpoena from a “sham lawsuit” to conceal Jones's alleged leaking of messages to The Shallows actress.

The new filing also includes claims from Abel alleging that Jones made “bizarre” statements about her to employees, based on supposed information from “psychic readings.” Abel stated, “In one instance, Jones announced to my subordinates that she had learned through psychic readings that I was an alcoholic and a gambling addict,” per the outlet.

Abel reportedly mentioned that the claim had no “basis in reality,” and instead raised concerns over whether Jones was experiencing a “mental breakdown.”

Abel's court filing also stated, “Although Jones had always been volatile, she now appeared to be actively unraveling.” It added, “On a different occasion, Jones announced, again per her psychic, that Abel would soon be pregnant with twins, humiliating and infuriating Abel, who, Jones knew, had struggled with fertility issues.”

However, Jones' attorneys are pushing back. In a statement to the publication, they called the new allegations “just distraction and noise” and “a few debunked conspiracy theories.”

The two explosive legal documents, filed in New York federal court, total 125 pages combined, according to the report.

Astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to revisit a misunderstood black hole thought to be gulping matter 40 times faster than the theoretical limit. It turns out, dust may have obscured the truth.

A "fast-feeding" black hole that appeared to defy physics is actually pretty ordinary, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal.

In November 2024, astronomers using JWST reported that they'd found a black hole from the early universe that appeared to be gorging on matter 40 times faster than theoretically possible. The black hole, called LID-568, was observed as it existed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang — much too early in the history of the universe for it to have gotten that huge.

However, new research suggests that this excessive eating rate may have been an overestimation. After revisiting the JWST observations of the "record-breaking" black hole, astronomers confirmed that it is not extreme after all. In fact, heavy dust obscured the black hole, leading to incorrect calculations, the researchers found.

In an accreting black hole, the infalling material is compressed and heated, causing it to emit high-energy radiation such as X-rays that push material away. The amount of matter a black hole can consume is governed by the Eddington limit, which defines the maximum luminosity at which the outward radiation pressure balances the black hole's gravitational pull. This limit depends directly on the black hole's mass — the higher the mass, the higher the Eddington limit.

When the radiation pressure becomes high enough to overpower gravity, the black hole stops accreting matter and thus limits how brightly it shines. However, under certain conditions, a black hole can continue to accrete matter beyond this limit — a process known as super-Eddington accretion.

The observations from last year suggested that LID-568 was undergoing super-Eddington accretion at nearly 40 times greater than expected. LID-568 existed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang — which is not enough time for this black hole to have grown this big. As a result, the astronomers speculated that such rapid super-Eddington accretion could provide a convincing explanation for the formation of supermassive black holes with unimaginably high masses in the early universe.

But in the new research, published April 4 in The Astrophysical Journal, astronomers found that LID-568 is feeding at a rate consistent with the Eddington limit — and the mistake was caused by dust.

The reason for the initial miscalculation about the black hole's hunger is because dust absorbs and scatters light, which significantly dims the light that reaches us from a black hole.

"For a heavily dust-obscured object like LID-568, it is very important that dust extinction is corrected properly," said study co-author Myungshin Im, director of the Seoul National University Astronomy Research Center told Live Science in an email. If this effect is not properly accounted for, it can lead to inaccurate calculations of the black hole's mass, which, in turn, affects the Eddington limit associated with it.

Im explained that, in the team's study, the researchers measured the black hole's mass using infrared light from the gas around it. Infrared radiation is much less affected by dust than optical light, which was used in the previous study for black hole mass measurement.

This different approach allowed them to calculate the black hole's mass to be just under a billion solar masses — about 40 times greater than the previous estimate. Using this revised black hole mass, the Eddington luminosity was recalculated. Overall, the observed luminosity closely matched the Eddington limit. Therefore, the black hole was not in the super-Eddington phase when it was observed, the team concluded. It was just clouded by dust.

—Black holes can destroy planets — but they can also lead us to thriving alien worlds. Here's how.

Consequently, LID-568's current feeding habits cannot be attributed to the growth of supermassive black holes, Im said. Astronomers have been aware of this issue in the case of distant galaxies and usually apply corrections for dust extinction in their measurements.

However, for "active galactic nuclei" (AGN) — which contain actively feeding black holes at their centers that dominate the AGN's brightness and are surrounded by complex dust environments — "dust extinction correction has not been thoroughly applied yet," Im said. This means the masses of other black holes may have been measured incorrectly, leading to misinterpretations of their properties. The team's approach could lead to a better understanding of dust-obscured black holes in a new class of galaxies called "little red dots," which were recently discovered through JWST observations, the team explained in their paper.

Justin Baldoni's legal battle with Blake Lively has taken a bizarre new twist, with lawyers launching 14 new claims against his embattled former publicist, Stephanie Jones, on Thursday.

Baldoni's, 41, movie company, Wayfarer, and his publicist for the film It Ends With Us, Jennifer Abel, both filed new claims including a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, defamation, and fraud against Jones.

They accused Jones of snooping on Abel's private messages all the way until January this year, and plotting a 'flagrant abuse of process' with Lively, 37, to generate a subpoena from a 'sham lawsuit' to cover up Jones allegedly leaking messages to Lively.

Abel's new filing also accused Jones of making 'bizarre' claims about Abel to her staff based on supposed information from 'psychic readings.'

'In one instance, Jones announced to Abel's subordinates that she had learned through psychic readings that Abel was an alcoholic and a gambling addict.' 

Abel added that the claim had 'no basis in reality', and instead 'raised alarm about whether Jones was in the midst of a mental breakdown.'

Jones' camp added that Abel's latest filing ‘offers no evidence for her claims, and many are recycled'. 

Abel's court document said: ‘Although Jones had always been volatile, she now appeared to be actively unraveling.'

‘On a different occasion, Jones announced, again per her psychic, that Abel would soon be pregnant with twins, humiliating and infuriating Abel, who—Jones knew—had struggled with fertility issues,' the filing said.

Jones' lawyers shot back, calling the new claims 'just distraction and noise' and 'a few debunked conspiracy theories', in a scathing statement to DailyMail.com. 

The two bombshell documents filed in New York federal court totaled a combined 125 pages. 

The same night the documents were filed, Lively attended the TIME100 all-star gala in New York City, following her controversial inclusion on the publication's Most Influential People list. She was joined by her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, at the event.

She sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly, who told DailyMail.com Blake 'shouldn't be here.'

Megyn accused her of 'bastardiz[ing] Me Too allegations' in her quest to sue Baldoni for sexual harassment, which he has denied.

The latest filings in the legal war were made in Jones' lawsuit against Abel.

After Lively and Baldoni's legal battle exploded into the courts in December, Jones sued her former staffer Abel in January claiming that Abel plotted behind her back to steal Baldoni as a client, and falsely pinned an alleged smear campaign against Lively on Jones.

Trial-watchers were expecting a run-of-the mill filing this evening: a boilerplate denial of Jones' claims.

But instead, Baldoni and Abel's lawyer Bryan Freedman went on the offensive.

Abel's filing accused Jones of stealing her personal data from her Jonesworks PR firm company phone when she announced she was quitting in July 2024.

They accused Jones of snooping on Abel's private messages all the way until January this year, and plotting a 'flagrant abuse of process' with Lively to generate a subpoena from a 'sham lawsuit' to cover up Jones allegedly leaking messages to Lively

She claimed Jones had illicit access to all her personal texts through her iCloud account – until as recently as January this year.

Abel claimed the alleged snooping amounted to a ‘violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act', ‘violations of Stored Communications Act' and ‘violations of the Federal Wiretap Act'.

The claws were out in the filing, with Abel giving a damning description of Jones' workplace.

She claimed morale at Jonesworks was ‘Abysmal', that it ‘had a toxic workplace culture', and staff ‘constantly gossiped and complained'.

Abel even claimed Jones would ‘regularly turn on deafening music so that she could berate her employees free from scrutiny.'

She quoted an unnamed former employee allegedly saying ‘I don't think there was one day in the office that someone wasn't crying.'

Abel claimed that when she left and Jones seized her company phone, the PR boss ‘had been sharing her private text messages with the entire office, mocking and disparaging her.'

The filing even claimed Jones ‘retained access to Abel's iCloud for multiple months thereafter, monitoring and intercepting her private communications in real-time [...] not only with her clients, fiancé, doctors, parents, and friends but also with the undersigned counsel.'

In their filings, both Abel and Wayfarer cited another twist in the case that was revealed by DailyMail.com last week.

DailyMail.com uncovered how Lively used her little-known company Vanzan Inc. to quietly file a mysterious lawsuit against unnamed defendants in September last year, months before her public legal battle with Baldoni began.

She then used the lawsuit to secretly issue a subpoena to Jones for embarrassing texts between Baldoni, Abel and his crisis PR Melissa Nathan, without alerting any of them.

The texts, allegedly showing a smear campaign plot against Lively, were used in her bombshell California legal complaint in December that kicked off the public legal war between the two Hollywood stars, and were shared with the New York Times in an explosive article the next day.

In their legal filing on Thursday night, Abel and Wayfarer slammed the tactic as a ‘sham lawsuit' and ‘nothing more than a transparent ploy to obtain subpoena power.'

Abel called it a ‘flagrant abuse of process'.

‘Since there were no identifiable parties and no party had been served, the subpoenas were issued without notice, depriving Abel of any knowledge of the subpoena, much less the opportunity to object,' her filing said.

She accused Jones of having already leaked texts with Lively's team – and using the secret Vanzan lawsuit to create ‘a veneer of legitimacy' and ‘plausible deniability'.

‘As a result of Jones' malicious scheme, Abel's life has been turned upside down,' her filing said.

‘In an unimaginable invasion of Abel's privacy and dignity, Jones and the Lively Parties now possess the full contents of Abel's iCloud and email accounts, including her photos, text messages, and emails. Abel lives in fear of what is to come, given the vast troves of personal data in the possession of these hostile actors.'

Wayfarer's filing accused Jones of a ‘breach of contract' for giving up the messages, claiming it violated the ‘confidentiality provision' by ‘voluntarily and maliciously disclosing Confidential Information'.

In her December complaint, Lively claimed Baldoni had acted unprofessionally on the set of the domestic abuse movie It Ends With Us in which the pair starred and Baldoni also directed

As well as two counts of ‘Breach of contract', they accused Jones of ‘breach of implied covenant' and defamation.

Jones' lawyers hit back with statements to DailyMail.com slamming the new claims as a distraction from what they say was a straightforward breach of contract by Abel.

Jones' attorney Kristin Tahler accused Freedman of ‘reversing course, dropping previously touted claims, presenting zero new evidence'.

Tahler was referring to Abel's previous stance that she had suffered ‘false imprisonment', trapped at the Jonesworks office and intimidated into signing documents and giving up her company phone – a claim that did not appear in the new filings on Thursday.

‘This case will be decided on the mountain of evidence that demonstrates Wayfarer Studios and Ms. Abel deliberately breached their contracts with Jonesworks, which the defendants have conspicuously failed to rebut,' fellow attorney Maaren Shah added.

‘The defendants' weak attempt to assemble their own case against Ms. Jones amounts to nothing more than a few debunked conspiracy theories and media gimmicks that have no basis in fact or evidence.'

Until DailyMail.com's discovery of the Vanzan lawsuit, the timeline of the courtroom battle between Lively and Baldoni appeared to begin in December, when she filed a California Civil Rights Department complaint and a federal lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation.

Lively claimed he had acted unprofessionally on the set of the domestic abuse movie It Ends With Us in which the pair starred and Baldoni also directed.

She also accused Baldoni and his team of publicists of launching a smear campaign against her amid the release of the film last summer.

Baldoni filed a countersuit in January. Both parties deny the allegations against them.

The New York Times published an explosive story about the alleged sexual harassment and smear campaign immediately after Lively's California filing, referring extensively to the embarrassing texts between Baldoni's publicists obtained by Lively's lawyers.

The paper reported that the texts included in Lively's filing had been obtained by a subpoena – a curious detail that raised eyebrows at the time.

Freedman pointed out that he wasn't aware of a subpoena and that none of his clients had been subpoenaed in the matter at that stage.

The latest salvo comes on top of months of claims and counterclaims over the fallout from It Ends With Us, with lawyers for both Lively and Baldoni publicly slugging it out.

The film at the heart of the feud, based on the 2016 bestseller by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and was a box office hit 

Many of the revelations that have emerged have proved highly embarrassing, not least Lively memorably comparing herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi and referring to husband Ryan and pal Taylor Swift as 'my dragons'.

Some of her more lurid claims also came under scrutiny, not least her assertation that Baldoni had sexually harassed her by nuzzling her neck during a scene and commenting on how she smells – none of which was recorded due to microphones being turned off.

But footage first published DailyMail.com revealed that it did have audio which picked up a full account of the conversation and revealed that it had been about the smell of Lively's fake tan.

She also faced criticism for serving legal papers to Baldoni's team in the middle of the devastating wildfires that ripped through Los Angeles in early January.

Other revelations from the initial complaint included Lively's alleged failure to read the novel on which It Ends With Us is based until long after filming had begun.

Baldoni's cross-complaint also revealed that he and his family had been forced to spend the premiere of It Ends With Us sitting in a basement because Lively refused to allow him to be in the same room as her.
