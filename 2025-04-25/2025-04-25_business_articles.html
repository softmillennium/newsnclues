                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty Friday in New York federal court to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione faces a possible death sentence in the case if he is convicted in the federal case of murdering Thompson, who was gunned down on a Manhattan street in December. The 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate is separately charged in New York state court with the slaying. Mangione is accused of fatally shooting Thompson on Dec. 4 as the CEO was walking into the Hilton Hotel in midtown. UnitedHealth Group, the parent of Thompson's health insurance giant, was hosting an event for investors at the hotel that day. Mangione was arrested five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He is charged U.S. District Court in Manhattan with murder through use of a firearm, two counts of stalking, and a firearms offence. Mangione appeared there Friday before Judge Margaret Garnett to enter his plea. In a court filing Thursday, prosecutors told Garnett there were several factors to warrant imposing a death sentence in the case, including the allegation that Mangione "intentionally killed" Thompson, and "that the killing required "substantial planning and premeditation." "Mangione presents a future danger because he expressed intent to target an entire industry, and rally political and social opposition to that industry, by engaging in an act of lethal violence; and he took steps to evade law enforcement, flee New York City immediately after the murder, and cross state lines while armed with a privately manufactured firearm and silencer." U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on April 1 first revealed that the Justice Department wanted to have Mangione executed if he is convicted. "Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America," Bondi said in a statement that day. Mangione's lawyers in an April 11 court filing asked Judge Garnett to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, arguing that Bondi had violated the defendant's rights to due process and that the attorney general had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors with her public statement. On Friday, Garnett warned lawyers in the case to refrain from "public commentary that could impede Mangione's right to a fair trial. "I'm specifically directing the government to convey my directive to Mr. Clayton and request that he convey the same to Attorney General Bondi and her associates at main Justice," Garnett said. Jay Clayton is the interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney, and "main Justice" is a reference to the Justice Department and its headquarters in Washington, D.C.

The AI Race:

Microsoft Corp. is rolling out its controversial Recall feature to high-end Windows PCs, betting a record of what users do on their computers will be seen as more of a benefit than a privacy risk.

The feature, which takes searchable snapshots of a PC screen every few seconds and has added safeguards, will be available to users of Microsoft's AI-branded PCs starting on Friday, the company said in a blog post. Microsoft also announced beefed-up search and a tool that lets users quickly summon artificially intelligent assistants to help edit text or photos. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge on Friday after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest. FBI Director Kash Patel announced in an X post that Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstruction for allegedly assisting Eduardo Flores-Ruiz in avoiding arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week. Marshals Service spokeswoman confirmed to CNBC that Dugan was arrested at about 8:30 a.m. local time on courthouse property. Dugan was released on bond after making her initial appearance Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee before Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries, according to her case docket. Dugan's "arraignment and plea" proceeding is set for May 15, the docket shows. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Chief Judge Carl Ashley told NBC that the judicial code of conduct restricts him from commenting on the matter, but said Dugan's court calendar "will be covered by another judge as needed." Patel in his tweet wrote that the FBI believes Dugan "intentionally misdirected federal agents away" from Flores-Ruiz as agents were attempting to arrest him at her courthouse. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Tuesday that the FBI was looking into Dugan's conduct surrounding an attempted arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at her courthouse on April 18. On that day, Dugan "became visibly angry" after learning that ICE agents were waiting in the hallway to arrest Flores-Ruiz after a hearing in his criminal battery case, according to a sworn affidavit unsealed Friday. Dugan and another judge entered the hallway and confronted the arrest team, telling one deportation officer that he needed a judicial warrant to make an arrest instead of an "administrative warrant." After returning to her courtroom, Dugan "escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel" through a jury door, which leads to a nonpublic area of the building, the affidavit stated, citing "multiple witnesses." After being told that Flores-Ruiz was in front of the courthouse, agents ran toward him and identified themselves as law enforcement officers. "Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued," according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and detained," it alleged. Dugan's criminal complaint shows she has been charged with concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, and obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a federal department or agency. ICE agents have previously arrested people in the courthouse hallways in March and April, according to the Journal Sentinel. ICE did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to NBC, "The days of actively aiding and abetting illegal aliens invading our country are over." "The Trump administration will never waver on putting Americans and America First with a no-nonsense approach to immigration enforcement. In this administration, anyone who commits crimes exposes themselves to criminal liability," Desai said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal authorities have arrested a former New Mexico judge and a Wisconsin judge in two separate cases, accusing them of interfering with Trump administration immigration enforcement efforts. Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested Friday morning and charged with obstruction for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest after he appeared in her courtroom last week. Dugan's arrest came one day after federal authorities arrested a former New Mexico judge and his wife on charges related to them reportedly harboring an undocumented immigrant with alleged ties to the notorious gang Tren de Aragua. Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano, who resigned last month, and Nancy Cano both face charges of tampering with evidence, jail records show.

Donald Trump

President Donald Trump said he would “absolutely” sign a bill banning congressional stock trading, saying he was concerned lawmakers could be using insider information for an advantage.

“I would be okay with it,” Trump said in an interview with Time Magazine that published Friday. “If they send that to me, I would do it.”</p>

Foreign investors have sold $63 billion of US equities since the start of March, Goldman Sachs strategists estimate, noting that the data from high-frequency fund flows suggest that European investors have been driving the selling, while other regions have continued to buy US stocks.

“This dynamic poses a substantial risk to equity valuations because foreign investors entered 2025 with a record 18% ownership share of US equities,” the portfolio strategy team lead by Daniel Chavez writes in a note to clients.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anti-Elon Musk and anti-Tesla protesters are celebrating a win after the automaker's earnings miss on Tuesday. "Today's earnings report sends a very clear message," the Tesla Takedown organization wrote in an email on Tuesday. In the follow-up call, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that vandalism and anti-Tesla hostility "had an impact in certain markets." Musk also announced during the call that he plans to take a significant step back from his role with DOGE starting next month. Tesla Takedown told Business Insider that its post-earnings email announcement had an open rate of over 53%, an increase from the roughly 30% average open rate it had in its four previous emails. The organization also said that more than 30 new protests were added to its Action Network page within about 24 hours of the earnings release. During the same period, it said its follower count on Bluesky rose by 10% to 15%, compared to its typical weekly growth on social media of less than 5%. The group, which has organized hundreds of protests in the past few months against Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, also said in a press release that "the movement to hold Musk accountable for attacks" on public services will move beyond Tesla. "Tesla Takedown has already started laying the groundwork to expand Tesla Takedown efforts to target other Musk businesses including SpaceX, Starlink, X and xAI," the organization said in the statement. Other similar protest movements against Musk show little sign of slowing down.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gwyneth Paltrow, 52, is ditching her strict paleo diet. On the Tuesday episode of her "Goop" podcast, Paltrow spoke about how her relationship with food has changed over the years. "I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time. Part of it was because of her dad's health, she said: "I think that I was really trying to heal my dad by proxy, and he just didn't really want anything to do with it." Her father died in 2002 after battling throat cancer. "But the beauty of it, for me, was that I really deepened my connection with food and this whole philosophy around macrobiotics, which is essentially just how they eat in the mountains of Japan," Paltrow said. Although the "Shakespeare in Love" star says that she "might have gotten a little didactic about it," all she wanted to do was share her eating philosophy with everyone she knew. "I think I was just so amazed that, you know, we had this power in our hands that if we treated ourselves well, hydrated, and ate whole foods, we could just feel so much better," Paltrow said. "But it's the reason Brad and I became paleo a few years ago now, although I'm a little sick of it, if I'm honest, and getting back into eating some sourdough bread and some cheese," Paltrow said. A little pasta, after being strict with it for so long." "But again, I think it's a good sort of template, right? A paleo diet is supposed to be based on the way ancient human ancestors ate and includes foods such as lean meats, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Paltrow's comments come months after her company, Goop, told Women's Wear Daily that it was restructuring. Paltrow has previously detailed her strict diet and wellness routine during an interview for "The Art of Being Well" podcast in 2023. Her restrictive diet, which drew widespread criticism from internet users and dietitians, included coffee in the mornings, bone broth for lunch, and a paleo diet for dinner. A representative for Paltrow did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.</p>
