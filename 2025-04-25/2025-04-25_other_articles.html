                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If the musical acts at Coachella skew too young for you (or if that festival has become overly commercialized and overly expensive), fret not. For Gen Xers and Elder Millennials - plus younger folks who internalized their taste from those groups - you have festival options. The top choice would be Best Friends Forever because, well, look at this incredible lineup: A post shared by Best Friends Forever (@bestfriendsforeverfest) Or, perhaps, Vegas isn't for you but you like the idea of hanging out in a small town inland from Seattle? A new festival is debuting this September, and it's being fronted by none other than Modest Mouse. Psychic Salamander is taking place September 13 and 14 at, in an old-school fashion, a farm. Some artists, such as Australian indie act Courtney Barnett, aren't of that era, that is where much of the drive is. Beyond Modest Mouse, there's Sleater-Kinney, Yo La Tengo, and Built to Spill. Nothing says "Gen X" like "The Flaming Lips playing their 1999 album in its entirety." This is a solid lineup and not one that threatens to get unwieldy. Tickets go on sale Friday, May 2 at 10:00am PT. Chris Morgan is a Detroit-based culture writer who has somehow managed to justify getting his BA in Film Studies. He has written about sports and entertainment across various internet platforms for years and is also the author of three books about '90s television.</p>

Find out the answers to these questions and more with Psychology Today. Conspiracy beliefs often take hold because it is easier for our brain to comprehend one explanation, one villain, or one horrific theme, rather than a multitude of competing theories, which can be more disorienting. "Helter Skelter," a phrase from the Beatles' White Album, written the year before, was taken as an apocalyptic vision intended for Charles Manson and members of his so-called "family." Vincent Bugliosi used "race war" as the theme of his prosecution case against Manson. O'Brien and Morris give prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi's theory short shrift. They explore the idea that Charles Manson was involved with the CIA's experiments on mind control. The MK-ULTRA and Manson connection is credible. However, there is no definitive proof, just a lot of speculation and innuendos. Did the MK Ultra psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Jolyon West, who was running a CIA-funded Haight Ashbury medical clinic, influence Manson during their overlapping time in the Haight Ashbury, the two years before the murders? It is a fact that Manson had his "family" go for treatment of STDs and pregnancy at the same clinic. It is a fact that the CIA and Manson were both interested in LSD. Dr. West's files from this period and others have gone missing. As a U.S. Air Force medical director during the Korean War, Dr. West undertook the study of 36 out of 59 U.S. airmen returned from North Korean prison, convinced they had exposed Korean civilians to germ warfare. Speculations were that the soldiers had been brainwashed. MK Ultra, a new CIA program, contracted Dr. West to develop experiments using hypnosis and psychotropics to protect our soldiers from mind control. The program enlarged and funded universities and private psychiatrists with the task of developing techniques for mind control, especially the use of LSD, which was given to subjects without their knowledge. The MK Ultra program closed down in 1964. Errol Morris's previous documentary, Wormwood  (2017), examines issues surrounding the death in 1952 of MK Ultra scientist Frank Olsen and the role that LSD played in his murder, initially attributed to suicidal depression. It took dozens of years for Frank Olsen's son to solve this case. Charles Manson was a drug dealer who used LSD, the mind-altering counterculture drug of the 1960s. His "family" was perpetually stoned, though Manson less so, to maintain absolute control. Manson failed to accept responsibility for his actions. Their rootlessness primed them for a magnetic attachment to a manipulative, grandiose man such as Charles Manson. No surprise that Woodstock followed just a few days after the murders. The APA listed brainwashing under dissociative disorders, though it was not an official diagnosis until 1980. "While "brainwashing" is a term often used to describe coercive persuasion, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) includes "Identity Disturbance due to Prolonged and Intense Coercive Persuasion" under its "Other Specified Dissociative Disorder" (OSDD) category, which can be a result of experiences like brainwashing." International Journal of Coercion, Abuse, and Manipulation, Volume 8, 2025, Jodi. Mind Control was not new: In 1950, author and authority on psychological warfare Edward Hunter (1902-1978) coined the word brainwashing from the Chinese. Centuries later, "Mao Zedong's Red Army used terrifying ancient techniques to turn the Chinese people into mindless, Communist automatons. “Brainwashing” was a literal translation from the Mandarin words for wash (xi) and brain (nao).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The newfound tomb of an Egyptian prince has a false door, which ancient people viewed as an "entry" and "exit" for souls in the afterlife, researchers say. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Archaeologists in Egypt have discovered the 4,400-year-old tomb of a prince whose burial has a giant "false" pink door to enable souls to enter and exit. The tomb belongs to Prince Userefre, also spelled Waser-If-Re, the son of King Userkaf, also spelled Wserkaf a pharaoh who reigned around 2465 to 2458 B.C. "Previous to this discovery, we didn't even know he existed," Ronald Leprohon, professor emeritus of Egyptology at the University of Toronto who was not involved with the excavation, told Live Science in an email. Leprohon noted that the prince's name may have meant "Re is powerful." Re (also spelled Ra) was a sun god in ancient Egypt. The giant false door, which is made of pink granite, is about 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) high and 3.8 feet (1.2 m) wide, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. The door's immense size and construction from pink granite is remarkable, experts said. "This is the first time that a false door like this was found in Saqqara" Zahi Hawass, a former antiquities minister who is leading excavations at the tomb, told Live Science in an email. The man's status as a prince with important titles explains why a false door like this was built for him, Hawass said. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Melanie Pitkin, a senior curator at the Chau Chak Wing Museum at the University of Sydney who was not involved with the excavation, said in an email that "at this time, false doors are most commonly made from limestone, which was a ubiquitous resource in Egypt. A red granite offering table was found near the false door. Leprohon noted that in ancient Egypt, people sometimes left food offerings on offering tables and believed that the deceased could "magically" eat "the offerings deposited on the so-called offering table in front of it." At this time, a statue depicting King Djoser (reign circa 2630 to 2611 B.C.) along with his wife and children was placed within it, the statement said. In front of them is a black granite statue that also dates to the third dynasty, Hawass said. Ann Macy Roth, a clinical professor of Egyptology at New York University who was not involved with the excavation, said that the sculptures from the third dynasty are remarkable as "there is very little sculpture from that era." Roth noted that prior to this discovery, "I can only think of one piece that represents a woman," so the statue depicting Djoser's wife and daughters is extraordinary. Excavations are ongoing, and the prince's burial chamber has not yet been found. "We only found a part of the tomb," Hawass noted. —Why are so many ancient Egyptians buried at the Saqqara necropolis? —4,100-year-old tomb of doctor who treated pharaohs discovered at Saqqara She told Live Science in an email that "it's "a nice puzzle piece for understanding a transformative moment in ancient Egypt's political and religious history — between the centralized power of the Fourth Dynasty and the perhaps more diversified elite power structures of the Fifth."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pinkvilla recently conducted a poll in which fans chose the upcoming supernatural Bollywood movie that they were most excited about, and here are the results. Some horror comedies and supernatural movies have made waves in Hindi cinema over the past few years. There are many films of this genre that the audience can look forward to in the future as well. Pinkvilla recently conducted a poll to allow the fans to choose the upcoming supernatural Bollywood movie that they were most excited about. Readers were asked to select between four options: Thama, Naagzilla, Bhediya 2, and Stree 3. According to the voting of three days, fans are most excited about Kartik Aaryan's recently announced creature comedy Naagzilla. It secured 52.08% of the votes, winning by a huge margin. Stree 3 came third with 16.67%, while Bhediya 2 got 10.42% of the votes. It is being helmed by Fukrey director Mrighdeep Singh Lamba. The film is presented by Dharma Productions and Mahaveer Jain Films. Kartik Aaryan will be seen as Preyamvadeshwar Pyare Chand, a shape-shifting snake. His own skin was covered in snake scales. The caption of the post read, “Insanon wali picharein toh bahut dekh leen, ab dekho naagon wali pichchar (You have seen a lot of movies about humans, now watch a film on snakes). Naagzilla is slated to release in cinemas on August 14, 2026. ALSO READ: POLL: Which Ananya Panday character is your favorite?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But so far, no solid evidence of life has ever been found beyond the Earth. A paper published in April 2025 claimed to detect a signature of life in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. And while this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers – including the paper's authors – aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists. The astronomer Carl Sagan used the phrase, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” in regard to searching for alien life. I'm an astronomer who has written a book about astrobiology. Over my career, I've seen some compelling scientific discoveries. There are three criteria for a scientific result to represent a true discovery and not be subject to uncertainty and doubt. How does the claim of life on K2-18b measure up? First, the experiment needs to measure a meaningful and important quantity. Researchers observed K2-18b's atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope and saw a spectral feature that they identified as dimethyl sulfide. However, it can also arise by other means, so this single molecule is not conclusive proof of life. Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons. The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise. There are many molecules that could create a feature in the same spectral range. For example, physicists at CERN gathered data patiently for two years until they had a 5-sigma detection of the Higgs boson particle, leading to a Nobel Prize one year later in 2013. Results are considered reliable when they've been repeated – ideally corroborated by other investigators or confirmed using a different instrument. For K2-18b, this might mean detecting other molecules that indicate biology, such as oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. Without more and better data, most researchers are viewing the claim of life on K2-18b with skepticism. In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life much closer to home, on the planet Mars. Over a century ago, retired Boston merchant turned astronomer Percival Lowell claimed that linear features he saw on the surface of Mars were canals, constructed by a dying civilization to transport water from the poles to the equator. Artificial waterways on Mars would certainly have been a major discovery, but this example failed the other two criteria: strong evidence and repeatability. In 1996, NASA held a press conference where a team of scientists presented evidence for biology in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Their evidence included an evocative image that seemed to show microfossils in the meteorite. However, scientists have come up with explanations for the meteorite's unusual features that do not involve biology. Like dimethyl sulfide and oxygen, methane on Earth is made primarily – but not exclusively – by life. Different spacecraft and rovers on the Martian surface have returned conflicting results, where a detection with one spacecraft was not confirmed by another. The low level and variability of methane on Mars is still a mystery. Detecting microbial life on Mars or an exoplanet would be dramatic, but the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations would be truly spectacular. In 2017, a rocky, cigar-shaped object called ‘Oumuamua was the first known interstellar object to visit the solar system. ‘Oumuamua's strange shape and trajectory led Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb to argue that it was an alien artifact. However, the object has already left the solar system, so there's no chance for astronomers to observe it again. And some researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that it's just a comet. While many scientists think we aren't alone, given the enormous amount of habitable real estate beyond Earth, no detection has cleared the threshold enunciated by Carl Sagan. These same criteria apply to research about the entire universe. One particular concern in cosmology is the fact that, unlike the case of planets, there is only one universe to study. Cosmologists call this event inflation, and it is invoked to explain why the universe is now smooth and flat. In 2014, astronomers claimed to have found evidence for inflation in a subtle signal from microwaves left over after the Big Bang. Within a year, however, the team retracted the result because the signal had a mundane explanation: They had confused dust in our galaxy with a signature of inflation. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was expanding. Then, in 1998, evidence emerged that this cosmic expansion is accelerating. Two research groups used supernovae to separately trace the expansion. In a friendly rivalry, they used different sets of supernovae but got the same result. Independent corroboration increased their confidence that the universe was accelerating. They called the force behind this accelerating expansion dark energy and received a Nobel Prize in 2011 for its discovery.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It seems Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's legal feud is getting more dramatic than ever. Now, Stephanie Jones, who was Justin Baldoni's former publicist, is facing 14 new claims that are raising eyebrows, according to the Daily Mail. Baldoni's Wayfarer company and his publicist for the It Ends With Us movie, Jennifer Abel, have filed new allegations against Jones. The new filing also includes claims from Abel alleging that Jones made “bizarre” statements about her to employees, based on supposed information from “psychic readings.” Abel stated, “In one instance, Jones announced to my subordinates that she had learned through psychic readings that I was an alcoholic and a gambling addict,” per the outlet. Abel reportedly mentioned that the claim had no “basis in reality,” and instead raised concerns over whether Jones was experiencing a “mental breakdown.” Abel's court filing also stated, “Although Jones had always been volatile, she now appeared to be actively unraveling.” It added, “On a different occasion, Jones announced, again per her psychic, that Abel would soon be pregnant with twins, humiliating and infuriating Abel, who, Jones knew, had struggled with fertility issues.” ALSO READ: Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Spotted on Date Amid Looming Legal Drama Involving Justin Baldoni With 1 year of entertainment journalism experience at Pinkvilla, she brings a sharp eye to the latest happenings in pop culture, delivering insightful and engaging content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to revisit a misunderstood black hole thought to be gulping matter 40 times faster than the theoretical limit. It turns out, dust may have obscured the truth. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A "fast-feeding" black hole that appeared to defy physics is actually pretty ordinary, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal. In November 2024, astronomers using JWST reported that they'd found a black hole from the early universe that appeared to be gorging on matter 40 times faster than theoretically possible. However, new research suggests that this excessive eating rate may have been an overestimation. In an accreting black hole, the infalling material is compressed and heated, causing it to emit high-energy radiation such as X-rays that push material away. When the radiation pressure becomes high enough to overpower gravity, the black hole stops accreting matter and thus limits how brightly it shines. However, under certain conditions, a black hole can continue to accrete matter beyond this limit — a process known as super-Eddington accretion. The observations from last year suggested that LID-568 was undergoing super-Eddington accretion at nearly 40 times greater than expected. LID-568 existed just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang — which is not enough time for this black hole to have grown this big. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. "For a heavily dust-obscured object like LID-568, it is very important that dust extinction is corrected properly," said study co-author Myungshin Im, director of the Seoul National University Astronomy Research Center told Live Science in an email. If this effect is not properly accounted for, it can lead to inaccurate calculations of the black hole's mass, which, in turn, affects the Eddington limit associated with it. Infrared radiation is much less affected by dust than optical light, which was used in the previous study for black hole mass measurement. This different approach allowed them to calculate the black hole's mass to be just under a billion solar masses — about 40 times greater than the previous estimate. Using this revised black hole mass, the Eddington luminosity was recalculated. —Newly 'awakened' black hole is releasing 100 times more energy than scientists have ever seen before —Incredible photo shows supermassive black hole blowing a jet of matter into interstellar space Consequently, LID-568's current feeding habits cannot be attributed to the growth of supermassive black holes, Im said. Astronomers have been aware of this issue in the case of distant galaxies and usually apply corrections for dust extinction in their measurements. However, for "active galactic nuclei" (AGN) — which contain actively feeding black holes at their centers that dominate the AGN's brightness and are surrounded by complex dust environments — "dust extinction correction has not been thoroughly applied yet," Im said. The team's approach could lead to a better understanding of dust-obscured black holes in a new class of galaxies called "little red dots," which were recently discovered through JWST observations, the team explained in their paper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Baldoni's legal battle with Blake Lively has taken a bizarre new twist, with lawyers launching 14 new claims against his embattled former publicist, Stephanie Jones, on Thursday. Baldoni's, 41, movie company, Wayfarer, and his publicist for the film It Ends With Us, Jennifer Abel, both filed new claims including a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, defamation, and fraud against Jones. They accused Jones of snooping on Abel's private messages all the way until January this year, and plotting a 'flagrant abuse of process' with Lively, 37, to generate a subpoena from a 'sham lawsuit' to cover up Jones allegedly leaking messages to Lively. Justin Baldoni's, 41, legal battle with Blake Lively, 37, has taken a bizarre new twist, with lawyers launching 14 new claims against his embattled former publicist Stephanie Jones Jones' camp added that Abel's latest filing ‘offers no evidence for her claims, and many are recycled'. Abel's court document said: ‘Although Jones had always been volatile, she now appeared to be actively unraveling.' ‘On a different occasion, Jones announced, again per her psychic, that Abel would soon be pregnant with twins, humiliating and infuriating Abel, who—Jones knew—had struggled with fertility issues,' the filing said. The two bombshell documents filed in New York federal court totaled a combined 125 pages. She was joined by her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, at the event. She sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly, who told DailyMail.com Blake 'shouldn't be here.' After Lively and Baldoni's legal battle exploded into the courts in December, Jones sued her former staffer Abel in January claiming that Abel plotted behind her back to steal Baldoni as a client, and falsely pinned an alleged smear campaign against Lively on Jones. But instead, Baldoni and Abel's lawyer Bryan Freedman went on the offensive. Abel's filing accused Jones of stealing her personal data from her Jonesworks PR firm company phone when she announced she was quitting in July 2024. Baldoni's movie company Wayfarer and his publicist for the film It Ends With Us, Jennifer Abel, both filed new claims including a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, breach of contract, defamation, and fraud against Jones (pictured) Abel's new filing accuses Jones of 'bizarre' claims to staff, based on 'psychic readings,' including false accusations about Abel (pictured) being 'an alcoholic and a gambling addict', which Abel says caused alarm about Jones being 'in the midst of a mental breakdown' They accused Jones of snooping on Abel's private messages all the way until January this year, and plotting a 'flagrant abuse of process' with Lively to generate a subpoena from a 'sham lawsuit' to cover up Jones allegedly leaking messages to Lively Abel even claimed Jones would ‘regularly turn on deafening music so that she could berate her employees free from scrutiny.' She quoted an unnamed former employee allegedly saying ‘I don't think there was one day in the office that someone wasn't crying.' The filing even claimed Jones ‘retained access to Abel's iCloud for multiple months thereafter, monitoring and intercepting her private communications in real-time [...] not only with her clients, fiancé, doctors, parents, and friends but also with the undersigned counsel.' After Lively and Baldoni's legal battle exploded into the courts in December, Jones sued her former staffer Abel in January claiming that Abel plotted behind her back to steal Baldoni as a client, and falsely pinned an alleged smear campaign against Lively on Jones Abel's filing accused Jones of stealing her personal data from her Jonesworks PR firm company phone when she announced she was quitting in July 2024 DailyMail.com uncovered how Lively used her little-known company Vanzan Inc. to quietly file a mysterious lawsuit against unnamed defendants in September last year, months before her public legal battle with Baldoni began She then used the lawsuit to secretly issue a subpoena to Jones for embarrassing texts between Baldoni, Abel and his crisis PR Melissa Nathan, without alerting any of them. Public records for Vanzan Inc list a business address in New York City and its CEO as 'Blake Reynolds' DailyMail.com uncovered how Lively used her little-known company Vanzan Inc. to quietly file a mysterious lawsuit against unnamed defendants in September last year, months before her public legal battle with Baldoni began. She then used the lawsuit to secretly issue a subpoena to Jones for embarrassing texts between Baldoni, Abel and his crisis PR Melissa Nathan, without alerting any of them. In their legal filing on Thursday night, Abel and Wayfarer slammed the tactic as a ‘sham lawsuit' and ‘nothing more than a transparent ploy to obtain subpoena power.' She accused Jones of having already leaked texts with Lively's team – and using the secret Vanzan lawsuit to create ‘a veneer of legitimacy' and ‘plausible deniability'. ‘As a result of Jones' malicious scheme, Abel's life has been turned upside down,' her filing said. Wayfarer's filing accused Jones of a ‘breach of contract' for giving up the messages, claiming it violated the ‘confidentiality provision' by ‘voluntarily and maliciously disclosing Confidential Information'. She was joined by her husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, at the event Lively sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly, who told DailyMail.com Blake 'shouldn't be here.' Jones' lawyers hit back with statements to DailyMail.com slamming the new claims as a distraction from what they say was a straightforward breach of contract by Abel. Jones' attorney Kristin Tahler accused Freedman of ‘reversing course, dropping previously touted claims, presenting zero new evidence'. Tahler was referring to Abel's previous stance that she had suffered ‘false imprisonment', trapped at the Jonesworks office and intimidated into signing documents and giving up her company phone – a claim that did not appear in the new filings on Thursday. ‘This case will be decided on the mountain of evidence that demonstrates Wayfarer Studios and Ms. Abel deliberately breached their contracts with Jonesworks, which the defendants have conspicuously failed to rebut,' fellow attorney Maaren Shah added. ‘The defendants' weak attempt to assemble their own case against Ms. Jones amounts to nothing more than a few debunked conspiracy theories and media gimmicks that have no basis in fact or evidence.' Until DailyMail.com's discovery of the Vanzan lawsuit, the timeline of the courtroom battle between Lively and Baldoni appeared to begin in December, when she filed a California Civil Rights Department complaint and a federal lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation. The latest salvo comes on top of months of claims and counterclaims over the fallout from It Ends With Us, with lawyers for both Lively and Baldoni publicly slugging it out. Many of the revelations that have emerged have proved highly embarrassing, not least Lively memorably comparing herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi and referring to husband Ryan and pal Taylor Swift as 'my dragons'. But footage first published DailyMail.com revealed that it did have audio which picked up a full account of the conversation and revealed that it had been about the smell of Lively's fake tan. She also faced criticism for serving legal papers to Baldoni's team in the middle of the devastating wildfires that ripped through Los Angeles in early January. Other revelations from the initial complaint included Lively's alleged failure to read the novel on which It Ends With Us is based until long after filming had begun. Baldoni's cross-complaint also revealed that he and his family had been forced to spend the premiere of It Ends With Us sitting in a basement because Lively refused to allow him to be in the same room as her.
