                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pregnant women living with opioid use disorder (OUD) and their infants had significantly better health outcomes when treated with buprenorphine, according to a new study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. Pregnant women who received buprenorphine, a medication used to treat OUD, were less likely to have a preterm birth, face serious health complications, or have their infants hospitalized in the NICU compared to those who did not receive the treatment, the study found. We know that treatment with medications like buprenorphine substantially reduces the risk of overdose death for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, but its benefits to newborns have not been well understood. We found a profound reduction in preterm birth among infants whose mothers were treated with buprenorphine, which can have a lifelong impact." Despite rates of OUD in pregnant women increasing more than fivefold from 1999 to 2017, more than half still do not receive treatment, researchers said. Preterm birth, a growing public health issue, increases the risk of health problems in children, including respiratory issues, infections, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing problems. Those receiving buprenorphine were significantly less likely to be Black. "Disparities in access to buprenorphine significantly affect vulnerable populations, including pregnant women," said Sunaya Krishnapura, graduating medical student at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and presenting author. "Our findings underscore the urgent need for policies that expand treatment access in the United States to ensure a healthy pregnancy and future for mothers and infants." The study examined more than 14,000 pregnant women with OUD who were enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid between 2010 and 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers using next-generation DNA sequencing have identified four specific genes whose mutations are linked to the development and progression of lethal stomach cancers. This could potentially enable doctors to offer targeted treatments that would spare many patients from unnecessarily aggressive procedures, according to a study scheduled for presentation at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2025. Today, most gastric cancers are treated the same way - with surgery and chemotherapy - but we hope to identify key molecular differences so we can tailor treatment to the biology of each patient's tumor." Ulysses Ribeiro, MD, PhD, study's lead author and professor at the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo, Brazil Researchers analyzed 21 genes in tumor samples from 87 patients who had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for gastric cancer and then tracked how the mutations related to survival. About one-third of the patients had changes in a specific combination of four genes - BRCA2, CDH1, RHOA, and TP53 - and these patients were more likely to experience a return of their cancer or die from the disease. Dr. Ribeiro said the findings support the idea that a more personalized approach - guided by the genetic makeup of each patient's tumor - may lead to better outcomes and, for some patients, less aggressive treatment. That step could make it easier and more affordable to screen tumors for high-risk features in the future. Most past studies have been conducted in East Asia, where the disease is more common. While more research is needed before these findings change medical practice, they offer a promising path forward, Dr. Ribeiro said. "We believe that these findings move us closer to more personalized treatment based on each tumor's biology." Dr. Ribeiro will present data from the study, "Next-generation DNA sequencing identifies somatic mutations associated to prognosis in gastric cancer patients," abstract 152, at 10:24 a.m. PDT, Saturday, May 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young children with chronic conditions are more likely to be hospitalized for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) than healthy children, according to a new study. Toddlers with chronic conditions are hospitalized for RSV at twice the rate as healthy toddlers over their first two seasons. The risk was highest for children born very prematurely under 28 weeks of gestation, or with conditions affecting multiple organs, the lungs, heart, or digestive system. Researchers recommend that children with those specific conditions receive immunization against RSV in their first season to increase protection, even if their mother was vaccinated. Current guidelines suggest pregnant women should receive vaccination before birth to pass on antibodies. Our research finds that many children with chronic conditions require seasonal RSV immunization beyond the period of protection that can be achieved with maternal vaccination. It expands current definitions from traditionally defined high-risk groups to other children with chronic conditions that could equally benefit from RSV immunization, up to two years of age. Our study underscores the importance of children with chronic conditions getting immunized against RSV in their second season, and in their first season even if their mother was vaccinated." This study analyzed data from 431,937 infants born in British Columbia, Canada, between 2013 and 2023, including 25,452 infants with chronic health conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article examines their key differences across various application scenarios, highlighting which is better suited to different project requirements. Solenoid pumps are driven by an electromagnet made up of a copper wire coil wrapped around a metal plunger. When electrical current flows through the coil, it creates a magnetic field that moves the plunger up and down, assisted by a spring. In contrast, Fluid Metering pumps use a motor to drive a rotating, reciprocating piston to deliver fluid. These factors adversely affect pump performance over time as the springs lose their tension. Fluid Metering's pumps feature simpler, valveless designs able to prevent clogging while ensuring long-term reliability. Their high-precision Cerampump® construction and patented adjustment method also afford Fluid Metering pumps the necessary boost to achieve more precise fluid delivery while enabling more accurate and consistent fluid dispensing versus solenoid pumps. Fluid Metering pumps generally offer flow rates ranging from a few milliliters per minute to just over 1 liter per minute. When it comes to flow rate ranges for microfluidic applications, solenoid and Fluid Metering pumps may seem evenly matched at first glance. In contrast, Fluid Metering pumps can cover a wider range of flow rates with a single pump, eliminating the need to use multiple pumps for different flow requirements. Solenoid pumps inherently produce significant pulsation due to their spring-plunger design. While Fluid Metering pumps also generate some degree of pulsatile flow, there are several effective system modification strategies that can be used to help minimize this pulsation. The high and unavoidable pulsation levels produced by solenoid pumps make them unsuitable for certain applications. In contrast, the pulsation levels in Fluid Metering pump systems can be significantly reduced, allowing for smoother operation. Solenoid pumps are generally manufactured from standard plastics and rubber diaphragms, while Fluid Metering pumps boast a ceramic construction that is chemically inert. Solenoid pumps offer only limited chemical compatibility. They typically struggle with viscous fluids due to increased flow resistance and internal valve clogging. Fluid Metering pumps, however, can handle harsh chemicals more effectively, including fluids of varying viscosities. Fluid Metering pumps, by comparison, deliver 0.5 % precision over millions of cycles without the need for maintenance or recalibration. Solenoid pumps tend to have a lower initial cost, but their ongoing maintenance requirements and potential for downtime increase costs while yielding a lower lifespan of just a few years. Fluid metering pumps require little to no maintenance; however, they have an extended lifespan generally equal to or longer than the life of the instrument in which they are installed. This makes Fluid Metering pumps a more cost-effective option in the long run. Solenoid pumps can be designed to accommodate similar flow rates, but Fluid Metering pumps can handle wider ranges with the same pump, making them the ideal choice for applications requiring reliable precision, high accuracy, long life, chemical inertness, and the ability to pump viscous fluids at high pressure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary disease which, in addition to a high risk of bowel cancer, also a greatly increased risk of duodenal cancer. At present, the only treatment available is close endoscopic monitoring with removal of the precursors, known as polyps, although this is also associated with an increased risk. But there are no specific preventive therapies. Dr. Benjamin Krämer, Co-Lead Author, Scientific Head of the Laboratory for Congenital Cellular Immunology, UKB The Bonn researchers have now discovered that certain cells of the innate immune system, known as type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), are present in significantly higher numbers in the duodenum of FAP patients. The Bonn research findings provide clues as to how these immune cells could contribute to the development of cancer: they produce a Neurotransmitter called interleukin-17A (IL-17A). "This messenger appears to stimulate intestinal cells to produce more harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species, or ROS for short. High concentrations of these ROS can damage the genetic material in the cells," says first author Dr. Kim Melanie Kaiser, who until recently conducted research as a doctoral student in the ImmunoSensation² Cluster of Excellence at the University of Bonn. Such damage to DNA, the carrier of genetic information, is a known factor that can drive the development of cancer. "Our findings suggest that the increased number of interleukin-17A-producing ILC3 in the duodenum creates a local environment that favors the development of cancer in FAP patients," says co-lead author Prof. Dr. Jacob Nattermann from the Laboratory for Innate Cellular Immunity, Deputy Director of Medical Clinic I and Senior Physician at the National Center for Hereditary Tumor Diseases at the UKB. "Targeting these immune cells or, in particular, blocking the messenger substance IL-17A directly in the duodenum could therefore represent a promising new approach to preventing duodenal cancer in people with FAP and offer an urgently needed therapeutic option in addition to pure endoscopic monitoring." These results are based on a collaboration between research institutions from all over Germany. IL-17A-producing NKp44(−) group 3 innate lymphoid cells accumulate in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis duodenal tissue.

Patients are advised to continue using their daily preventer inhaler as prescribed, and to speak to a healthcare professional if they find themselves needing their blue inhaler more than twice a week. If asthma symptoms, such as chest tightness, wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing, worsen or are not relieved by the blue inhaler, patients are advised to seek urgent medical help. Patient safety is our top priority and we continue to monitor all medicines to ensure their benefits outweigh any risks. Blue inhalers are important for treating symptoms during an asthma attack, but should not be used as the only treatment to manage asthma. We advise patients to speak to a healthcare professional if they find themselves needing their blue inhaler more than twice a week. Preventer inhalers should be taken as prescribed, even when symptoms appear under control. If asthma symptoms worsen or are not relieved by their blue inhaler, such as chest tightness, wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing, patients should seek urgent medical help.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Huo Xue Tong Luo Capsule (HXTL) has been clinically used to treat osteonecrosis of the femoral head, osteoporosis, and other bone and joint diseases with promising effects. Our previous study has shown that HXTL can promote osteogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting lncRNA-Miat expression through histone modifications. However, the mechanism by which HXTL treats postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) remains unclear. In this study, we used network pharmacology-based mechanism prediction, molecular docking, and pharmacological validation to investigate the mechanism of HXTL in treating PMOP. The key candidate targets and relevant signaling pathways of HXTL for PMOP treatment were predicted using network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis. RAW264.7 cells were used for Western blot to validate the predicted mechanistic pathways. The ovaries of mice were surgically removed to simulate PMOP. The effect of HXTL on PMOP was evaluated using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and immunohistochemical assays in vivo. Network pharmacology analysis suggested that HXTL interacted with 215 key targets linked to PMOP, primarily affecting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking showed that the main components of HXTL exhibited strong binding affinity to NFATc1, p-PI3K, and p-AKT1. Furthermore, our in vitro results confirmed that HXTL suppressed the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. This research demonstrated that HXTL could inhibit osteoclast formation and prevent bone loss induced by ovariectomy in mice by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings provide important evidence for the clinical application of HXTL in treating PMOP.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even without accounting for veterinary or pharmaceutical waste, human antibiotic use alone is pushing rivers past ecological tipping points, putting global water systems and health at risk. Contaminant pathways of antibiotics in the global aquatic environment. Modeled contaminant pathways and mass balances of antibiotics by path. Values in parentheses indicate total amounts of the top 40 antibiotics consumed worldwide in tonnes year−1; percentage values are relative to the total excretion amount (20,500 tonnes year−1). In a recent article published in the journal PNAS Nexus, researchers estimated the quantities of the 40 antibiotics most commonly used by humans that reach oceans and rivers, with a focus on domestic sources. Their analysis underscores the urgent need for global strategies to control pollution. It suggests that 8,500 tons of antibiotics reach river systems each year and that six million kilometers of global rivers exceed safe levels for promoting resistance and harming ecosystem health. Antibiotic contamination in natural waters is increasingly reported in sediments, groundwater, and surface water, raising concerns for both human and environmental health. Even at low levels, antibiotics can facilitate the development of resistance genes, reduce microbial diversity, and have a negative impact on aquatic life. Antibiotics enter the environment due to incomplete human metabolism, insufficient removal in wastewater systems, and widespread use in animal farming, aquaculture, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Industrial sources are somewhat regulated, but household and hospital wastewater, both important point sources, are often inadequately treated. An estimated half of the wastewater from these sources is released without treatment globally. Since global human antibiotic use has surged, increasing by 65% between 2000 and 2015 and by 114% in low-income countries, concerns about the growing environmental load are intensifying. Advanced treatment technologies exist but are not widely implemented. Moreover, some antibiotic residues may persist in sediments or transform into other biologically active forms. Direct global monitoring of antibiotics is limited by high costs and complexity, making regular tracking difficult. Environmental exposure levels of antibiotics in global rivers. Total risk quotient (RQtot) is calculated as the sum of individual risk quotients of all 40 antibiotics in the global river system under low-flow conditions. Only rivers exceeding a long-term average flow of 0.1 m3 s−1 are shown. In this analysis, researchers used a contaminant fate model called HydroFATE to assess whether antibiotics from human use alone pose a threat to river systems globally, based on data from 23.8 million kilometers of river networks. They estimated the antibiotic emissions from human activity by combining population distributions, per capita antibiotic use, and human metabolism rates. The fate of these substances was modeled based on their pathways, including treated and untreated wastewater, as well as natural land attenuation. River networks were simulated to track contaminant transport by calculating how antibiotic loads accumulated downstream, incorporating instream decay and lake removal. Concentrations in rivers were computed as the total load divided by local river discharge. Environmental exposure was assessed using risk quotients (RQi), calculated as the ratio of modeled concentrations to ecological or resistance-promoting thresholds. These were summed into a total risk quotient (RQtot) to capture cumulative impacts. The exposure faced by humans in terms of health impacts was evaluated using the equivalent dose concentration as a proportion of the defined daily dose and assessed against chronic exposure thresholds. The highest percentile of dose concentrations was used to estimate high-risk human exposure scenarios, assuming untreated water consumption. Annual consumption of the 40 antibiotics selected for inclusion in this study, aggregated by country. Reported values are from Klein et al. (20), and extrapolated values were calculated based on the methodology described in the paper. The researchers estimated that global antibiotic consumption was 32,200 tons per year, with 29,200 tons attributed to the top 40 most commonly used antibiotics. After accounting for additional countries, the estimate rose to 30,300 tons. Of this amount, 68%, or 20,500 tons per year, is excreted, and approximately 29%, or 8,500 tons per year, is estimated to be released into the river system. Only 43% of domestic antibiotic loads are treated through wastewater systems. Most removal occurs through instream decay (48%) and lake retention (13%). About 3.8 million kilometers of rivers had one or more substances that exceeded individual risk thresholds, and 0.7 million kilometers were contaminated by ten or more high-risk antibiotics. Countries like India, Pakistan, and China showed extensive river lengths at high risk, largely driven by common antibiotics such as amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and cefixime, which were the main contributors by river length exceeding individual high-risk thresholds, although other antibiotics like ciprofloxacin were also significant contributors in specific regions or for human health risk assessment. For human health exposure, 1.4% of global rivers fell within the highest antibiotic dose percentile, potentially affecting over 750 million people under conditions where untreated water was consumed. The study finds that human antibiotic use poses significant risks to rivers globally, with even greater risks likely in areas where veterinary use, pharmaceutical waste, and inadequate wastewater treatment are also present. While industrial discharge, aquaculture, and agriculture are key contributors, these were not included in the models due to limitations in data availability. Seasonal peaks and extreme weather events could also lead to higher local concentrations. Despite its constraints, the model reliably estimates long-term risks and highlights the urgent need for improved wastewater management, stricter regulations, and responsible antibiotic use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study, published in BMC Nutrition, demonstrates that providing medically tailored meals (MTM) to patients with heart failure (HF) and malnutrition risk following hospital discharge significantly improves their nutritional status and keeps hospital readmission rates well below local and national averages. A research team, led by Penn Nursing's Charlene Compher, PhD, RD, LDN, FASPEN, the Shearer Chair of Healthy Community Practices, Professor of Nutrition Science, and Director of Nutrition programs in the Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, enrolled 46 patients discharged from the hospital with HF and malnutrition risk. The research team conducted telephone surveys at baseline, 30-, and 60-days post-discharge to assess changes in malnutrition risk, adherence to American Heart Association (AHA) dietary guidelines, sarcopenia risk, and 30-day readmissions. Notably, adherence to AHA diet goals improved over time, regardless of whether patients received seven or 21 meals. The 30-day readmission rates were significantly lower than the national average, at nine percent for those receiving 21 MTM and 12.5 percent for those receiving seven MTM. Our findings suggest that even a modest intervention of seven medically tailored meals per week can have a profound positive impact on the health and recovery of heart failure patients. This intervention not only improves nutritional outcomes and diet adherence but also keeps hospital readmissions low, which translates to better patient care and lower healthcare costs." Charlene Compher, PhD, RD, LDN, FASPEN, Penn Nursing The researchers concluded that the provision of at least seven MTM per week in the immediate post-discharge period is a promising strategy to improve malnutrition and sarcopenia risk, enhance diet adherence, and maintain readmission rates below national averages for patients with HF and malnutrition risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indiana University School of Medicine scientists have developed a powerful new imaging technique to study bone marrow in mouse models. By overcoming key challenges unique to imaging this complex tissue, this advancement could support future drug development and therapies for conditions involving bone marrow, including cancers, autoimmune diseases and musculoskeletal disorders. The new method was made possible by the multiplex imaging tool Phenocycler 2.0, which enabled researchers to visualize a record number of cellular markers within intact bone marrow tissue from mice. The findings were recently published in Leukemia. Since bone marrow plays an important role in blood and immune cell formation and houses valuable stem cells, our unique imaging approach offers a useful tool for a variety of research applications." Traditional tools like flow cytometry and standard fluorescence imaging are considered the most established methods for tissue analysis. However, flow cytometry requires disrupting complex tissues to study and quantify cell populations, and standard fluorescent imaging is limited to detecting only three cellular markers at a time. "Because mouse models are widely used to study human diseases, this technique offers a promising new method for investigating a range of conditions like autoimmune diseases, leukemia and other disorders involving bone marrow," said Reuben Kapur, PhD, a co-senior author on the study, director of the IU School of Medicine's Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research and co-director of the IU Cooperative Center of Excellence in Hematology. The IU Innovation and Commercialization Office has filed a provisional patent for the new imaging methodology, and the team is now working to expand the marker panel to include additional features such as bone, nerves, muscle and more immune and signaling cell types. Additional IU study authors include Connor Gulbronson, Paige C. Jordan, Rahul Kanumuri, Baskar Ramdas, Ramesh Kumar, Melissa L. Hartman, Izza Khurram, Drew M. Brown, Karen E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a powerful natural experiment using Australian health data, researchers found that being eligible for the shingles vaccine may reduce dementia diagnoses, strengthening the case for preventive strategies in brain health. In a recent study published in the JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association), an international team of researchers determined whether eligibility for herpes zoster (HZ) (virus that causes shingles) vaccination based on date of birth influenced the likelihood of receiving a new dementia (memory loss and thinking problems) diagnosis. Dementia affects over 55 million people globally, posing a growing public health crisis. While age remains the strongest risk factor, infections may also play a role. One underexplored link is between HZ and dementia. HZ results from reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, a neurotropic virus that can affect the central nervous system. Vaccination against HZ might not only prevent shingles but also lower dementia risk, possibly through immune modulation. A previous quasi-experiment in Wales found this association, but replication is essential across diverse populations and health systems. Further research is needed to validate these findings globally. To ensure the finding was specific to dementia, researchers checked if vaccine eligibility affected 15 other common conditions like heart disease or diabetes; it did not show a significant impact on those diagnoses. The present study employed a quasi-experimental design using primary care data from 65 general practices across Australia, facilitated by the health informatics platform PenCS. The analysis leveraged a natural eligibility cutoff created by the National Immunisation Programme, which began offering the live attenuated HZ vaccine (Zostavax) free of charge on November 1, 2016, to individuals aged 70 to 79 years. Eligibility was determined by birthdate: individuals born on or after November 2, 1936, were eligible, while those born before were not. This setup allowed for a comparison between groups that were nearly identical in age and baseline health, differing primarily in vaccine access. Patient records included diagnosis histories, immunizations, prescriptions, and demographic details. Dates of birth were coded by week, and all diagnoses, including dementia, were identified using open-ended text fields provided by general practitioners. Patients aged 50 or older as of November 1, 2016, and with at least one clinical visit between 1993 and 2024 were included. The main exposure was eligibility for HZ vaccination based on birthdate. Statistical analysis centered on regression discontinuity (RD), comparing individuals born just before and after the eligibility threshold. This method controls for both observed and unobserved variables, assuming no abrupt changes other than vaccination status. Secondary analyses used time-to-event models, including accelerated failure time and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, along with robustness checks across multiple bandwidths and modeling strategies. All analyses were conducted using R statistical software. It is important to note that the effect measured in this study is for eligibility for HZ vaccination, not for confirmed receipt of the vaccine, because vaccination status is likely underreported in the primary care data used. Additionally, the study population was drawn from practices that agreed to participate and use the PenCS platform, so the data are not fully representative of all Australian primary care patients. Importantly, no differences were observed in prior health conditions, uptake of other preventive services, or dementia risk factors across the eligibility threshold, supporting the validity of the natural experiment. Regression discontinuity analysis showed that eligibility for HZ vaccination led to a statistically significant 1.8 percentage point reduction in the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis over 7.4 years (95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 3.3; P = .01). The protective effect was consistent across alternative follow-up durations, grace periods, and model specifications. Additional checks, including those limited to frequent primary care users and time-to-event models, supported the primary findings. No effects were observed on other common diagnoses or preventive health behaviors, indicating the result was specific to dementia. Comparative RD using an additional ineligible cohort yielded a similar effect size of 1.5 percentage points. Kaplan-Meier plots and cumulative incidence curves further showed the delayed onset of dementia in vaccine-eligible individuals. It is also important to note that dementia diagnoses are substantially underdetected in the primary care data analyzed. For example, only about 1.4% of patients older than 65 in the PenCS dataset had a dementia diagnosis, compared to an estimated 8.4% prevalence in the general Australian population. These findings, when combined with similar research from Wales, provide consistent and compelling evidence that HZ vaccination may help prevent or delay the onset of dementia. To summarize, this study demonstrated that individuals eligible for free HZ vaccination due to their date of birth had a significantly lower likelihood of being diagnosed with dementia over a 7.4-year follow-up period. The use of a quasi-experimental design allowed for a comparison between nearly identical groups, minimizing confounding and providing stronger causal inference than traditional observational studies. These findings highlight the potential for HZ vaccination to serve as a low-cost intervention for dementia prevention. However, further studies in additional populations, as well as mechanistic and clinical research, are needed to explore the biological pathways, generalizability, and policy implications of these promising results.
