                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Francis' wooden coffin was sealed on Friday night, in a private rite that officially ends three days of his body lying in state at the Vatican. About 250,000 people filed through St. Peter's Basilica to pay their final respects to Francis, who was the first pope from Latin America and the first from the Jesuit order. Farrell, a Dublin-born cleric who became a naturalized American citizen, was formerly the Bishop of Dallas, in Texas. A US cardinal accused of mismanaging clerical sexual abuse – the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony – has also been listed as playing an official role. The ceremony, which took place behind closed doors, included several short songs, spoken prayers and a moment for silent prayer. Farrell spread a white silk veil over the late pope's face and sprinkled the body with holy water, according to an order of service released by the Vatican press office earlier this week. In keeping with tradition, the camerlengo placed several possessions inside the coffin before sealing it, including the pope's pallium – the long white robe he wore – coins minted during his pontificate and a deed summarizing the highlights of his tenure. The rite concluded with a hymn to Mary. As part of Francis' push to simplify the papal funeral rites, his body is in a single wooden coffin, rather than having three nested coffins of cypress, lead and oak as was tradition. Related article Why Pope Francis isn't being buried in the Vatican Friday marks the fourth day of national mourning in Italy and a public holiday – Liberation Day – meaning many locals had more time to join the line. Others traveled from much farther away following news of the pope's death. “It was wonderful to see him,” said Joana Veiga, from Porto, Portugal, who arrived with her sister in the morning. “It was very peaceful – calm.” Her sister missed a chance to see Francis last year in Portugal, and was thankful that they made it in time for his lying in state. Pope Francis' funeral will take place on Saturday on the steps outside of St. Peter's Basilica at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. His final resting place, in Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, will also be simple in style. It will be made of marble from Liguria, northern Italy, where his great-grandfather was from. He asked that the tomb not have ornate decoration, instead only including an image of the cross he wore as Archbishop of Buenos Aires and the Latin inscription of his papal name: Franciscus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday morning, FBI Director Kash Patel announced on X that the FBI had arrested a state judge in Wisconsin, allegedly over her efforts to keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents out of her courtroom while she was adjudicating a case involving an immigrant they were targeting. Patel bragged about the arrest on social media, then deleted the post, which claimed there was evidence of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan “obstructing an immigration arrest operation” on April 18. “We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be,” Patel wrote. The arrest came after right-wing media in Wisconsin sensationalized Dugan's actions earlier this week. Legal experts speaking to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel were split on whether Dugan will actually be convicted. According to sources who witnessed her actions, ICE agents sought an individual who was the subject of a court hearing Dugan was presiding over. Dugan told those agents to stay in another judge's office while she finished the proceeding. “No one should jump at the assumption” that Dugan's actions amounted to obstruction, Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor, told the publication. Dugan “shouldn't have to be concerned that the courtroom will be, for all intents and purposes, a trap for people who are doing their legitimate business there,” former federal prosecutor Franklyn Gimbel said. On social media, several other legal experts decried Patel's arrest of Dugan, noting that it marked an escalation of the Trump administration's attacks on the judiciary, including at local levels. “They are arresting judges now, ramping up a campaign of intimidation against the judicial branch,” opined Don Moynihan, political science professor at University of Michigan. “I don't know if this judge did anything wrong. But I can say that if this Admin insists on disappearing migrants to foreign gulags in violation of court orders, more & more ppl will feel compelled to thwart ICE.” “Milwaukee's Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade ICE by not turning her courtroom into a trap. It's a warning shot: obey, or get cuffed,” podcaster Brian Allen said. Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-Wisconsin), whose district encompasses Milwaukee, issued a statement regarding Dugan's arrest. BREAKING: The Trump Administration has arrested a sitting Milwaukee judge.My statement below: pic.twitter.com/Mz6NeT5lUp “We do not have kings in this country,” Baldwin went on, adding that, “by attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders and arresting a sitting judge,” Trump is “putting basic democratic values…on the line.” We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump is weaponizing a high-tech surveillance state in violation of international human rights law, experts say. Trump is weaponizing a high-tech surveillance state in violation of international human rights law, experts say. While the legally dubious arrests of pro-Palestine student activists and the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego García along with other immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador have received the most media attention, these cases provide only a peek into the expanding surveillance dragnet President Donald Trump and his appointees have at their disposal, which includes tools capable of sucking up an unprecedented amount of online personal data. The report was submitted to the UN Human Rights Council, which is scheduled for a regular review of U.S. human rights commitments in November. However, it's the disappearing of student activists, legal U.S. residents, and even U.S. citizens into the byzantine system of immigration jails that has most alarmed the broader public, particularly after Trump said that he hopes to deport U.S. citizens accused of crimes to El Salvador's infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison as well. Facing multiple lawsuits and a string of legal setbacks, the administration abruptly changed course and announced in federal court on Friday that it would restore thousands of foreign college students to “active status” in a key federal database, which is required to study and work off-campus. The report points to Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil and doctoral student Ranjani Srinivasan, who both were targeted after participating in pro-Palestinian activism on campus. After pleading for help from the university, Srinivasan fled to Canada as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called her a “terrorist sympathizer” on social media without evidence. Khalil now sits thousands of miles away in a rural Louisiana immigration jail. A recognizable and explicitly nonviolent organizer who did not wear a mask to protests, Khalil has not been charged with any crime but was labeled by supporters of Israel's war on Gaza as a supporter of the militant group and political party Hamas. Khalil denies any connection with Hamas, and his lawyers now say he was arrested without a warrant. In new court filings this week, attorneys for the administration claimed Khalil was arrested and transferred out of state after he attempted to flee, a claim contradicted by testimony and video from Khalil's wife, who was there at the time of arrest. She has since given birth to a son while Khalil's lawyers fight for his release and against deportation. Marc Van Der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said it's “completely outrageous” that the Trump administration attempted to argue in court and the media that there was a warrant for Khalil's surprise arrest, which quickly became global news. “In DHS' filing in immigration court this week, we learned for the first time that the DHS agents who arrested Mahmoud lied to him: they wrote in their arrest report that the agents told him that they had an arrest warrant, but DHS has now admitted in their filing that that was a lie and that there was no warrant at all at the time of the arrest,” Van Der Hout said in a statement on Thursday. Indeed, the authoritarian “anti-terror” apparatus that Trump controls today is rooted in decades of pro-Israel foreign policy that has stigmatized Palestinians as “terrorists” since 1967. “The UN must recognize this not as a series of isolated incidents, but as a systemic effort to suppress expression, assembly, and solidarity across borders,” Subei said. What remains unanswered in many of these cases is how the government identified, tracked down, and targeted immigrants and activists in the first place. According to the report, digital surveillance in the U.S. is so comprehensive that people reasonably fear taking action that could invite government intrusion into their lives or the lives of people they associate with, which violates principles of freedom of expression. Both law enforcement and private right-wing groups used facial recognition technology to identify activists during anti-genocide protests, which has led to protests by students demanding free speech protections. To track down targets for deportation, immigration police are using social media scanning tools to geolocate individuals and identify home addresses by accessing license plate databases, utility billing databases, app-based location data, and other online data sold by private data brokers, according to the report. The Department of Homeland Security now forces all detainees suspected — but not necessarily convicted — of violating immigration law to submit DNA samples, and the government added the DNA of 1.5 million people to its central database between 2020 and 2024. While non-citizens are the target of such efforts, everyone's data is sucked into various digital dragnets operated by the federal government and law enforcement agencies at every level. Technology such as smartphones, app-based location tools, automated license plate readers and artificial intelligence has made such surveillance ubiquitous as the Trump regime puts its agenda into action. Such digital surveillance strategies have already been used by the U.S. government to surveil users of  Muslim dating and prayer apps and participants in the 2020 protests for racial justice. Smart cameras and [automatic license plate readers] enable law enforcement to track, in some cases, the entirety of people's public movements; entities from the military to local police have contracted with social media surveillance firms access to surveil people engaging in free expression. AI technology also enables law enforcement to comb through and analyze troves of data to invade the public's privacy at levels that would have been prohibitively expensive or simply impossible just a decade ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It took several DNA tests to confirm the identity of Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, who was killed in Russian captivity last fall. Roshchyna, 27, disappeared in August 2023 while reporting from Ukraine's Russian-occupied territories, with Moscow acknowledging her detention the following year. On April 24, however, lawmaker Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, who chairs the parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said that her body had been returned in late February, but the news was withheld due to uncertainty over her identity. As far as I know, the tests were conducted both in Ukraine and abroad to conclude with certainty that it was indeed Viktoriia," Yurchyshyn wrote on Telegram. "Russians killed the 27-year-old journalist after unlawfully detaining and torturing her for an extended period," he said. After launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has increased its assault on press freedom, deliberately targeting Ukrainian journalists with attacks and abducting media workers in occupied territories in an attempt to control the narrative. Throughout the full-scale invasion, journalists have played a crucial role in spotlighting Russia's brutal war, documenting its war crimes and their aftermath. As of April 24, Russia has committed 833 crimes against journalists and the media in Ukraine, according to the Institute of Mass Information (IMI). One hundred two media workers have been killed, including both those on assignment and those who had joined Ukraine's Armed Forces. At least 30 Ukrainian journalists remain in Russian captivity as of April, IMI reported, with little known about their health conditions or whereabouts. Multiple reports have revealed that Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) are tortured and killed while in Russian captivity. When Russia occupies a new settlement, one of its first actions is targeting individuals who could resist the occupation, including journalists. "Russian troops have lists of journalists, activists, and war veterans, and they look for people on those lists when occupying a territory," Diachuk says. Ukrainian journalist and poet Oleksandr Hunko, who was briefly detained in occupied Nova Kakhovka in April 2022, says that FSB (Russian Federal Security Service) officers asked him about other local journalists during interrogations. Dmytro Khyliuk, a journalist with the UNIAN news agency, was kidnapped alongside his father from their home in Kyiv Oblast in March 2022, while the area was under Russian occupation. While Khyliuk's father was later released, Russia accused the journalist of communicating with the Ukrainian military and put him in a penal colony in Russia's Vladimir Oblast. According to a recent report by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), citing a man who spent a year in the same prison cell as Khyliuk, the journalist is being subjected to torture and humiliation, with his current weight reportedly "no more than 45 kilograms." Another Ukrainian journalist, Iryna Danylovych, was abducted in occupied Crimea. She was sentenced to seven years in prison for "illegal possession of explosives" and transferred to a penal colony in Russia. Recent reports also indicate that her health has declined while in captivity: According to the  Crimean Tatar Resource Center NGO, 45-year-old Danylovych "lost hearing in her left ear." In addition, "the left side of her body is numb following a micro-stroke, and she constantly complains of heart issues and headaches." According to the Media Initiative for Human Rights, 62-year-old Iryna is a retired journalist. She and her husband were kidnapped in their hometown of Melitopol in May 2023, with few details known about them since then. "Russians do not give access to journalists in captivity," Diachuk says. Both facilities are known for the use of torture against prisoners. There were also cuts on Roshchyna's arms after interrogations, the witness said. The cause of her death is yet to be established. Roshchyna reportedly died on Sept. 19, marking the first known death of a Ukrainian journalist in Russian captivity. And what did Russia do to her that she died just one year later?" As civilians, Ukrainian journalists are trapped in legal limbo, as international law prohibits the capture and exchange of civilians for prisoners of war, with only two of them liberated since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to IMI: Nariman Dzhelyal, a Crimean Tatar journalist and politician, as well as Maksym Butkevych, Ukrainian journalist and human rights activist. Time has stopped for them, but it's important for all of them to know that everything possible is being done to secure their release," Butkevych said during a meeting with Zelensky days after his release from captivity on Oct. 18. Russia began targeting Ukrainian journalists long before the full-scale invasion. According to Oksana Romaniuk, the head of IMI, over 100 journalists, both Ukrainian and foreign, have been detained by Russia since 2014. But some of the journalists detained between 2014 and 2021 still remain in captivity. I would say it is a crime of genocide, as we see the filtering of citizens based on specific criteria," says Romaniuk, as quoted by IMI. And disseminating this truthful information to the world is not beneficial for Russia because it does not want to show that it is committing crimes," says Diachuk. Since the first day of Russia's all-out war, I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia's brutal aggression. By telling all those painful stories, we are helping to keep the world informed about the reality of Russia's war against Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Search and rescue operations at the site of a Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on April 24 have ended, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said on April 25. Thirty-one people remain hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a day earlier. A series of explosions rocked the capital around 1:00 a.m. local time on April 24, Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground reported. Additional explosions were later heard around 4 a.m. local time. We just went out into the corridor, went to open the door, and that was it — an explosion." Fires were reported in residential buildings, Kyiv City Military Administration chief Tymur Tkachenko said, adding that cars and commercial buildings have been impacted as well. Fallen debris was found around the city, Tkachenko added, describing the  attack as "Russian peace in all its glory." The mass attack came just hours after the Kremlin demanded Ukraine's full recognition of Russia's claim over four Ukrainian oblasts it partially occupies, neutral status for Ukraine, and an end to all Western military support. Earlier on April 23, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace in Ukraine. Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were also targeted in the "massive combined strike," though Kyiv was hit the hardest, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said. In response to the attack, Poland's Air Force scrambled allied fighter jets to protect the country's own airspace from missiles that may stray into Polish territory. Russia has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure since the onset of its full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022. The U.S. has been in talks with Ukraine and Russia to negotiate an end to Russia's war against Ukraine. Ukraine has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready if Russia also agrees to the terms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rodney Taylor, whose legs were amputated as a toddler, just one of many people with disabilities at risk from detention In his three months locked up at Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, Rodney Taylor has missed meals and showers, lived with increasing pain in his hips, developed a swollen thumb on his right hand and blisters on the stumps where his two legs were amputated when he was a toddler. He went through 16 operations and is a double amputee. Nonetheless, his immigration status is unresolved, and despite having an application for residence – commonly known as a “green card” – pending, on 15 January Ice agents arrived at his Loganville, Georgia home and took him to Stewart. The reason, according to his attorney, who shared paperwork from his case with the Guardian: a burglary conviction he received as a teenager and which the state of Georgia pardoned him for in 2010. His case is one of an untold number of people with disabilities and other serious health issues who are being swept up in the current administration's “mass deportation” efforts. They also happen without the benefit of two federal offices that formerly provided oversight for healthcare and other issues, and now a situation is unfolding where detainees with disabilities like Taylor are increasingly at risk of life-altering outcomes and even death, experts say. “Deaths are much more likely … [and] we haven't thought about the healthcare implications of what's developing,” he said. The immigration detention system was already a precarious, potentially unsafe place for detainees with disabilities, according to experts and a handful of current and former employees with the Department of Homeland Security – Ice's parent agency. “It's all happening in the dark,” said Sarah Owings, Taylor's attorney, speaking of conditions facing her client and others like him. Then the detention center gave him shoes that didn't fit the legs and trying to walk “felt like walking on concrete on my knees”, he said. In addition, the prosthetic legs have batteries that require eight hours of charging a day. But after being locked up at Stewart, he didn't even see a doctor for three days, and in the ensuing months, the facility has never been able to arrange for eight hours of charging, allowing only several hours at a time. Taylor and Owings sought a medical leave, in order to see the doctor who could at least fit him for the new prosthetic legs – and were denied. A case manager took over the chore, often arriving at least an hour after meals. Staff also offered Taylor a wheelchair – but he can't push it, as his right hand only has two fingers, and his thumb has swollen and become painful since he was detained. Taylor's case was one of several featured in a CNN story about people facing possible deportation after decades of living in the US. “I haven't heard a response yet,” Taylor said. He met another detainee who suffered an infection and couldn't walk; the man had to wait about a month to get crutches. “Unless you're dying or bleeding out … they're not going to come,” he said a guard told him and several others. They mentioned Krome, in Miami, Florida, where at least three detainees have died in recent months and others with conditions such as HIV have gone weeks without medicine. Amy Zeidan, a professor of emergency medicine at Atlanta's Emory University who has researched healthcare in the immigration detention system, said that increasing overcrowding also worsens a chronic workforce shortage. “They don't have enough qualified people,” she said. These conditions “are emblematic of the system” under the current administration, said a DHS staffer who preferred anonymity to avoid retaliation. Michelle Brané was the ombudsman at the Oido until the office of 100-plus employees was shut down, doing away with inspections of immigration detention facilities – both announced and unannounced; responses to complaints; and policy recommendations for improving such aspects of detention as healthcare. Her office “deescalated situations that are now being exacerbated [by] … increasing detentions”, she said. “These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department's] mission,” said a DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, in March, regarding shuttering the Oido and the CRCL, which handled more in-depth investigations of healthcare and other issues. Ice did not respond to a query from the Guardian. This attitude, said Brané, shows a “disdain for meeting basic humane conditions”, adding that her office was “created by statute and funded by Congress”. “Ultimately, I'm worried people will die, or suffer irreparable harm – and dying shouldn't be the point at which we start caring,” she said. “We shouldn't be a country that is willingly mistreating people.”</p>

Exit comes after Joe Kasper was implicated as orchestrator of power grab that led to dismissal of three Pentagon officials

Joe Kasper, the controversial chief of staff to the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was central to a dramatic power struggle at the Pentagon, has left his post, in an unexpected departure.

Despite Hegseth's assurances just days ago in a TV appearance on the Fox & Friends show that Kasper would merely transition to “a slightly different role” within the department, Kasper confirmed to Politico in a Thursday interview he will instead return to government relations and consulting, maintaining only limited Pentagon ties as a special government employee.

A senior defense official at the Pentagon confirmed the dramatic title change to the Guardian on Friday, saying Kasper would be “handling special projects at the Department of Defense”

“Secretary Hegseth is thankful for [Kasper's] continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda,” the official said in a statement, referring to Donald Trump's protectionist policy push.

The quick exit comes after Kasper was implicated as the orchestrator of a power grab that led to the dismissal of three senior Pentagon officials – Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick and Colin Carroll – allegedly as part of a leak investigation.

The administration's first hundred days created a troubled tenure for Kasper, with anonymous sources claiming he was frequently late to meetings, failed to follow through on critical tasks, and displayed inappropriate behavior, including berating officials and making crude comments allegedly about his bowel movements during high-level meetings.

“He lacked the focus and organizational skills needed to get things done,” one anonymous insider told Politico.

The leadership shake-up coincides with separate allegations that Hegseth had an unsecured internet connection installed in his Pentagon office, which would bypass government security protocols, to use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer. This “dirty line” arrangement potentially exposes sensitive defense information to surveillance or hacking risks, according to reports from the Associated Press and ABC News.

Kasper previously worked at the Department of Homeland Security, the US navy and the air force during the first Trump administration before becoming a lobbyist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 700 essays from around the world have been unveiled in Moscow ahead of a major global forum on the future economy, with authors sharing bold ideas for shaping a better world. Moscow hosted a presentation on Thursday of essays submitted for a contest which is part of the upcoming Open Dialogue: ‘The Future of the World: New Platform for Global Growth'. The event, scheduled for April 28-30, will bring global experts to the Russian capital to explore what lies ahead for the world economy and society. The essays, now compiled into four volumes, center on four themes: Investments in people, Technology, Environment, and Communication. The organizers say the goal is to identify breakthrough ideas that could inform future economic planning. “Soon, there will be 10 billion of us on the planet, and we must decide what to do about electricity and environment in the future,” Gerald Sakuler, the president of the Austrian Business Club in Russia, said. Thursday's presentation brought together experts, contributors, and organizers to discuss highlights from the submissions and exchange ideas ahead of the main forum. The upcoming Open Dialogue forum will gather representatives from think tanks, government agencies, universities, development organizations, media, and youth groups to debate strategies for global development. The full event program is available in Russian, English, Chinese, Arabic, and Portuguese on the National Centre RUSSIA website. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy Cano, were taken into custody on Thursday after authorities raided their home in New Mexico amid reports and court papers stating that an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member was arrested living in a building behind his home. “Under President Trump, we have arrested over 150,000 aliens—including more than 600 members of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang,” Noem wrote alongside the post. The couple was allegedly living with Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, a Venezuelan illegal immigrant, at their home in Las Cruces, roughly 40 miles north of the U.S.–Mexico border. The DOJ said Ortega-Lopez, who entered the U.S. illegally on Dec. 15, 2023, and was released pending removal proceedings, was charged with being an illegal immigrant in possession of a firearm or ammunition. Court documents state that Ortega-Lopez was hired by Nancy Cano to “install a glass door for her” and that he “continued to do a few jobs” for her after being evicted from an apartment in April 2024, at which point she offered him a place to stay at the back of the residence she shared with her husband. Two email accounts that appear to be associated with Cano did not return a request for comment on Thursday. He must also never seek or accept a pro tempore position “for any New Mexico judicial office in the future,” which includes working as a judge in any municipal, probate, metropolitan, magistrate, district, or appeals court. Cano is also banned from working as a judge for the Supreme Court. He “shall never again hold or exercise any judicial authority in the State of New Mexico,” which also includes “officiating at weddings,” according to the court order. The Supreme Court did not state why he was leaving his position or why he was barred from being a judge in the state. Cano, who had been a magistrate judge in Doña Ana County since 2011, resigned last month. “Working with each of you has been a very rewarding experience for which I will remain eternally grateful,” he wrote. The Epoch Times reached out to the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.</p>

DOGE previously reported on March 18 that 3.2 million records had been marked as deceased. A chart shared by DOGE on Thursday showed that more than 2.7 million records of people aged 120 to 129 have been removed over the past several weeks. Another 1.3 million accounts of people aged 150 to 159 were also removed this month, the chart showed. In total, 10,926,833 accounts were marked as deceased, according to the chart. The tech entrepreneur posted on social media platform X a screenshot of a federal database showing that more than 12 million Social Security recipients were listed as older than 120. “Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.” From 2015 to 2022, SSA paid almost $8.6 trillion in benefits and made approximately $71.8 billion, or 0.84 percent, in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, according to the report. The report noted that improper payments have been a “longstanding challenge” for the SSA and that, while the agency has taken actions to address this challenge, “there is more it needs to do.” “Without better access to data, increased automation, systems modernization, and policy or legislative changes, improper payments will continue to be an issue into the future,” the report stated. Additional penalties under state unemployment insurance laws may also include criminal prosecution with fines and/or incarceration and permanent loss of eligibility for unemployment compensation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I was reading the print edition of The Globe and Mail, taking photos of interesting articles and texting them to a group chat called “Sweet Baby Idiots.” This is my version of sharing a link. Like any noble group chat, it exists so my friends and I can talk about the news and then – as people of action! “Societal inequality – the needless degree of it – drives so much chaos and hostility. What's the best way average citizens like us can reject this system? Do any of our everyday actions matter, at all?” I don't consider myself a hysterical person, but Mat could sense I was unusually bothered, and instead of replying in the group chat, he called me. For the next ten minutes, we lamented all of the things people lament, and then we stumbled onto something useful. I found myself wondering if the best way to open your mind and connect with people is to engage in more shared spaces. Places where real life happens – parks, schools, libraries, coffee shops, live music venues and subways are living and breathing ecosystems. Being among strangers in these vibrant public places helps us build an understanding of one another. I mused to Mat that moving through public spaces might seem to have a passive effect on us, but the emotional impact is significant. It's why sports and music can lead to such unifying experiences. It's why I love events like free street festivals. If you've been out at 10 p.m. on an Art Crawl in Hamilton or OssFest in Toronto, you know the energy I'm talking about. The feeling of energy and harmony when people are engaged in a shared purpose.” Everyone bringing their own unique talents and spirits to a collective. Sharing in mutual appreciation of everyone's unique gifts. A week later, I was out for a beer with Mat and were talking about the virtues of public education – one of the most important shared spaces we have in society. Mat grew up in a troubled home, and without much thought, I said to him: “If not for the diversity of your public school, you wouldn't have met the kind of families who let you sleep over when things were going badly at home. You had a warm, safe bed to sleep in.” In his sage way, he looked at me with a sympathetic smile, and said, “But Max, isn't it kind of great that they knew me, too?” I immediately felt incredibly foolish, apologized, and sent him a text the next day to apologize some more. I was just trying to articulate that both sides of the equation can enrich each other.” It's near impossible these days to offer an idea that doesn't offend some part of the political spectrum, but I am going to try here: sharing space with others is good. I have a very lucky job, alongside four of my best friends, that occasionally affords me a glitzy life – but the deepest satisfaction in my work comes from the time and space I've shared with the people of all walks of life that I've met along the way. It's opened my mind and offered me an endlessly full life. Settings – ones that encourage observation and allow for spontaneous conversation – make me more curious, feel more connected and often put my own problems in perspective. Now, I also get that sharing space with people can be annoying. And I don't want to be near my neighbourhood Facebook group when there's a disagreement. I get that people become worn down by the world and cynicism can come easy. But nothing good ever came from worn-down, cynical people. Just because the world gets annoying doesn't mean we should opt out. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allies turn away from Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, while relations between India and Pakistan worsen in the wake of a terror attack in Kashmir. Meanwhile, Washington and Tehran are still far apart on the nuclear deal. Ukraine has been losing the support of its closest allies. Washington has criticized Kiev for its unwillingness to make concessions as part of the settlement process, and European partners, too, have called on Bankovaya Street (Vladimir Zelensky's office - TASS) to consider the possibility of a compromise. US President Donald Trump is especially irritated, as he threatened Zelensky with the loss of the whole country unless he agrees to conclude a deal immediately. On April 25, Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will make his fourth visit to Russia for full-fledged talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In addition, work toward an in-person meeting between the Russian and American leaders is ongoing. A foreign ministers meeting on Ukraine scheduled to take place in London on April 23 didn't happen, and in this light, the focus has clearly shifted, Vladimir Vasilyev, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies, observed. Among other key issues, Ukraine refuses to sign a mineral deal, the expert continued. Zelensky's personality, too, matters, for how he behaves can now be interpreted as entrenched irresponsibility. This is how his diplomacy can be described," Vasilyev said. According to The Financial Times, Britain, Germany, and France have been secretly pressing Kiev to give up part of its territory as they fear that, should the United States abandon the negotiating process, they would confront Moscow on their own. Discussions on lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as part of a peace deal, as reported by Politico, are yet another proof that European elites are ready to bargain, sacrificing Ukraine's interests for a stable energy market, even as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later denied this report. Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed South Asian nations, following a deadly attack on April 22 in Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian region disputed by Pakistan. Despite Islamabad denying any involvement and offering its own counterclaims, on April 24, the Indian Foreign Ministry suspended the issuance of visas for Pakistani nationals, effective immediately, and announced that visas already granted would be revoked by April 27. Around 1,500 people have been detained in Kashmir, where a specialized police operation is currently underway. Under this agreement, New Delhi has the exclusive right to utilize water from three eastern rivers, explained Alexey Kupriyanov, head of the South Asia and Pacific Region Group at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations. Boris Volkhonsky, associate professor at Moscow State University's Institute of Asian and African Countries, suggested that while the use of force cannot be completely ruled out, it remains unlikely. The balance of nuclear weapons between India and Pakistan has so far acted as a deterrent, preventing the conflict from escalating into full-scale war, he noted in an interview with Vedomosti. Though isolated retaliatory actions may occur, it's important to consider that a non-state actor has claimed responsibility for the attack. This could lead to substantial disruptions at Indian airports in the short term, he warned. The United States would agree to allow Iran to develop its civilian nuclear program provided it relies exclusively on foreign-made nuclear fuel for it as part of a potential deal, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told The Free Press online news outlet. This, as Trump and other hawks on Iran view it, can force Tehran to make concessions in striking a deal, the expert continues. In an interview with Vedomosti, he doubted the US and Iran can strike a deal. However, Tehran is willing to compromise on its nuclear program, as, first, it would like some of the sanctions pressure on its economy to be eased and, second, Iran would strongly oppose a major regional escalation and potential strikes on its nuclear facilities by the US or Israel, the expert emphasized. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has paid a visit to South Africa and held talks with the country's President Cyril Ramaphosa. In an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Oleg Teterin, First Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Asia and Africa Today magazine, said: "South Africa is a BRICS member, and it provides moral assistance to Russia anyway. And Zelensky is desperately looking for support now that he has been rejected by US President Donald Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Even as they cannot put it bluntly, South African leaders certainly lean toward Russia." The majority of countries in Africa, excluding in votes on a UN resolution, does not provide any support to Kiev, he told Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "South African President Ramaphosa headed a delegation of African leaders on a peace mission to Kiev, and they also met with President Putin in St. Petersburg, after which Russia and Ukraine exchanged POWs. Even as that mission did not yield any real results, South Africa remains committed to pushing for peace across the globe. And it views Zelensky's visit in this light, too," Shubin explained. According to him, not everybody in South Africa's ruling coalition approved Zelensky's visit, with the Communist party campaigning against his arrival. And the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) reacted negatively to his visit, he continued. And the official position of Pretoria is that it is willing to help find a peaceful solution while pursuing the policy of non-alignment," he concluded. Hungary and Slovakia will maintain the opportunity to buy Russian oil. A temporary waiver on the general ban on Russian oil imports for pumping fuel to Central European countries that do not have the opportunity to receive it by sea was introduced in 2022. Nevertheless, in May, the EC is set to publish a roadmap for completely phasing out Russian energy sources by 2027. Experts, too, believe that Bratislava and Budapest will continue to purchase resources from Russia anyway. The Czech Republic fully switched to non-Russian oil supplies earlier this month. Therefore, only Hungary and Slovakia continue to receive Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline now. Hungary and Slovakia will be able to defend their right to buy energy from Russia using this pipeline, since the situation is less tense now than it was in 2022, when they won their exemption from the oil embargo, Igor Yushkov, an expert at the Financial University and the National Energy Security Fund, told Izvestia. Slovakia acts appropriately in continuing to buy oil from Russia, because refusing to do so would harm the republic's economy, Peter Marcek, a former parliamentarian, told Izvestia. Slovakia would like to deepen economic cooperation with Russia, he added. Whether Hungary will continue to buy Russian oil after 2027 depends on next year's parliamentary election. Much depends on relations between Russia and the United States, he argues: if this positive trend continues, Trump will allow Hungary to buy Russian oil.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event to sign executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, on April 23.Leah Millis/Reuters Jordan Brennan is a former chief economist at Unifor. But if trade liberalization is the main culprit behind deindustrialization in the U.S., we should expect globe-trotting manufacturing giants such as General Motors GM-N to have shed comparatively fewer jobs than the domestic manufacturing sector, as jobs relocated over borders. GM's global headcount mirrors the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. Since the 1980s, America has shed nearly seven million manufacturing jobs – one in three. GM's global work force shrank a whopping 82 per cent over the same period, though its annual output per worker soared from seven vehicles in the 1980s to 38 by 2023 – an astonishing 500-per-cent-plus increase in productivity. The White House understands this but is putting politics before facts. This raises an ominous question: Are the tariffs a short-term ploy to win better trade terms or a long-term strategy to repatriate industry, raise revenue and fund tax cuts? If so, Mr. Trump's tariffs are a predatory, zero-sum policy. That includes Canada, whose auto industry is caught in the crosshairs. Our next federal government must make it clear that Canada will not surrender its auto industry. Industry executives are nervous and need assurances that Canada will not forfeit its share of North American auto production without a fight. We must start with the “soft,” prototypically Canadian approach that is patient diplomacy. We account for less than 2 per cent of new vehicle sales globally, which means the countertariffs imposed by Ottawa will have a minimal impact on the U.S. What's more, countertariffs hurt Canadian consumers and mirror the self-defeating logic of Mr. Trump's approach. If Canada can offer Mr. Trump a few symbolic “wins,” like paying more into NATO, phasing out supply management and partnering on critical minerals – things we should be doing anyway – we might defuse the situation constructively. There is a more muscular option in keeping with the Trump playbook, however, which we keep in our pocket but should not be afraid to use: escalation. To be sure, there is danger in this more aggressive approach. In teaching the White House about this law, Canada must diligently avoid having its response backfire. But in conflict situations, escalation is tactically useful because it pushes the parties toward resolution. If Mr. Trump succeeds in forcing production south, American consumers will be left with the most expensive cars ever built. Do Trump voters want to spend more on their next vehicle? There's another card to play in this more aggressive plan. If Canada and Mexico seal their borders, restricting the export of critical auto parts, U.S. assembly lines would be instantly crippled. This would yield two results: First, no imports would mean no tariff revenue from auto parts, so no money to fund Mr. Trump's tax cuts; second, the very workers who elected Mr. Trump will be laid off – something they didn't vote for.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least a third of Donald Trump's cabinet are Roman Catholic While Christianity has always been a dominant force in US politics, Protestant Evangelicalism has long been the denomination favoured by Republicans. But with the return of Mr Trump to the White House, and his stated ambition to bring about a new “golden age” in America, Catholicism appears to be the religion most prominent among Maga Republicans. At least a third of his cabinet are Roman Catholic, with many of his top team and followers using their faith to justify the president's policy agenda. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt's Catholic faith is so intertwined with her work that she leads her team in prayer before every media briefing. A number of high-profile Trump-backers have also converted to the faith in recent years, including Russell Brand, who was baptised in the Thames last year, and launched a Christian prayer app part-funded by Mr Vance. Candace Owens, the far-Right media personality, converted last year, as did pro-Trump comedian Rob Schneider. Catholicism's resurgence can be seen at a grassroots level as well, with dioceses across America seeing the number of people converting this Easter jump by up to 70 per cent on previous years. However, the surge in conversions is not just a turn towards Catholicism, but a highly specific version of it: one described as “muscular Catholicism” that casts itself in opposition to the modernising approach of the Church in Rome and progressive US politics, and emphasises American strength as a core tenet of faith. A study published by the Catholic Project at the Catholic University of America found almost all priests ordained in 2020 or later described themselves as moderate or conservative. A conservative Catholic revival has been brewing for decades in the US in response to liberalising reforms to the Church in Rome, with tensions coming to a head during Joe Biden's presidency, when Catholic concerns about culture war issues mapped neatly onto Republican talking points. The Democrats' wholescale embrace of progressive policies issues such as transgender ideology and abortion under the Biden-Harris administration sparked fury among conservatives. Kamala Harris's support for such policies during her presidential campaign is also thought to have contributed to large numbers of mostly Catholic Hispanic Americans voting for Mr Trump in last year's election. Mr Trump boosted his vote share among Latino Catholics from 31 percentage points in 2020 to 43 per cent, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. Despite Mr Biden being a Catholic himself, and Mr Trump not, the Republicans effectively seized on the groundswell of Catholic opposition to Democrat policies, publicly courting non-establishment leaders, including many on the radical fringe. The president also accused the Biden administration of persecuting Catholics, releasing “Make America Pray Again” merchandise and vowing to create a task force to “fight anti-Christian bias”, which launched this week. Meanwhile, Ms Harris came under heavy criticism during the election campaign for failing to attend the annual Al Smith dinner, which raises money for Catholic charities. Where John F Kennedy felt compelled to distance himself from the Roman Catholic Church in 1960, describing himself as “the Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also to be a Catholic”, the faith has become a badge of honour for Maga Republicans. The growing popularity of Catholicism in the US is particularly pronounced among young men, tapping into another reservoir of support for Mr Trump. “It has become identified with a certain kind of sexual morality, with natural law, and there's the whole sense that the tradition of the liturgy, going back over a thousand years of uninterrupted continuity.” Unlike the Church in Rome under Pope Francis, who spoke out strongly in support of migrants, appointed women to high-ranking Vatican positions and struck a more conciliatory tone towards LGBTQ people, authorising blessings to same-sex couples, US Catholicism places a greater emphasis on conservatism. “The new Conservative movement is really a revanchist movement against all possible updates of the Catholic Church,” said Prof Faggioli, adding that this clash became “explosive” under Pope Francis. His papacy galvanised an existing strain of traditionalism in the American Catholic church, with critics, including some clergy, accusing him of sowing confusion over fundamental church doctrines and haphazardly rushing through reform. The late Pope clashed with a number of prominent US Catholic leaders, and in 2023 lamented the “backwardness” of some American conservatives, warning about how “ideologies replace faith”. A few months before he died, Francis engaged in his final high-profile skirmish with his US flock in a letter to American bishops stating that deporting migrants violates the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families”.</p>

WASHINGTON, April 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is probably the only world leader who recognizes the need to address the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS in an interview.

In his words, Trump "is probably the only leader on Earth, who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation."

"He said it was a huge mistake to pull Ukraine into NATO, and this was a mistake by the Biden administration, and he wants to rectify this," the top Russian diplomat said.

Fragments of the interview were published on Thursday night. The full version will be aired on Sunday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly spoken in favor of settling the conflict in Ukraine, but only if Russia's interests are taken into account and if root causes of the Ukrainian crisis are fixed. The Russian leader is convinced that this is the only way to achieve a long and lasting peace, in which Moscow is interested.</p>
