(AP Photo/Jim Mone, File) Mangione, 26, stood with his lawyers as he entered the plea, leaning forward toward a microphone on the defense table as U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett asked him if understood the indictment, which charges him with stalking and shooting Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel last December. A cause célèbre for people upset with the health insurance industry, Mangione's arraignment attracted several dozen people to the Manhattan federal courthouse, including former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, who served prison time for stealing classified diplomatic cables. Mangione, held in a federal jail in Brooklyn since his arrest, arrived to court in a mustard-colored jail suit and chatted with one of his lawyers, death penalty counsel Avi Moskowitz, as they waited for the arraignment to begin. Late Thursday night, federal prosecutors filed a required notice of their intent to seek the death penalty. Because of the many legal issues involved in capital cases, Mangione's case will move much slower that non-death penalty prosecutions. He is due back in federal court on Dec. 5, a day after the one-year anniversary of Thompson's death. No trial date has been set in either the federal or his parallel state murder case. Mangione's lawyers argue that Bondi's announcement — which she followed with posts on Instagram account and a TV appearance — was a “political stunt” that violated long-established Justice Department protocols, corrupted the grand jury process and deprived him of his constitutional right to due process. After Mangione's lawyers raised the issue again on Friday, Garnett instructed Manhattan federal prosecutors to convey to Bondi and other Justice Department officials that court rules prohibit any pretrial publicity that could interfere with a defendant's right to a fair trial. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family, faces separate federal and state murder charges after authorities say he gunned down Thompson, 50, outside the New York Hilton Midtown on Dec. 4 as the executive arrived for UnitedHealthcare's annual investor conference. The state murder charges carry a maximum punishment of life in prison. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims. The killing and ensuing five-day search leading to Mangione's arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers deleting photos of executives from their websites and switching to online shareholder meetings. At the same time, some health insurance critics have rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. Mangione was arrested Dec. 9 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City and whisked to Manhattan by plane and helicopter. Among the entries, prosecutors said, was one from August 2024 that said “the target is insurance” because “it checks every box” and one from October that describes an intent to “wack” an insurance company CEO. UnitedHealthcare, the largest U.S. health insurer, has said Mangione was never a client.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Newly minted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has defiantly rejected any notion that Canada will become America's 51st state blasting the idea as "crazy." Trump has discussed acquiring Greenland, Canada and Panama for months — and has regularly referred to Canada as the 51st U.S. state. Despite skepticism from some, Trump said in an interview with Tine magazine published Friday that he is serious about these proposals. When asked by Time's Eric Cortellessa whether Trump was "trolling a bit" in suggesting Canada join the U.S., Trump replied, "Actually, no, I'm not." Trump has regularly voiced interest in acquiring Greenland for national security purposes. Cortellessa then asked whether Trump intended to "grow the American empire," prompting Trump to double down on the significance of acquiring these key pieces of territory. "Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity," Trump said. "Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security." "We're taking care of their military," Trump said. "We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state." (Bonnie Cash/UPI/Bloomberg, left, Adrian Wyld /The Canadian Press via AP, right. ) The Time piece was published a day after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters that Trump routinely discusses Canada becoming a state, claiming that Trump brings it up "all the time." Carney has previously shut down any notions that Canada will become a U.S. state. Meanwhile, Trump has emphasized that Greenland is key for national security purposes. While the Danish territory has said it is seeking independence from Copenhagen but isn't inclined to join the U.S., Trump has voiced a strong desire to secure Greenland amid increase Russian and Chinese presence in the Arctic. "If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and Russian ships all over the place, and we're not going to be able to do that," Trump told reporters in March. "We're not relying on Denmark or anybody to take care of that situation. Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering the White House.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is backing down from a multi-state legal fight over sweeping actions taken by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement that potentially terminated the immigration status of thousands of international students studying in the United States. The dramatic shift was announced in court proceedings across the country Friday and follows a flurry of legal action filed by students who said their legal status was being cancelled without explanation. Department of Justice attorneys told the court immigration officials are working to create a new system to review and terminate the records for international students, known as SEVIS, that are connected to their immigration status. During a hearing Friday, a Justice Department attorney said ICE was in the process of reinstating the records of all the students who had been terminated in that process, not just those who had filed lawsuits. The SEVIS revocations occurred alongside visa cancellations for many students, putting them ultimately at risk for deportation, multiple attorneys representing students have said in court documents. The DOJ continues to claim that SEVIS changes did not cause visa terminations. The Trump administration began to cancel visas and launched deportation proceedings in March, which initially targeted students who participated in protests against the Israel-Hamas war on college campuses last year. Weeks later, immigration officials began revoking students' immigration statuses over minor legal infractions and in some cases without any apparent explanation. Several federal judges have halted some of the revocations and issued restraining orders to make sure that students are not removed from the country. The cases revealed that ICE was justifying the records terminations by arguing that the students had an alleged “criminal history,” including students who were arrested and never charged, or who had their charges dismissed. While the restoration of student statuses is likely to calm fears among thousands of international students who worried the revocation of their status would put them at risk for deportation it does not appear to impact other international students whose visas were revoked, including Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University student who was arrested near her home in Massachusetts, and Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and legal permanent resident who was arrested near his home on campus after being accused of engaging in activities in support of Hamas. In recent weeks, ICE appeared to cancel students' SEVIS statuses for minor legal infractions including drunk driving and traffic violations, according to multiple lawsuits filed to stop the cancellations, with some students seeing records cancelled even if they had never been convicted of a crime. Students like Dartmouth University graduate researcher Xiaotian Liu, a Chinese national who is studying computer science and has been in the United States since 2016. Liu's status was changed without notice earlier this month despite him never having committed a crime or a traffic violation, according to his attorney. Foreign students, who typically hold an F-1 visa, are required to meet specific criteria to maintain their status including full-time course work and no outside employment. “ICE is now officially pulling back from its disastrous and harmful actions that terminated the status of nearly 5,000 students with visas but only after AILA members and others filed dozens of lawsuits,” Gregory Chen, AILA's senior director of government relations, said in a statement. “While ICE pulling back on its massive mistake now gives some relief to thousands of people, there are still long-term harms that continue to hurt these students and their families as well as American universities, research institutions and businesses. Senior District Judge Jeffrey White, who sits in San Francisco, is requesting that the administration submit additional information about the new statement. One of those attorneys, John Sinodis called the new ICE statement “woefully inadequate” as he asked what it would mean for students who left the country because their records had been terminated. Would they be given a new visa to reenter, he asked. Will ICE arrest and detain those whose visas were revoked? The judge himself seemed skeptical that the issues before him had been fully resolved, pushing back when a DOJ attorney urged him to consider that there was a “new world order” with Friday's announcement. “It seems like, from this administration, there's a new world order every single day,” Judge White said.</p>

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Walter T. Blanks Jr. joins 'Fox & Friends' to detail how Ohio's EdChoice program helped him obtain a college degree. A new study revealed the drastic benefits Ohio's school choice voucher program provided for students, specifically helping minorities, low-income families, males and struggling learners thrive in the classroom. American Federation for Children spokesperson Walter T. Blanks Jr., a beneficiary of the program, was two grades behind in school when his mother decided to take action. He revealed how the scholarship she found saved his life and turned his academic trajectory around during "Fox & Friends." I was in an educational environment that just simply did not work for me," Blanks Jr. told Ainsley Earhardt on Friday. "I was severely bullied, and the principal told my mom, 'If you just give us five years we'll have the middle school turned around and the high school turned around,' and my mom said, ‘In five years Walter will either be in jail or in a body bag,' and so she found out about the EdChoice Scholarship Program, and it changed my life." "It saved my life, and now I have the opportunity to continue that fight for other students." The Urban Institute released a study this week indicating Ohio's Educational Choice Scholarship (EdChoice) Program boosted long-term academic outcomes for beneficiaries in terms of college enrollment and graduation rates. The college enrollment rate among Black scholarship recipients surged 18%. The study also found that beneficiaries were more likely to enroll in college and earn a bachelor's degree than public school counterparts. The data also indicated that the college enrollment rate was 16% higher for scholarship recipients than for public school students and the college graduation rate was 8% higher. Banks Jr., who previously attended a school that was deemed failing by state standards, received a scholarship to a private Christian school, and that was ultimately the catalyst that allowed him to turn his life around. "Not only was I getting the academic portion, but also the moral side of things. And so my parents trusted that when I went to this school that I would be raised in the right way, become a man integrity, which I have." "It was a massive blessing, not just for my family, but for countless families out there in the state of Ohio," he continued. Banks Jr. went on to continue his academic career by receiving a bachelor's degree in journalism and media production from Mount Vernon Nazarene University. "At the federal level, President Trump is a massive supporter of school choice across the country, which is why he supports the Educational Choice for Children Act, because every single family should have the option to be in the best educational environment that works for them and their family," Blanks Jr. said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Biden did not attend the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2023, which occurred during his presidency. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush will not attend the funeral. Bush spokesman Freddy Ford said the 43rd president “did not have the privilege of knowing Pope Francis” and therefore was unlikely to attend. During his presidency, Bush attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005. “In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound — embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners — he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another.” It is unclear whether former President Bill Clinton will attend, and his office didn't respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that he will attend the funeral, which will be held Saturday in Rome at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern), six days after the pope's death. “Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Vance calls it a ‘blessing' to visit Pope Francis shortly before death Vance visited Francis on Easter Sunday, less than 24 hours before his death, during a seven-day trip to Europe and India that included the vice president's entire nuclear family. On Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced that his deputy, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), will lead a bipartisan delegation of 10 House lawmakers to the funeral, a list that includes former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? American campuses, the video warns, had become hotbeds of anti-Israel extremism: safe spaces for students to attend “Jew-hating conferences and anti-American rallies.” To fight this, Canary Mission would build an extensive database of students and professors who engaged in anti-Israel activity. “These individuals are applying for jobs within your company,” the Canary Mission video warns. “It is your duty to ensure that today's radicals are not tomorrow's employees.” People listed in the database have been harassed, disciplined, and even fired. Israeli intelligence has used Canary Mission profiles as justification for detaining listed visitors at the border. After plainclothes officers arrested Tufts University graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk on the streets of Boston in late March, Öztürk's attorneys claimed the sole reason for her arrest was her Canary Mission profile. While the Trump administration claims she had engaged in activity “in support of Hamas,” the private Homeland Security memo justifying her detention only cited an op-ed she had written in support of boycotting Israel, using language very similar to her Canary Mission page. After Öztürk's arrest, Canary Mission's X account posted a celebratory tweet claiming “sources point to her Canary Mission profile as the primary cause.” It currently maintains a list of seven other students and professors who it believes should be targeted for deportation. Two of these, Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi, are currently in ICE custody. Canary Mission's rise is not really a story about one organization, or even the toxic climate of America's Israel-Palestine debate. And when such groups can align themselves with a friendly government, the danger rises exponentially. But Canary Mission is unusual in two respects: its opaque structure and extremely aggressive tactics. On paper, its headquarters are in Israel — specifically Beit Shemesh, a medium-sized city near Jerusalem. Yet the address listed on its paperwork is in a padlocked, seemingly abandoned building. Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. It's an unusual setup that effectively allows Canary Mission to keep its funding sources fully anonymous. “I can't think of another one that hides their funding like this.” But it is necessary, in part, because Canary Mission has been a lightning rod for controversy even within the pro-Israel community. And many of these groups engage in political activity — like documenting Jewish students' concerns about campus antisemitism or creating new right-leaning Middle East studies journals — that are within the confines of legitimate debate and activism in a democratic society. But Canary Mission represents a different, and more aggressive, strain of campus pro-Israel activism, one that aims not to debate pro-Palestinian students and scholars but to silence them. Lila Corwin Berman, a historian of Jewish philanthropy at New York University, dates this approach to roughly the early 2000s. During that time, pro-Israel organizations like Campus Watch and the David Project began publicly targeting professors and students that they believed had engaged in unacceptable speech. These efforts were haphazard at the outset, publishing specific attacks on allegedly problematic scholars rather than maintaining a full-on blacklist. Canary Mission's database, first unveiled in 2014, represented a qualitative escalation — one explicitly aimed at creating professional problems for anti-Israel activists. In 2018, pro-Israel campus groups at five major universities published a joint op-ed calling on the movement to repudiate Canary Mission. This internal criticism did not do much to stop the Canary Mission's growth, fueled as it was by unaccountable backers. Today, Canary Mission's searchable database is vast — containing entries for over 2,000 individuals across 38 states, DC, and five Canadian provinces. To understand why Canary Mission is so controversial, start by looking at how its blacklist works. Each individual listing contains both a dossier documenting the target's alleged offenses and their contact information, including direct links to their social media accounts that can facilitate targeted harassment campaigns. Some Canary Mission targets have said or done something that many would find offensive, such as endorsing the October 7, 2023, massacre. But the vast majority of profiles I could find were individuals who either attended a pro-Palestinian rally or wrote something critical about Israel's policies towards the Palestinians. Canary Mission will describe this banal activity in threatening terms, like “attending a pro-Hamas rally.” But the speech in question is more than just legally protected: It is exactly the sort of political activity that people in a democracy are supposed to use as a vehicle for expressing their opinion. The Mission's database isn't primarily about identifying examples of extreme anti-Israel speech or political violence — it is about trying to silence any criticism of Israel by labeling it antisemitic or pro-terrorist. Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student facing deportation, is a case in point. There is no plausible case that people like Öztürk constitute any kind of threat to Jews on campus. That she is listed by Canary Mission — and that the organization publicly cheered her arrest — reveals its primary interest in policing speech critical of Israel by any means necessary. The American Jewish community is fairly left-wing; roughly two-thirds disapprove of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government. While a strong majority supports Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, large numbers of American Jews believe its occupation of Palestinian territory is both strategically unwise and morally indefensible. There is also a minority of anti-Zionist American Jews, more prominent in younger generations, who support the dissolution of Israel and its replacement with a binational state. Reading their dossiers, like the profile of eminent Holocaust historian Omer Bartov, their alleged offenses include everything from criticizing the Netanyahu government's approach to judicial reform to attending a pro-Palestinian demonstration. If Canary Mission were truly about protecting Jews' rights to participate freely in campus life, then it wouldn't include them on a database explicitly designed to hurt their career prospects. We don't know for a fact that the Trump administration is using Canary Mission's database to identify deportation targets. But so far, there is no direct proof of a link. Yet regardless of whether Canary Mission entries are currently directing policy, it's clear they wish to be seen as doing so. They do this not only by maintaining their list of seven people they wish were deported, but also posting messages in support for actual deportations with slogans like “pro-Hamas extremism has consequences” and “no more safe havens for terror supporters.” Canary Mission has graduated from “merely” advocating professional consequences for pro-Palestinian voices to endorsing outright state repression against them. The idea of trying to silence political opponents rather than debate them is dangerous. There are certainly cases where speech merits consequences: If a professor says discriminatory things about Jewish students, for example, or an activist advocates violence against her peers. But these are generally seen as exceptions rather than rules in free societies: the “boundary cases” where toleration for political expression runs up against other important values. Canary Mission was founded on the opposite principle: that an entire category of speech, pro-Palestinian advocacy, should be treated as presumptively illegitimate. They believe the cause of defending Israel is best served not by engaging in rigorous debate and advocacy, but by making a giant list of people who believe the “wrong” things and ensuring they suffer consequences for those beliefs. No elected leader can turn a democracy into an authoritarian regime on their own. They need partners, influential people and organizations that can operate to weaken resistance to democratic backsliding and help create a climate of fear in which anti-government activity is perceived as costly. However, Chambers and Kopstein warned, this doesn't mean they'll always be irrelevant. Even if “illiberal forces cannot destabilize the state,” the authors write, “they can still “contribute to an insidious erosion of values that leaves liberalism vulnerable to all sorts of threat.” Canary Mission's behavior in the past 10 years shows that this warning was prescient.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is considering eliminating the 988 Suicide Prevention and Crisis Lifeline's specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth as a way to cut back on funding for next year's discretionary budget for mental health, according to an internal document reviewed by CNN. The preliminary memo, dated April 10, previews the administration's possible plans to slash discretionary federal health spending and rework health agencies as President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. consolidate many functions of the US Department of Health and Human Services into the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA. Related article Internal Trump administration document reveals massive budget cut proposal for federal health agencies The White House Office of Management and Budget did not respond to CNN's request for comment. In July 2022, the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launched under the Biden administration, transitioning what was a 10-digit number to an easier-to-remember three-digit number. Soon after its launch, the 988 Lifeline included a subnetwork for LGBTQ+ individuals to connect with specialized services. There have been some discussions within the Trump administration around ending the 988 Lifeline's LGBTQ+ subnetwork, according to a person in HHS who has worked closely with the 988 Lifeline team and who asked for anonymity because they were recently given a Reduction in Force notice but hope to keep their job. “Suicide rates are four times higher among LGBTQ youth than others,” the person said. Related article Many 988 callers will now get help based on where they are, not their phone's area code As of mid-March, more than 14.5 million people have called, texted or sent chats to the 988 Lifeline and been transferred to a crisis contact center since July 2022, according to data from the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. About 1.2 million of those were routed to the LGBTQ+ specialized service. Ending the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's LGBTQ+ youth specialized services will not just strip away access from millions of LGBTQ+ kids and teens – it will put their lives at risk,” Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, said in a news release. “These programs were implemented to address a proven, unprecedented, and ongoing mental health crisis among our nation's young people with strong bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by President Trump himself,” he said. Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, who served as HHS's assistant secretary for mental health and substance use in the Biden administration, said she worries about how the agency's restructuring may affect 988 as a public health resource as well as other services and programs that fall under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. “There's been some discussion and questions about whether the LGBTQ+ line will remain, and so I am concerned about that part of 988,” she said. Related article What you should know about the ‘silent epidemic of suicide' Since 2022, the federal government has invested some $1.5 billion in the 988 project, including expanding access to services for Spanish speakers, LGBTQI+ youth and young adults, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing by creating sub-lifelines or subnetworks for those groups. Delphin-Rittmon said she worries about how certain staffing and funding support for 988 could shift or be eliminated under the HHS restructuring.</p>

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Creatine — yes, the favorite of gym rats everywhere, a supplement many of us have taken ourselves — is a naturally occurring compound that is already found inside each person. Scientists have been studying creatine since the 1830s and, for more than a century, we have known that it was pivotal for producing energy in our muscles. It didn't take long after that for creatine supplements to hit the shelves of drugstores and workout gyms nationwide. Not only was it cheap — a 10-ounce jar of creatine costs $17 on Amazon — but it was also an easy way for bodybuilders and exercise enthusiasts to improve their performance. Today, as many as one in four adults say they have used creatine; $400 million worth of it is sold in the US every year. And this was a supplement that really worked: A 2018 meta-analysis of the available research concluded that creatine is “the most effective nutritional supplement available to athletes to increase high intensity exercise capacity and muscle mass during training.” Across years of studies, no dangerous side effects have been detected. But the most surprising use of creatine supplements is in a setting that could not be further from the image of jacked-up bodybuilders pumping iron: treating depression. The compound helps your brain to convert nutrients into energy and scientists concluded that poor metabolism could help to explain various psychiatric disorders, including depression. In layman's terms, if your brain wasn't processing energy efficiently, it could have these negative side effects. A decade ago, the first clinical trials began testing whether creatine supplements improved depression among people who were also receiving antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy. The results have been impressive: A 2024 meta-review concluded that creatine had proven its effectiveness in supplementing those other treatments, leading people to feel better more quickly and be less likely to experience depression again. Now comes a new study, out of India, suggesting creatine could be helpful in treating depression without antidepressants being involved — a preliminary but potentially important finding as we search for cheaper and easier ways to provide help to more people who need it. The study, published earlier this year, was tiny and flew under the radar: 100 participants, in Dehradun, a city of 800,000 in India's far north. Lead researcher Nima Norbu Sherpa of Glasgow Caledonian University received a grant from an India-based charity, the Universal Human Rights and Social Development Association, to run the experiment. The setting is telling: Part of creatine's appeal in mental health treatment is not only its potential efficacy but also that it's cheap and doesn't require a professional clinician; patients can take it on their own. One group also received 5 milligrams of creatine every day, while the other got a placebo. After eight weeks, both groups were improving — cognitive behavioral therapy itself is, of course, a well-attested treatment for depression. But the patients who took creatine on top of their therapy were doing better still. People in both groups started a little below 18 on average, indicating moderately severe depression. Eleven people who were taking creatine throughout the study reported going into remission, meaning they could effectively return to normal life; only five people taking placebos said the same. The reported side effects for people taking creatine were mild. — warrants being clear and cautious in how we interpret the findings. “Previous sensationalist messages in this research area, e.g., creatine, physical exercise, keto diet, have caused more harm to the science than benefit,'” De Giorgi told me over email. More research that replicates the same results is needed before we can be confident that creatine plus therapy is a winning combination. Peter Attia, a physician who writes about longevity and health enhancement and was not involved with the study, wrote in covering the study's findings that “since many people already use creatine as part of their supplement routine, it could be an easy addition for those looking to improve mental health without major lifestyle changes.” Its affordability and ubiquity could also make it appealing for people with fewer resources, like those who participated in the India study. He did, however, also caution that more evidence would be necessary before we can figure out whether and how creatine fits into “the therapeutic toolbox.” More than two-thirds of the world's population can't get access to conventional mental health treatments.

"It's not that I mind tipping in the right context," he said. "It's just that fast food, by nature, has traditionally been a non-tipping experience." About 77% said the quality of the service they receive is a "major factor" in deciding whether to tip and how much. "Unless they make less than minimum wage, no need to tip." Another user wrote that if there's a tip option at a fast-food restaurant, "it should be an instant zero … unless they make less than minimum wage, no need to tip." Most fast-food restaurants are required to pay the federal minimum wage, and some states have an even higher minimum wage. "More often than not, I don't tip at fast-food places unless the staff has gone above and beyond – or if it's a locally-owned spot that I want to support," Nordstrom said. "Tipping is tied to service – not just the act of handing over an order that was pre-prepared." "Tipping is tied to service – not just the act of handing over an order that was pre-prepared," one customer said. But people who work in the service or retail industry may have a different perspective. "If the option comes up, I'm always happy to tip," Blair Dubinsky, a client advisor at a luxury-brand retail store in New York City, told Fox News Digital. "Working with the public isn't easy, and if that's the way I can thank them, I don't mind doing it." The custom of tipping is strictly American, according to Sarah Aynesworth, a Texas-based etiquette consultant who trained at the Protocol School of Washington. "'TIP' is an acronym for 'to insure promptness,' which began during Prohibition," she told Fox News Digital. "People would get their alcohol delivered faster if they gave a little bit of extra money." Blair Dubinksy, a client advisor at a luxury-brand retail store in New York City, said she's always happy to tip. Aynesworth said she does not always tip the customary 20% when dining at a casual or fast-food restaurant. "That's really for more of a seated, served meal, where someone is refilling your water and giving you an experience," she said. "At a fast-food restaurant, you're paying for fast food." For those who do decide to tip, pay attention to the numbers on the screen before tapping, said Aynesworth. "Sometimes they are prompting you to pay even more than a normal percentage," she said. Nordstrom said he has noticed auto-tip options creeping higher, sometimes starting at 25%. "When I'm being prompted to tip for things like grabbing a water, it seems a bit excessive, especially when the cashier is staring at you," he said. Dubinsky said she often tips fast-food workers – not out of obligation, but simply as a courtesy. "I don't think people should necessarily feel like they need to tip at a fast-food restaurant … however, people put in the effort to take the order and make the food, so I think it's very polite to tip." If picking up takeout food and there's an option to tip, she said she will usually leave one, but not if picking up food from a window, "because I'm not interacting with anyone." "If tipping becomes an expectation everywhere … then its meaning as a reward for above-and-beyond hospitality is lost." Nordstrom said he believes it should not always be expected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Related article Uncertainty around NIH funding leaves Alzheimer's studies in limbo The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation's foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas. The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally. KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated. Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. “We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.” “It's science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn't respond to requests for comment. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses. Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation's public health. Related article Scholars, groups sue Trump administration over canceled NIH research funding At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month. Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I'm gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS. KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network's funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women. “This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children. “It's important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu. He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read. Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis. Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren't immune to the NIH's terminations. Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn't receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children's vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated. Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we're able to do.” Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH's Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. The NIH's grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress. The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported over 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that's more acute in rural communities. Related article ‘People will die based on these decisions': Trump administration cuts funding for dozens of HIV studies Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work. “Even if there are changes in the next administration, we're looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said.

Theologian and Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss what's to come in the wake of Pope Francis' death. But how much of the Academy Award winner is accurate to the real event about to take place? Bryan Pham, a Jesuit priest and associate director for Catholic Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, told Fox News Digital he believes the movie was accurate according to the "timeline and sequence of events of how to handle the death of a pope, the relaying of information, the gathering of the cardinals, and general procedures of getting the new pope elected." "Although, in real-life, these conversations happen in what is called ‘general congregation' and is much more formal," he said. "But of course, cardinals are also mere mortals, so gossips and side-conversations do happen." "Conclave," which came out last year and won the Oscar in March for best adapted screenplay, stars Ralph Fiennes as the cardinal in charge of the conclave after a fictional pope dies. It also stars Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow. "Where ‘Conclave' was clearly a Hollywood movie that wants to be sensational, create potential scandals for shock value in order to make money and perhaps perpetuate the anti-Catholic sentiment (especially in the United States)" was "everything else that played into the negative aspect of the Catholic mystique that perpetuate the Catholic Church as primitive and byzantine," he said. "There were beautiful imageries, and the cinematography was excellent. I only wish Isabella Rossellini had a more prominent role (or lines); she is such an accomplished actor to be cast in such a relatively minor role." Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, who has personally witnessed three conclaves and is heading back to Rome for this one, said viewership of the movie spiked because it's "in the zeitgeist. Amazon Prime made "Conclave" available for free on its streaming service on Monday after the pope died. Arroyo said he thinks a superior movie to "Conclave" is 1968's "The Shoes of the Fisherman," starring Anthony Quinn, which also depicts a conclave and is "more gripping and dramatic and interesting." "And frankly, that's the best part of ‘Conclave,' which is otherwise a very boring, draggy movie," Arroyo said. He noted that "the writing of the ballot, the going up and swearing before Michelangelo's last judgment," raising their ballots and making an oath to the last judgment, placing the ballots in a vessel and having them counted by counters was all accurate. "Conclave" won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay. "They count votes, and then they run a needle and string through them," he continued. Arroyo said all the potential choices for pope are already vetted. "That's one dysfunctional Vatican," he joked of the movie. "That's all I can say on the screen. And the real one is dysfunctional enough. Arroyo said that tradition goes back to one conclave when the cardinals weren't able to elect a pope for a year, "and the conclave kept dragging on, and they hadn't elected a pope, so they decided to lock them in the place and not give them food or water, pressure them to make a decision." He said that while the traditions and ancient rituals "themselves are beautiful," why they're done is "always more fascinating." "I thought the movie ‘Conclave' exploited the church's visuals to drive home a message and a version of the church that just isn't on point," he said. "I mean, when the nuns [were] lecturing all the cardinals while they're eating, that would never happen. And look, I know a lot of cardinals. He agreed with Pham that the business of meeting with the candidates "and getting comfortable with the man who might be pope or at least the major candidates" usually happens at dinners and other events before they are locked in during the conclave. Ralph Fiennes at the New York premiere of "Conclave" in October (John Nacion/Getty Images) Arroyo said he will head to Rome during the nine days of mourning for the pope. "Those nine days are when all the business of the conclave is really done," he explains. "By the time they go into the conclave, they pretty much have at least a top one and two candidates that they're moving toward." He said the movie clearly had "great production designers and costumers who tried to match the locations and the places, and they didn't get that wrong. But he said they missed "the heart of" what it's all about. You know, Jesus didn't say follow me in doubt. So that's what you're called to do. And no, doubt is not part of that." He continued, "The wonder of miracles is that, you know, they defy reality, they defy natural law. But there's no doubt involved in that. It either happened or didn't happen. But if it happens, it wakes a lot of people up, and that's what happened initially. And that's why these people gave their lives for what Jesus said and for Christ himself. They gave their life because he rose again." "That idea of doubt being at the heart of faith and at the heart of the church is a stupid one," he said, "and one that people, I think a certain cast of mind, would like the church to pursue that path." The movie, he said, "cast a certain ideological vision that they imagined the church should be, and it was an open, it's basically an open church, cut off from the very traditions that they celebrated and that the movie profits off of." "The movie sought to propagate a version of Catholicism cut off from the very traditions and rituals that the movie celebrates, holds up and made a lot of money," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days after his death, the memory of Pope Francis remains vivid in the places he used to visit personally. VATICAN CITY (AP) — In the streets around the Vatican, where Pope Francis used to make impromptu outings, some of the shopkeepers are mourning the man they knew, not as the leader of a church or head of state, but as an ordinary person. “He had been our regular customer for more than seven years,” said Sebastian Padrón, an Argentine ice cream maker whose store is located around the corner from Francis' austere hotel room in Vatican City. He recalled how close he and his family felt to Francis, who often gave gifts to his children. “The memory is wonderful, which is why it hurts so much,” he told The Associated Press on Thursday. Francis had a notorious sweet tooth, and Padrón's dulce de leche ice cream, a typical Argentine caramel dessert, became the pope's favorite. When Francis became pope in 2013, he opted to live in the Domus Santa Marta hotel rather than the lavish papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace, overlooking St. Peter's Square. He moved around Rome in an ordinary hatchback and popped into stores to buy shoe insoles, change eyeglass lenses and buy recordings of classical music and tango from his native Argentina. “I met a man who was full of smiles, very friendly,” said Raniero Mancinelli, a Roman tailor who sold the basic pectoral cross that Francis wore for decades. Mancinelli, who was tailor to the last three popes, said that, unlike his predecessors, Francis wanted everything to be simple, practical and inexpensive. Mancinelli said he sold Francis a cardinal's sash before the conclave that eventually elected him pope. Francis caused havoc among tourists and Romans several times when he showed up at an optician's shop in Rome's historic center. Luca Spiezia, who owns the store with his father, remembered his surprise at the pope introducing himself simply as “Francesco” when they met in 2015. Offered a new pair of glasses, Francis declined, asking only for new lenses in his old frames and insisting on paying for the work. “He never made you feel that he was a powerful figure in the world, even though he was the head of the church,” Spiezia said. “I hope that this will be continuing with the next pope.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration is loosening rules to help U.S. automakers like Elon Musk's Tesla develop self-driving cars so they can take on Chinese rivals. U.S. companies developing self-driving cars will be allowed exemptions from certain federal safety rules for testing purposes, the Transportation Department said Thursday. The department also said it will streamline crash reporting requirements involving self-driving software that Musk has criticized as onerous and will move toward a single set of national rules for the technology to replace a patchwork of state regulations. “We're in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn't be higher,” said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard.” The new exemption procedures will allow U.S. automakers to apply to skip certain safety rules for self-driving vehicles if they are used only for research, demonstrations and other non-commercial purposes. The exemptions were in place previously for foreign, imported vehicles whose home country rules may be different than those in the U.S. It's not clear how the exemptions from National Traffic Safety Administration rules will affect Tesla specifically. The company has pinned its future on complete automation of its cars, but it is facing stiff competition now from rivals, especially China automaker BYD. The crash reporting rule being changed has drawn criticism from Musk as too burdensome and unfair. The transportation statement Thursday said reporting will be loosened to “remove unnecessary and duplicative” requirements but that the obligation to report crashes will remain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hogg was elected earlier this year to his DNC leadership role following 2024 election losses that saw President Donald Trump enter the White House for a second time and Republicans take control of both houses of Congress. As vice chairman, Hogg has been outspoken regarding his plan to launch a primary initiative that would spend $20 million on electing younger politicians through his organization, Leaders We Deserve. DNC Chairman Ken Martin, however, told the Washington Examiner that he has no “intention” of forcing out Hogg. Concha has noted that Hogg's left-wing views have created a greater fracture within the Democratic Party, making progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) “look centrist.” His comments come as the party is experiencing record-low polling figures. “This is a party that needs to go towards the center again, like Bill Clinton did in 1994. Concha argued that Hogg does not have the political maturity to change course regarding his views. When asked what might come next for Hogg, should he be ousted from his DNC role, Concha suggested he could “get a job at MSNBC or be the first male host of The View.” The senior writer for the Washington Examiner also said he believes Trump will win his current trade battle that has found his administration in negotiations with several countries after issuing new tariffs. However, Concha noted that if Trump is not successful with his tariffs, or if the economy does not improve, the Democrats' current disarray may have an opportunity to right itself. “If he wins that,” Concha said regarding Trump's current economic and trade war, “then Democrats will be in Sherwood Forest as far as the political wilderness for a very long time. If that goes the other way, then Democrats have an opportunity because Donald Trump's failure is their gain.”</p>
