They are Giancarlo Esposito (Captain America: Brave New World), Tatiana Maslany (The Monkey), Victoria Moroles (Never Have I Ever), Will Price (A Complete Unknown), and Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire). No word on the roles to be played by these actors. Currently in production in New York City, the film follows Harry (Turturro), a career pickpocket who is forced into a desperate, high-stakes race against time through the streets of his city. Freshly cast in Amazon MGM's Your Mother Your Mother Your Mother and crime thriller By Any Means, Esposito is coming off turns in Netflix's The Residence and The Electric State and Marvel's Captain America: Brave New World.

Most recently seen in James Mangold's A Complete Unknown, Price has an impressive slate coming up with turns in Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, Maude Apatow's Poetic License, Scarlett Johansson's Eleanor the Great, and Tim Robinson's new HBO series, The Chair Company. A Golden Globe, SAG and Emmy winner known for work in myriad classic films and TV series, Buscemi will next be seen in Netflix's hit series Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fellow director Francis Ford Coppola, who's set to receive the AFI Life Achievement Award on Saturday, was a big topic of conversation throughout Lucas' remarks. Lucas is presenting Coppola with his AFI honor alongside Steven Spielberg, as Lucas and Coppola have a long history of friendship and collaboration. 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' Rerelease Tops 'Accountant 2' With $3.4M in Box Office Previews Lucas and Coppola met working on the latter's 1968 film Finian's Rainbow, where Lucas was essentially interning at Warner Bros. after winning the Samuel Warner Scholarship. Lucas, who was 22 at the time, said it was “so boring” sitting on set, as he had no interest in making theatrical films, and he recalls a 27-year-old Coppola approaching him. “I'm watching you make a movie, but it's really boring. I don't want to make these kind of movies,” Lucas recalled telling Coppola when asked why he was on set, which kicked off a friendship and long partnership between the two. Lucas also shared the start of his San Francisco-based film production company American Zoetrope with Coppola, which they founded in late 1969. Mankiewicz joked throughout as Lucas would continue talking about his work with Coppola instead of answering the question at hand. Lucas did eventually venture into Star Wars territory, sharing the discussions he had with the film's studio, 20th Century Fox, around his contract. The director, who was coming off his Oscar-nominated film American Graffiti, said the studio was concerned he'd try to ask for more money. “I'm not going to do that here,” he recalled telling the studio. “Beside that, I'd like licensing,” he remembers telling the studio. Lucas said the studio talked about it and decided that they'd give them to him because there's no way he'd make a profit from it. Lucas also spoke about Yoda, one of Empire Strikes Back's most notable additions to the Stars Wars universe, and his distinctive way of speaking. “It was done purposely because if you [are] speaking regular English, people don't listen that much. But if you have an accent or it's really hard to understand what he's saying, they focus on what he's saying,” the director explained. The festival runs through April 27 with viewings around Hollywood. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

A future Head Gamemaker and rebellion leader, Plutarch Heavensbee was previously played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman; his performances in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Parts 1 and 2 were his final film roles. Sunrise on the Reaping sold 1.5 million copies in its first week on sale in the U.S., UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand after it hit shelves in March. Francis Lawrence will direct from a screenplay adaptation by Billy Ray. Color Force's Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson will produce. Meredith Wieck and Scott O'Brien are overseeing the project for Lionsgate. “Jesse is one of the most talented actors of his generation, with a proven record of picking his roles selectively,” said Erin Westerman, co-president, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. “We are honored that he has chosen to bring his own take to one of the most fascinating figures in Panem, and feel that his previous collaboration with Philip Seymour Hoffman makes it all the more special. His Plutarch will be both a tribute to the character fans have already come to know and a portrayal he makes his own. We can't wait for audiences to see it.” Added producer Jacobson of Color Force, “Jesse has been one of my favorite actors since I first saw him in ‘Friday Night Lights.' Plemons was most recently seen in the Netflix series Zero Day opposite Robert De Niro. Other past credits include being nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in The Power of the Dog, Kinds of Kindness and Killers of the Flower Moon. His upcoming credits include a reteaming with Yorgos Lanthimos in Bugonia and a role in an untitled film from director Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The actor stars in the Looney Tunes film, which was recently saved by Ketchup Entertainment after being scrapped by Warner Bros. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	A few weeks after Coyote vs. Acme was officially saved by Ketchup Entertainment and is headed to theaters, star Will Forte is still in shock. 


	The Looney Tunes film, featuring Forte and John Cena opposite an animated Wile E. Coyote, became the most talked about movie in Hollywood in late 2023 when The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Warner Bros. intended to scrap the movie as part of a $115 million writedown. It appeared it would never be released, but a social media campaign to save the project helped lead to an acquisition deal between Ketchup and Warners for the worldwide rights.

					Will Forte Says His "Biggest Regret" Is Not Doing 'The Amazing Race' With Val Kilmer		
			









	At the Los Angeles premiere of his new show The Four Seasons on Thursday, Forte told THR that “words cannot describe” how he's feeling about the movie's changed fate.

	“I never thought it would happen so it just came out of nowhere and I'm so thrilled,” he said. “Thank you Ketchup Entertainment, I'm so excited for people to see this movie. I'm gonna promote the crap out of it, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll go, I'll do whatever — go to the top of Mount Everest, I'm there.” 


	Forte had previously been vocal about the shelving, telling MovieWeb earlier this year, “My thoughts were that it's a fucking bullshit,” before adding, “It is such a delightful movie. It deserves so much better … I can't tell you possibly why the decision was made to not release it, but it makes my blood boil.”  


	The film — directed by Dave Green and produced by Chris deFaria and James Gunn — does not yet have a release date.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When “American Idol” judges Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie delivered their decision on which four contestants would round out the top 14 on April 21, 2025, Baylee Littrell did not make the cut after performing John Legend's “All of Me.” That was a shocker for lots of Backstreet Boys fans who've been cheering on the son of BSB member Brian Littrell since he confirmed his 22-year-old son had auditioned. Moments after the top 14 was finalized, Underwood acknowledged to “Entertainment Tonight” that she was aware Brian, who attended and even sang during his son's audition, was likely a bit upset with the judges over their decision. When the outlet asked Underwood about him possibly being upset, she replied, “Um, don't think it didn't cross my mind!” Baylee, meanwhile, told “ET” after he got cut, “It's been a very long journey, a lot of pre-judgment, and now, uh, these guys gave me my chance. Though Baylee received tons of support from BSB fans, he also faced a great deal of criticism from “Idol” viewers who labeled him a “nepo baby,” riding on the coattails of his famous dad. Baylee's famous dad responded to his son's April 22 Instagram post about being cut from the competition, writing, “Bubba I am and always will be in your corner. It's never the end, only the beginning for so many to be blessed by your gifts….. you killed it last night. Brian's wife, Leighanne Littrell, also weighed in on their son's post, disappointed that “Idol” didn't upload his final performance to its social media pages. “I wish they would have posted last nights performance,” she wrote. You are a true artist, no bells and whistles needed! I can't wait for what's to come!” Another Backstreet Boy, Kevin Richardson, wrote on Baylee's post, “So glad you got to experience this. It got your name and music out for the world to see!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dorit Kemsley revealed she was “blindsided” during “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” Season 14 reunion, but it wasn't by anything her co-stars said. In an April 2025 interview with Rollacoaster, the Bravo TV personality noted that she experienced an unexpected moment from her estranged husband, PK, during the sitdown with Andy Cohen. “I was completely blindsided when PK had sent a statement,” Kemsley shared in the interview. I never believed that things could ever get to a place where our bond and the foundation would ever be broken to the extent that we could do things to hurt each other that crosses the line.” In May 2024, Dorit and PK Kemsley announced they were separating after nine years of marriage. The split news came just as filming for RHOBH Season 14 began. Despite the split, PK filmed some scenes for Season 14. Much to Dorit Kemsley's surprise, Cohen read PK's statement during the reunion. “I was invited to be part of the reunion, but declined because I don't believe engaging with Dorit in this forum would be constructive,” read PK's statement, per BravoTV.com. “Dorit has made several mischaracterizations about me, but the one I must address is the claim that I am a bad father,” he continued. It is deeply hurtful to me and more importantly, to our children, who, despite Dorit's assertion, will inevitably see and hear all of this at a time not of our choosing.” “Those closest to us know the truth,” PK added. The Dorit I married would never have allowed this, much less caused it. I can only hope this version of Dorit finds her way back to the person she once was.” PK's reaction was to his ex's comments about his alleged parenting style during an exchange with Kathy Hilton in Season 14, Episode 10 of RHOBH. After Hilton asked of PK, “I think he's a very good father. ….I've protected him at all costs no matter what, and I don't think he realizes that.” Kemsley later apologized for her comments on the RHOBH After Show. You can only take the high road for so long.” “I know that there are brighter days ahead,” she said.</p>

Last Thursday night, moviegoers across this godforsaken land rabidly made their way to the nearest multiplex — or pilgrimaging across state lines to the closest theater capable of projecting 15-Perf IMAX 70mm film — in order to see early screenings of the first original blockbuster from a gifted filmmaker whose fame has been predicated upon his ability to put a strong personal stamp on increasingly generic Hollywood franchises. At that very same time, halfway around the world, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and chief creative officer Dave Filoni took the stage at Star Wars Celebration 2025 in Chiba, Japan to announce that the next chapter of cinema's most iconic saga would be directed by a filmmaker whose fame has been predicated upon his ability to be friends with Ryan Reynolds. Related Stories ‘Sinners' Took a Nice Bite Out of a Random Tuesday at the Box Office Ryan Coogler Thanks Over 40 ‘Cinematic Influences' Who Inspired ‘Sinners,' Including Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino, and Brian De Palma While both have their value, those values are in a constant state of flux, and they can only be determined with any real accuracy by measuring the difference between them. Seldom has that difference ever seemed more dramatic than it did at the fateful moment when “Sinners” mania overlapped with the reveal of “Star Wars: Starfighter.” On the one hand, you have an ultra-personal multiplex event that could not and would not have been made by anyone else — a music-driven genre mash-up that reworks age-old vampire tropes into a fresh, thoughtful, and deliciously hot-blooded period saga rooted in the specifics of Black history. While “Sinners” was offering one audience something they had never seen before, “Star Wars: Starfighter” was pitching a different audience a movie so generic and familiar that even its title sounds like it's repeating itself. (Just to be clear, this isn't Starfighter the ship. And, while anything's possible, I'm not suggesting that Coogler's movie will ultimately outgross the first “Star Wars” feature that promises to pick up from the saga where “Episode IX” left off. You couldn't have scripted a better way of confirming the reality that studios have been trying to prevent ever since they offered mid-budget movies as a blood sacrifice at the altar of mega-tentpole franchises: Mediocrity is losing its grip on the public imagination. (Cookie-cutter as “A Minecraft Movie” might have been in the end, I maintain that getting the “Napoleon Dynamite” guy to adapt a plotless video game about blocks was less of a slam-dunk than it seems, and the Chicken Jockey phenomenon speaks to a degree of novelty that was missing from recent short-fallers like “Captain America: Brave New World.”) Levy's hiring only seems to deepen the sense that Jon Favreau's forthcoming “The Mandalorian and Grogu” — possibly the worst movie title I've heard since “Star Wars: Starfighter,” in addition to being an outgrowth of a TV show that lost most of its luster two seasons ago — isn't just a stop-gap to buy the franchise some time, but also a reflection of the studio's apprehensiveness to make any decisions it can't take back. I know that Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand weren't exactly the most idiosyncratic directors of their day either, but the second and third “Star Wars” movies didn't have to justify their own existences in the same way that “Starfighter” will; they didn't come out at a time when people could watch a variety of aggressively mid “Star Wars” TV shows from the comfort of their homes. Not only is the film about pop art's power to preserve cultural memory as part of an intergenerational song of pain, hope, and the pursuit of freedom, it was sold on the strength of Ryan Coogler's self-evident passion for telling this particular story (a story whose origins trace back to his late uncle James, who once seeded the young filmmaker's imagination with vivid details about growing up in the Delta). Warner Bros. didn't hide the fact that audiences would get two Michael B. Jordans for the price of one, or that both of them would square off in a blues-soaked battle royale against a horde of white blood-suckers at the height of the Jim Crow South, but it's no accident that the most effective piece of marketing — by far — was a 10-minute Kodak video in which Coogler talked people through his new movie's various screening formats. Cutting between exclusive “Sinners” footage and film school-worthy clips of Coogler standing in front of the diagrams he'd drawn on a white board, the video went viral because it clearly illustrated how much this shit means to him, and how much attention he and his team paid to making the experience special for moviegoers. As the director said in a recent interview: “I want people walking out of the theater and thinking, ‘Man, I had a full meal. Everybody on the project knew that this was going to theaters. They all care about seeing movies on the big screen and what it feels like when you see a good one.” You don't need to care about the difference between 2.76:1 and 1.90:1 to feel it in your bones when the screen widens during the film's climactic siege, and you sure as hell don't need to care about it in order to appreciate a director making so earnest an appeal to our attention at a time when most studio movies feel like they were made with the same casual indifference that audiences have been conditioned to watch them. While Coogler's first original project was always going to command a certain amount of hype, the decision to lead with its importance to him galvanized people around the notion that “Sinners” was more than just another movie they could watch at home in three weeks (rave reviews from basically every critic in the country didn't hurt either). It's good that “Sinners” is great, but I tend to suspect that even a somewhat less successful version of the same film would have triggered a broadly similar response, which is to say that “Sinners” is sparking so much real excitement because it palpably came from such a real place. While it's not a coincidence that “Nope” was the last completely original movie to hit at this level (another self-aware spectacle that interrogated the blind spots of Black representation on screen, and will be dominating best of the decade lists in a few years' time), the fervor around “Sinners” also puts it in a category that Jordan Peele's creature feature shares with “Oppenheimer,” “Avatar,” and “Nosferatu.” Which is to say: Films that connected with audiences because they dared to emphasize an idiosyncratic creative vision over the safety of selling people on something they'd already seen before. Hollywood should be kissing Ryan Coogler's feet for creating a film that already feels like it belongs to him. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

When Joe Apollonio, the 33-year-old New York internet comic with a wild coif of reddish hair, names River Phoenix as one of his favorite actors, it all makes sense. “I get shit sometimes from my friends for not watching certain movies,” Apollonio told IndieWire at a brewery in Bryant Park (though Apollonio is five years sober). Related Stories ‘The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping' Finds Its Cast: Jesse Plemons, Joseph Zada, Whitney Peak, and McKenna Grace ‘Until Dawn' Director David F. Sandberg Almost Quit Making IP-Based Films After ‘Shazam 2' Death Threats Apollonio broke out from his long-running Instagram feed of quippy queer characters and outsize personalities with a solo show at Joe's Pub in New York's Noho in summer 2023, one that put his very close relationship with his single mom front and center. He now stars in his friend Amalia Ulman's quirky ethnocentricity satire “Magic Farm,” which premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, followed by Berlin, and opens from MUBI in theaters this Friday. Or, where they think is Argentina anyway, until they end up in the wrong South American country in a town also called San Cristobal. Apollonio grew up in the town of Babylon, Long Island, before moving to New York City after high school, training at Stella Adler and finding small roles on series like “Betty,” “Hacks,” and “Young Sheldon.” “In ‘Hacks,' I played a circuit twink with Owen Thiele. It was just two scenes in one episode. I played some angsty younger brother to Mandy, and it was fun. They turned that character into a main character on the spinoff of ‘Young Sheldon' [‘George and Mandy's First Marriage'], but they cast someone else.” If I try to play the tape forward, being in something like ‘Magic Farm,' it's an edgy enough thing for me to still be myself with things that I create, and it makes sense because it's on par. To be in something that mainstream and just for nuclear families in middle America [like ‘Young Sheldon'], maybe I would have to censor myself and dilute myself down.” Indeed, Apollonio makes his queerness the focal point of his Instagram comedy, where he has more than 14,000 followers and self-made video posts dating back a decade, often outré-costumed and hilariously, grotesquely Facetuned, dating back to 2014. “I would say that's how it really started, and then I think where it's going to continue is stuff like this and taking my writing and putting it up on stage, or making longer-form videos or movies. Instagram is so oversaturated now with people who think that they're funny, and they can just make a joke about something going on in the zeitgeist. I don't really want any part of that. I want to make things that are valuable to me, and I also don't want to make a bunch of shit for no money and just have it completely sidelined in this thralling crazy pool of the comedy algorithm, so I'm kind of over it.” “She had a knee replacement last year where I took care of her. It's kind of a vignette into what my life is going to look like at some point, which is a bit scary, but I can't be doing a cross-country move right now unless I have enough money to take her with me,” he said of the thought of moving to L.A. “The only relieving thing is everyone has to deal with this shit. She's a single mom, and I'm an only child. It's a central part of my work,” he said. “It's weird, though, because she's a Baby Boomer, and their notion of Hollywood and acting is far different from what it is now. I've been on TV and stuff, but she's always like, ‘When are you going to make it? Argentine-born Spanish artist-turned-filmmaker Amalia Ulman — the director of 2021's “El Planeta,” also about an only child's too-closeness with their mother — has been good friends with Apollonio for a few years now, which made it easy to cast him in “Magic Farm” among an ensemble that includes Chloë Sevigny, Simon Rex, and Alex Wolff. “People thought Amalia and I were dating,” Apollonio said. I don't know.” (In real life, Apollonio is dating trans star Bianca Leigh, who stars on Broadway's “Oh, Mary!”) That friendship eventually led to Chloë Sevigny, with whom Ulman had connected and whom Apollonio met at a Maison Margiela party before they got to work on the script with producer/filmmaker Eugene Kotlyarenko (a producer alongside Riccardo Maddalosso and Alex Hughes). “I was a barback at this place called Peel's in the Lower East Side. Once production on “Magic Farm” got underway in 2023, “We were filming in this town called San Antonio de Areco, which is two hours northwest of Buenos Aires. People go there to vacation; it's kind of like a resort town. Then we shot some stuff in New York about a month or so afterward,” he said. “I don't speak Spanish, so any sort of broken horrible Spanish I would use to order food made me feel super American. I was strutting down the street with my aviator glasses on, listening to music. I quickly got out of my own head and realized everyone was staring at me like an alien.” While “Magic Farm” drummed up buzz at Sundance and then Berlin (“the Germans loved it”), Apollonio said, “I'm still waiting to see what will come from this,” though he's working on yet another personal project aimed for the stage. “I don't want to get too much into what it's about, but it's going to be another mother-and-son dynamic show, but it's going to be much more fictional and much more over-the-top and ridiculous,” he said. One thing he's not doing any time soon, and one thing he has in common with his co-star Sevigny? L.A. is really cool when you have something to do. I subletted there a few times, and you don't have anything going on and your friends are busy, it can get dark. And you're getting gaslit by the weather to be happy,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is on the cusp of completing the first 100 days of his second presidency, and things are feeling a little more lawless than the first time around. On Friday, Time magazine published an interview with Trump discussing his first 100 days, and the president wasn't convinced that the United States was a country run by laws, not by men. Time senior political correspondent Eric Cortellessa and editor-in-hief Sam Jacobs asked the president — who has redecorated the Oval Office to align with the gaudy gold-plated trappings of his golf clubs and penthouses — about a portrait he added of John Adams. Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law,” he responded. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me.” Earlier in the interview, Trump teased to Time that while he didn't know anything about the possibility of serving a third term, people were begging him to and he knew of options to make it happen. I don't believe in using loopholes,” Trump claimed, adding that he's being “inundated with requests” to serve a third term. But if Trump wants to claim that he doesn't believe in the exploitation of loopholes, the evidence is stacked against him. The president and his advisers have gone to great pains to reinterpret centuries-old wartime powers like the Alien Enemies Act to conduct mass deportations without due process for migrants, dumped hundreds of men in brutal prisons in El Salvador without trial or conviction, and defied the federal courts at every turn. He told Time that he wasn't in charge of complying with the court's orders or making the decision to secure Abrego Garcia's return. “I leave that to my lawyers,” he said. When pressed, the president added that he hadn't requested that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele return Abrego Garcia because Bukele had “said he wouldn't,” and repeated spurious accusations that Abrego Garcia was a violent gang member belonging to MS-13.

When I have a person, these would be extreme cases,” he said. “If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law.” While John Adams may have said that the United States is a land of laws, it may only take the work and will of one man to dismantle them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ike all good children of immigrants, Charlene Kaye greets me with a gift. The shirt is emblazoned with neon-pink lightning, the title of her comedy show, Tiger Daughter, in a Def Leppard font, and a collage of images — including a photo of her mother, Lily, well, naked as the day she was born. “These are nude portraits that my mother made of herself. And this is us both showing our ass, because it runs in the family.” Tiger Daughter: Or, How I Brought My Immigrant Mother Ultimate Shame slots neatly into the trend of storytelling that fuses comedy and personal testimony. Kaye's version, if the full title isn't clear enough, has a familiar outline: First-gen immigrants become parents in the West, hoping their sacrifices will be rewarded with a doctor or lawyer child; child goes another way; conflict ensues. Ultimately, she tries to answer the question of whether you can truly love someone without ever fully understanding them. It's a PowerPoint presentation that plops the crowd directly into Kaye's inner turmoil and asks if they relate. “Everyone has disappointed their parents in some way,” Kaye tells me, one hand lazily stirring her coffee at a cafe in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood. The vast majority of people who've heard of Kaye know her not from Tiger Daughter but from the wildly popular music parodies she puts out online. Think “Every Chappell Roan Song” and “Every Charli XCX Song” — affectionate riffs that poke fun at an artist's musical and lyrical tendencies while celebrating their work all the same. (The Taylor Swift one has more than a million views.) But the reason she's so adept at breaking down what other musicians do is that she is one herself — a really, really good one. Kaye's Mad Libs CV goes something like this: While attending the University of Michigan, the classically trained piano and guitar player toured with Team StarKid, the musical theater troupe that shot to internet stardom in 2009 with its viral Harry Potter musical parody, A Very Potter Musical. “I wanted to be a Mitski or Phoebe Bridgers,” Kaye says. All along, Kaye's internet presence grew, especially as she showed off more of her comic instincts. In 2022, she posted the first video in her now-legendary Guitar Center series, where she grabs merchandise off the wall and, in her words, “terrorizes” male employees and shoppers by purposely butchering popular riffs, like the opening notes of “Smoke on the Water” or “Sweet Child O' Mine.” In some clips, a man approaches and corrects her. “Rock music is such a boys' club,” Kaye says. Is There Really a Serial Killer Stalking New England? ‘Andor' Showrunner Reveals Season 2 Secrets and Why Writing Darth Vader Is ‘Limiting' “Because I understand the tropes of different artists, so I'm able to map it out academically in this way that's very satisfying to me. One of those fans is the trailblazing comedian Margaret Cho, who found Kaye through TikTok and has since become “obsessed.” Last fall, Cho launched a yearlong residency as a curator at the iconic New York venue Joe's Pub with Kaye's show. She shreds!” Cho tells Rolling Stone in an email. “The same thing happened to my sister, and I internalized that as there are no roles for me.” As Kaye discusses in Tiger Daughter, her mother — who clearly has a dramatic flair, and her own signature rock & roll style — entered the biggest reality-show singing competition in Singapore three times; twice she placed second. When her mom signed up Kaye for all kinds of musical lessons, it activated that performer's DNA. Playing guitar from a young age “taught me how to connect and to be bodily aware of myself on a stage,” Kaye says. The StarKid years took that stage presence to a whole other level. One girl showed up and she had the signatures of all seven StarKids on the tour tattooed on her calves, wrapped in plastic and bleeding. We had one girl who faked a seizure at the VIP meet and greet so that one of the guys would catch her. “I didn't have experience doing stand-up,” Kaye says. “It was just this very specific story I had. It also includes painful moments that bring the audience to a hush, such as Kaye's discovery of an interview her mother had given calling Charlene a “spoiled and entitled” disappointment who brought the memory of her late father Marty shame. This dream, abandoned in Lily's life but pursued by her daughter, is at the core of their push-pull relationship. “Perfection has always been a form of safety for me. “How can I possibly repay [my parents] for the monumental sacrifices they made? Is it selfish to pursue my own joys, even if they are kind of outrageous? Trump Attacks the Supreme Court, Says America ‘Cannot Give Everyone a Trial' Suge Knight's Wrongful-Death Retrial Officially Ran Off the Rails Today Kneecap Respond to Coachella Criticism, Address Sharon Osbourne Comments Tiger Daughter — which Kaye recently toured in Melbourne, Australia — doesn't pretend to have answers. Instead, Kaye rehashes every hurt, fight, deranged Whats­App request, and crying voicemail onstage, in the hopes that sharing it with an audience will bring her closer to some form of healing. She's started a femme Radiohead cover band called Labiahead, and has ideas for plenty more sex-pun bands. And if, even after pouring her heart out night after night for years, she's still best known for her parodies, she's OK with that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March, three high-profile women streamers were stalked while streaming at the Santa Monica Pier, igniting a conversation about the dangers and difficulties of being so visible in a world increasingly dominated by misogyny. Imane “Pokimane” Anys and Leslie “Fuslie” Fu are two wildly popular Twitch streamers (with 9.4 million and 1.2 million followers, respectively) who are both women of color and got their starts streaming Riot Games' multiplayer online battle arena, League of Legends. For them, existence is an act of resistance, and success is a sign that they have overcome the odds stacked against them — their Twitch streams never delve into drama content or rage bait, offering instead a steady flow of sweetness, like a content chocolate fountain. Speaking with Anys, it's clear that the 28-year-old has had some impressive media training — she is bright, peppy, and positive for most of our chat, effortlessly threading the needle between addressing the issues women streamers face and preaching positivity. She compliments other female streamers who have supported her journey, discusses how she finds a happy medium when expressing herself on streams, and brings up Hazelight Studios' co-op game, Split Fiction (which both she and Fu have played on their streams to promote the game's limited-time Friend Edition). “If that was on Twitter, I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes people just be saying stuff,” she says cheerily. Couple that with the increased visibility of Twitch streaming, which can (and has) resulted in truly scary situations, like the man who accosted Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter, Brittany “Cinna” Watts, and Emily “Emiru” Schunk during an IRL livestream in March. “There are moments where I was like, ‘This is a lot, but I can feel the support of people online and in my close circle, that makes me feel like I can overcome this,'” Anys says. “As crazy as it might sound, I felt like I had no choice but to overcome those difficult moments, especially because I had certain financial goals in terms of taking care of my parents or repaying them for their sacrifices, or wanting to achieve something. It felt like, yeah, this might suck, but what other choice do I have?' There have also been moments, especially in the last two years, where I'm like, ‘this is just too much for one brain and one heart to handle. Anys has taken steps back before — in 2022, she announced a hiatus from streaming, and just a few weeks ago, she said on X (formerly Twitter) that she needed “a little break from the internet.” For her, the ability to take these moments to self-reflect away from the spotlight is a privileged position, one that's only come thanks to her success. How the Spiritual Sequel to ‘Street Fighter' Became One of Gaming's Most Influential Series This French Indie RPG Has ‘Final Fantasy'-Level Bona Fides Mexican Streamer AriGameplays Forays Into Music as Aria Bela: ‘Best of Both Worlds' When asked if she ever gets exhausted, Anys cuts in before the question is finished, saying, “Although it can be exhausting, I wanted to interject and say, it can be equally fulfilling. Nothing hits harder than someone saying you inspired me.” Though the Chinese-American Twitch streamer is more off-the-cuff than Anys and slightly goofier, with a tendency to go on tangents (something she herself warns me of), it was Anys that inspired her to begin streaming League of Legends on Twitch. Fu's highs include establishing a core group of “streamer friends” and following in the footsteps of Asian-American content creators like Ryan Higa and Michelle Phan, whom she looked up to as a young woman, long before she became a Twitch streamer. I felt safer and more inspired to put myself out there because they did first, they paved the way,” Fu says. Fu's full-circle moment came when members of her Twitch community said, “Leslie, that's how you are for me,” and she realized that she had become a role model for so many young Asian Americans. And then someone will be like, ‘Thank you for doing this. If I can create a space where they feel safe and show them somebody that looks like them, it's really special,” Fu explains. How does she reckon with being such a visible woman of color in a space still dominated by people who don't look like her? “It's been pretty brutal, especially the past year,” Fu admits. That solution protects her somewhat from the rage-bait accounts like Drama Alert, which often focus on painting popular women streamers like Anys and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter in a negative light. “Sometimes it just feels like you want to give up, but then I realize, ‘No, I have spent 10 years building a career, creating a community, online, offline — there is way too much here that's actually positive,'” Fu says. Though Anys and Fu are very different women with different personalities, interests, communities, and more, they share similar sentiments about their path to Twitch fame and how others can follow in their footsteps (yes, they do think streaming is a viable option for young women and people of color, even in the current climate). “Lean on those that are either similar to you or that you feel comfortable with, because I would not have made it as far as I have in streaming if it wasn't for my female streamer friends or my male streamer friends who were supportive and kind and understanding,” Anys suggests For her, a solid support system is crucial when facing the seemingly endless criticism of people on the internet, as is doggedly refusing to give up on a dream. “It's good to remind yourself that you can still accomplish anything you want … try to be the one who proves everyone else wrong.” Kneecap Respond to Coachella Criticism, Address Sharon Osbourne Comments Hear the Song that Sammy Hagar Wrote With Eddie Van Halen in a Dream Bill Maher Slams Larry David's Satirical Hitler Essay: Insults 'Six Million Dead Jews' “While [harassment] sucks, there is a form of empowerment that comes with finding other women in this space,” Fu says. “Sometimes I'll even queue into an all-girl lobby, and those are magical.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

The filmmaker: George Lucas, appearing for a rare pre-show Q&A to discuss the making of his “Star Wars” sequel and why he felt financial — but not creative — pressure following up what was then the most commercially successful film in history. In a conversation with Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, Lucas explained that he never felt intimidated by the prospect of failing to live up to “Star Wars,” because he had written the story for “Empire” long before the first film became an unexpected hit. “As it turned out, when I got the ‘Star Wars' script done, there were 180 pages. So I cut it into three parts and said I'll focus on the first one, because we'd never get enough money to make the whole thing.” Related Stories Julia Garner Was Shocked to Be Cast as the Silver Surfer in ‘Fantastic Four' After an ‘All Over the Place' Meeting: ‘Wait, What?' Joe Apollonio Enters the Scene with His Idiosyncratic Brand of Comedy and Amalia Ulman's ‘Magic Farm' Lucas credited Fox executive Alan Ladd Jr. with giving “Star Wars” the green light at a time when no one — including Lucas himself — knew exactly what the movie was going to be. Ladd just wanted to be in business with the guy who had directed “American Graffiti,” which Lucas said was the most profitable movie ever made at that point in relation to its cost. I want to make a movie with you.' Lucas was determined to make all three of his “Star Wars” stories no matter what, and negotiated a deal in which he kept the sequel rights so that he could produce “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi” elsewhere if the first movie wasn't successful or Fox just wasn't interested in continuing the series. '” Lucas' idea was to use merchandising to help promote the movies, with kids wearing “Star Wars” shirts that would help spread the word. Because they hadn't really run a campaign.” Indeed, amazingly enough, no one at the studio but Ladd really believed in the movie, which Lucas said wasn't unusual for “Star Wars,” which even his friends thought was a strange film for him to be making. “I certainly didn't think it was going to make any money,” Lucas said, but he added that when it did make money it put him in an unusual position maintaining ownership of the sequels. Lucas self-financed “Empire,” with Fox staying on as a distributor, and that's where the real risk came in — he wasn't worried about the movie measuring up to “Star Wars” creatively, but had it bombed financially he would have been ruined. Luckily, “The Empire Strikes Back” was a huge hit as well as an artistic success, one of the few sequels to a classic film that is commonly agreed upon to be as good as if not superior to its predecessor. The film's power was on full display at the Chinese Thursday night, with a packed crowd (one that included many of Lucas' directing peers, like his USC classmate Randal Kleiser, Joe Dante, John Landis, Ernest Dickerson, and Alexander Payne) enthralled by the spectacle, and audibly entertained by the sequel's new characters like Yoda and Lando Calrissian. Mankiewicz wrapped the discussion up by asking Lucas why Yoda “talks backwards,” and Lucas had a simple answer. “Yoda had a very distinctive way of speaking, and that was done purposely,” Lucas said. “If you're speaking regular English, people don't listen that much. Lucas concluded by talking about how difficult writing is, and what his friend and mentor Francis Coppola taught him about the importance of a good screenplay. “He said, ‘Look, the first draft's gonna be horrible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Catalyst of Change honor was presented to her by Lily Allen on Thursday night (April 24). Every night on tour, Olivia Rodrigo performs for countless women and girls – but when they all funnel out of the arenas and festival grounds at the end of each of her shows, she worries constantly for their futures. And on Thursday evening (April 24) at Planned Parenthood of Greater New York's Spring Into Action Gala in New York City, those efforts were honored by the organization with the designation of 2025's Catalyst of Change award to the 22-year-old pop star, who asked during her speech, “When I play shows, I look out at crowds filled with young girls and the bond I feel with them is profound… I often wonder, ‘What happens to those girls when they leave those venues? What kind of world are they returning to? Rodrigo was one of two guests of honor at the night's celebration at Cipriani South Street in lower Manhattan, with Amanda Zurawski — the Texas woman who sued her home state in 2023 after she nearly died due to pregnancy complications and was denied an abortion — also getting a moment of recognition as this year's Champion of Change award winner. Past winner Laverne Cox was on hand to present Zurawski with the honor, while the “Vampire” singer's friend and fellow activist Lily Allen (with whom she chanted “F–k you” to the Supreme Court at her Glastonbury set three years prior, shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned), gave Rodrigo a heartfelt introduction. “Olivia, my love, you're the realest,” the British singer-songwriter gushed after commending Rodrigo for not “[straying] from her values to make powerful people comfortable.” “You use your platform because you actually give a s–t about reproductive freedom and justice. And in this world, genuinely giving a s–t is revolutionary.” “It's a privilege to be here tonight to support an organization that, despite countless obstacles, continues to show up with compassion, hope and dignity for women,” Rodrigo told a crowd of donors and Planned Parenthood of Greater New York board members, who clung to every word. “My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources.” “[Richards] led at a time of relentless attacks on care and constant efforts to silence and shame women into submission,” the three-time Grammy winner added. “She reminds us that standing up for what's right doesn't mean we have to be fearless. The event honoring her comes after years of Rodrigo being one of the most vocal and hands-on modern pop stars when it comes to advocating for reproductive freedom. Back in May 2022 at a Sour Tour concert in Washington, D.C., just after the overturning of Roe, she made headlines for telling her crowd, “Our bodies should never be in the hands of politicians … I hope we can raise our voices to protect our right to have a safe abortion, which is a right that so many people before us have worked so hard to get.” Through the initiative, the Grammy winner also had local abortion funds set up tables at her venues, allowing young fans to learn about reproductive health and resources. In December, she announced that she'd donated more than $2 million in ticket sales from her 2024 Guts Tour — which continues this year with shows in Latin America and Europe as well as a run of global festival dates — to 10 organizations around the world championing girls' education, reproductive rights and the prevention of gender-based violence. Read Rodrigo's full speech at the 2025 Planned Parenthood Spring Into Action Gala below. Um, first of all, huge thank you to Lily. And a huge thank you to Planned Parenthood of Greater New York for this incredible honor. But perhaps the greatest privilege this career has given me is connection with women through my music. To be in a space where we can all feel safe to be wild, emotional and carefree is incredibly powerful, and even though we're not speaking one on one, those moments where we sing together and lock eyes, something real forms. It feels like we're part of each other's lives. What kind of world are they returning to? We live in a world that politicizes our bodies and uses harmful ideologies to deny us safety and healthcare, and it breaks my heart to think that, because of oppressive laws and outdated policies, some of those girls may not get to follow their dreams the way I was able to follow mine. Just a year ago, fueled by heartbreak and anger over what was happening in the world, I launched my Fund 4 Good, a global initiative that supports local nonprofits, championing reproductive freedom, girls' education and the prevention of gender-based violence. You deserve this award far more than I do, and I'm just very honored to stand with you tonight and celebrate your bravery. Providing affordable healthcare, cancer screenings, birth control, STD testing, and abortion care, amongst so many other things, gives women the autonomy to care for themselves and shape their futures. My greatest wish is that through organizations like Planned Parenthood and the action of everyday citizens, no woman will need to sacrifice her dreams, her health or humanity because of restrictive laws or lack of resources. She led at a time of relentless attacks on care and constant efforts to silence and shame women into submission, but Cecile stood her ground, and in doing so, she stood up for millions of us. She reminds us that standing up for what's right doesn't mean we have to be fearless. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Valley” star Brittany Cartwright is opening up about co-parenting her son, Cruz, 4, with her estranged husband, Jax Taylor. In an April 2025 Access Hollywood interview, Cartwright referenced that their son was diagnosed with autism in late 2024. “He loves his son,” said Cartwright, who filed for divorce from Taylor in August 2024. She said while Taylor “doesn't see as much as [she] see[s] that goes into it,” he is “learning” about autism. While speaking to Access Hollywood, Cartwright explained why she went public with her son's diagnosis. “I can use my platform for something amazing. And I can help other families that are going through this,” said Cartwright during the interview. In addition, she said she wants to spread the message that “early intervention is so important” for children with autism. “With other families that are going through it, they need to realize that early intervention is so important to give their child the best life they can have,” said Cartwright. During an April 2025 interview with People magazine, Cartwright said her son attends preschool with a therapeutic companion and goes to speech and occupational therapy. Cartwright stated that she is “trying to do everything [she] possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever.” If I have to work, I have the most amazing nanny in the entire world, she is literally my family. Sometimes Jax will take him,” said Cartwright to the publication. In a different April 2025 interview with Access Hollywood, Taylor spoke about his son. He then referenced his child's autism diagnosis. “My little boy needs me more than ever. And I feel like it's just a sign from God. Brittany and I are really coming together about this. And knowing that me and his mom will love him more than anything,” said Taylor to Access Hollywood.</p>

Young Thug is back with his first single since being released from jail in October as the Future-assisted “Money on Money” arrived on Friday (April 25). “Money on Money” is slated to appear on Thugger's upcoming UY SCUTI album, which has a rumored release date of May 9 and marks exactly three years since Thug and 27 others were indicted and taken into custody on RICO charges. Ye Disses Kendrick Lamar & Tyler, the Creator Again: 'The Two Most Overrated So-Called Artist' Young Thug made “Money on Money” official with a brief 10-second clip posted to X on Thursday (April 24) that finds the YSL logo surrounded by a circle of flames. Future and Thug have an extensive collaborative history as two of the rap titans calling Atlanta home. They previously joined forces for the Super Slimey joint album in 2017, which debuted at No. Other standout collabs from their catalogs include “Relationship,” Gunna's “Pushin P,” Drake's “Way Too Sexy” and “Sup Mate.” After serving more than two years behind bars as part of the longest-running trial in Georgia's history, Thug secured his freedom when he was released after reaching a plea deal on Halloween that saw the rapper sentenced to 15 years of probation.
