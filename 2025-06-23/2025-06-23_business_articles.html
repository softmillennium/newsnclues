                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has thanked Iran for giving the United States advance notice of the coming missile strike on America's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The notice, he wrote on social media, "made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured." U.S. stock market indexes closed higher Monday on optimism that Iran's retaliation for U.S. bombings of its nuclear facilities would be limited to the missile attack. Iran's armed forces boasted via state media earlier today that a "powerful and destructive missile strike" had hit the base, which houses around 10,000 troops. CNBC reporters are covering the Middle East conflict on air and online, reporting from Washington, D.C., London, Dubai, San Francisco and Englewood Cliffs, N.J. Trump congratulated the world and said "it's time for peace!," in an all-caps Truth Social post following Iran's missile strike. In a separate Truth Social post minutes prior, Trump thanked the "highly respected emir of Qatar for all that he has done in seeking peace for the region." Trump also celebrated that the Iranian strikes resulted in no American or Qatari casualties. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says that his country "will not submit to anyone's harassment" after Iran launched retaliatory missiles at U.S. bases in the Middle East. "We didn't harm anyone," Khamenei said on X, according to a Google translation. And we will not submit to anyone's harassment," he wrote. There are approximately 45,000 American service members stationed in the Middle East, according to a recent Reuters analysis. This number is in constant flux, however, and it reflects estimates of personnel at several bases where troop numbers are not publicly acknowledged, due to national security concerns. Iraq hosts the Al Asad air base, where another 2,500 Americans are posted. In Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, around 9,000 seamen are stationed at any given time. Saudi Arabia hosts both American soldiers and large-scale U.S. missile batteries at Prince Sultan Air Base, south of the capital Riyadh. Trump said Iran gave the U.S. "early notice" of its missile attack on an American military base in Qatar, "which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured." Trump thanked Iran for that heads up, but nevertheless called the retaliatory strike a "very weak response" that was "very effectively countered" by the U.S. "Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their "system," and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE," Trump wrote on Truth Social. Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered. I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their "system," and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. "While Dubai Airports works with airlines to ensure flights operate according to approved schedules, some flights may experience delays or cancellations," the statement from the Dubai Media Office said. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said that "this is the retaliation that was expected," after Iran said it launched missile strikes on U.S. military bases in Qatar and Iraq. He also said that it is not an "appropriate time" for a war powers resolution, and he doesn't think it's "necessary." Johnson said that he received a classified briefing Monday morning on the conflict with Iran. "I know that the national security team is in the Situation Room, even as we speak, and they're monitoring this," he said. A frame grab taken from AFP's live TV coverage shows the remnants of an Iranian missile intercepted by Qatar lying on pavement following the Monday retaliation. U.S. crude oil futures sold off steeply, on hopes the Middle East conflict will de-escalate after Iran's retaliatory strike on a U.S. base left no reported casualties. U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell $5.33, or 7.22%, to close at $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed $5.53, or 7.18%, to settle at $71.48 per barrel. The oil market appears to have avoided its worst-case scenario, for now, in which Iran attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz. Some 20 million barrels per day of crude, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. crude has given up most of its gains since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. Brent is up more than 2% since the conflict began. The UAE also fully supports any measures by Qatar "aimed at safeguarding the security and safety of its citizens and residents." "The Kingdom affirms its full solidarity with and unwavering support for the State of Qatar and places all its capabilities at Qatar's disposal in support of any measures it may take," the statement continues. Abdullah Almulla, who was in Doha during the attack, described hearing "bangs in the sky," while he was on his way home from work, during an interview on CNBC's 'The Exchange.' "It is scary, it's not something I ever heard in my life or ever experienced, so ... it's a bit worrisome, I'm worried for my friends and family and I just want them to be safe," said Almulla, who is from Qatar and works with Qatar News Agency. He said that his friends and family appear to be safe from the attack. Iran's retaliatory strike was meant to be symbolic, while leaving an exit ramp open for all sides, the Times reported. "The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it," he wrote. "It never ends with the sleazebags in the Media, and that's why their Ratings are at an ALL TIME LOW — ZERO CREDIBILITY!" Kuwait Airways is suspending all departing flights from the country due to regional tensions until further notice, the airline posted on X. The suspension will remain in effect "until further notice." The flight suspensions follow Qatar closing its airspace to commercial flights just before Iran launched missiles attacking the U.S. base in Qatar. Bahrain also temporarily suspended air traffic, according to NBC News. Iran did not move nuclear material out of its Fordo facility before the U.S. strike on Saturday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday morning, citing U.S. intelligence. A New York Times report published Sunday cited two unnamed Israeli officials who said Iran appeared to have moved nuclear material and equipment from Fordo before the U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. "Our intelligence report says they didn't," the Republican senator said. "In fact, we actually believe they stored more of it in Fordo because they believe Fordo was impenetrable," Mullin said. "They thought it was a safe place to be." Read Dan Mangan's full report on Mullins' interview here. Airlines diverted more flights in the Middle East as Qatar's airspace closed and areas above other Persian Gulf nations were reportedly also off limits after Iran said it attacked a U.S. military base in Qatar. At least six commercial aircraft turned around near the United Arab Emirates' airspace, according to flight-tracking platform Flightradar24, which also reported that the UAE airspace was closed. Several major international airlines have also scaled back service to major hubs like Doha, Qatar, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, or have offered travelers vouchers to travel at a later date because of the conflict. No deaths or injuries have been reported in the missile attack on Al-Udeid military base, CNBC's Megan Cassella reports, citing a statement from Qatar's ministry of defense. "We confirm that no injuries or human casualties resulted from the attack," he continued. "We affirm that Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this brazen aggression, in line with international law," he said. The alternative, and a much more costly scenario for traders, would have been if Iran had targeted oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, for example, or Gulf state oil production sites. Oil prices also fell this afternoon after briefly jumping, moved lower by the same working assumptions about Iran's retaliation. Trump is meeting with his national security team this afternoon. A White House official told NBC News the national security team was already meeting in the Situation Room when Iranian missiles were fired at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Qatar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday lashed out at former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for claiming that multiple countries are "ready to directly supply" Iran with nuclear warheads as a result of the U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. "Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination?" Trump chided Medvedev that the "N word" — which he specified stood for "Nuclear" — "should not be treated so casually." But his response included a similar bout of nuclear saber-rattling, suggesting that the president feels emboldened after ordering the bomb attacks against Iran late Saturday Eastern time. Trump added, "I guess that's why Putin's 'THE BOSS.'" The post came in response to Medvedev, who preceded Vladimir Putin as president, criticizing the U.S. strikes on social media while downplaying their impact on Iran, a Russian ally. While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted that the attacks had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear ambitions, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday morning London time that it detected "no increase in off-site radiation levels has been reported as of this time." Vice President JD Vance in a Sunday interview declined to say that the U.S. is certain that Iran's nuclear sites were destroyed, though he said he believes "we have really pushed their program back by a very long time." But Medvedev wrote early Sunday morning ET on X that Iranian nuclear infrastructure appears to have sustained only minor damage, and asserted that the "future production of nuclear weapons" will continue. He added that, "A number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads" following the U.S. strikes. Medvedev also mocked Trump for having "pushed the US into another war" that most countries oppose. "At this rate, Trump can forget about the Nobel Peace Prize — not even with how rigged it has become. What a way to kick things off, Mr. President. Russia's current president, Putin, on Monday condemned the U.S. military action as "absolutely unprovoked aggression" and claimed that Moscow is making efforts to aid the Iranian people. Medvedev responded to Trump's critique in a new post, writing, "Russia has no intention of supplying nuclear weapons to Iran." "But other countries might — that's what was said," he added.

Tesla:

A Tesla Inc. robotaxi on Oltorf Street in Austin, Texas, June 22.

Tesla Inc.'s self-driving taxis appeared to violate traffic laws during the company's first day offering paid rides, with one customer capturing footage of a left turn gone wrong and others traveling in cars that exceeded posted speed limits.

In a video taken by Rob Maurer, an investor who used to host a Tesla podcast, the Model Y he's riding in enters an Austin intersection in a left-turn-only lane. The Tesla hesitates to make the turn, swerves right and proceeds into an unoccupied lane meant for traffic moving in the opposite direction.</p>

Israel-Iran War:

The al-Udeid Air Base, which is also the regional headquarters for US Central Command, in Doha in 2021.

Qatar suspended air traffic on Monday after the US and UK governments told citizens based in the Gulf state to shelter in place, amid fears that Iran will target US military assets in retaliation for strikes on its nuclear facilities.

Qatar's foreign affairs ministry described the move as a precautionary measure to protect residents, citizens and visitors. It wasn't immediately clear if there was a specific threat from Iran. Qatar hosts thousands of American servicemembers at the Al Udeid Air base.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets. Europe's Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed 0.25% lower on Monday, though sector performances diverged. Despite the huge spike in Middle East tensions over the weekend, with knock-on effects impacting shipping routes and oil prices, moves in financial markets have been relatively muted on Monday. That's because corporations are much better prepared for high-risk events than they once were, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC's Annette Weisbach at Germany's Day of Industry 2025 event in Berlin this afternoon. "It's obviously another crisis situation, but you see actually that overall, the capital markets remain calm," Sewing said. But each and every participant in the industry is better prepared for those situations than any time before, and therefore we see overall, a calm reaction." A lot still rests on whether there is further escalation, he noted, but for years boards have been improving their risk management and now pay closer attention during periods of uncertainty. Shares of London-listed Spectris are topping the Stoxx 600 this afternoon, up nearly 16%, after the maker of industrial equipment announced it had agreed to be acquired for £3.8 billion ($5.13 billion) by U.S. private equity firm Advent International. "Since 2019, we have repositioned Spectris as a focused, high quality, compound growth business with advantaged positions in attractive end markets," Spectris CEO Andrew Heath said in a statement. In light of a strong set of intentions set out today, the Board have confidence that Advent is committed to supporting Spectris with investment that will drive growth and accelerate delivery of our strategic objectives." Some investors appear to believe there will be a limit to further escalation in conflict between the U.S. and Iran from here, while steadier oil price movements are also calming market jitters. Novo Nordisk has reportedly ended its partnership to provide its weight-loss drug Wegovy through telehealth provider Hims & Hers, knocking down the share price of the Californian firm. Reuters news first reported, citing a statement from Novo, that the deal signed two months ago in April was being terminated. Hims & Hers' shares have sunk more than 16% in premarket trading. In April, the two companies said they had agreed to a "long-term" partnership to bring "more accessible, more affordable" weight-loss drugs to Americans at a reduced price of $599 per month. That deal came after the Danish company came under criticism from some U.S. lawmakers for the high cost of its drugs. The sell-off in European defense stocks has gathered pace late morning. German defense contractors RENK Group, Hensoldt, Rheinmetall, Sweden's Saab, Italy's Leonardo and  France's Thales are among the biggest decliners in the Stoxx Europe 600 index. It contrasts with the shares in U.S. defense companies gaining ground premarket. RTX Corp and Northrop Grumman shares are up 0.9%. The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, the bombs dropped on Iran, were developed by Boeing and were carried on B-2 bomber aircraft developed by Northrop. In major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country's parliament on Sunday reportedly approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, risking alienating its neighbors and trade partners. Regional defense stocks were lower on Monday as investors assessed the fallout of the U.S. joining Israel's strikes on Iran. German defense giant Rheinmetall was 1.7% lower during early trade, paring earlier losses, while Sweden's Saab shed 1.3% and France's Thales was down by around 0.8%. Bucking the trend was Polish defense equipment manufacturer Lubawa, which jumped 3.5% during early trade. The U.S. dollar index — which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals — was 0.3% higher by 8:25 a.m. in London. So far this year, the dollar index has shed around 8.8%. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen — also typically seen as a safe haven during times of geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty — lost ground. "Eyes are on how Iran would retaliate — a potential withdrawal from its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," analysts at Maybank said in a Monday morning note. "Risk sensitive (AUD, NZD, CAD) and net oil importers (KRW, JPY, TWD, PHP, INR) could continue to remain under pressure." "We think USD/JPY works as a hedge against an escalation in geopolitical tension in the Middle East with positive carry," analysts at Bank of America said in a Friday note. Japan imports almost all of petroleum it needs and more than 90% of its petroleum imports come from the Middle East, the highest dependency among G10 economies. USD/JPY can reprice higher if the oil price remains elevated." Milan-listed shares of Stellantis fell nearly 6% shortly after the opening bell, before swiftly paring some of its losses after a brief trading suspension. That comes shortly after new CEO Antonio Filosa announced the firm's new management team on his first day in the job. "It is my great privilege to take the lead of Stellantis, a global company with deep regional roots," Filosa said in a statement. Alongside taking the reins, the company said, Filosa will retain his role as head of North America and American brands. Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann will take on responsibility for mergers and acquisitions and joint ventures, while Jean-Philippe Imparato continues in his role as head of enlarged Europe and European brands, which will now also include the struggling luxury Maserati unit. We're 10 minutes into Monday's trading session, and European shares are trading lower as the Middle East conflict — and America's involvement in it — remains in focus. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen 0.4% lower, with every sector barring oil and gas in negative territory. All major bourses are in the red, with France's CAC 40, down 0.7%, leading losses. The U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran might seem like a geopolitical flashpoint that would send markets tumbling. Instead, investors are largely shrugging off the escalation, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained — and even bullish for some risk assets. Futures data from IG suggests a choppy start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 0.3% lower at 8,747, Germany's DAX down 0.4% 23,222, France's CAC 40 0.5% lower at 7,536 and Italy's FTSE MIB 0.6% lower. Global market sentiment could plummet further this week after the United States entered Israel's war against Iran over the weekend, launching strikes against three nuclear sites in Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz. The move by U.S. President Donald Trump surprised investors because he had said last Friday that he would make a decision to attack Iran "within the next two weeks," according to the White House. The latest attacks caused oil prices to rise further and have stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Asia-Pacific markets declined overnight, while U.S. stock futures fell ahead of Monday's session. In Europe, flash purchasing managers' index data, showing business activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, is due Monday morning. There are no other major earnings or data releases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla's Model Y robotaxi finally hit the road this weekend, sending shares of the electric vehicle maker up 10% on Monday. The EV giant debuted autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, opening the service to a limited number of riders by invitation only. CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social network X that customers were charged a flat fee of $4.20 per ride. "Super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!! Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla," he said in a post. One passenger in Tesla's early access program for the Model Y robotaxis wrote on X that they did 11 rides with the service with "zero issues." Musk reposted numerous firsthand encounters with the services. Other road users and researchers observed the robotaxis appearing to violate traffic rules in Austin. Tesla-critical author Ed Niedermeyer shared a video from Austin showing a Tesla robotaxi braking hard in the middle of traffic in response to "stationary police vehicles outside its driving path." Musk has long promised a Tesla robotaxi fleet to investors, amping up the pressure to deliver in recent months. Once considered a pioneer, Tesla is now trying to catch up to Alphabet's Waymo in the West, and Chinese competitors including Baidu's Apollo Go, WeRide and Pony.ai. Waymo has reported that it is now delivering more than 250,000 commercial driverless rides per week and surpassed 10 million trips last month. Apollo Go reported that it has surpassed 11 million trips. Musk told CNBC's David Faber last month that Tesla aims to have "hundreds of thousands, if not over a million" self-driving cars in the U.S. by the end of next year. In May, Musk first announced plans to launch the service in Austin, with later debuts set for Los Angeles and San Francisco. The company has not yet released the systems being tested on Texas streets, known as FSD Unsupervised, to general Tesla owners. Tesla sells its new EVs with partially automated driving systems marketed as the standard Autopilot, and premium FSD Supervised systems. These include features such as automatic lane-keeping and navigation, and have been linked to accidents, including fatalities, according to data tracked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Weight-Loss Drugs:

Novo Nordisk A/S scrapped a partnership with Hims & Hers Health Inc. after less than two months, saying the US company is using “deceptive marketing” to sell copycat versions of its obesity blockbuster Wegovy. 

Hims, a telehealth platform, wasn't stepping back enough from its practice of mass marketing off-brand imitations of the weight-loss medicine, Novo executives said. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global investors are on alert about a 90-mile sea passage in the Middle East, fearing that any block of the Strait of Hormuz could derail global shipping and oil. Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply after the US struck Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday, prompting fears of retaliation from Tehran. Beyond concerns about defense and security, markets are concerned about the fallout for oil prices and the global economy should Iran block shipping in the Strait of Hormuz — a threat Tehran has repeated for years. "If Iran chooses to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, it'd be categorically negative," Kyle Rodda, a senior financial markets analyst at Capital.com, told Business Insider. One of the most geopolitically sensitive maritime routes, the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles across at its narrowest point. About a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquified natural gas trade moves through the Hormuz, so any disruption to shipping would hit the energy markets hard. Analysts said they think an Iranian blockade is probably more about political posturing than real action. "While the headlines sound dramatic, the reality is that Iran's parliament holds no executive power over military or strategic decisions, particularly not ones with such far-reaching geopolitical and economic consequences," Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, told BI. "Iran is well aware that any direct disruption to global oil flows through the Strait would likely trigger a significant military and economic response, possibly escalating the conflict beyond its control," she added. The US is an energy giant and has become a net energy exporter since 2019, so it's less prone to physical supply shock from a blockade of the Hormuz. "Any negative impact would be through deteriorating financial conditions or through higher for longer rates as the Fed has another reason to delay cuts," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a Monday note. Asian countries would be the most affected by a blockade of the Hormuz, said Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova. In 2024, over 80% of crude oil, condensates, and LNG that moved through the Hormuz headed to Asia, according to the EIA. "Asia, which consumes the lion's share of Middle Eastern oil, would be most vulnerable, with India, Japan, South Korea, and China facing logistical uncertainties and costlier re-routing," said Sachdeva. South European countries dependent on Gulf oil could also face higher import costs, although Saudi Arabia and the UAE can reroute significant volumes of such exports via pipelines and via a pipeline and the UAE port of Fujairah. Energy is a key input cost, so any gains in oil prices are likely to drive up inflation broadly. Oil prices are now up about 10% since Israel's strikes on Iran in June. These developments are taking place amid the summer driving season, when US gas demand peaks. According to the EIA, the price of gas typically rises by 2.4 cents per gallon when crude oil prices rise by $1. This translates into a gain of about 20 cents per gallon at current levels for oil futures.</p>
