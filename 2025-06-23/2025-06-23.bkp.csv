            Zohran Mamdani could barely walk a few feet at a recent Juneteenth festival in Queens without a crowd of selfie-demanding admirers trying to stop him.
    


            Mamdani is a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist who's surged in the campaign for New York City mayor with a mix of viral videos and proposals appealing to younger progressives. He's capitalized on progressive frustration with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor mounting a political comeback with a mayoral run; in one of his videos, he explains New York City's ranked-choice voting system in Hindi and Urdu and likens Cuomo to a Bollywood villain.
    


            Now running as Cuomo's top rival in Tuesday's primary, Mamdani's rise has also caused growing consternation from the Democratic establishment. His critics argue his platform is too far to the left for moderates and certain to be weaponized by local and national Republicans trying to paint the Democratic Party as out of touch. He's also faced criticism about how he's addressed the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            That concern was hard to find at Thursday's festival in Queens. Mamdani stood onstage awkwardly but joyfully two-stepping and swaying side to side next to other candidates in the primary. Then he walked through the park on a sweltering day, joking that he was fine in his wool suit because he had on an undershirt.
    


            “We've seen a campaign that is powered by the hunger of New Yorkers for a new generation of leadership,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Here's what to know about Mamdani and his campaign.
    


            Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who represents parts of Queens, one the most diverse areas in the nation.
    


            He is an immigrant from Uganda who was first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, and later in New York City, attending the prestigious Bronx High School of Science before enrolling at Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”
    


            Prior to his mayoral campaign, Mamdani made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt. He also moonlighted as a rapper under the stage name Mr. Cardamom rapping about chapati, an Indian flatbread, and worked as foreclosure prevention counselor.
    


            If elected mayor, he would become one of the youngest people to ever hold the post. Mamdani would also become the first Muslim mayor in the history of the city — home to more than half a million Muslims and one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel.
    


            Mamdani wants to freeze the rent for nearly 1 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments and provide free city bus service, universal childcare and city-subsidized grocery stores.
    


            Mamdani has said he will pay for it all by raising taxes on the city's wealthiest, even though he would have little power to do so from City Hall. Taxes can be raised or lowered only by state lawmakers with approval from the governor. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has already thrown cold water on the proposal, saying the move is likely to drive more New Yorkers out of the concrete jungle and toward Florida and other lower-tax destinations.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has raised $7 million from thousands of individual donors and mobilized an army of volunteers. He secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the United Auto Workers union.
    


            “This race is not just symbolic about the future of New York City, this race is symbolic about the future of our country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during a campaign rally packed with more than 2,000 supporters last week. “For so long we have had political leadership, including in the Democratic Party, that has just wanted to play it safe.”
    


            Democratic establishment concern was laid out in a recent call held by Third Way, a national think tank that favors a centrist political agenda. The group released a memo last week, warning that a Mamdani's win would be “a devastating blow in the fight to defeat Trumpism.”
    


            “We're really worried about all Democrats going forward if Mamdani were to win,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs, told reporters during the call. “Even if he doesn't win the election, if he just wins the Democratic nomination, that can hurt Democrats.”
    


            Cuomo has made his long career in government and experience with President Donald Trump the cornerstones of his comeback run. He dismisses Mamdani as an inexperienced leader with unrealistic ideas and suggests Trump would run through Mamdani like “a hot knife through butter.”
    


            “He's never done any of the essentials. And now you have Donald Trump on top of all of that,” Cuomo said during a recent debate.
    


            Mamdani has responded by zeroing in on Cuomo's sexual harassment scandals, his reputation as a bully and his billionaire donors. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the misconduct allegations.
    


            “I've never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said during one debate. “I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done these things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.”
    


            Cuomo and other rivals of Mamdani have called out how he's spoken about antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            Mamdani has accused the Israeli government of carrying out a “genocide.” And he defended the use of the slogan “globalize the intifada” as a rallying cry for Palestinian human rights during an interview with The Bulwark.
    


            Mamdani said he believed the phrase was about “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,” explaining that the US Holocaust Museum used a similar Arabic word meaning “uprising” to describe the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis.
    


            “I have shared my opinions with New Yorkers over the course of this race, opinions that always come back to a belief in universal human rights, that means taking on antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has proposed making an increase of 800% for the city's anti-hate crime program.
    


            Still, the criticism to those comments came fast and furious. Mamdani was condemned by the Holocaust Museum and some fellow Democrats for using a phrase they believe encourages violence against Jews.
    


            City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is running third behind Mamdani and has cross-endorsed him under the primary's ranked-choice system, said he preferred Mamdani avoid the term altogether.
    


            Mamdani's reaction was equally visceral. He became emotional and cried while speaking with reporters about the backlash, detailing the multiple threats and the near-constant harassing calls his office now receives on a daily basis.
    


            “It pains me to be painted as if I am somehow to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love that are such a key part of this city,” Mamdani said. “When I speak, when I speak with emotion I am characterized by rivals as being a monster. I get messages that say, ‘The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim.' I get threats on my life, on the people that I love.”
    


            He has also accused a pro-Cuomo PAC of designing a campaign mailer that featured his photo appearing to be altered to make his beard look darker and thicker next to text saying Mamdani “rejects Jewish rights.” The Cuomo campaign said it never sent out the mailer and it was made up by an independent vendor.
    


            Mamdani called the strikes ordered by Trump “a new, dark chapter in his endless series of betrayals.”
    


            “While Donald Trump bears immediate responsibility for this illegal escalation, these actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within,” he said in a statement.

Follow:


            The Supreme Court agreed Monday to take up the case of a Rastafarian man seeking to sue prison officials in Louisiana who cut off his dreadlocks while he was incarcerated.
    


            The case is the latest that involves religious rights to catch the high court's attention, and it could have significant implications by allowing prisoners to sue government officials for damages when their religious rights are burdened under a federal law enacted 25 years ago.
    


            Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had taken a religious vow years earlier to not cut his locks.
    


            But his situation took a turn for the worse after arriving at a new prison weeks before his release. He handed officials a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks. The guards tossed it in the trash. They then handcuffed him to a chair and forcibly shaved his head.
    


            Following Landor's release, he sued Louisiana prison officials and guards for damages under a decades-old law that protects the religious interests of inmates. But lower courts dismissed his case, ruling that the law doesn't allow individuals to pursue damages against prison officials for alleged violations of it even though, in one court's view, he had been the victim of a “grave legal wrong.”

            The conservative New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision last year that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit divided on whether to hear the case.
    


            President Bill Clinton signed the bipartisan law in 2000 that protects the religion interests of state prisoners but it's not clear whether that law allows people who were harmed to sue for money damages. The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that a similar law with nearly identical language allows people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.
    


            “Without a damages remedy,” lawyers for Landor told the justices in court papers, inmates “will often be left without meaningful protection for their religious exercise.”
    


            In other words, once Landor's head was shaved, the only way for him to have some legal remedy is through monetary damages.
    


            “The no-damages rule ensured that respondent officials would not be held accountable for violating the religious rights of a prisoner set for release in just three weeks and prevented him from obtaining any relief for the abuse he suffered,” his lawyers said.
    


            Attorneys for the Louisiana state officials urged the court to not take up the case, arguing among other things that Landor could bring his claims under state law. They also told the justices that permitting the lawsuit to move forward could hamper the state's ability to hire staff in its prisons.
    


            Siding with Landor, they told the court, “would almost certainly deepen the problem by driving down staffing levels and dissuading job applicants.”
    


            “That, in turn, inevitably would lead to worse prison conditions and perhaps lessened protections for religious liberty, as understaffed prisons attempt to survive the growing prison populations,” they added. “No one wins in that situation.”
    


            The Trump administration, meanwhile, had asked the justices to take up the matter. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court in May that the federal government has an interest “in ensuring that prisons or other institutions receiving federal funds do not substantially burden religious exercise, and damages liability is closely connected to that interest.”

Live Updates


            • Today's witness: The federal criminal trial of music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs in on a lunch break. Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, has been on the stand to speak about evidence charts compiled by the prosecution.
    


            • Trial timeline: Prosecutors expect Cerciello's testimony to continue into tomorrow morning. The defense is expected to rest by the end of the day Tuesday after submitting some exhibits into evidence.
    


            • Federal charges: Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.
    


            • Editor's Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with intimate partner violence, there are resources available, including the National Domestic Violence Hotline.



            Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey finished the direct examination of Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Joseph Cerciello. Cross-examination is scheduled to begin after the lunch break, around 1:45 p.m.
    


            Before the break, Cerciello reviewed text messages related to the June 18, 2024, violent altercation between Jane and Sean “Diddy” Combs at her home that had previously been read into the record.
    


            The jury saw records from the days around October 18, 2023. “Jane” previously testified she and Sean “Diddy” Combs had a “sobriety party” in Beverly Hills, California, around that time.
    


            Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, confirmed this is the summary chart's last entry before Cassie Ventura's November 2023 civil lawsuit against Combs.
    


            Cerciello walked through some messages between Jane and Combs from the days before the sobriety party, which the jury has previously seen. In the messages, Jane said in part, that she didn't want to be mistreated, and that “I don't feel like performing loveless, cold sex.”
    


            The jury saw messages indicating Jane went to Combs' Los Angeles home the next day. In a later conversation, Kristina Khorram, who was Combs' chief of staff, messaged Combs assistant Brendan Paul and other assistants about prepping a hotel room, according to messages seen by the jury.
    


            The jury also saw messages between Combs and an escort from Cowboys for Angels, coordinating a time to go to the hotel. Hours later, Combs sent an “entertainer,” Paul, the hotel information. Records showed $3,000 was deposited into an account of the “entertainer” shortly after.
    


            In the days following the hotel reservation, Jane messaged Combs, asking if he could put something in her account, saying she felt “violated and manipulated,” the records show.
    


Remember: Jane, one of Combs' accusers who testified under a pseudonym, testified the following about the October 2023 “sobriety party”: She said she wanted Combs to get sober around this time, and he agreed to stop taking substances for 30 days but wanted to have “one last sobriety party” first. This party was a “hotel night” that lasted 12 to 18 hours, she testified. She didn't take any drugs, but Combs took ecstasy and cocaine, she testified.
    


            Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, reviewed records from January 2023, when the government asserts Sean “Diddy” Combs and Jane hosted three “entertainers” during a “hotel night” in Los Angeles.
    


            Combs sent Jane an audio message, according to the records: “Hey let me know right now if I should book debauchery for 9 o'clock Yes or no answer.”
    


            Jane, one of Combs' accusers who testified under a pseudonym in this trial and dated Combs from 2021 to 2024, texted him back, according to the records: “yea its a thumbs up.” She then asked him for money to buy new clothes, the records show. Later, Combs sent another audio message, “sent you $15,000 baby girl,” according to the records.
    


            The jury saw flight records for all three “entertainers.”
    


            Combs scheduled one of the “entertainers” through Cowboys for Angels, according to the records. Jane paid Cowboys for Angels $1,100 on Cash App and texted Combs, “send this as proof of payment,” the records show.
    


Remember: Jane testified extensively about going with Combs to what she called “hotel nights,” which she described as sexual encounters with a male “entertainer,” often in a hotel room, with Combs present. People who worked for Combs sometimes called such encounters “king nights” or “wild king nights,” according to testimony. Cassie Ventura, who dated Combs from around 2007 to 2018, also testified about similar encounters, which she said Combs called “Freak Offs.”
    


            The jury saw messages around November 14, 2021, when Kristina Khorram, Sean “Diddy” Combs's former chief of staff, booked a hotel in Los Angeles for Combs and Jane. Khorram texted him when an assistant was there, setting up the room. Later in the day, Khorram texted Combs, “Hotel called Paul coming up.”
    


            Paul is someone whom Combs and Jane would pay to have sex with Jane on multiple occasions during “hotel nights,” but he also worked with Combs as a trainer.
    


            Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, reviewed documents around November 8-10, 2021. Sean “Diddy” Combs texted “Jane,” asking if she wanted to see him and an “entertainer” called Paul, according to the documents. Combs later messaged Paul, telling him to let him know when he was close.
    


            In that time frame, Jane (one of Combs' accusers who  testified under a pseudonym in this trial and dated Combs from 2021 to 2024) also was texting an “entertainer” called Sly about travelling to Los Angeles from Atlanta. Combs was messaging his travel manager about booking a flight and hotel for Sly, and Jane was then relaying the travel information to Sly, according to the documents.
    


            The jury saw several messages between Combs and his then-chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, in that time frame, including messages in which he requested $5,000 cash and she notified him that some baby oil had been dropped off, according to the records.
    


            Several explicit videos were taken during those days, Cerciello said.
    


            Around that time, Jane sent Sly a Cash App payment, and a large amount of cash was deposited into one of Paul's accounts, according to the records.
    


            The jury saw more text messages between Sean “Diddy” Combs and his former chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, days later in September 2023. Combs told Khorram to keep someone named “Chelsea” at a Miami hotel and get a hotel suite at a different hotel for him and “Jane,” one of his accusers.
    


            He told Khorram that Chelsea would move from the hotel to his Miami residence after Jane left. The chart also included a flight record booked by Combs' travel manager for Jane from Miami to Los Angeles.
    


            Joseph Cerciello is still reviewing messages related to the September 17-19, 2023, trip to New York City.
    


            The jury saw messages Sean “Diddy” Combs sent to an entertainer from the Cowboys for Angels escort service telling him when to arrive at the hotel room.
    


            Hours later, an employee from Cowboys for Angels texted Combs saying he still needed to pay $600.
    


                    “Lol he couldn't even perform,” Combs texted back. The employee explained that Combs was paying for the man's time. Combs told the employee that she should be nice to him, adding that he was “a longtime customer.”
                





            The jury saw other texts between “Jane,” one of the Combs' accusers, and an entertainer called Sly coordinating his arrival at the hotel. They also saw messages involving Brendan Paul, a former assistant for Combs, coordinating an IV drip for three people.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is back on the bench and Joseph Cerciello, the special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, is back on the stand. The jury is entering now.
    


            Throughout the time that the videos were played it was silent in the courtroom.
    


            Many of the jurors were paying attention but there were moments when two jurors closed their eyes.
    


            At this point in the trial the jurors have watched at least 40 minutes of sexually explicit video.
    


            The jury is on a break until 11:15 a.m.
    


            Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said she has more than an hour of questioning left on direct examination and that it could take up to two hours to complete.
    


            Joseph Cerciello reviewed entries in another summary chart from September 2023 when “Jane” met Sean “Diddy” Combs in New York City.
    


            “Jane” is one of Combs' accusers who used a pseudonym in court,
    


            Cerciello and Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey read text messages exchanged around that time, many of which were previously read into the record during witness testimony.
    


            Some of the texts were between Jane and Combs in which she first said she wouldn't go to Manhattan because she knew he wanted a hotel night. She later acquiesced and planned the trip. Others messages were between Combs' staff planning the logistics of the trip and hotel arrangements.
    


            In one thread recounted in the summary chart, Combs texted with someone from Cowboys for Angels, an escort service, to inquire about hiring an escort.
    


            Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, walked through another chart that he says maps out records surrounding a September 17-19, 2023, trip Jane took with Sean “Diddy” Combs to New York City.
    


            The chart shows flight and hotel records for Jane (who testified under a pseudonym in this trial and dated Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2021 to 2024) and an “entertainer” called Sly. Records show hotel stays at the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan. A credit card paid for by “Bad Boy Ent” paid for Jane's travel, according to records.
    


            The records show Jane paid for Sly's transportation but was sent $5,000 by Combs' account manager around that the time. The travel arrangements were booked by Combs' travel manager, the records show.
    


            The jury also saw records related to a September 24-26, 2023, stay in Miami. Records showed the hotel was booked with a credit card held by Combs' travel manager. Round trip flights for Jane and Sly were booked with the same card, records show.
    


            The jury watched at least 13 clips of sexually explicit videos recorded in November 2021, December 2021, February 2022, August 2022 and October 2022. The jury watched more than 12 minutes of the footage.
    


            Jurors listened through headphones as they watched the clips. The public and press cannot see the videos, which are under seal.
    


            The panel watched the videos after Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations testifying on the stand, referred to a summary chart compiled by the prosecution. That chart referenced sexually explicit videos showing Jane (who testified under a pseudonym in this trial and dated Sean “Diddy” Combs from 2021 to 2024) with other men, and Combs also can be seen in the videos, Cerciello said.
    


            The chart cites several other explicit videos that the jury did not view, Cerciello said. He confirmed that about 50 explicit videos were recorded December 17-21, 2021.
    


            Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Joseph Cerciello confirmed that several sexually explicit videos showing Jane with other men are cited in a summary chart.
    


            The videos are collectively several hours long, Cerciello said. Sean “Diddy” Combs can also be seen in the videos, he added.
    


            The jury is viewing clips of the videos and listening through headphones. The public and press cannot see the videos, which are under seal.
    


            Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, is back on the stand, and the jury has entered.
    


            Cerciello, who began testifying Friday, is expected to continue to speak about evidence charts compiled by the prosecution.
    


            Before the resumption of testimony this morning, the lawyers mapped out the week ahead.
    


            Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said she expects the testimony of Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Joseph Cerciello to continue into Tuesday morning. The defense is expected to rest by the end of Tuesday after submitting some exhibits into evidence.
    


            The attorneys intend to meet for a charge conference Wednesday morning, and closing arguments would be Thursday.
    


            Judge Arun Subramanian is on the bench.
    


            Testimony is expected to resume this morning from Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, who will speak about evidence charts compiled by the prosecution.
    


            Joseph Cerciello, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, will be back on the stand today in the federal criminal trial of music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs.
    


            The prosecution called Cerciello, who was not involved in the case against Combs, to begin testifying Friday.
    


            Cerciello reviewed charts of evidence compiled by the prosecutors to confirm the information in the charts corresponds with the underlying exhibits, which include thousands of pages of text messages, as well as phone and financial records.
    


            The chart's 44 entries spanned from May 2021 to August 2024.
    


Details on a 2023 hotel stay: On Friday, Cerciello testified that he reviewed documents related to a hotel stay that Combs had in Los Angeles in January 2023.
    


            Hotel records showed the room was reserved under the name “Joseph Chavez” and included a $3,750 charge for “damaged furniture.” A report from the hotel said there were “bodily fluids stained on the wood floor” across the entire room and on some of the furniture.
    


            The evidence chart referenced some of Combs' text messages with “Jane,” one of his accusers who is using a pseudonym in the trial. The messages showed the two coordinating the arrival of three men at the hotel, and Combs telling Jane to send $1,100 to Cowboys for Angels, an escort service, for flights and an “overnight rate.”
    


Where we'll pick up today: Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said she hopes the government will rest by the end of today.
    


            Comey said she will likely question Cerciello through the lunch break, and the defense will question him for the remainder of the day.
    


            Nine attorneys – five men and four women – fill two tables in the courtroom for Sean ‘Diddy' Combs.

            But they all answer to one person: Combs himself.
    


            Attorney Brian Steel was about to finish his cross examination of rapper Kid Cudi last month when he paused and walked over to Combs at the defense table. The two men conferred in a whisper before Steel said he had no further questions.
    


            As another lawyer questioned Combs' former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, whose allegations are at the center of the criminal case, Combs scribbled on Post-It notes and passed one after another to his lead attorney Marc Agnifilo.
    


            The stakes are high.
    


            Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted of the most serious charges, Combs could face as much as life in prison and a minimum sentence of 15 years.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed he has “interesting intel” on the location of Iran's enriched uranium. He made the remark following US airstrikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan.

Speaking to reporters during a briefing on Sunday, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel is aware of the location of Iran's 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium, but refused to give further details.

“We've been following that very closely. I can tell you that it's an important component of a nuclear program. It's not the sole component. It's not a sufficient component. But it is an important component and we have interesting intel on that, which you will excuse me if I don't share with you,” he said when asked about the whereabouts of the material.

He also claimed that Iran's underground Fordow nuclear site was damaged in a Sunday strike by US bombers, reportedly involving bunker-buster munitions, but noted the extent of the impact remained unclear.

According to Netanyahu, Israel “had to act” following what he described as Tehran's accelerated push toward nuclear weaponization after the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September 2024. He also accused Iran of expanding its missile program and planning to produce 300 ballistic missiles per month.

He added that Israel is now “very, very close” to achieving its objective of eliminating what he called the dual threats posed by Iran's nuclear and missile capabilities.

“We won't pursue our actions beyond what is needed to achieve them, but we also won't finish too soon. When the objectives are achieved, then the operation is complete and the fighting will stop,” he told reporters, adding: “Israel is very close to the goals that we have set in the campaign against Iran.”

Iran has repeatedly denied seeking nuclear weapons and maintains that its program is peaceful. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Iran's enriched uranium reserves were continuing to grow, though the material remains below weapons-grade levels.

Tehran began increasing its enrichment after the US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018 under President Donald Trump. Iranian officials have accused Israel of fabricating threats to justify military escalation and warned that further aggression will trigger a firm response.

Two people are being questioned by French police after DisneyLand Paris staff raised concerns about a suspected fake wedding ceremony, allegedly involving a nine-year-old Ukrainian girl.

The incident was first reported by Le Parisien, which said a man had rented the Disneyland Paris complex several weeks earlier for a private event costing €130,000 ($150,000). The booking was scheduled outside of regular park hours with the alleged ceremony taking place early Saturday morning.

Staff and security reportedly raised the alarm when they noticed that a girl dressed as a bride appeared to be underage. After police were called to the scene, the Meaux prosecutor's office said that the “marriage” was staged.

 “So it wasn't a wedding, but a staged wedding filmed with around a hundred extras. They privatized Disneyland Paris, pretending it was a real wedding,” the magistrate told AFP.

Four people were initially taken into police custody, with two remaining under questioning on Sunday on suspicion of fraud and money laundering. Among them was a 22-year-old man, believed to be British, who allegedly posed as the groom and organized the event, according to AFP. A 24-year-old woman from Latvia was also being questioned.

“The investigations, including the medical examination of the minor, a Ukrainian national, revealed that she had not been subjected to any violence or coercive acts and that the event turned out to be a set-up, with the guests themselves being extras,” the Meaux prosecutor's office said in a statement.

The child's 41-year-old mother and a 55-year-old Latvian man were reportedly released after questioning.

One of the extras hired to attend what she believed was a real wedding told France Inter radio: “I saw the panic of the Disney people, then, through the window, I saw a small child with a wedding dress on. A woman was carrying her in her arms and that's when I understood that the child was really young,” The Guardian reported, citing the broadcaster.

Disneyland Paris told the station: “A private event booked at our destination was immediately cancelled by our staff after irregularities were identified. Police were called and arrived quickly.”

The reason for staging the fake wedding and the child's exact role in the event remain unclear. The park said it is cooperating with authorities and has filed its own legal complaint.

NATO members have agreed to delay the timeline for raising defense spending to the level sought by US President Donald Trump due to Spain's opposition, Reuters reported on Monday.

Mark Rutte, secretary general of the US-led military bloc, had aimed to secure approval this week for a declaration increasing the defense spending target from the current 2% of GDP to 3.5%, with an additional 1.5% allocated to broader security initiatives, such as bridge renovations to support troop movements.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters said the draft deadline was pushed back from 2032 to 2035, and the wording was changed from “we commit” to “allies commit,” after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez publicly declined to endorse the proposal.

Spain is among the NATO members not currently meeting the 2% threshold. On Sunday afternoon, Sanchez announced that Spain would not adhere to the bloc's new objectives and instead would raise military spending to 2.1% of GDP – “nothing more, nothing less.”

“We fully respect the legitimate desire of other countries to increase their defense investment but we won't do it,” Sanchez said on national television. The remarks were reportedly made after amendments to the draft declaration had been finalized.

Trump on Friday criticized Spain as “notorious” for failing to meet NATO's existing targets and argued that the US, unlike other members, should not be required to hit the 5% mark due to its historically high defense expenditures.

Politico reported that the agenda for the NATO leaders summit in The Hague, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, had been modified to reduce the focus on Ukraine. Vladimir Zelensky was reportedly invited only to a welcome dinner, which he may skip, the outlet noted.

On Saturday, Zelensky called on Western nations to pledge 0.25% of their GDP to supporting Ukraine's arms industry.

Last week, Trump departed the G7 summit in Canada ahead of schedule, missing a session attended by the Ukrainian leader. No joint G7 statement on the conflict between Kiev and Moscow was issued.

NATO maintains that rising defense budgets are a response to threats posed by Russia – a claim Moscow has rejected as fearmongering intended to silence public criticism over future declines in living standards caused by military spending.

Advocates fear Senate's version of Trump's budget bill could leave millions without healthcare and boost corporations

Advocates are urging Senate Republicans to reject a proposal to cut billions from American healthcare to extend tax breaks that primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations.

The proposal would make historic cuts to Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income and disabled people that covers 71 million Americans, and is the Senate version of the “big beautiful bill” act, which contains most of Donald Trump's legislative agenda.

“With the text released earlier this week, somehow the Senate made the House's ‘big, bad budget bill' worse in many ways,” said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Families USA, a consumer healthcare advocacy group, in a press call.

The Senate's version makes deeper cuts to Medicaid and so-called Obamacare (Affordable Care Act) plans, “both by expanding paperwork requirements and making it harder for states to fund Medicaid coverage for their residents”, said Wright.

If passed, the House-passed bill would have already made the biggest cuts to Medicaid since the program's enactment in 1965. With red tape and an expiration of additional healthcare subsidies to Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the House version would leave 16 million people without health insurance by 2034.

CBO has not yet released estimates, or “scored”, the impact of the Senate proposal, but advocates and experts said the cuts are more draconian, “punish” states that expanded Medicaid, and attack Medicaid by going after its byzantine financing structures.

“If we look at the big picture of our healthcare system that's where the inefficiencies are – not in Medicaid – but in all the groups profiting off the system,” said David Machledt, a senior policy analyst at the National Health Law Program, referring to Republicans' assertions that they are targeting “waste, fraud and abuse” with cuts.

“What these cuts are going to do is look at the most cost-efficient program and squeeze it further, and take us backwards, and put us back at a system where the people at the low end are literally dying to fund these tax cuts for rich people and businesses.”

A recent study found that expanding Medicaid, as was done during the Obama administration, probably saved an additional 27,400 lives over a 12-year period, and did so cheaper than other insurance programs. The same study found that about a quarter of the difference in life expectancy between low- and high-income Americans is due to lack of health insurance.

Republicans, such as senator John Thune of South Dakota, argue that their bill “protects” Medicaid by “removing people who should not be on the rolls”, including working-age adults, legal and undocumented immigrants; by adding work requirements and by going after a tax maneuver states use to bring in more federal Medicaid funding.

“Removing these individuals is just basic, good governance,” said Thune.

But experts and advocates argue the cuts will not only remove the targeted individuals, including many who are working but struggle to get through red tape, but will also place states in impossible situations with potentially multibillion-dollar shortfalls in their budgets.

Both versions contain so-called work requirements, which analyses show will cause people to lose coverage even if they are eligible, experts said. Instead, the largest difference between the Senate and House versions of the bill is the Senate's attack on Medicaid's complex financing arrangements.

Medicaid is jointly financed by states and the federal government, making it simultaneously one of states' largest expenditures and sources of revenue. The Senate's version specifically attacks two ways states finance Medicaid, through provider taxes and state-directed payments.

With a provider tax, states bring in additional federal revenue by increasing payments to providers. Because the federal portion of Medicaid is based on a percentage rate, increasing payments to providers in turn increases the amount that federal officials pay the state. States then tax those same providers, such as hospitals, to bring the funding back to the state.

Although this maneuver has been criticized, it has also now been used for decades. It's in place in every state except for Alaska, is legal and openly discussed. The Senate bill caps this manuever by cutting the tax rate by about half, from 6% to 3.5%, according to Machledt.

In a 2024 analysis, the Congressional Research Service estimated that lowering the provider tax cap to 2.5% would effectively cut $241bn from Medicaid payments to states. Although the exact impacts of the Senate tax cap are not yet known, Machledt expects it would be in the billions, which states would then be under pressure to make up.

“We took great pains to close a $1.1bn shortfall caused by rising healthcare costs,” said the Colorado state treasurer, Dave Young, in a press call. “To protect healthcare and education, we had to cut transportation projects, maternal health programs and even $1m in aid to food banks.”

Because of taxing provisions in Colorado's state constitution, Young said: “It will be nearly impossible to raise taxes or borrow money to make up the difference.”

Similarly, the Senate bill goes after “state-directed payments”. To understand state-directed payments, it's helpful to understand a big picture, and often hidden, aspect of US healthcare – health insurance pays providers different rates for the same service.

Providers are almost universally paid the worst for treating patients who have Medicaid. Medicare pays roughly the cost of providing care, although many doctors and hospitals complain it is still too little. Commercial insurance pays doctors and hospitals most handsomely.

To encourage more providers to accept Medicaid, lawmakers in some states have chosen to pay providers treating Medicaid patients additional funds. In West Virginia, a federally approved plan allows the state to pay providers more for certain populations. In North Carolina, state-directed payments allow the state to pay hospitals rates equal to the average commercial insurance rate, if they agree to medical debt forgiveness provisions.

The first state-directed payment plan was approved in 2018, under the first Trump administration. These kinds of payments were criticized by the Government Accountability Office during the Biden administration.

However, the Senate bill goes after these rates by tying them to Medicaid expansion – a central tenet of Obamacare – and gives stricter limits to the 41 states that expanded the program. Doing this will effectively be “punishing them”, Machledt said, referring to states that participated in this key provision of Obamacare, “by limiting the way they can finance”.

Advocates also warned of unintended knock-on effects from such enormous disruption. Medical debt financing companies are already readying new pitches to hospitals. Even people who don't lose their insurance and are not insured through Medicaid could see prices increase.

When Medicaid is cut, hospital emergency rooms are still obliged to provide stabilizing care to patients, even if they can't pay. Hospitals must then make up that shortfall somewhere, and the only payers they can negotiate with are commercial: for example, the private health insurance most people in the US rely on.

“Folks who do not lose their health insurance will see increased costs,” said Leslie Frane, the executive vice-president of SEIU, a union that represents about 2 million members, including in healthcare. “Your copays are going to go up, your deductibles are going to go up, your bills are going to go up.”

Republicans hope to pass the bill by 4 July.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

General Dan Caine and defense secretary Pete Hegseth are in the situation room with Trump right now monitoring Iran's attack on US bases in Middle East, CNBC reports

Iran-Israel war – live updates

Joint Chiefs Chair General Dan Caine and Secretary Pete Hegseth are in the Situation Room right now monitoring potential Iranian retaliation, per a senior White House official. Trump is currently in the room with them, CNBC reports.

Trump had visited the Qatari base Iran is attacking just last month. The president addressed US and Qatari troops there in May during a trip to the region.

Speaking to US troops at the base just weeks ago, Trump said “my priority is to end conflicts, not start them.”

He added: “But I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it's necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners. And this is one of our great partners right here,” referring to Qatar. “When we're threatened, America's military will answer our enemies without even thinking about it. We have overwhelming strength and devastating force.”

An Axios reporter, citing an Israeli official, said that six missiles had been launched by Iran directed towards US airbases in Qatar.
 Follow the Israel-Iran war live blog for more updates:

A western diplomat told Reuters that there has been a credible Iranian threat against the US-run al Udeid airbase in Qatar since noon.

The airbase in Qatar is the Middle East's largest US base that houses about 10,000 troops.

At the same time, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Iran is moving missile launchers into place for a potential attack on US forces in the Middle East, citing US officials.

France's president, Emmanuel Macron, said today that there was no “framework of legality” regarding the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, adding any regime change in the country should be a result of the will of the people, not of bombs.

“There is no framework of legality in these strikes, even if France shares the objective not to see Iran acquire nuclear weapons,” he told reporters during a press conference in Oslo alongside the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre.

“I believe in the sovereignty of peoples and territorial integrity … so I don't think we can take the place of a people to change its leaders,” Macron added.

A group of 12 House Democratic military veterans are backing efforts to constrain Donald Trump's military authority, announcing they will support a War Powers Act resolution in response to the US president's go ahead for airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

The veterans – some of whom served in Iraq and Afghanistan – were strongly critical of Trump's decision to launch what they called “preventive air strikes” without US congressional approval, drawing explicit parallels to the run-up to some of America's longest recent wars.

“Twenty years ago, in their rush to appear strong and tough, politicians – from both parties – failed to ask the hard questions before starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” they wrote in a letter led by Representative Pat Ryan to Trump sent on Monday. “We refuse to make those same mistakes.”

Their intervention comes as multiple war powers resolutions are gaining momentum on Capitol Hill, with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, pushing for a vote as early as this week to rein in the president's military actions. The veterans did not specify which measure they would support, as competing versions are being drafted by different Democratic factions alongside a bipartisan effort.

Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team at 1pm ET in the Oval Office.

Trump responded to Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia and an ally of Vladimir Putin, who said on social media that a “number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads”. In response, Trump said that “The ‘N word' should not be treated so casually. I guess that's why Putin's ‘THE BOSS.'”

Trump issued a warning about oil prices after White House adviser says Iran strike won't disrupt markets.

The US embassy in Qatar advised American citizens there to “shelter in place until further notice” and on Sunday night, the state department issued a “worldwide caution” security alert advising US citizens abroad to “exercise increased caution”.

Pakistan has condemned  Trump for bombing Iran, less than 24 hours after saying he deserved a Nobel peace prize for defusing a recent crisis with India.

Trump is set to attend the two day Nato summit beginning on Tuesday. The White House said that at the summit, Trump will push Nato members to increase defense spending.

Trump insisted that “monumental damage” had been done by US strikes to Iran's nuclear sites, but the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says no one in a position to fully assess damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities.

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that the US position on Iran regime change has altered, despite Trump raising the prospect of regime change in Iran on Sunday.

Democratic senator John Fetterman called US strike on Iran “entirely appropriate” and criticized his Democratic colleagues who have condemned the strikes.

On Monday morning, Trump once again hit out at Republican representative Thomas Massie, who has publicly opposed Trump's decision to strike Iran.

The LA county sheriff's department deleted and then apologized for posting a message expressing sympathy for “the victims and families impacted” by US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Donald Trump has responded to Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia and an ally of Vladimir Putin, who said on social media that a “number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads”.

In a post on Sunday, Medvedev also wrote that Trump, who he said was “once hailed as ‘president of peace” has “now pushed the US into another war”.

On Monday morning, Trump responded on Truth Social, writing in a lengthy post, “Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the ‘N word' (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran?”.

He added: “The ‘N word' should not be treated so casually. I guess that's why Putin's ‘THE BOSS.'”

German chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday that there was “no reason to criticize” the US over its strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran.

In a speech on Monday, Merz said:

There is no reason to criticize what America did at the weekend. Yes, it is not without risk. But leaving things as they were was not an option either.

Messaging app WhatsApp has been banned on devices used by staff in the US House of Representatives, per reports.

According to Reuters and Axios, the US House's chief administrative officer (CAO) notified congressional staffers on Monday that WhatsApp is now prohibited from their government devices.

The email, obtained by Axios, reportedly stated that the “Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high-risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.”

It further specified, “House staff are NOT allowed to download or keep the WhatsApp application on any House device, including any mobile, desktop, or web browser versions of its products.”

Additionally, it mentioned that those who have the WhatsApp application on their House-managed devices will be contacted to remove it.

The email listed Microsoft Teams, Wickr, Signal, iMessage and FaceTime as acceptable alternatives to WhatsApp.

On Fox News this morning, Democratic senator John Fetterman, who has been a vocal supporter of Israel and has advocated for the US to join Israel's attack of Iran, criticized members of his own party who have condemned Trump's attack on Iran over the weekend.

“There's going to be a lot of people in my party who are going to disagree with the strike in Iran,” Fetterman said. “And I actually support that. I've always been calling for that thing. I think it was entirely appropriate. And again, there might be votes on that. So for me, that's not a war. That was a very limited military exercise.

“I've been always calling to destroy these nuclear facilities,” he continued. “Now let's talk about the context in the middle of all that now, too. Now, our party has been often wrong, and they were pushing for a ceasefire last year, and now Israel pushed through that and has broken Hamas and Hezbollah as well now, too.

“And now here it is right now, Israel has air supremacy over Iraq right now,” he said. “And now, here's where Iraq – I mean, excuse me, where Iran is right now. Their capabilities are severely limited, and now that was an entirely appropriate to finally take out those nuclear facilities.”

The Los Angeles county sheriff's department deleted and then apologized for posting a message expressing sympathy for “the victims and families impacted” by US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

In the original post, according to a screenshot by local news station KTLA, the Sheriff's department said: “Our hearts go out to the victims and the families impacted by the recent bombings in Iran.”

A swift online backlash followed, and the department then issued an apology on Sunday that referred to its own original post as “offensive and inappropriate” and “unacceptable”.

The Department said that the post was “made in error” and “does not reflect the views of Sheriff Robert G Luna or the Department”.

“As a law enforcement agency, we do not comment on foreign policy or military matters” the statement on Sunday added. “Our mission remains solely focused on protecting public safety and serving our diverse communities.”

In a post on Truth Social this morning, Donald Trump has once again hit out at Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who has publicly opposed Trump's decision to strike Iran.

Last week, in a rare moment of cross party cooperation, Massie collaborated with Democratic California congressman Ro Khanna, to introduce a measure that would force Trump to get congressional approval to enter Israel's conflict with Iran.

On Sunday, Trump took aim at Massie in a lengthy post on Truth Social, describing him as “a negative force”, “a simple minded ‘grandstander'”, “weak” and “ineffective”.

“Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is,” Trump wrote on Sunday. “Actually, MAGA doesn't want him, doesn't know him, and doesn't respect him.”

In response to Trump's comments, Massie wrote on X: “@realDonaldTrump declared so much War on me today it should require an Act of Congress. #sassywithmassie” tagging Trump's X account.

And now, on Monday morning, Trump added to his attacks on Massie, saying “GET THIS “BUM” OUT OF OFFICE, ASAP!!!”

Axios reported on Sunday that Trump's political operation had launched an aggressive effort to unseat Massie.

In a post on Truth Social this morning, President Donald Trump issued a warning on oil pricing.

“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” Trump wrote on Monday morning.

In a second post, he added, “To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!.”

Earlier this morning, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that the US strikes on Iran over the weekend had “not really disrupted global oil markets”.

In an interview with CNBC, Hassett said, “if you look at the excess reserves that oil producing countries have around the world, it's maybe about three times as big as total Iranian production”.

“There's a lot of room to adjust, should we need to,” he said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared on Good Morning America this morning and said that the Trump administration was confident that the airstrikes the US carried out on Saturday in Iran “completely and totally obliterated” Iran's nuclear facilities.

“We are confident that Iran's nuclear sites were completely and totally obliterated,” Leavitt said. “And we have a high degree of confidence that where those strikes took place is where Iran's enriched uranium was stored.

“The president wouldn't have launched the strikes if we weren't confident in that” Leavitt added.

Trump will push Nato members to increase defense spending when he goes to the Nato alliance summit on Tuesday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt says.

In an interview with Fox News on Monday morning, Leavitt said that Trump would push Nato members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP.

“One of the main topics of discussion will be that 5% threshold that our Nato allies have to hit” Leavitt said. “The president has been calling on our Nato allies to do more for quite some time. He got them to step up and do more in his first term, and you'll hear the president talk about that on this next historic trip to Europe.”

The US president and his Nato counterparts are scheduled to meet for the annual Nato summit, which will take place over two days in The Hague, Netherlands, on Tuesday.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked just now about Trump's statements last night regarding regime change in Iran.

“The President's posture and our military posture has not changed” Leavitt said. “The President was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking, if the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks … if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime?”

“That's a question the President raised last night,” she added. “But as far as our military posture, it hasn't changed.”

Leavitt also said that there has been both “public and private messages sent to the Iranians” since Saturday night.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team at 1pm ET today in the Oval Office, according to his schedule.

This comes as on Sunday evening, Trump hinted at the question of regime change in Iran, despite top officials in his administration, including Vice-President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have stressed over the last few days that the Trump administration was not interested in overthrowing Iran's government.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???” Trump posted on social media. “MIGA!!!”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Donald Trump has doubled down on claims “monumental damage” had been done to Iran's nuclear sites, as the head of the UN's nuclear agency said that while he anticipated “very significant damage” at the underground Fordow site, the agency had not been able to assess it.

Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, confirmed that Iran had told the agency it had planned to take “special measures” to protect equipment and nuclear materials on 13 June.

Trump, who has a reputation for hyperbole, again stated that the sites had been “obliterated” by this weekend's US bombings, in contrast with the more cautious language from the Pentagon and Israeli officials.

“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images,” he said in a social media post. “Obliteration is an accurate term!” Pentagon officials have characterised the damage to the sites – at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan – as “severe”.

Assessing the extent of the damage has been complicated by the fact that the US, Israel and the IAEA only have access to surface satellite imagery of the sites and reporting from Iran's nuclear agency on any contamination.

Satellite imagery of Fordow taken in the days before the US attack showed an unusual volume of truck traffic. The images appeared to confirm that Iranian authorities had preemptively removed some material from the site, possibly including its uranium stockpile – or parts of it.

On Monday, Israeli jets struck Fordow in order to obstruct its access routes, the IDF said.

According to briefings from unnamed US and Israeli officials to American and Israeli media, Fordow had been heavily damaged but not destroyed. A senior US official told the New York Times the site had been taken “off the table” but that even 12 bunker-busting bombs could not destroy it.

Speaking in Vienna, Grossi said that given the “explosive payload utilised and the extreme vibration sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred.”

He added, however, that “at this time, no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to have fully assessed the underground damage.” Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had earlier said Tehran was still “calculating the damage”.

Grossi also called for agency inspectors to be allowed to return to Iran's nuclear sites in an effort to “account for” Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpiles and a “return to the negotiating table”.

Whether or not Iran had managed to remove technology and uranium from the attacked sites is likely to be a key question in the coming days and weeks.

“We are going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel and that's one of the things that we're going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” the US vice-president, JD Vance, told ABC's This Week on Sunday, referring to the stockpile of uranium theoretically sufficient to make nine or 10 atomic weapons.

Satellite images released by several imaging companies in the immediate aftermath of the US strikes suggested changes to the above ground topography of the Fordow site, which is buried beneath layers of sedimentary rock in the Zagros mountains.

Other images showed what appeared to be two distinct clusters of holes in a ridge at the site, caused by the entry of the dozen bunker-busting Massive Ordinance Penetrators dropped by US B2 Spirit stealth bombers.

According to Joseph Rodgers, deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Project on Nuclear Issues, the US bunker busters appeared to have targeted ventilation shafts at the Fordow facility.

“The reason that you'd want to target a ventilation shaft is that it's a more direct route to the core components of the underground facility,” Rodgers told Wired magazine.

Among those so far sceptical about the impact of the US strikes was Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who tracks Iran's nuclear facilities.

“At the end of the day there are some really important things that haven't been hit. If this ends here, it's a really incomplete strike,” Lewis told NPR, echoing other experts who pointed to Iran's continued retention of enriched uranium as the key issue.

In a lengthy thread on social media, Lewis expanded his point: “This means Iran has retained 400kg [of 60% highly enriched uranium], the ability to manufacture centrifuges, and one, possibly two underground enrichment sites.

“That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA's calculation, although Iran insists it does not seek nuclear weapons.”

“That is also to say nothing of possible secret sites, which opponents of the JCPOA [the Iran nuclear deal Trump pulled out of] used to invoke all the freaking time,” Lewis said.

“If the strike leaves the current regime, or something very much like it, in power with a nuclear option then it will have been a strategic failure. What does it say when two of the most amazing military operations in modern memory are still unable to fully eliminate Iran's nuclear programme? I think that's proof that this is tactical brilliance […] may be in service of a foolhardy strategy.”

Pre-sales for Premier12 Championship commemorative coins, set to be physically distributed in November, began yesterday and would run until Wednesday next week, the central bank said.

A total of 36,000 coins, priced at NT$1,600 each, would be released to celebrate Taiwan's victory in last year's World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) Premier12 Championship.

The Bank of Taiwan, which is handling the sale and distribution, would offer registration for the purchase through its Web site or at its branches, excluding those that provide only basic banking services.

Should pre-sales exceed the 36,000-coin limit, a computer-generated draw would be held on Thursday next week to select the lucky purchasers, the central bank said. 

The list of selected purchasers would be released at 6pm on Thursday. Those who have chosen to buy the commemorative coin would have until 3:30pm on July 11 to complete their payment. Failure to do so by the deadline would result in the forfeiture of their right to purchase the coin.

Those who complete their payment would be able to collect their coins from a designated Bank of Taiwan branch in November.

Taiwan's national baseball team made history on Nov. 24 last year by securing Taiwan's first gold medal in a world-class national team tournament after defeating Japan 4-0 in the WBSC Premier12 Championship Game at the Tokyo Dome.

The obverse of the coin features the team's players celebrating with the Premier12 trophy, while the reverse displays the phrase “Global Champions Premier12” in English, along with the coin's nominal value (NT$50) and the date of the championship game.

The reverse says that the coin is made from half an ounce of 99.9 percent pure silver.


DIVIDED VIEWS: 
                                         Although the Fed agreed on holding rates steady, some officials see no rate cuts for this year, while 10 policymakers foresee two or more cuts                                        There are a lot of unknowns about the outlook for the economy and interest rates, but US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled at least one thing seems certain: Higher prices are coming.
Fed policymakers voted unanimously to hold interest rates steady at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent for a fourth straight meeting on Wednesday, as they await clarity on whether tariffs would leave a one-time or more lasting mark on inflation. 
Powell said it is still unclear how much of the bill would fall on the shoulders of consumers, but he expects to learn more about tariffs                                    


NOT JUSTIFIED: 
                                        The bank's governor said there would only be a rate cut if inflation falls below 1.5% and economic conditions deteriorate, which have not been detected                                        The central bank yesterday kept its key interest rates unchanged for a fifth consecutive quarter, aligning with market expectations, while slightly lowering its inflation outlook amid signs of cooling price pressures.
The move came after the US Federal Reserve held rates steady overnight, despite pressure from US President Donald Trump to cut borrowing costs.
Central bank board members unanimously voted to maintain the discount rate at 2 percent, the secured loan rate at 2.375 percent and the overnight lending rate at 4.25 percent.
“We consider the policy decision appropriate, although it suggests tightening leaning after factoring in slackening inflation and stable GDP growth,”

Beyond the bad pay, the 22-year-old said that her working and living conditions were “miserable and unacceptable.” 
Millions holiday in Greece every year, but its vital tourism industry is finding it harder and harder to recruit Greeks to look after them.

In a world increasingly defined by unpredictability, two actors stand out as islands of stability: Europe and Taiwan. One, a sprawling union of democracies, but under immense pressure, grappling with a geopolitical reality it was not originally designed for. The other, a vibrant, resilient democracy thriving as a technological global leader, but living under a growing existential threat. 

In response to rising uncertainties, they are both seeking resilience and learning to better position themselves. It is now time they recognize each other not just as partners of convenience, but as strategic and indispensable lifelines.

The US, long seen as the anchor of liberal values, is entering a dangerous period of volatility. Whether through isolationist mood swings, reinvigorated protectionism or transactional diplomacy, under US President Donald Trump, Washington is becoming less predictable and therefore less reliable. 

Meanwhile, China has grown more assertive, betting on the world being too distracted or too divided to respond to its creeping coercion of Taiwan. Europe and Taiwan find themselves caught in the middle — a position that neither is comfortable with.

This is why and where the EU must step up — and where Taiwan must look west.

The European Parliament has already made bold moves: It has continued and even intensified official visits to Taipei, consistently supported the nation's global participation through resolutions and plenary debates, and repeatedly urged investing in resilience and joint efforts, particularly through tech collaboration, an area where global competition has become the toughest. 

The parliament has shown that parliamentary diplomacy works. Yet, it is clearly not enough. It must be supported by member states, whose collective weight is not negligible, especially for China and its global aspirations.

EU member states have converged in appreciating Taiwan's strategic importance to their security and prosperity. For example, this includes voicing concern about growing tensions in the Taiwan Strait in their council conclusions. Yet, it is hard to identify and evaluate concrete steps through which they plan to increase their contribution to deterring an assertive China in the Strait.

At present, the EU's approach to China is going through a rethink — more pushback against Beijing in all fields and overall more investment in strategic autonomy. This has been a positive development, most recently tested by Trump's attack on Europe and everything it stands for. Whether the EU continues on its path of geopolitical rethink would also shape the credibility of its claims that it has elevated Taiwan on its agenda. 

However, steps taken so far by the different EU institutions remain fragmented. They lack urgency. The EU is a multi-layered governance structure and its performance must be assessed as such. In such a structure, ensuring consistency would continue to be exceptionally difficult, yet there is no way around it if the EU is serious about its geopolitical shift. Therefore, what is needed now is clarity in language, and creativity and consistency in action. 

The EU's approach to Taiwan already has a solid foundation, namely shared democratic values, and international standards and principles, which the EU has started to assert much more clearly in its narrative. 

Taiwan is already integrated in the EU's Indo-Pacific strategy adopted in 2021. Yet, although clearly articulated on paper, in practice it remains difficult to evaluate the implementation of the strategy and identify tangible progress. 

The EU must now set clear priorities and pursue them consistently — bolstering its ability to develop, secure and sustain critical technologies — while embracing a more realistic approach to geopolitics. This would require a great deal of creativity. With supply chain concerns on the rise, investing in resilience requires trusted partners.

Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan has proven to be a reliable ally. Europe knows as much, but it must do more than talk. EU institutions all have a role to play and they should each do their part — and be evaluated accordingly.

The parliament should institutionalize annual parliamentary visits to Taiwan to ensure consistency and predictability. It should also adopt regular stand-alone reports on Taiwan (like it does on China). Its first-ever Taiwan report in 2021 was groundbreaking, but has been the last one so far. 

The EU should expand educational and research cooperation with Taiwan, including youth exchanges and institutional partnerships, while continuing to press for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international forums such as the WHO and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

In line with their different strengths and ambitions, member states should explore ways to expand sectoral agreements on digital technology, renewables, cybersecurity and foreign information manipulation — and yes, a serious conversation about a bilateral investment agreement is long overdue, and the European Commission should seriously consider it. 

This is not about recognizing Taiwan as a state. It is about recognizing it as a partner — one that shares Europe's values, complements its economic needs and stands on the frontlines of the global contest between openness and authoritarianism.

Taiwan, for its part, should seize this moment to diversify its global alliances. Europe offers what Taiwan needs most: stability, predictability, legitimacy and policy consistency — without the chaos that increasingly defines US politics.

Taiwan is not just the world's semiconductor hub. It is a democratic bellwether in Asia. Europe's Indo-Pacific strategy cannot be serious if Taiwan is treated as a footnote. At a time when Russia pursues its brutal attack to destroy Ukraine and China deepens its authoritarian playbook, pretending Taiwan is not central to the global balance is a dangerous delusion.

If the 2020s have taught us anything, it is that alliances must be built not just on power, but on principle and predictability. Europe and Taiwan offer that. 

In an era of crumbling certainties, it is time they see each other not through the fog of China or the US — but clearly, and directly.

The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has criticized Ma's participation in the Straits Forum as “dancing with Beijing,” while the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) defends it as an act of constitutional diplomacy.
Both sides miss a crucial point: The real question is not whether Ma's visit helps or hurts Taiwan — it is why Taiwan lacks a sophisticated, multi-track approach to one of the most complex geopolitical relationships in the world.

There, he met with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chairman Wang Huning (王滬寧).

Manchester City hit Al-Ain for six on Sunday to secure a place in the last 16 of the FIFA Club World Cup after Real Madrid shrugged off an early red card to beat Mexican side Pachuca 3-1. 

Juventus proved too strong for Wydad Casablanca while Red Bull Salzburg and Al-Hilal drew 0-0 as the second round of group games at the tournament concluded. 

The match between City and Al-Ain in Atlanta, Georgia, was dubbed the “Abu derby,” with the English club's owner and United Arab Emirates Vice President Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan facing off against his elder sibling, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the Emirati team and also the country.

Ilkay Gundogan put City ahead early on before 19-year-old Claudio Echeverri netted his first goal for the club with a free-kick and Erland Haaland slotted in the third with a penalty in first-half stoppage time. 

In the second half, Gundogan struck again before two substitutes joined in, with Oscar Bobb rolling in the fifth and Rayan Cherki grabbing his first City goal for 6-0. 

The result, in a game watched by a crowd of more than 40,000, means City and Juventus are through to the knockout phase after each winning their first two matches in Group G. 

They are to face each other in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday to decide who tops the section. 

Juventus triumphed 4-1 against Moroccan giants Wydad in Philadelphia, as Kenan Yildiz played a starring role. 

The Turkish international forward scored twice after forcing the early own goal which put Juve ahead in front of almost 32,000 at Lincoln Financial Field. 

His shot found the net with the aid of a slight but crucial deflection off Abdelmounaim Boutouil, and Yildiz then smashed in the second on 16 minutes with a brilliant half-volley. 

South African winger Thembinkosi Lorch pulled one back for Wydad, but the impressive Yildiz made it 3-1 midway through the second half, and Dusan Vlahovic converted a penalty in injury time to seal the win for Igor Tudor's side. 

In Charlotte, North Carolina, Real Madrid overcame the early sending-off of Raul Asencio to beat Pachuca and get their first win under new coach Xabi Alonso. 

Defender Asencio was dismissed after just seven minutes for pulling down Salomon Rondon with the Venezuelan clear on goal. 

That left the Liga MX team sensing the chance for an upset in front of 70,248 fans at the home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers. 

However, Real took the lead on 35 minutes when Jude Bellingham buried a left-foot shot into the bottom corner, and they scored again before the interval through Arda Guler. 

Fede Valverde got their third in the second half, with a deflected Elias Montiel effort pulling one back for Pachuca. 

Alonso also said that Real defender Antonio Rudiger had complained of a racist incident at the end of the game when the German was visibly angered following an exchange of words with Pachuca's Gustavo Cabral. 

“I think the FIFA protocol has been activated to investigate, but if it has happened, all measures should be taken and we support Antonio because it's something unacceptable,” Alonso said. 

Cabral, the 39-year-old Argentinian centre-back, denied the accusations, saying his words had been misinterpreted.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated with additional details.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov on June 23 was formally named a suspect in a high-profile illegal land grab case, becoming the highest-ranking official in Ukrainian history to face such charges while in office.

After reports and public speculation around Chernyshov's potential involvement, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) released a statement announcing that he was the sixth suspect in a “large-scale” corruption scheme lead by a property developer from Kyiv who illegally claimed a land plot to build a residential complex. 

In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Chernyshov denied the accusations against him. ""I'm absolutely not involved in that (scheme). That's clear,"" he said. He also said he won't step down from his post.""I will stay in this position,"" he said.Chernyshov, who heads the new National Unity Ministry in charge of returning refugees, is a close ally of President Volodymyr Zelensky. He raised eyebrows in Ukraine after leaving the country days before law enforcement revealed a massive corruption scheme and detained two of his former close associates — Maksym Horbatiuk and Vasyl Volodin. 

According to the anti-corruption agency, during his time as Development of Communities and Territories Minister in 2020-2022, Chernyshov and his associates undervalued land plots by five times to benefit the developer, which Ukrainian media identified as Serhii Kopystyra, which allegedly cost the state Hr 1 billion ($24 million).

In exchange, NABU says the developer gave kickbacks to Chernyshov and his accomplices with ""significant"" discounts on apartments in his existing buildings, totaling over Hr 14.5 million ($346,000). Ukrainian news site Ukrainska Pravda reports this took place between 2021-2022. 

NABU and Ukraine's Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) seized the plot to prevent the scheme. Most of the illegally obtained apartments have been seized. 

Chernyshov arrived back in the country on June 22 after suspicions mounted in Ukraine that he was on the run and avoiding detention. ""I was definitely on a business trip and I was not escaping out of Ukraine,"" Chernyshov told the Kyiv Independent. ""The rumors of me not returning is nothing but manipulation. I came exactly once my trip was over. I had a very intensive trip in Europe.""

Chernyshov said he was targeted by a ""smear campaign"" but said he didn't know who could be behind it.Chernyshov said that he came back on his own accord and denied that anyone had asked him to return. 

He arrived at NABU offices on June 23, after the agency summoned him to be charged. Upon leaving the bureau, Chernyshov wrote on Facebook that he had a “constructive chat” with detectives and will cooperate with the organization. 

An investigation into Chernyshov and two of his associates took place last year after suspicions arose, according to Ukrainska Pravda, with the agency obtaining a warrant to search Chernyshov's home. However, sources in anti-corruption agencies told Ukrainska Pravda that the head of NABU, Semen Kryvonos, blocked police searches due to his close relationship with Chernyshov, who was his boss when Kryvonos headed the State Architecture Inspection, an agency that subordinated to Chernyshov's former ministry. 

The searches allegedly happened a few weeks ago, after a one-year delay, according to Ukrainska Pravda.Chernyshov said that while he knows Kryvonos in a professional setting, the two are not in contact. He added that the allegations against Horbatiuk and Volodin look ""quite serious"" but that it was for law enforcement to decide if their detention is justified. 

Chernyshov was appointed head of state-owned energy giant Naftogaz in 2022 after the dissolution of the Communities and Territories Development Ministry. He became the national unity minister in December 2024, a ministry created from scratch. 

He is widely believed to have a personal friendship with Zelensky. According to a report by Ukrainska Pravda, Chernyshov was among only a handful of guests invited to celebrate Zelensky's birthday during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 — and the only member of the Cabinet of Ministers in attendance.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated as new details emerge.

Russia launched a mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 23, killing at least nine people and injuring 33 others, including four children, local officials reported.

Kyiv Independent journalists heard explosions and kamikaze drones flying overhead from around 1 a.m. Louder explosions from ballistic missiles were heard an hour later, with the attack lasting around 3.5 hours in total.

The heaviest damage occurred in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the city, when a five-story building partially collapsed after being hit by a ballistic missile, Ukraine's military reported. At least nine people died as a result, and more may be trapped under the rubble. 

An 11-year-old girl was confirmed as the ninth victim of the strike, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said. Her mother's body was recovered earlier from the rubble.

Student Veronika Sherinova, who lives in a nearby building, said she didn't sleep all night — first because she was hiding from the attack, then because the missile strike shattered the windows in her home and neighboring apartments.

""Most of my former classmates lived in this building (that was hit), most of my friends and acquaintances, too,"" she told the Kyiv Independent at the site of the strike. ""We got dressed right away and went over.""

""When my mom and I arrived, I saw them coming out in just their underwear, covered in blood, wounded. It was impossible to look at. It was pure shock. We were all in a state of shock.""

At first, she just wanted to help clear the shattered glass and debris. But after seeing the extent of the destruction, Sherinova realized that some of the people she knew might not have survived the attack.

""The strike hit exactly the floors where our friends lived,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, they didn't survive. My other friends did — they were on the first floor,"" she added, her eyes filling with tears.

""It was a miracle they came out without a single scratch. But the upper floors were just blown away, there wasn't even a chance for anyone up there to survive.""

According to Sherinova, the Russian strike killed a family living on the upper floor — a father, mother, and grandfather — but their teenage son survived. 

""We suspected it right away, but we didn't want to believe it until the very end. But then we found out that they were the first ones they carried out,"" she said. ""The boy is in shock right now; he doesn't realize what's happened. He's just not reacting at all.""

She said her two other friends who lived in the building left for abroad immediately after the strike. 

""They went abroad — they took a bus and left right away.""

State Emergency Service spokesperson Svitlana Vodolaha told journalists at the site that when rescuers arrived, they had been told only a few people would be affected there.

""As it turned out, the information we had was not reliable — there were more people here than we had been told. At this moment, we still don't have complete information on how many people might be trapped under the rubble,"" Vodolaha said. 

""That's why we'll keep working until the very end, until we're completely sure no one is left under the debris.""

Shortly after their arrival, rescuers pulled 10 people from under the rubble, including two children and a pregnant woman, Vodolaha said. 

Vodolaha did not rule out the use of cluster munitions in this attack. After arriving at the site, Kyiv Independent journalists observed holes in the building across from the one that was hit, resembling those from the previous strike on the capital on June 17.

Cluster munitions are banned under international law by more than 100 countries due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term threat they pose to civilians, especially when unexploded submunitions remain hidden in residential areas.

""It's possible as such incidents have happened not only during today's attack but at other times as well,"" Vodolaha said. 

""I think everyone has noticed how our attacks have become longer and more intense, even across the capital,"" she added. ""That's why this morning we were working simultaneously at 15 locations.""

Fifteen-year-old Roman Turko arrived at the site in the morning after the attack with his friend. His uncle lived in the destroyed building but, luckily, wasn't home when the strike happened.

""He's currently serving (in the military), he's a border guard. He was on duty, so luckily he wasn't home,"" Turko told the Kyiv Independent. ""His apartment doesn't really exist anymore: The balcony is gone, the walls are gone.""

""If he had been there, it probably would have been the end for him.""

After surviving such a heavy attack, Sherinova is now considering leaving Kyiv, at least for a while. But she says it feels like there's nowhere left to hide from the Russian war.

""There's a kindergarten nearby where my mom works. It has a shelter, and that's where we usually go when we see reports of (Russian) jets taking off or a possible strike.""

""But today it happened so suddenly, we wouldn't have had time to run anywhere. We just stepped into the hallway, crouched down, and covered our eyes and ears,"" she said. 

""It's hitting everywhere, strikes are happening everywhere. I still can't believe it happened to me, to my neighborhood, where I was born and have lived my whole life.""

""I just can't believe it. I'm still in such a state of shock, looking at all of this and not believing it really happened.""

In the wider Kyiv Oblast, a woman was killed and eight others injured in Bila Tserkva, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration reported. 

Casualties were also reported in other areas around the capital in Kyiv Oblast, including Bucha, a town just northwest of Kyiv.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia deployed 368 aerial weapons, including 352 attack drones, 11 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 5 Iskander-K cruise missiles, striking primarily Kyiv. Ukraine's air defenses destroyed 354 of them. 

Russian forces reportedly struck six locations directly, with debris falling in 25 sites across Kyiv and its surrounding region.

Earlier, it was reported that a high-rise apartment building was damaged as a result of the attack in the area, as well as an exit at the Sviatoshyn metro station and a nearby bus shelter.

Reports indicate that the Darnytskyi, Podilskyi, Solomianskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, and Sviatoshynskyi districts had been affected by the attack. 

Fires also broke out in the Podilskyi district, where debris struck a residential building and a vehicle. 

A large fire was also reported at a four-story office building in the Solomianskyi district. The fire reportedly covered an area of 800 square meters, the State Emergency Service said, with firefighting efforts ongoing.

Drone strike debris also landed in an open area of a stadium in Sviatoshynskyi without causing injuries or fire.

President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, noting that while Moscow had previously criticized strikes on Iran's nuclear program, it remained silent following its own ""cynical"" bombardment of Kyiv with Shahed drones and missiles. 

""Only in Kyiv, five apartment buildings were damaged. These are ordinary residential buildings,"" he said, adding that one person was also killed in Bila Tserkva after a Shahed drone hit a hospital. 

Zelensky said the attack damaged sites in four Ukrainian regions and involved 352 drones—including 159 Shaheds—and 16 missiles, possibly including North Korean ballistic missiles. 

""Every country near Russia, Iran, and North Korea should be thinking about whether they can protect life if this coalition of killers continues spreading terror,"" Zelensky said.

The attack on the capital comes just days after Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Kyiv, killing 28 people and injuring 134 others.

Russia's latest round of large-scale attacks comes as Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi warned on June 21 that Russian forces are attempting to advance along almost the entire front in eastern Ukraine while trying to establish a buffer zone in northeastern Sumy Oblast.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

People watch the scene of the Dryden Creek wildfire, from an intersection along Highway 99 in Brackendale, north of Squamish, B.C, on June 11. How we talk to our kids about climate change can have an impact on how involved they are in helping the planet.Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press

There's not a lot I shield my young kids from. They are 5 and 3, and I try to answer any question they have with age-appropriate honesty. In broad strokes, they know how babies are made, what happens when our bodies stop working and the vague origin story of Santa Claus. 

But one recent query stopped me in my tracks: “Why is the sky orange?” 

Smoke from wildfires burning across Canada was turning our sunny Toronto day a mildly apocalyptic hue. Instead of being honest – and potentially causing panic before drop-off – I simply avoided the question: “Orange is a fun word to say. Does anything rhyme with orange?”

As a parent, literally devoting my life to the future, my climate anxiety is often through the roof. The headlines make me want to scream: It's already on track to be the second-worst wildfire season on record, behind 2023. A new assessment by climate scientists says the world will surpass the 1.5C warming limit within three years if current carbon dioxide emissions continue.

And while parts of the country burned out of control, the G7 leaders who met in Kananaskis, Alta., wrote a charter about the growing threat of wildfires but omitted two rather serious words, and the reason wildfires are getting worse: climate change.

Yet I often keep my climate anxiety hidden from my kids' view. I'm hesitant to volunteer information that might contribute to their worry. When my daughter asked me why the sky was orange, I couldn't muster the truth: That families just like ours were having to flee their homes to escape wildfires, that our air quality in Toronto on that particular day was one of the worst in the world due to wildfire smoke – and that we may have to stay inside more during our precious summer months with rising temperatures and concerning air quality. 

From loss to life: How a Canadian ocean scientist keeps her hope alive

For Mia Gordon, a weather reporter and mom of two in Squamish, B.C., the crisis became very real as a wildfire broke out in her town earlier this month. But she didn't avert her kids' eyes.

“You really think it's never going to happen in your backyard,” she said. “Wildfire season is something I talk about daily for work, but I've never had the experience so personally. As a mom, it was really an eerie thing to witness first hand.”

As an evacuation order was issued for Alice Lake Provincial Park – where her family goes most weekends in the summer – she was honest with her son that one of their favourite places may not always be there. But she also had him focus on the efforts of the firefighters, keeping him “curious and interested” as the water bombers flew over their house every evening. 

“I refuse to be all doom and gloom. I think there is a real opportunity if we communicate to our kids, that they can be stewards of the land and protectors of the environment.”

Bridget Shirvell, a Connecticut-based journalist, mother and author of Parenting in a Climate Crisis: A Handbook for Turning Fear into Action, agrees that how we communicate to our kids can have an impact on how involved they are in helping the planet. 

“It is such a hard balance between being honest and not terrifying them,” she said, underlining that she always recommends parents follow the children's lead. 

Opinion: As northern Canada burns, southern Canada makes climate change worse

With her own child, who is six, Shirvell frames the crisis around the choices humans make. “I never refer to wildfire as natural disaster because I make it clear that these things are happening because of what humans are doing – and the flip side of that, is that humans can also do things that are going to make the planet better.” 

Shirvell says age should be the guiding factor in how to approach the conversation. For young kids, she uses a blanket analogy. “You can put a blanket around your kids, and you can talk a little bit about how the Earth has its own blanket that helps it stay at a good temperature where humans can survive. And if you put on more blankets, the Earth will get too hot.”

After the age of five, Shirvell says developing and nurturing problem-solving skills is key. At the grocery store, she challenges her daughter to find her favourite foods in packaging that is better for the environment. “I make it a game – we can get apple sauce if you can find it in something that's not plastic.” When kids are older, that's when you can have the “very serious talk” about what's happening to our planet. “But keep in mind they're going to be angry, and they should be,” she said. 

So on a recent flight (yes, I know) I told my five-year-old daughter, as gently as I could, about the plane's effects on the Earth, how the fuel it burns makes the world hotter and why we limit airline travel. I didn't talk about the fires – but I explained why we plant trees, why we don't eat meat and why we drive an electric car.

I also explained why this trip was important: We were flying to meet my newborn nephew and her only cousin. The future. 

Later, as my daughter sat beside his bassinet, she said: “I'll put more trees in the dirt for you, so you can have more air.” 

I hope the world they both inherit has trees that are still standing and air that's still safe to breathe. And leaders who finally make systemic changes. When our kids are adults themselves, fielding hard questions from the little ones in their lives, I hope they won't need to skirt the truth.

Good morning. I'm Mariya Postelnyak, The Globe's consumer affairs reporter. For the past week, I've been digging into a scam that hits close to home.

Fraudsters on Facebook and Instagram have been impersonating financial commentators and advisers, including Globe contributor David Rosenberg, BMO's Brian Belski and Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf.

More on how the scam has played out below. First, let's catch up on an eventful weekend:

Iran: A U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites could push oil prices even higher and trigger a knee-jerk rush to safety. Investors are assessing how the latest escalation of tensions could ripple through the global economy. 

Defence: NATO countries agreed on a statement yesterday for their upcoming summit that sets a goal of 5 per cent of GDP for annual defence and security-related spending by 2035.

Manufacturing: With its key auto sector under pressure from U.S. tariffs, Ontario is pivoting to the European defence market.

Tariffs: Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked Kirsten Hillman to stay on as Canada's ambassador to Washington. She will take on the role of chief negotiator with the Trump administration.

Today: Carney is in Europe to meet with leaders ahead of the NATO summit.

Tomorrow: Statistics Canada reports inflation for May. The Bank of Canada is concerned that underlying inflationary pressures led by trade disruption and uncertainty could persist for an “extended period.”

Friday: Analysts are expecting Canadian GDP for April to show a clear slowdown after exporters rushed to move goods across the border ahead of U.S. tariff deadlines.

Notable earnings: BlackBerry reports tomorrow; AGF Management Ltd. and Alimentation Couche-Tard are both up on Wednesday.

David Rosenberg says an investment scam using his name bilked victims out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

Shortly after I started work last Monday, our investment team received an e-mail from one of our regular contributors, David Rosenberg. 

Over the phone, he explained that he'd recently been impersonated in an online scam and had spent the past two months frantically trying to put out the fires. He sounded exhausted.

As a Wall Street and Bay Street veteran, Rosenberg is no stranger to impersonation scams. He's grown somewhat used to seeing his name and image misused online.

But when a friend texted him about the “Wolfpack program” in late April, he knew something about this scam was different. 

He remembers the friend saying: ‘Is this something that small fish like us can invest in, or is it just for the big fish?' ”

His consultancy firm, Rosenberg Research, offers ETF-based model portfolios that clients can mirror. It doesn't offer any investment programs under the name “Wolfpack.”

In the weeks that followed, Rosenberg and his team, including his son Jacob, heard from dozens of people who'd been lured into collectively investing more than $1-million in a sophisticated pump-and-dump scheme boasting David's name. 

I spoke to a handful of the alleged victims, who described the scam as follows: They'd spot a sponsored ad on Facebook or Instagram featuring a photo of David in suit and tie, promising to help “select good stocks” with returns of 30 to 70 per cent. Clicking the ad led them to a WhatsApp group, which appeared to be full of eager investors (though they now suspect most were bots).

At first, the victims had their doubts. All of them began by putting in tiny amounts in the recommended stocks, which they did through their own trading platform of choice.

One person I spoke with remembers seeing 300-per-cent returns in just a month. Others reported similar initial gains. They grew bold and invested more, finding safety in a promise from the scammers to cover at least 80 per cent of losses.

One 60-year-old Saskatchewan man told me he ultimately invested $460,000, including his entire life savings. But just as quickly as the stocks had soared, they crashed.

When victims confronted the scammers on WhatsApp groups, they were often removed. Embarrassed to go to the police, many contacted Rosenberg directly instead.

That's part of the problem, Detective David Coffey of the Toronto Police Financial Crimes Unit told me. A lack of formal reports from victims makes it exceedingly difficult to investigate.

To make matters worse, scams that involve impersonating financial experts are only multiplying.

Last week, BMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski became the latest financial heavyweight to warn his followers about imposters posing as him to scam investors.

And last month, Financial Times economics columnist Martin Wolf and his colleagues played “whack-a-mole” with Meta, trying to take down a deep fake of him giving investment advice. 

While these types of scams are proliferating online, law enforcement, legal experts and social-media giants are split on who's to blame.

But Wolf's case seems to suggest a possible answer: as much as platforms such as Meta may be facilitating the problem, they clearly have the capacity for a solution.

Just before publishing a column about his experience being impersonated, Wolf was enrolled in a new “celeb-bait,” facial-recognition program from Meta. Since then, he's not heard of a single fake ad boasting his image. 

The traditional argument in favour of investing in fertilizer producers – at least long term – rested on rising demand for global food production and threatened arable land owing to urbanization and climate change.

The new argument could include global instability, David Berman writes. Consider Nutrien's recent rally. 

Powering up: How Canada can make up for decades of underinvestment in productivity.

Powering down: Yes, you can unwind from work without having a drink. Here's how.

Keeping in touch: Are you travelling in Canada this summer? Send us a postcard.

World shares slipped on Monday and oil prices briefly hit five-month highs before retracing gains as investors awaited possible retaliation from Iran following U.S. attacks on its nuclear sites, with fallout risks to global trade and inflation.

S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.2 per cent. Treasury yields were little changed. TSX futures edged higher.

In Europe, Germany's DAX was down 0.27 per cent at 23,288.45 and the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.45 per cent at 7,555.78. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.04 per cent at 8,771.47

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 edged 0.1 per cent lower to 38,354.09. Hong Kong's Hang Seng regained lost ground, climbing 0.7 per cent to 23,689.13.

The Canadian dollar was down 0.37 per cent at 72.53 US cents.

A Montreal memorial for the victims of Air India Flight 182, in Lachine, Que., on June 23, 2022.Christinne Muschi/The Globe and Mail

Nisha Thampi is an Ottawa-based physician. Her mother, Vijaya, was murdered in the bombing of Air India Flight 182.

Today is the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, which has been recognized since 2005 as a day to “remember and honour every Canadian whose life was cut short or forever changed by a terrorist attack.” What Canadians might not realize is that we commemorate this on June 23 for a reason. On that day, in 1985, Air India Flight 182 - flying from Montreal to London on its way to Delhi and Mumbai – exploded over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people aboard, including 268 Canadians. It remains the deadliest terror attack in Canadian history.

Forty years later, we mark this grim anniversary at a time of geopolitical tensions and in the aftermath of another horrific Air India crash two weeks ago, in Ahmedabad, India. The bombing of Flight 182 is often presented as a distant tragedy – one that occurred over the ocean and left no survivors, at a time when there was no 24-hour news cycle or social media. The Canadian public was largely shielded from the horrors witnessed by British and Irish recovery teams.

But Flight 182 also represents the tragedy of distance: too many Canadians simply didn't feel connected to an explosion involving a foreign airline carrying many hyphenated Canadians who did not look like them. The Canadian government perpetuated this: For years afterward, Ottawa declined to confirm that the flight was bombed at all, thus abdicating the responsibility to pursue justice for the 268 Canadian citizens and 61 foreign nationals who perished on the flight, and denying support to families and broader communities whose civil litigation in pursuit of healing needed to prove that the plane was brought down by a bomb. 

How families are building a digital archive to commemorate the Air India bombing

It took 15 years for charges to be laid in relation to the bombing, another five years for a trial to end with stunningly light consequences, and another five for an official apology by then-prime minister Stephen Harper. A federal inquiry's report spoke of a “cascading series of errors,” yet it still excluded expert testimony that alluded to the racist structures that perpetuated harm against victims' families.

But this was an act of homegrown terror – a plot that authorities now blame on a group of Khalistani militants living in Canada. Yet 40 years on, the tragedy remains largely forgotten in the public memory. 

I do not have the luxury of forgetting. My mother was on the flight. My father went on to remarry a woman who had lost her husband, K. Lakshmanan, and daughter, Preethi, in the same bombing. I grew up in a community shattered by this sudden loss and marginalized by the institutional indifference that followed. 

Yet, despite these intersections, it took me a long time to engage more fully with this history. As I experienced milestones as a daughter, sister, wife, mother and physician, it became clear that Flight 182 is refracted in my life, my work and my family. 

Liberal MP sponsors petition to open a new Air India bombing investigation

A view of a section of Air India Flight 182 is shown in this handout photo released on April 27, 2004.

The history of the Air India bombing is difficult to teach and learn. There is the inherent violence, the sheer scale of which is hard to comprehend; less than 5 per cent of the wreckage was recovered but is not accessible to the general public. As journalist Kim Bolan wrote: “I wish that all Canadians could have seen the absolute devastation... to have understood the magnitude of the calamity.” How can we comprehend a tragedy we cannot see? If we cannot understand its magnitude, how can we ever hope to prevent its recurrence?

There is also the disturbing timeline of events indicating that the bombing was preventable – that Canadian authorities failed to adequately respond to warnings about the planned attack. These revelations should challenge Canadians' sense of identity – and force us to reflect on what it really means to belong here.

It doesn't help, either, that the framing of the tragedy has strategically shifted over the years. It's gone from a foreign event to a costly trial to a post-9/11 talking point, always suiting the dominant narrative and offloading the burden of remembrance onto victims' families.

It is no surprise, then, that a 2023 poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that nine out of 10 Canadians had little to no knowledge of what it called “the worst single instance of the mass killing of their fellow citizens”. Sixty per cent of Canadians aged 18-to-34 had never even heard of this event. As younger Canadians grow more removed from the bombing, there is a real risk that it will fade entirely from our collective memory.

Wreckage of bombed Air India aircraft should be on display, say victims' families

The story of Flight 182 represents a stark warning against sacrificing human rights and justice for political expediency. This dark chapter should be discussed in Canadian schools, museums and other public spaces to foster the discourse that leads to institutional introspection and accountability, and placed in the context of other difficult histories that have shaped our country. By confronting the bombing and the structures that contributed to the harms afterward, we can better address the historical injustices that live on in the present. We cannot prevent future acts of terrorism if we don't learn from past ones. 

Forty years after Flight 182, Canada now has a choice: Will we finally learn from our history, or are we destined to repeat it?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Iran: What are the chances for regime change?","https://www.dw.com/en/iran-the-dangerous-dream-of-regime-change/a-72995153","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 08:24:41 GMT","

The longer Israel's attack on Iran goes on, the greater the speculation about the possibility of overthrowing the government in Tehran. But regime change has historically had disastrous consequences in the region.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly told the US broadcaster Fox News on Sunday that regime change in Iran ""could certainly be the result"" of Israel's operation there, because, he said, the Iranian government was ""very weak.""

US President Donald Trump has meanwhile sent out contradictory signals. ""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding,"" he wrote on his personal social network, Truth Social on June 17, singling out Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ""He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.""

In the night between Saturday and Sunday, the US flew strikes against Iran's three main nuclear sites, and Trump has threatened more attacks should Tehran not return to the negotiation table.

""There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran,"" the US president said Saturday, adding that the US ""will go for other targets"" should that not be the case. On Sunday, Trump again posted on Truth Social, saying: ""It's not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change?? MIGA!!!""
The longer the conflict with Iran goes on, the more tempting it might appear to Israel and the United States to get rid not just of the Iranian nuclear program, but of the Islamic Republic as well.

""It's extremely doubtful that it would be possible to bring about a regime change like that from the outside, with the push of a button,"" said Eckart Woertz, the head of the German Institute of Global and Area Studies in Hamburg. ""If it did come to that, whether things would then go in the right direction is a whole other question.""

Foreign-imposed ""regime change"" is a highly controversial concept. Under international law, it is a clear violation of the sovereignty of the affected state. Often, the move is not democratically legitimized, and it frequently leads to a power vacuum or violence and instability.

Newly installed governments often find themselves unable to cope with the challenge of resolving the country's problems, and this results in further crises and conflicts.

That's what happened in Afghanistan. After the terrorist attacks on New York on September 11, 2001, NATO invoked the mutual defense guarantee contained in Article 5 of the NATO Treaty for the first and (so far) only time. A Western military alliance led by the United States resolved to topple Afghanistan's Islamist Taliban regime, and fight the terrorist organization al-Qaeda.

Initially, the operation was quite successful, and by the end of 2001 the Taliban had been driven out of Kabul. But various parties to the alliance disagreed on a number of things, including how military, political and development aid should cooperate.

And so, for 20 years, the security situation remained extremely precarious. The country was devastated by attacks as the Taliban launched repeated counteroffensives. Between 2001 and 2021, around 3,600 Western soldiers and almost 50,000 Afghan civilians were killed. The Afghanistan mission cost a total of almost $1 billion (€868 million).

After the chaotic withdrawal of the US and its allies in the summer of 2021, the Taliban returned to power. Since then, they have rolled back almost all the progress made over the past 20 years. Afghanistan is isolated and desperately poor, with 23 million people dependent on humanitarian aid.

The US once supplied weapons to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was in power for more than two decades. In 2003, however, it decided to overthrow Hussein with help of a ""coalition of the willing,"" but without a mandate from the UN Security Council. Washington justified the decision with the assertion that Hussein was supporting al-Qaeda and was in possession of weapons of mass destruction — claims later proven to be false.

""Saddam Hussein was overthrown not because he possessed weapons of mass destruction, but because he did not possess them,"" said Woertz. And, at the time, Iran took note.

Once Hussein had been toppled, the Americans installed a transitional government, which was later heavily criticized for mismanagement and lack of knowledge of the country.

Existing enmities between Iraq's different religious groups deteriorated into a situation akin to civil war between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Deadly attacks were an almost daily occurrence. Soldiers discharged from the Iraqi army started fighting the US troops who had previously toppled Hussein.

Twenty years after the American invasion and the attempted regime change in Iraq, the situation has improved. Violence has died down, and the next round of parliamentary elections is due to take place in November. Nonetheless, Iraq remains a country in the process of change.

Libya is also still suffering the consequences of an attempted regime change, which came from within and was flanked from abroad. In the wake of the Arab Spring, a civil war began in 2011 with protests against the rule of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. When Gadhafi attempted to put down the uprisings with bloodshed, NATO intervened militarily in the form of a no-fly zone to protect the civilian population. The regime held on for a few months. Then on October 20, 2011, Gadhafi was killed.

But a government acceptable to the entire country was never established. Instead, there have been years of further conflict between rival militias. The state has virtually disintegrated, with two different governments fighting for control. The human rights situation remains extremely precarious.

Aside from these cautionary examples from recent history, Woertz sees another problem: Ultimately, ground force would be required to force a change of government in Iran.

""I don't see a massively strong rebel movement within Iran that could topple the current regime,"" he said.

""While there was a successful regime change in Germany once, at the end of World War II, that required a ground invasion,"" said Woertz. ""And then you need a transition backed by local people. It helps if there is a common external enemy — like the Soviet bloc after 1945 — which glosses over the differences. But regime change has never happened with aerial bombardment alone, and I don't think Iran will be an exception now.""

The chancellor says, ""Europeans must become stronger on our own"" as Germany invests record sums in defense and infrastructure. Follow DW for more.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for Europe to boost its defense spending and reduce reliance on the United States, warning that American support is no longer guaranteed. 

Speaking in Berlin, he emphasized the need for strategic independence, resilience against hybrid threats, and long-term support for Ukraine.

Germany is targeting 2.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense-related spending this year and increase it gradually to 3,5% by 2029.

Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of Germans now back the idea of a European nuclear deterrent that doesn't rely on the US, according to a new Forsa poll.

Support stands at 64%, with solid backing across age groups, regions, and party lines — something rare in German foreign policy debates.

Here are the latest headlines from Germany on Monday, June 23.

A coalition of 30 non-governmental organizations is urging the German government not to reduce its foreign aid budget, as the Cabinet prepares to approve the 2026 federal budget on Tuesday.

""Germany should lead by example and encourage other countries to invest in a fairer world,"" the NGOs said in a joint statement.

The appeal has been signed by the aid groups Caritas International, Brot für die Welt, Welthungerhilfe, Kindernothilfe, Oxfam and others. It warns that deep cuts seen in other donor countries are undermining progress and trust.

""They also erode confidence in international cooperation and make it nearly impossible to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030,"" the organizations state.

""There are no national solutions to global challenges. Either we lose alone — or win together.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said Europe can no longer ""free-ride"" on US security and must invest more in its own defense to become strategically independent.

Speaking at the Day of Industry in Berlin on Monday, Merz said US tolerance of low European defense spending ""will not"" continue, and warned that even a new US administration would not return to old assumptions.

""We Europeans must become stronger on our own,"" he said.

Merz urged European countries to build on their strengths and address weaknesses gradually. He also emphasized the need for long-term support for Ukraine, citing the Russian government's ""very rigid stance.""

""Our resilience is required not only militarily, but above all politically,"" Merz said.

Merz added that Europe must protect its freedom from sabotage, cyberattacks, disinformation, destabilization efforts, and attempts to divide the continent. Merz became chancellor last month.

Germany plans to increase its defense budget to 3.5% of GDP over the next five years, government sources said on Monday, aligning with a proposed new NATO target for core military spending.

Defense spending is set to rise from 2.4% of GDP this year, as the German government moves to strengthen its armed forces amid growing security threats from Russia and continued pressure from US President Donald Trump.

The share of children growing up in large families in Germany has been rising again in recent years, according to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), driven mainly by immigration since 2015.

In 2024, 26% of children were living in households with at least three children. That figure had declined from 25% in 1996 to 23% in 2015, but then rose again to 26% by 2024.

""The development over the past ten years is likely due mainly to immigration starting in 2015,"" Destatis said.

Families with a migration background were found to have three or more children nearly twice as often as families without foreign roots. In 2024, 19% of migrant families had at least three children, compared to around 10% of other families.

Also in 2024, 8% of children lived with three or more siblings, while 18% had two siblings. The largest group — 44% — lived with one sibling, and 30% were only children.

Larger families were slightly more common in the western federal states, where 13% of families had at least three children, compared to 11% in eastern Germany.

The figures come from the annual microcensus, which surveys 1% of the population. Families are defined as parent-child groups living in the same household — children who have moved out are not included.

Bavarian Premier Markus Söder has reaffirmed his call for the return of compulsory military service, citing growing threats to European security.

The German government — especially under the current coalition — has proposed a new form of military service based initially on volunteering. As part of this concept, the Bundeswehr has started sending out questionnaires to young people to ask whether they would be interested in serving. Söder, however, says he sees this as insufficient.

""I am in favor of conscription and not just a few questionnaires being sent out. We need it to defend our freedom,"" Söder said Monday on German broadcaster ZDF.

Pointing to the threat from Russia, Söder noted that Sweden and Finland joined NATO last year ""because they say their waters and airspace are constantly being challenged and violated.""

""We have to make an assessment: How much time do we have?"" he added. ""We don't alone decide the timing — the international situation does.""

The coalition agreement between the center-left Social Democrats and the conservative CDU/CSU bloc mentions a new form of military service, initially based on voluntary participation.

""I think it's okay to say we want to increase voluntary recruitment, but if you want to defend a NATO border, defend national borders, and truly become the strongest army in Europe, it probably won't be enough with just questionnaires and volunteering,"" Söder said.

Söder heads the junior partner in the Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc, the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU).

The German government is adjusting its security measures in anticipation of possible retaliatory strikes by Iran, following US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, a government official said Monday.

""We have done so since before the operations began. We will continue to do so. But we are making ongoing adjustments and are in very close and very constructive consultation with our partners,"" the official said.

The official added that the issue had been discussed with Britain and France on Sunday

The ""abstract threat"" to US military bases in Germany has increased following American strikes on Iran's nuclear program, a top German government official warned Monday.

Thorsten Frei, head of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's office, said Sunday's attacks have changed the security environment. ""The abstract threat has without a doubt risen after the developments of the last few hours,"" Frei said in Berlin. ""I believe we must assume that, and be prepared for it.""

Frei, a member of Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said German security authorities are doing everything possible to protect US facilities in the country.

Security around Jewish and Israeli institutions had already been increased following Israel's attacks on Iran on June 13.

""We stand on the side of the US and Israel,"" Frei said.

A survey has shown that many workers in Germany are staying at home to work for more days a week than their employers officially permit.

In many cases, employees made unofficial agreements with their superiors, but often the rules were simply not policed, the survey from the German job portal Indeed showed.

More than a quarter of the 1,000 people questioned in the survey said their direct superiors often allowed more days than permitted by their companies.

The opposite also occurs, with 13.8% of respondents saying they were sometimes called into the office more often than was officially required.

More than two-thirds said their employers had clearly stipulated how often work from home — known in German as ""Homeoffice"" — was allowed, but more than half said there was little monitoring of whether people stuck to the rules.

The survey showed that more than half of respondents were not satisfied with the rules on working from home laid down by their employers and that those who could decide themselves whether and when to work from home tended to be more content with the situation.

The wish of many employees to be free to work from home is also shown by the fact that more than the half of respondents said they deliberately scheduled appointments with doctors and tradespeople, for example, so they could do so.

German customs officials stopped a van on a highway in Brandenburg carrying more than half a ton of pyrotechnics. 

The vehicle contained some 520 kilograms (about 1150 pounds) of fireworks, some of which, due to their hazardous classification, can only be imported into Germany with a special permit. 

The Potsdam Main Customs Office said the import had not been authorized and was discovered during a check near the distrcit of Spreeau, just outside Berlin. 

Tax criminal proceedings were initiated against the 33-year-old driver in connection with a violation of the Explosives Act.

Upon opening the trunk, customs officials discovered a total of 34 boxes full of pyrotechnics as well as individual loose rockets. The driver said he had bought the fireworks for a wedding celebration and was headed from Poland to France. Police confiscated the haul. 

Germany's foreign minister has said Iran must engage in direct talks with the United States after recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, while affirming the European Union's continued role in diplomacy.

""Iran says it only wants to negotiate with Europe and we see that as a good sign but we do also say that's not sufficient. We want to see the United States being involved,"" Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters in Brussels ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

""I renew my call on Iran to now be ready for talks. We have, however, been asked by the US, over the last few weeks and also just now, to remain in touch and Europe does have a role,"" he said.

Migrant arrivals in the European Union have been more highly educated in 2024 than ever before, according to a new German study.

The Rockwool Foundation Berlin (RFBerlin) reports that 32.1% of migrants from non-EU countries had a university degree or equivalent qualification in 2024 — up from 30.9% in 2023. The study, released Monday, describes this as a ""record level"" and part of a continued upward trend over the past decade.

In Germany, the share of highly educated non-EU migrants rose from 29.4% to 31.1% over the same period. For migrants from other EU member states, the percentage holding a tertiary qualification climbed from 33.8% to 35.2% EU-wide, and from 28.6% to 30.1% in Germany.

""This continuous rise in education levels highlights the potential migrants bring to EU labor markets,"" said Tommaso Frattini, co-director of the Center for Research and Analysis of Migration at RFBerlin and professor at the University of Milan. He said that if migrants' skills are fully utilized, ""they can be a key driver of economic growth across the EU.""

Almost two-thirds of Germans are in favor of a European nuclear deterrent independent of the United States, according to a new poll.

The survey, conducted by the Forsa institute for ""Internationale Politik"" magazine, found that 64% of respondents were in favor of setting up a European nuclear shield, while 29% were opposed.

Before taking office in May, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had already signaled his intent to pursue discussions with the United Kingdom and France — Europe's two nuclear powers — on developing a joint European nuclear strategy.

The goal is to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, especially amid concerns over the unpredictability of President Donald Trump.

Support for a European deterrent was consistent across demographic and political lines — an unusual level of consensus on foreign policy in Germany.

In western Germany, 66% backed the idea, compared to 52% in the east. Among respondents under 45, support was 58.5%, rising to 67.5% among those over 45.

By party affiliation, 78% of Green Party voters supported the concept, followed by 71% of supporters of Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Support also stood at 65% among Social Democratic Party (SPD) voters, 54% among Alternative for Germany (AfD) voters, and 52% among those backing The Left.

The UK's nuclear deterrent is operationally independent but technologically reliant on US systems. France's version is both operationally and technologically independent.

The poll was carried out in the second week of June, before the latest escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, which has involved direct US military action against Tehran's nuclear program.

Guten Morgen from a cloudy Bonn am Rhein. Welcome to DW's coverage of developments in Germany on Monday, June 23.

A study has found that most Germans are in favor of Europe developing a nuclear deterrent that is independent of the United States. 

Almost two-thirds of people who were asked said they were in favor of a shared nuclear strategy for Europe.

The aim would be to reduce Europe's reliance on the US nuclear umbrella, especially amid concerns over the unpredictability of President Donald Trump.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:telegraph.co.uk/us","Iran threatened to ‘activate terror sleeper cells inside US' if attacked","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2025/06/22/us-strikes-iran-latest-updates/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 02:16:03 GMT","

Iran threatened to activate terror sleeper cells inside the United States if the country attacked, reports suggest.

Sources told NBC News that Iran sent a communiqué to Donald Trump in the days before the US's strikes, threatening to green-light the terror sleeper cells.

Mr Trump received the message via an intermediary at the G7 summit in Canada last week. He later told reporters he was not “in the mood” to negotiate with Iran.

Sleeper cells are essentially spies or terrorists who operate in the US and remain inactive until they are ordered to act.

It comes as Mr Trump authorised strikes on Iran's three nuclear bases, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, on Saturday night in a stealth mission he hailed “a spectacular military success”.

The US president had previously vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to American officials.

Israeli officials said they believed Iran's heavily-fortified nuclear site at Fordow sustained serious damage from the strikes but had not been completely destroyed. A US official told the New York Times it had been taken “off the table”.

On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, claimed Israel was “close” to wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles.

Thank you for following our live blog. We will back shortly to bring you the latest out of the Middle East conflict.

Air raid sirens are ringing through central Israel early this morning, as the military works to intercept Iranian missiles. 

🚨Sirens sounding across central Israel due to a missile launch from Iran🚨

Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Moscow as he embarks on a campaign to “rally the world against Israel”, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

Mr Araghchi earlier slammed the US's attack, calling it an “outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation” of international law.

The Israeli army said it carried out strikes on Iranian “military targets”, including missile launch and storage sites on Sunday.

“Approximately 20 (Israeli airforce) fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes using over 30 munitions on military targets in Iran,” the Israeli army wrote on Telegram.

The attacks struck “storage and missile launching infrastructure sites”, as well as “military satellites and radar sites”.

Iran sent a communiqué to Donald Trump in the days before the US's strikes, threatening to activate sleeper-cell terror inside the country if it attacked, sources said.

Sleeper cells are essentially spies or terrorists who operate in the US and remain inactive until they are ordered to act.

Mr Trump received the message via an intermediary at the G7 summit in Canada last week.

The US president left the summit early to deal with escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The dollar strengthened in early trading as investors sought havens in a move to shield against mounting geopolitical risks.

The US currency was quoted stronger against the euro and most major foreign-exchange peers as markets opened for the week in Sydney. Traders are forecasting a drop in stocks and a jump in crude prices and gold as the bombing fuels demand for safety and angst about energy supply. 

In another early sign of risk aversion, Bitcoin slid below $100,000 for the first time since May and Ether sank sharply as cryptocurrencies posted broad-based declines. 

Market reaction had been generally muted since Israel's initial assault on Iran earlier this month: Even after falling for the past two weeks, the S&P 500 is only about 3 per cent below its all-time high from February. And a Bloomberg gauge of the greenback is up less than 1 per cent since the June 13 attack. 

That's mostly because investors have expected the conflict to be be localised, with no wider impact on the global economy. But moves stand to get bigger if Iran responds to the latest developments with steps such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for oil and gas shipments, or attacking US forces in the region, market watchers say. 

The biggest market reaction since the start of the escalation has been in oil, with Brent futures jumping 11 per cent to $77 a barrel. 

Traders are preparing for another surge in crude prices even as it's unclear where the crisis goes from here. That rise is expected to restart on Monday, after the US assault dramatically raised the stakes in a region that accounts for a third of global oil output.

Donald Trump has stopped short of saying that the goal of US strikes was to topple the government in Tehran, but he said “regime change” would happen if its leaders were “unable to make Iran great again”.

Yet, according to US officials, he had already vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Hawks within the Israeli establishment, and many ordinary Israelis, would love to see Khamenei dead, arguing that he is a legitimate target whose removal would eliminate one of the gravest threats to the Jewish state.

To bolster their case, they note the limited backlash following the assassinations last year of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah chief in Lebanon, and Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader behind the Oct 7 massacre.

But many analysts believe assassinating Khamenei would be a perilous gamble – one that could easily misfire by paving the way for an even more hardline successor.

Khamenei may be no peacemaker, but he did place a fatwa effectively banning Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It is unclear whether the ruling has survived in its original form, and many in Israel set little store by it.

The assassination of 10 senior Iranian generals may already have strengthened the regime's fundamentalist wing, even as it has dealt a serious blow to its military command structure.

Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, has slammed the US for its strikes.

Mr Iravani told the UN Security Council: “The United States, a permanent member of this Council... has now once again resorted to illegal force, waged a war against my country, under a fabricated and absurd pretext: preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.”

He said the US had “decided to destroy diplomacy” and that the Iranian military would now decide the “timing, nature and scale of Iran's proportionate response”.

“We will take all measures necessary,” Mr Iravani told the meeting.

In a post on his Truth Social network, Donald Trump has said: “It's not politically correct to use the term, “Regime Change,” but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!”

Just hours ago, Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth stressed that Washington was not seeking to topple the Iranian government or force “regime change”.

Speaking to the UN Security Council by video link, Rafael Grossi also provided insights into the extent of the damage caused by US attacks on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility.

 There were visible craters “indicating the use by the United States of America of ground-penetrating munitions,” the IAEA director said.

But Mr Grossi noted that no one had been able to assess the underground damage at Fordow.

He added that “armed attacks on nuclear facilities should never take place and could result in radioactive releases with grave consequences within and beyond the boundaries of the State which has been attacked”.

 

Rafael Grossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), spoke at the special United Nations meeting where he voiced fears over “potential widening” of the Middle East conflict.

“We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy,” Mr Grossi said.

“If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall.”

United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has warned against yet “another cycle of destruction” and retaliation following the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, which he said marked a “perilous turn” in the region.

“I have repeatedly condemned any military escalation in the Middle East,” the secretary-general told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

“The people of the region cannot endure another cycle of destruction. And yet, we now risk descending into a rathole of retaliation after retaliation.”

 

 

 

A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister spoke to the President of the United States Donald Trump this evening. 

“The leaders discussed the situation in the Middle East and reiterated the grave risk posed by Iran's nuclear programme to international security. They discussed the actions taken by the United States last night to reduce the threat and agreed that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. 

“They discussed the need for Iran to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to make progress on a lasting settlement.

“They agreed to stay in close contact in the coming days.”

A powerful explosion was heard in central Isfahan at 10:48 pm local time as air defence activity intensified across multiple Iranian cities, Iranian media reported.

Citizens in Isfahan reported hearing a “big explosion” from the southeastern part of the ancient city.

Air defence activity also intensified in Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz and Ahvaz late on Sunday, according to Iranian media.

Isfahan is home to one of Iran's major nuclear facilities that was targeted in the American strikes.

UK bases in the Middle East are on heightened alert for drone strikes after the US bombing of Iran.

John Healey, the Defence Secretary, said UK Armed Forces protection was at its “highest level” amid fears that the US action could escalate into a wider conflict.

It is understood UK bases across the Middle East have increased security since the US action in the early hours of Sunday morning, with personnel on high alert for drone attacks as well as conventional rockets and missiles.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is addressing the UN about the US strikes last night.

“Craters are visible at the Fordow site, Iran's main location for enriching uranium at 60 per cent, indicating the use by the United States of America of ground-penetrating munitions,” he said.

“No one... is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.”

At the Isfahan site, Mr Grossi continued, “additional buildings were hit overnight with the US confirming their use of cruise missiles.”

“Affected buildings include some related to uranium conversion processes. Entrances to tunnel used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit,” he said.

At Natanz, a “fuel enrichment plant has been hit, with the US confirming it used ground-penetrating munitions.”

Several explosions were heard in the northwestern city of Tabriz around 10 pm local time following an Israeli attack, Iranian state media reported.

“Around 22:00 on Sunday, following the Zionist attack, the sound of several explosions was heard in Tabriz,” Fars news agency said.

A Fars correspondent reported hearing the sound of a fighter jet over Tabriz, according to the agency.

Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has arrived in Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin following a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites.

“Abbas Araghchi ... arrived in Moscow to hold consultations with the (Russian) president and other senior officials of Russia regarding regional and international developments following the military aggression by the United States and the Zionist regime against Iran,” state media reported.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israel is “close” to destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities and stock of ballistic missiles.

He vowed not to be dragged into a “war of attrition with Iran”, saying: “When we achieve our objectives, the fighting will stop.”

However, senior members of Donald Trump's administration on Sunday issued a more conservative assessment of the damage inflicted on Tehran's nuclear ambitions.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said its capabilities had been “degraded” and “set back” but stopped short of saying they had been outright destroyed.

Similarly, JD Vance, the US vice president, said last night's strikes on three Iranian facilities had “substantially delayed” Iran's ability to develop of a nuclear weapon “by many, many years”.

Danny Danon criticised António Guterres after the UN secretary general said he was “gravely alarmed” by the US bombing Iran's nuclear sites.

“It was very disappointing because the secretary general failed in his remarks to mention the threat of a nuclear Iran,” he said.

“He knows better. He knows diplomacy has failed for the last decades, and should thank the US for bringing stability and bringing peace through power.”

Danny Danon said “the entire world is safer” following the US' strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities last night.

“You don't have a radical regime which threatens to destroy member states of the UN,” he said, adding: “Today I think we have historic days.”

Mr Danon said he wanted to see regime change but conceded “that's for the Iranian people to decide, not us.”

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations has warned the West it cannot “sit out” the conflict with Iran.

Danny Danon, speaking shortly before an emergency security council meeting: “[Iran] threatens every capital in the West with its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles.

“You cannot sit this one out. You cannot condemn the firefighters while the arsonist tries to light more fire. You cannot protect peace by appeasing evil.”

He warned Tehran: “Under this, any further attacks against our civilians will be met with overpowering, righteous force, unlike your actions against our civilians”

America is on alert for an attack on home soil by Iranian-backed terrorists, JD Vance has warned.

Authorities are preparing for a possible attack after Donald Trump bombed Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday morning local time, with security being increased at places of worship in major cities.

Speaking to NBC's “Meet the Press”, Mr Vance, the US vice president, claimed that individuals “on the terrorism watch list” had been allowed to enter the country during Joe Biden's administration.

“We feel very confident in our FBI and law enforcement that we're on top of the situation, but yeah, we're looking at this very closely,” he continued.

“We're doing everything that we can to keep our people safe.”

Police in Washington, DC, New York and other major American cities said they had increased their presence outside places of worship on Sunday following the US air strikes.

The White House has reportedly been monitoring possible Iranian sleeper cells in the US, which could be ordered by Tehran to launch an attack in retaliation for the damage inflicted on its nuclear programme.

The next 48 hours are considered the most dangerous period for an Iranian attack, either on American civilians or military in the Middle East or on home soil, US officials told NBC News.

Donald Trump has lashed out at a Republican congressman who claimed his bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities was unconstitutional.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president accused Thomas Massie, a representative for Kentucky”, of “grandstanding” and failing to recognise “what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran”.

“He's a simple-minded ‘grandstander' who thinks it's good politics for Iran to have the highest level nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘Death to America' at every change they get,” he said, labelling the Republican “weak” and “ineffective”.

Mr Trump continued: “He is disrespectful to our great military, and all that they stand for, not even acknowledging the brilliance and bravery in yesterday's attack, which was a total and complete win.

“Massie should drop his fake act and start putting America First, but he doesn't know how to get there - he doesn't have a clue!”

Iranian police have arrested an alleged Israeli agent in a suburb of Tehran.

“With intelligence oversight and control in real and online platforms... police officers succeeded in identifying and arresting a mercenary of the Israeli regime in Parand,” said Colonel Ali Zanganeh, the police commander of Robat Karim district.

The United Nations is expected to hold an emergency security council meeting at 3pm EDT (8pm BST) after the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Hezbollah has condemned US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and expressed “confidence” in Iran's ability to “make America and Israel taste defeat.”

“We condemn in the strongest terms the barbaric and treacherous American aggression against Iran's peaceful nuclear facilities,” the Iran-backed Lebanese group said in a statement.

The group called the strikes “a reckless, dangerous and uncalculated escalation that threatens to expand the war and drag the region and world toward the unknown if not stopped.”

Hezbollah said the US was seeking through the “criminal aggression to achieve what Israel had failed to accomplish and compensate for its disgraceful failure in achieving its goals against Iran's painful and devastating missiles.”

It called the strikes “a violation of international and humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions and the U.N. Charter, which prohibit targeting nuclear facilities and using force against an independent country.”

Marco Rubio has urged Iran to turn over enriched uranium which the US believes it “buried deep under the ground” at the Isfahan site.

The US secretary of state was asked about reports that Iran had removed stockpiles from the Fordow facility ahead of American air strikes last night.

“No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it because you really can't move anything right now, and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran,” Mr Rubio told CBS' “Face the Nation”.

“The minute a truck starts driving somewhere, the Israelis have seen it and they've targeted it and taken it out.  

“So our assessment is we have to assume that that's a lot of 60 percent enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan, and that really is the key.  

“What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over.  Multiple countries around the world will take it and down-blend it.”

Iran still has a stockpile of enriched uranium despite US strikes last night on its nuclear sites, an adviser to its supreme leader has claimed.

“Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn't over, enriched materials, indigenous knowledge, political will remain,” said Ali Shamkhani, a close ally of ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

He added that the “political and operational initiative is now with the side that plays smart, avoids blind strikes. Surprises will continue.”

Seven Revolutionary Guard members and two conscript soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes on two military centres in central Yazd province this afternoon, Iranian forces announced.

The Revolutionary Guard's Al-Ghadir unit in Yazd said the casualties resulted from “aggressions by the savage Zionist regime and its mercenaries” against the military facilities.

“Seven Revolutionary Guard personnel and two conscript soldiers achieved martyrdom, and several others were wounded, with treatment of these dear ones underway,” the unit said.

Iranian air defences are targeting Israeli aircraft over central Isfahan province, state media reported.

“Isfahan air defence operations against hostile aircraft began an hour ago,” Tasnim news agency said.

“Following the detection, identification and tracking of several hostile Israeli aircraft in Isfahan's airspace, air defences immediately activated and are destroying these targets.”

New York is on “high alert” after the US struck three nuclear sites in Iran, according to the state's governor, Kathy Hochul.

“We are not aware of any specific or credible threat to New Yorkers,” Ms Hochul said in a statement. “However, given New York's distinctive global profile, we are taking this situation extraordinarily seriously.”

The Department of Homeland Security has warned the US was facing a “heightened threat environment” and could face attacks or cyberattacks by Iran.

“The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilising to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence,” it said on Sunday.

Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz have urged Iran to return to the negotiating table following US air strikes last night.

The three leaders, from the British-French-German grouping known as the E3, said in a statement:

We have discussed the latest developments in the Middle East earlier today.We reiterate our commitment to peace and stability for all countries in the region. We affirm our support for the security of Israel.We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security. Earlier today, the United States has conducted targeted military strikes against nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Our aim continues to be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.We call upon Iran to engage in negotiations leading to an agreement that addresses all concerns associated with its nuclear programme. We stand ready to contribute to that goal in coordination with all parties.We urge Iran not to take any further action that could destabilise the region.We will continue our joint diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and ensure the conflict does not intensify and spread further.

Masoud Pezeshkian, the Iranian president, has said the US “must receive response to their aggression” following the attacks on Tehran's nuclear facilities.

Donald Trump ordered US defence secretary Pete Hegseth to strike Iran on Saturday, Fox News reported.

A US official told the broadcaster: “The president gave the final order to the secretary of defence yesterday.

“In the week leading up to the strike, the president was continuing to pursue diplomacy, mainly through special envoy [Steve] Witkoff's efforts, while the Pentagon was simultaneously preparing the operation.

“The president was briefed daily on the Israelis' efforts and the operation itself as he decided whether to move forward.”

Tom Cotton, the Republican senator, warned Iran that retaliating would result in “military force” that made Saturday night's air strikes “look like child's play”.

Mr Cotton, a foreign policy hawk who was reportedly influential in pushing Donald Trump towards military action, noted the US had troops stationed in the Middle East and that the president had “no higher priority” than the safety of Americans.

For years, successive US administrations used sanctions and threats to keep Iran in line. On Saturday night, Donald Trump launched strikes on Tehran's nuclear programme in what could be the biggest gamble of his presidency.

He has repeatedly made the case that he doesn't want foreign wars. But his intervention in the Middle East could now trigger an Iranian response with attacks on American interests – including 40,000 US troops in the region.

But the calculus clearly changed in the days after Israel launched its own strikes on Iran. Tehran launched barrage after barrage of missiles and rockets in retaliation, but the terrifying forecasts of thousands dead in Israel never materialised.

At the same time, Iran had given away some of its secrets last year when it launched its own strikes on Israel. That was a fatal mistake, according to Fred Fleitz, who served on the national security council during Mr Trump's first term.

“It gave Israel a chance to retaliate and probe Iran's defences,” he said. “It meant Israel knew Russian air defence systems, that everyone knew were protecting the nuclear facilities, didn't work very well.”

This may be Mr Trump's biggest gamble so far, but he acted only when the odds had started to turn his way.

The Iranian parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz after the US launched strikes against the country's nuclear facilities.

The strait is a key passage through which 20 per cent of global oil and gas demand flows. Major oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, rely on the waterway to access the open sea.

The closure of the shipping lane would be expected to disrupt global oil supply, causing a sharp spike in prices, and could temporarily restrict the ability of US warships to exit the Persian Gulf.

Iran's security body will now make the final decision on whether to proceed with the plan, state television reported this afternoon.

Esmail Kosari, a revolutionary guards commander, told the Young Journalist Club, a news agency in Iran, that the closure was on the agenda and “will be done whenever necessary”.

It comes after America's leading general said the US military had inflicted “extreme damage and destruction” on Iran's three most critical nuclear sites.

Unveiling details of the mission, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Gen Dan Caine said the US had “retained the element of surprise” throughout the operation and claimed there was not a single shot fired at its stealth bombers.

Donald Trump has claimed Republicans are unified “like we have never seen before” in his first public statement since revealing details of US strikes late on Sunday.

The US president wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Great unity in the Republican Party, perhaps unity like we have never seen before. 

“Now let's get the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill done. Our Country is doing GREAT. MAGA!”

While most Republicans have publicly backed Mr Trump over the strikes, Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who has angered the president with his opposition to the “big, beautiful” tax-and-spend bill, claimed the move was unconstitutional.

Iran's Fordow nuclear facility has not been destroyed despite Donald Trump's claim that it was “totally and completely obliterated”, according to reports.

US and Israeli officials told The New York Times that the heavily-fortified site, which is located deep underground, had been severely damaged but not destroyed by the 12 “bunker-busting bombs” dropped on it by US bombers last night.

However, a US official said the facility had effectively been taken “off the table” by the attack.

In a Pentagon press conference this morning, Dan Caine, the chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, said the US had achieved the “the destruction of capabilities” at Fordow but a damage assessment was still ongoing.

The Pope has warned that “war does not solve problems” following US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities last night.

“War does not solve problems; on the contrary, it amplifies them and inflicts deep wounds on the history of peoples, which take generations to heal,” Leo XIV, who was born in Chicago, said in a statement.

“No armed victory can compensate for the pain of mothers, the fear of children, or stolen futures.

“May diplomacy silence the weapons! May nations chart their futures with works of peace, not with violence and bloodstained conflicts!”

Earlier on Sunday, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said the US “not looking for war with Iran” and warned that any retaliation would be “the worst mistake they've ever made”.

War does not solve problems; on the contrary, it amplifies them and inflicts deep wounds on the history of peoples, which take generations to heal. No armed victory can compensate for the pain of mothers, the fear of children, or stolen futures. May diplomacy silence the weapons!…

Authorities are on the alert for a terrorist attack on US soil following the strikes last night, JD Vance has said.

The vice president told NBC: “We know that a lot of people who we don't have full accounting of were let in over the last four years under the Biden administration.

“We know that some of those people were on the terrorism watch list.

“We feel very confident in our FBI and law enforcement that we're on top of the situation, but yeah, we're looking at this very closely. We're doing everything that we can to keep our people safe.”

JD Vance said the US strikes last night had “substantially delayed [Iran's] development of a nuclear weapon”.

The vice president had been asked about Donald Trump's claim that the attack had “completely and totally obliterated” Tehran's nuclear facilities on NBC's “Meet the Press”, but declined to get into “sensitive intelligence about what we've seen on the ground”.

It will be “many, many years before the Iranians are able to develop a nuclear weapon,” he continued. “But again, our goal is that they're never able to develop a nuclear weapons programme.”

JD Vance, the US vice president, has just ridden to the rescue of Mr Trump's defence secretary and other key figures. The media has been rife with rumours that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, had lost the president's confidence and were on the outs.

Mr Vance, a key conduit to a restive part of the Maga base and one of the administration's most effective communicators, says last night's actions show that to be nonsense.

Two thoughts this morning:The operation last night is an incredible testament to American pilots and other service members, from General Caine and General Kurilla on down. While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division,…

“While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team,” he posted on X. “I'm incredibly proud of them, and I know the president is, too.”

Iran will commit “economic suicide” if it blocks off the Strait of Hormuz in response to US strikes, Marco Rubio has said.

The US secretary of state, asked on Fox News if he expected Tehran to close off the strait to disrupt global oil supplies, said: “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil.

“If they do that, it will be another terrible mistake.

“It's economic suicide for them if they do it, and we retain options to deal with that, but other countries should be looking at that as well. It would hurt other countries' economies a lot more than ours.”

Mr Rubio said the move would be a “massive escalation that would have to merit a response not just by us, but from others.”

Lindsey Graham, one of Mr Trump's most hawkish senators, said the president was well within his authority to order strikes.

In the run up to Saturday's attack on Iran, constitutional scholars had pointed out that only Congress - not the president - has the power to declare war.

“He was within his Article II authority, Mr Graham told NBC's ‘Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'. “Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can't be the commander-in-chief.

“You can't have 535 commander-in-chiefs. If you don't like what the president does in terms of war, you can cut off the funding.

“But declaring war is left to the Congress. We've declared war five times in the history of America. All of these other military operations were lawful. He had all the authority he needs under the constitution. They are wrong.”

Article II is the part of the US constitution that gives that gives the president executive authority to take (some) decisions on behalf of the nation.

The US secretary of state has warned Iran that retaliation would be the “worst mistake they have ever made”.

Speaking to Fox News this morning, Marco Rubio said the US was “not looking for war in Iran” but blamed Tehran for not negotiating with Donald Trump.

Iran was “playing games with Donald Trump... the way they played every American president for the last 35 years,” he continued.

Iranian retaliation would be “the worst mistake they've ever made...we can fly in and out of Iran at will,” Mr Rubio warned.

“We're not looking for war in Iran but if they attack us then I think we have capabilities they haven't even seen yet,” he added.

Mr Rubio said Iran's nuclear programme had been “degraded” and “set back from a technical standpoint” but stopped short of saying it had been destroyed outright.

John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, said the US strikes have left Iran “on the verge” of “regime change”.

Mr Bolton, who has been a frequent critic of his former boss, told CNN that the US president made the “right decision for America”, calling Iranian leadership “very vulnerable” and “in trouble”.

While he suggested Iran would be wary of taking on the US, he said it could seek to close the Strait of Hormuz to damage global shipping, strike US military or civilians, damage oil infrastructure, or launch terrorist attacks around the world.

In that situation, Mr Trump would have no choice but to use “brutal force against the Iranian regime”, he said.

The Iranian parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global oil chokepoint through which 20 per cent of global oil and gas demand flows.

Iran's top security body will now make the final decision on whether to close the shipping lane, state TV reported this afternoon.

Such a move could temporarily restrict US warship's ability to exit the Persian Gulf and lead to the disruption of global oil supply, causing a sharp spike in prices.

US strikes on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility left six craters in the ground where American bombs likely entered before hitting their target, a new picture released by Maxar Technologies shows. 

Grey dust and debris can also be seen scattered down the mountainside after US “bunker buster” bombs were dropped overnight. 

JD Vance, the vice president, said the media was to blame for “fake division” over Donald Trump's decision to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.

“While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team,” he said.

“I'm incredibly proud of them, and I know the president is, too.”

His comments come after Mr Trump suggested Tulsi Gabbard, his intelligence chief, was “wrong” to suggest Iran was not close to building a nuclear weapon.

It was the second time that Mr Trump had directly contradicted Ms Gabbard on the issue, with the US president saying on Thursday that he did not “care what she thinks”.

There has also been division amongst Mr Trump's supporters about whether the US should attack Iran. Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, two influential media personalities who supported the president's re-election bid, said it would be wrong to do so.

Israel has launched a fresh round of strikes against Iranian targets in the centre and south of the country, according to state news. 

Two military zones were targeted in the region of Yazd, Mher reported, while strikes were also carried out in Bushehr. 

Bushehr is the location the location where another of Iran's nuclear power plants is located. It was not targeted in US strikes overnight. 

The UN's nuclear watchdog warned that striking the Bushehr plant could lead to a “very high release of radioactivity”. 

The US vice president said the White House has been clear that is not seeking a regime change in Iran.

“Well, look, that's up to the Israelis,” JD Vance told NBC's Meet the Press. “But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change. We do not want to protract this or build this out any more than it's already been built out. 

“We want to end their nuclear programme, and then we want to talk to the Iranians about a long term settlement here.”

He has said repeatedly during this interview that Iran faces a choice: if it gives up its nuclear weapons programme then it can have a relationship with Washington.

JD Vance, US vice president, said he won't be drawn into whether the president had new intelligence that necessitated a strike, but he says it would have been irresponsible not to attack Fordow.

In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, “There's, of course, an open question about whether they were weeks away, whether they were months away, but they were way too close to nuclear weapon for the comfort of the president of the United States, which is why he took this action.”

“Now there's another element here too Kristen, which is that we had a narrow window of opportunity, we might not have been able to carry out this attack six months down the road.”

Failing to strike now, might have made a future attack impossible.

“It would have been irresponsible, I think, for the president not to take the action that he did, which is why Fordow was destroyed last night,” he said.

Continuing the press briefing, Dan Caine said that the US is “unaware” of any shots being fired at US bombers on the way in and way out of Iran.

“Iran's fighters did not fly and it appears that Iran's surface to air missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission we retained the element of surprise,” he added.

US forces “employed approximately 75 precision guided weapons during this operation” and more than 125 aircraft, he said.

In the wake of the attack, he said: “Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attack, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend ourselves.”

“B-2 bombers left the US on midnight, with part of the group heading “to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy”, Dan Caine told the briefing.

Meanwhile, seven B-2 bombers “proceeded quietly to the East with minimal communications”, he continued.

“Once over the land the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex tightly timed manoeuvre… all done with minimal communications,” Gen Caine continued.

At around 5pm EST, a US submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles at Isfahan, a nuclear site, he said.

“The US employed several deception tactics including decoys as the fourth and fifth generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude, and high speed, sweeping in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface to air missile threats,” he said.

The US military inflicted “extreme damage and destruction” on Iran's three most critical nuclear sites, America's top general said.

Unveiling the details of the mission, dubbed “ Midnight Hammer”, General Dan Caine said that throughout the operation the US “retained the element of surprise” and there was not a single shot fired at its stealth bombers.

Decoy warplanes were sent West, while the real strike group headed East, before unloading the US's most devastating bombs on Iran's enrichment facilities, while submarines fired Tomahawk missiles.

“Initial assessments indicate that all three Iranian nuclear sites sustained extreme damage and destruction”,” he said, referring to the three sites targeted - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Celebrating its “overwhelming” success, Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said the US completed its mission to “destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear programme”.

Seeking to now de-escalate the situation, he said the US was seeking peace not war and warned Iran against a retaliatory attack.

Iran has vowed “everlasting consequences” in the wake of the attacks, raising fears of strikes on US bases in the Middle East.

Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the US had executed a “deliberate and precise strike against three Iranian nuclear facilities” in “Operation Midnight Hammer”.

“This was a complex and high risk mission carried out with exceptional skill and discipline by our joint force,” he said. “This operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. It was planned and executed across multiple domains and theatres… with speed and precision at the time and place of our nation's choosing.”

Gen Caine said “very few people in Washington” knew “the timing or nature of this plan.”

Donald Trump “seeks peace and Iran should take that”, Pete Hegseth continued.

He praised US Central Command, “who did a phenomenal job”, thanking “every American involved in this operation” who “performed flawlessly” along with the US' allies in the Middle East.

“This was a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we could be ready when the president of the United States called,” Mr Hegseth said. “It took a great deal of precision. It involved misdirection,” he added.

B-2 bombers “were in and out and back without the world knowing at all”.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, called the US strikes against Iran “bold and beautiful”.

He said the mission was to “destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear programme” and called it “an incredible and overwhelming success”.

“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme. It's worth noting the operation did not target the Iranian troops or the Iranian people,” he continued.

“Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. Many presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear programme. And none could – until President Trump.”

He declared: “American deterrence is back.”

Sir Keir Starmer warned that there was a “risk of escalation” after the US strikes against Iran, both in the Middle East and “beyond the region”.

Asked on Sky News if the UK was prepared to offer military support, the Prime Minister said: “My focus is on de-escalating the situation. I accept your challenge that there is a risk of escalation. That's a risk to the region. It's a risk beyond the region.

“And that's why all our focus has been on de-escalating, getting people back around to negotiate what is a very real threat.

“In relation to the nuclear program, in relation to the UK, we were not involved in the attack. We were given due notice, as we would expect, as close allies to the US, and we have been moving assets to the region to make sure that we're in a position to protect our own interests, our personnel and our assets, and, of course, those of our allies.”

US Defence Secretary Pete Hesgeth is about to give a briefing on the US strikes on Iran. 

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned the US to “expect regrettable responses” to its strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites.

Iran, it said, would “use options beyond the understanding... of the aggressor front, and the aggressors of this land must expect regrettable responses”.

The Guards also said they would continue to target Israel, which has been hit by multiple waves of missile and drone attacks since it struck Iran on June 13.

Sir Keir Starmer will chair a meeting of Cobra to oversee Britain's response to the US bombing of nuclear sites in Iran.

The Prime Minister has been working in Number Ten, speaking to political leaders in the region and his ministers amid warnings that the security threat to the UK has been increased by the US operation on Sunday morning.

Sir Keir Starmer once again emphasised that the Government's focus was on de-escalation and diplomacy in response to the US strikes on Iran.

“We were not involved, we were given due notice as we would expect as close allies with the us and we have been moving assets to the region,” he told Sky News.

The Prime Minister refused to comment on what might happen next or how Nato would respond if Iran attacked US bases.

Instead, he sought to reassure the public that that “all necessary measures” to protect UK interests and military personnel had been taken.

Speaking directly to Britons in the Middle East, he said: “I urge all citizens to make contact with the Foreign Office so we can facilitate whatever support is needed.”

The Israeli army said today it had “other goals” in Iran and intended to continue its military offensive.

“We have other goals and we will continue to act until we attain them,” army spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters.

 

The threat of Iranian attacks in the UK could increase in the wake of US bombing of the country's nuclear facilities, a Cabinet minister has warned.

Donald Trump deployed B-2 bombers to strike Iran's three principal nuclear sites overnight, in what he called a “very successful attack”.

The world is bracing for Iran's retaliation after its foreign minister warned there would be “everlasting consequences”.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, said that Iran's disruptive spying operations in the UK were “already at a significant level”, with hardly a week going by without an Iranian cyber attack on the UK's infrastructure.

He said: “I think it would be naive to say that wouldn't potentially increase but again, there's a choice here for Iran. Do they want to continue being an agent of instability in the region and the wider world? Where has that got them? Where has it got the Iranian people?

“There is a better course of action for Iran to take here and I think they should consider that.”

In May, police uncovered an alleged terror plot to attack Israel's embassy in London by a group of Iranian nationals.

The UK has already declared Iran and any agents acting on its behalf as a security threat under new laws that force them to register their activities in the UK or face five years in jail.

Mr Reynolds also confirmed that the UK was not involved in the US bombing of Iran's nuclear sites but was told in advance by the US of the attack.

He said the US had also made no request to use the UK military in the attack, either through RAF support from Typhoon fighter jets in RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus or using Diego Garcia military base as a staging post for the bombing.

The international nuclear watchdog said the facilities struck by US bombs overnight in Iran contained little or no nuclear material.

“The facilities targeted today either contained no nuclear material or small quantities of natural or low-enriched uranium, meaning any radioactive contamination is limited to the buildings that were damaged or destroyed,” he said.

Britons in Israel have been told to book on the first Foreign Office charter flight to leave the region in the wake of the US bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities.

The Foreign Office launched a flight registration form for British nationals in Israel and the Palestinian occupied territories to log their details and interest in the flight. It has opened a booking portal and urged all UK nationals to register their presence now.

It said those with greatest need will be prioritised for flights. British nationals plus their non-British immediate family members travelling with them are eligible.

The Foreign Office said all passengers must hold a valid travel document. Non-British immediate family members will require valid visas or permission to enter the UK or remain that was granted for more than six months.

It said it would contact those who are allocated a seat on the flight directly and British Nationals should not make their way to the airport unless they are contacted.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “We are in active conversations about chartering aircraft to get people out. That's not possible at the minute from Israel, because airspace is, of course, closed.”

However, he said the Government aimed to get the first flight out in “hours, not days.”

The US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities were conducted in coordination with the Israeli military, the IDF's chief spokesman said.

During a televised briefing, Effie Defrin did not comment on how or the extent to which the two militaries worked together during the strikes.

 

Most of the highly enriched uranium at the Fordow nuclear facility was moved ahead of the attack, according to a senior Iranian official.

Reuters, citing the official, said the materials in recent days were moved to an undisclosed location in anticipation of an attack on the underground facility.

Personnel numbers were also reduced at the site, the source said.

Satellite images from Fordow on Friday and Saturday showed queues of trucks lining up at the site.

Iran's foreign minister is heading to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin tomorrow in the wake of US strikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities.

Calling Russia a “friend of Iran,” Abbas Araghchi warned that Iran “reserves all options to defend its security, its interests, its people...All options are on the table.”

Mr Araghchi said he will speak to Iran's key ally on how to proceed. “We always consult with each other,” he added in a press conference in Istanbul. 

His visit to Russia will raise significant concerns over what kind of support Moscow is willing to offer Tehran at this moment, which could include sending defence materials, getting involved directly militarily or throwing diplomatic weight behind Iran.

Overnight, Donald Trump deployed B-2 bombers to strike Iran's three principal nuclear sites, in what he called a “very successful attack” that “obliterated” Tehran's uranium enrichment sites.

The world is bracing for Iran's pledged retaliation. Mr Araghchi earlier said there would be “everlasting consequences” for the US strikes.

“We have to respond based on our legitimate right to defend ourselves,” Iran's foreign minister has just said in the wake of the US strikes.

Abbas Araghchi, speaking at a press conference, said diplomacy was no longer an option “in this case”.

He said Iran's response is “necessary”. “It was not Iran but the US who betrayed diplomacy and betrayed negotiations,” he argued.

“There is no red line that they have not crossed and the most dangerous one was last night, they crossed a very big red line by attacking nuclear facilities,” Mr Araghchi said. “It was the rule of law and international law that was bombed last night.”

Iran's foreign minister says the US is “fully responsible” for the consequences of its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Speaking in Istanbul, Abbas Araghchi said that Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran had not only “betrayed” Tehran, but deceived his own nation.

He said attacking a nuclear facility is an “unforgivable violation” of international law and once again emphasised that Iran “reserves all options to defend its security”.

Iran's missile barrage early this morning wounded at least 86 people, including children.

Several buildings were heavily damaged in the Ramat Aviv area in Tel Aviv, with holes torn in the facades of apartment blocks.

“Houses here were hit very, very badly,” Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai told reporters at the scene. “The damage is very, very extensive, but in terms of human life, we are okay.”

Other missiles hit Haifa in the north and Ness Ziona, south of Tel Aviv, where rubble littered the roads and whole streets had their windows blown out.

The Israeli military announced that it had recovered the bodies of three hostages in Gaza more than 20 months after they were abducted by Hamas militants.

“In a special operation... the bodies of the hostages Ofra Keidar, Yonatan Samerano, and Staff Sergeant Shay Levinson were recovered from the Gaza Strip yesterday,” the military said in a statement.

Ms Keidar, 71, Mr Samerano, 22, and Mr Levinson, 19, were all killed during Hamas's attacks on southern Israel in Oct 7, 2023 and their bodies were taken to Gaza.

Ahead of Donald Trump's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, his defence chiefs would have war-gamed possible retaliation.

Washington has put its 40,000 troops deployed in the Middle East, including in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, on high alert amid escalating tensions.

Now that America has attacked key Iranian nuclear sites with what is reported to be six bunker buster munitions, US defence chiefs will be bracing for a response.

US officials told the New York Times that the strikes against the three nuclear sites were complete and that no follow-up attacks were expected. However, commanders were ready to respond if Iran did choose to retaliate.

Here are the top threats the US must consider: missiles attacks on US bases, capacity to defend, Iran's regional proxies, the possible shutting down of the Strait of Hormuz, strikes on oil infrastructure in the Gulf and large-scale cyber attacks.

The international nuclear watchdog has said it is convening an emergency meeting tomorrow.

Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the decision was taken “in light of the urgent situation in Iran”.

There are nuclear safety fears following the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, however the IARA has reported no increased radiation levels on Sunday.

“Now Khamenei must go,” the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran has urged.

“Khamenei is responsible for an unpatriotic project that, in addition to costing countless lives, has cost the Iranian people at least two trillion dollars—and now, it has all gone up in smoke,” Maryam Rajavi wrote in a statement.

“No to appeasement, no to war—yes to regime change,” she added. The NCRI, founded in 1981, is a broad coalition of Iranian organisations and individuals which aim to establish a democratic republic of Iran.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, sought to reassure Britons caught up in the Iranian conflict that the Government was “making extensive preparations for all eventualities.”

Speaking on Sky News, he suggested Iran's failure to take up a diplomatic solution was to blame for the US bombing.

“We support the prevention of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. We had proposed a diplomatic course of action, as other European countries had done. The Iranians had rejected that,” he said.

“I know people will be waking up this morning, and they'll be worried. They'll want to know what this means, and I do want to give them reassurance that whilst the British government the UK, has not been involved in these attacks, we have been making extensive preparations for all eventualities.”

He said this included “how we look after British nationals in the region and how we get them out, and the assets we have in the region to protect British infrastructure, British bases British personnel if we need to do that.”

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has backed Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran.

He said: “Reform UK stands behind the military actions of the USA overnight.”Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, the future of Israel depends on it.”

Reform UK stands behind the military actions of the USA overnight. Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, the future of Israel depends on it.

The Telegraph understands that the UK was not involved in the US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities and that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was told of the strike plans in advance.

At least 16 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles at the country following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said in a statement that it had “evacuated 16 people to hospital, including a 30-year-old man in moderate condition.”

Iran's foreign ministry has also issued a statement condemning the US strikes and vowing to defend Iran “by all force and means”.

“The war-mongering and lawless regime of the United States of America is held fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far-reaching implications of this egregious act of aggression and heinous crime,” it said.

The statement also called on the UN Security Council to convene an emergency session and for other international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, to “take urgent and decisive action”.

“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement said.

Sir Keir Starmer has responding to the US strikes against Iran, saying the move helped alleviated the threat of Iran building a nuclear weapon.

“Iran's nuclear programme is a grave threat to international security. Iran can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and the US has taken action to alleviate that threat,” the Prime Minister said in a statement on Sunday.“The situation in the Middle East remains volatile and stability in the region is a priority. We call on Iran to return to the negotiating table and reach a diplomatic solution to end this crisis.”

An Iranian parliament member from central Qom, where the Fordow nuclear site is, located, has downplayed damage to the facility and threatened retaliation against US forces.

Qasem Ravanbakhs said: “The damage inflicted on Fordow facilities is not to the extent that American media and the criminal Trump claim.”

He added:“Trump should order mass production from coffin-making companies as soon as possible to transfer the bodies of American military personnel stationed in the region.” 

The Israeli military said it launched a fresh series of strikes this morning targeting military sites including missile launchers in western Iran.

The air force began “a series of strikes toward military targets in western Iran”, a military statement said, adding it had “struck missile launchers ready to launch toward Israeli territory, soldiers in the Iranian Armed Forces, and swiftly neutralised the launchers that launched missiles toward Israeli territory a short while ago”.

Donald Trump was elected on a promise to avoid foreign wars and international entanglements.

On Saturday night, he sent B-2 bombers into action to obliterate what was left of Iran's nuclear programme, using the sort of deep-penetrating weapons that Israel lacks.

Insiders said this was not a departure from his campaign pledge but a reminder that American power is based on the idea of “peace through strength”.

He is still a leader who puts deals ahead of military action, said one former official speaking before the strikes, but one who recognises that the best deals come when adversaries are negotiating from a weakened position.

He had sent a signal of his intent on Thursday.

“Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” was the quote read by Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary.

In fact, there was no window or deadline.

The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that it has not detected an increase in radiation levels after the US bombed three key nuclear sites.

At least 11 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said in a statement that “11 people were taken to hospital, including one in moderate condition - a 30-year-old man wounded in the upper body by shrapnel.”

Public broadcaster KAN 11 showed images of a devastated building surrounded by mounds of rubble that it said was in central Israel.

Iran's state TV announced this morning that it launched 30 missiles against Israel after the US, its closest ally, bombed several Iranian nuclear sites.

“These live images you are seeing are of a new salvo of Iranian missiles fired on the occupied territories,” said a presenter on air, referring to Israel. Citing “sources”, a presenter said that “30 missiles have been launched at Israel from Iran”.

Benny Gantz, Israel's former defence minister, praised the US for what he called a “historic decision” to make “the world, the Middle East and Israel safer places”.

“I wish to convey to President Trump and the American people my profound appreciation for their leadership, determination and their clear stand with Israel throughout this campaign and tonight particularly against the Iranian regime,” he said.

In breaking news, Iran has reportedly launched ballistic missiles targeting central and northern Israel.

Explosions have been heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Sirens are sounding and everyone is urged to take shelter immediately. 

Medics and security forces are at the scene. No injuries have been reported yet.

These are the first missiles launched in over a day and the first since the US strikes against Iran.

Hamas has issued a statement condemning “in the strongest terms” the US attacks against Iran, according to the Palestine-based Quds Press Agency.

The statement called the strikes a “flagrant violation of international law” and “a direct threat to international peace and security”.

The group also said that it has “complete confidence in Iran's ability to defend its sovereignty and the interests of its people, and to confront this aggression”.

Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has become the highest level Iranian official to speak out following the US strikes, saying that his country “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people”.   

He said that the US had “committed a grave violation of the UN Charter, international law and the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation] by attacking Iran's peaceful nuclear installations”.

“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences. Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior,” he added.

The Israel Airports Authority announced that the country had closed its airspace as an apparent precautionary measure until further notice.

The authority said that “the airspace of the State of Israel is closed to entry and exit due to recent developments”, but the land crossing with Egypt and Jordan are “operating normally”.

The Israeli Defense Force also announced that it shot down two drones from Iran a short while ago. The drones had triggered sirens in Israel's southern Arava region. 

Another drone was also intercepted around midnight over Golan Heights in the northern part of the country.

Drones take many hours to travel so these were likely sent before the US launched strikes against Iran.

Gideon Saar, Israel's foreign minister, has commended President Trump and said that he “wrote his name in letters of gold in the history books” after the US strikes against Iran.

Mr Saar also complimented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's “extraordinary leadership” in initiating the attack against Iran last week.

The B-2 bombers which struck Iran's nuclear sites flew non-stop for roughly 37 hours from their base in Missouri, a US official told The New York Times. They refuelled several times in mid-air en route to Iran.

There is “no danger” to Iranians living near the Fordow nuclear facility, Iranian authorities have said. 

The Crisis Management Headquarters in the province of Qom, where the enrichment plant is located, said in a statement that “there is no danger to the people of Qom and the surrounding area,” according to Iran's official news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has yet to make a statement on the attacks.

The state-run Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran previously said the strikes were a “barbaric act that violated international law, especially the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty”.

Earlier, another Iranian official previously said that the Fordow had “long been evacuated and has not suffered any irreversible damage”.

Saudi Arabia's Nuclear and Radiological Regulatory Commission has also issued a statement saying that “no radioactive effects were detected in the Gulf states”.

Law enforcement is on the alert for any attacks by Iran on US soil following a series of airstrikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities.

The Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and other agencies are keeping a close eye for potential threats, an official told CNN, following warnings of Iran-backed terror cells operating in the US.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said in a social media post on Saturday: “We will work unceasingly to protect the American homeland.”

Mitch McConnell, the former Republican Senate leader and a regular critic of Donald Trump, praised the US president's decision to strike Iran.

“Seizing this opportunity is not an escalation toward war - it is a prudent response to the warmongers in Tehran,” he said.

“Iran would be foolish to misunderstand American resolve.”

Donald Trump didn't even bother to conceal his contempt of Tulsi Gabbard's assessment of Iran's nuclear ambitions.

“She's wrong,” the US president said on Friday, speaking to media en route to his Bedminster golf course in New Jersey.

Mr Trump has assembled an unusual team for his White House and Cabinet, drawing on close loyalists, Fox News presenters and veterans of Capitol Hill.

But with tensions boiling over in the Middle East he has made the unusual move of sidelining two key national security figures, relying instead on old friends and military insiders.

It means Ms Gabbard, the national intelligence director, and Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, both surprise picks who had impressed Mr Trump with lively performances on Fox News – have found themselves on the outside of discussions.

Read the full story on how Mr Hegseth and Ms Gabbard found themselves outside Mr Trump's inner circle here.

Donald Trump has said Iranian retaliation will be met with “far greater” force.

Following US strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: “ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.”

António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, said that he is “gravely alarmed by the use of force by the United States against Iran today” and that the attack was a “dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge”.

“There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control – with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region, and the world,” he said.

He called on UN member states to de-escalate and “avoid a spiral of chaos”.

Bernie Sanders announced the news of Donald Trump's strikes on Iran live at a political rally.

Mr Sanders shared footage of his Oklahoma rally on X from the moment the news of the attacks on three nuclear facilities broke.

I learned about Trump's unconstitutional attack on Iran at a large rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here is the response: pic.twitter.com/eziVpp3Y54

Speaking on stage, Mr Sanders said: “This is a statement from Donald Trump...We have completed a very successful attack on three nuclear sites in Iran etc.”

Furious rally-goers then began chanting: “No more war.”

The Left-wing Democrat senator described the strikes as “alarming” and “grossly unconstitutional”.

Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi's political bureau, said that “Washington must bear the consequences,” in a short post on social media.

The Houthis are a close ally of Iran and have helped launch attacks against Israel since 2023. Two days after Israel first attacked Iran, the group announced that it had responded by firing several ballistic missiles at Israel.

Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management System detected abnormal thermal activity near the Fordow facility this evening.

Satellites captured the heat-generating activity around 6:59pm and 7:24pm EST – the last reported approximately 30 minutes before Donald Trump announced the strikes on social media.

This type of activity can be caused by natural events like wildfires or by a bomb.

The White House has released photos from the Situation Room as the attack on Iran unfolded.

Donald Trump, wearing a red Maga cap, appears at the head of the table, flanked by Marco Rubio and JD Vance. 

Donald Trump confirmed that B2 bombers, one of the US' top aircraft, were used in the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.

The four-engine B2, which is flown by a two-person crew, can carry conventional or nuclear weapons and has a payload of 40,000 pounds.

According to the New York Times the B2 bombers dropped at least six 30,000-pound bunker busters on Fordow, citing an anonymous US official.

The same official also said that submarines fired 30 TLAM cruise missiles at the Natanz and Isfahan facilities.

The US Air Force only has 20 B2s in its arsenal, but in 2021, the aircraft were flown to Afghanistan and more recently they were deployed to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen.

“If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes,” Donald Trump says.

The president adds a press conference with take place with Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, and Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, at 8am EDT on Sunday.

Donald Trump has threatened to launch further strikes on Iran if it does not immediately make peace.

“Future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier,” the US president said in an address to the nation following the US attack on three of the country's nuclear sites.

He added: “There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days. Remember there are many targets left.”

Earlier, Mr Trump said the US had attacked Iran's enrichment sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.

He called the attacks a “spectacular success” and said Iran's nuclear programme had been “completely and totally obliterated”.

Donald Trump says Iran “must now make peace”.

If they do not, “future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier,” he says,

“A short time ago, the US military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime,” Donald Trump says.

The US president continues: “The strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”

Donald Trump is flanked by JD Vance, his vice president, Marco Rubio, secretary of state, and Pete Hegseth, defence secretary, as he starts his speech, warning Iran of more strikes if it does not make peace. 

In his first statement since the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated President Trump for the US' “awesome and righteous might” and said that the strikes would “change history”.

He called Israel's alliance with the US “unshakeable” and said that in bombing Iran's nuclear facilities, “America has been truly unsurpassed”.

“It has done what no other country on earth could do. History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world's most dangerous regime, the world's most weapons,” Mr Netanyahu said.

He also praised Trump's leadership as a “pivot of history” that can “lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace”.

“President Trump and I often say peace through strength. First comes strength, then comes peace and tonight President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength,” Mr Netanyahu said.

Steve Bannon has said the US' strikes in Iran tonight are “probably the biggest and boldest” move of Donald Trump's presidency.

Mr Bannon, a key voice in Mr Trump's Maga movement and a former White House chief strategist, said he doubled the US president would want to get entangled in a protracted conflict in the Middle East.

“We have now become a combatant in this war between Israel and the Persians. I guess you say it's now a broader war, although it looks like the president is trying to keep this to a very tactical strike,” he said on his “War Room” podcast.

In the US, “an overwhelming majority of the people don't want to get involved in any of this,” he said, adding: “Now, we're involved.”

Mr Bannon, who has been sceptical about the US intervening in the conflict between Israel and Iran, met Mr Trump for lunch at the White House on Thursday. The same day, the president said he would make a decision on whether to strike Iran within two weeks.

Democrat firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran is “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment”.

The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.

In a post the politician, known as AOC, said: “The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorisation is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.

“He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.

“It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.”

Donald Trump just spoke to Reuters by phone and threatened more strikes.

He said: “They should make peace immediately. They should stop immediately. Otherwise they'll get hit again. They should make peace immediately or they'll get hit again.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congresswoman, sent a reminder of Mr Trump's political jeopardy while US planes were still in Iranian airspace.

”Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” she posted before the president announced strikes. 

She added: “This is not our war.”

Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war.There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.Israel is a nuclear armed nation.This is not our fight.Peace is…

She changed her tune after Mr Trump's announcement, but she also raised fears about attacks on American soil

”Let us join together and pray for the safety of our US troops and Americans in the Middle East,” she wrote on social media.

“Let us pray that we are not attacked by terrorists on our homeland after our border was open for the past 4 years and over 2 million gotaways came in.”

Iranian state television has allegedly said that every American citizen and military personnel in the region is now a target.

Unverified footage shared on social media shows a Iranian state news television presenter with a graphic behind him of the Middle East, where red flags appear to mark possible military targets.

Addressing Donald Trump directly, the presenter allegedly said: “You started it, and we will end it,” according to unverified translations of his remarks.

The US dropped six “bunker-busting bombs”, otherwise known as GBU-47s, on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, according to Fox News.

The weapons, each of which weighs 15 tons, were carried by American B-2 stealth bombers, which were deployed to the Middle East earlier today.

John Thune, the Republican leader in the Senate, said Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran has put the country's efforts to build a nuclear weapon “out of reach”.

“The regime in Iran, which has committed itself to bringing ‘death to America' and wiping Israel off the map, has rejected all diplomatic pathways to peace. The mullahs' misguided pursuit of nuclear weapons must be stopped,” Mr Thune said in a statement.

“As we take action tonight to ensure a nuclear weapon remains out of reach for Iran, I stand with President Trump and pray for the American troops and personnel in harm's way.”

After Donald Trump approved an operation to strike Iran, US defence chiefs will now be bracing for Iranian retaliation.

The US has in recent days repositioned aircraft carriers to the Middle East in what defence secretary Pete Hegseth called a “defensively postured” manoeuvre.

The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz was redirected to the region, while USS Gerald R Ford and the USS Carl Vinson may also work as back up to deter a response from Tehran.

Any military response from the Islamic Republic is likely to come in the form of strikes through its proxies in Yemen, where Houthis have already said that the strikes represent the “beginning” of a war.

Iran also has the means to effectively shut down access to the Straits of Hormuz, tucked between the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf's western flank, potentially crippling shipping through the region, as there are no alternative routes.

Nothing hurts a government more than the price of oil, and this narrow stretch of water between Oman and Iran is vital in the global supply.

A host on Iran's state TV news declared following the US air strikes: “Mr Trump, you started it, and we will end it.”

The broadcaster displayed a graphic of US bases in the Middle East which are said to be within firing range of Iran.

A US official has said American forces in the region are prepared for a retaliation by Iran and are not planning further strikes.

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, reportedly spoke following US air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The US also alerted Israel before launching the attacks.

John Fetterman, the Democrat senator, has said US air strikes were the “correct move”.

Me Fetterman, a staunch support of Israel, said in a post on X: “As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS [Donald Trump].

“Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities.

“I'm grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.”

Iranian media has claimed the strikes struck by the US do not contain nuclear material.

“There are no materials in these three nuclear sites that cause radiation,” IRNA, the Iranian state-affiliated media channel said, quoting an official.

Iranian authorities appear to be suggesting they removed enriched uranium from the facilities in advance of the bombing raid.

Donald Trump is not planning additional US strikes on Iran and is hopeful today's attack will see Tehran return to the negotiating table, sources told US media.

Mr Trump apparently came to believe in recent days that US intervention would be needed to take out Iran's nuclear facilities.

Despite the president's hope for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, American forces in the Middle East are said to be prepared for retaliation by Iran.

The Houthis have called US strikes on Iran the “beginning of war”.

Mohamed al-Farah, a member of the Yemeni group, told Al Jazeera that Mr Trump's decision will not be the end of the conflict.

“Destroying a nuclear facility here and there is not the end of the war, but it's the beginning,” he said in a statement. “The time of hit and run is gone.”

It comes after the Houthis threatened to attack US ships in the Red Sea if America joined the conflict, in breach of a recent ceasefire agreement.

When Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, read the president's words on Iran on Thursday it seems like much of the world may have come away with the wrong message.

“Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” was the actual quote.

But headlines around the world suggested that Mr Trump had just announced a 14-day window for Iran to come to the table, glossing over the fact that his actual words suggested a decision could still be made sooner than that. There was no two-week deadline.

Concerned officials in the West Wing quietly started briefing out that anything could still happen any time.

Mr Trump himself clarified the position on Friday when asked when he might take action: “I'm giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum.”

Saturday night's events show how true that was.

Mike Johnson, the US House speaker, has said that the US's strikes against Iran serve “as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that president Trump means what he says”.

“The president gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,” Mr Johnson wrote on X.

He added that the decision to launch an attack on Iran was “America First policy in action”, seeking to quell dissent among isolationists within Mr Trump's Maga base.

Donald Trump will meet with his National Security Council tomorrow, CNN reported.

In a post on X, the network's chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins said: “President Trump returns to the White House tomorrow and has a national security meeting on his schedule at 6pm in the Oval Office.”

The US may send B-2 stealth bombers back to Iran if the Fordow nuclear site remains in action, according to reports.

White House sources told Andrew Neil, the former editor of The Sunday Times, that the stealth jets “will be back” if the bunker buster munitions have not destroyed Iran's nuclear bunkers.

“Getting indications from the White House that if the bomb assessment damage concludes the bunker busters have not quite done their job in Iran then the B2's will be back, especially to hit Fordow again,” Mr Beil wrote on X.

Iran has not launched any missile attacks on Israel so far tonight, marking a rare quiet period since hostilities first broke out a week ago. 

Simone Ledeen, the former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East in Mr Trump's first administration, said: “It's a really powerful message to China and Russia and whoever else thinks that the US has gone weak and that Trump is just about making deals.”

She also pointed out that Mr Trump had not given Iran 14 days of breathing space. He had said he would make his decision “within two weeks.”

“Obviously people could read into that that he was saying there was more time than there was. But the reality is that he already given Iran 60 days to reach a deal. And he clearly meant it,” she said.

Democrats and Republicans have been left divided over Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran.

Dan Crenshaw, a Republican congressman, posted on X: “support the president.”

He added that it is “wrong” to think a US attack will lead to soldiers deploying.

The president's decision was also supported by John Fetterman, a Democratic senator, who said “Iran is the world leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities”.

Meanwhile, Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who is tipped as a future leader of the party, called for Congress call a vote to “prevent America To another endless Middle East war”.

Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defence minister, has said Donald Trump took a “bold decision”.

In a post on X he said: “President Trump took a bold decision for the United States, for Israel, for all of humanity.

“The world is now a safer place.”

Mr Trump had spent Friday night and much of Saturday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

But in a sign of a fast developing situation, he flew back to the White House just before 10pm UK time (5pm EST) .

He didn't speak to his travelling press pool at any point.

He then went directly to the West Wing where he was meeting with his top security officials.

His announcement that strikes had been conducted arrived three hours later.

Gabriel Noronha, a state department Iran adviser during Mr Trump's first term, said the president had gone way beyond simply focusing on the key site of Fordow.

“I think what Trump is doing by hitting three sites is he's going all in,” he told the Telegraph.

“It's not just a pin prick, but he is saying... he is putting the finishing blow to the Iran nuclear program, and he is owning that, and he is embracing that, and he's going to want the credit for that as well, and he deserves it.”

Donald Trump will address the nation at 3am UK time (10pm EST) after the US launched strikes on Iran.

The Fordow plant, 20 miles from the central city of Qom, is considered so naturally protected that there is just one weapon in the world able to blow it up.

The US's 30,000lb GBU-57F/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or “Mop”, can penetrate around 60 metres underground before exploding.

With weapons-grade uranium suspected of being manufactured at the site and hazardous raw materials, experts warned a strike could have severe effects.

The Mop is thought to be able to penetrate through 61 metres of concrete and is considered the only weapon able to directly threaten the site itself.

It can only be dropped by a B2 stealth bomber, which can carry two at a time. The bomb is designed to penetrate and detonate at the maximum possible depth to neutralise interred threats such as bunkers.

Donald Trump has reposted the message “Fordow is gone” on his site Truth Social.

He shared a post from a page called Open Source Intel that said: “Fordow is gone.”

The US president earlier said America had completed “our very successful strikes” on three nuclear bases.

Mr Trump said Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan had been hit.

The decision to bomb Iran comes after the US moved four B-2 stealth jets to its military base in Guam on Saturday morning.

The B-2 is designed for long-range missions and is the only aircraft capable of delivering the 30,000-lb “Massive Ordnance Penetrator” (Mop) precision-guided bunker busters that could be used to destroy Iran's underground nuclear plant at Fordow.

It is not yet clear which munitions the US has used to strike Iran's three nuclear sites.

Iran has pledged to retaliate if it joined the Israeli assault and the US has already begun removing key personnel from Embassy in anticipation of a strike.

Aside from the threat from Iran, the conflict is incredibly risky for the president, who won the White House on the promise of keeping America out of costly foreign conflicts and scoffed at the value of American interventionism.

 

Trump's decision to enter the conflict comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran.

The strikes have moved to systematically eradicate the country's air defences and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. 

US and Israeli officials have maintained that American stealth bombers and a 30,000-lb. bunker buster bomb  offered the best chance of destroying heavily-fortified sites connect Ed to the Iranian nuclear program buried deep underground.

Donald Trump said the US has completed a “very successful” attack on Friday.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said the Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites were targeted.

“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and [Isfahan],” he wrote.

“All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home.

“Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

The US has launched strikes on Iran, bombing three of its nuclear sites, Donald Trump has announced.

Donald Trump has appeared to agitate for new leadership in Iran.

The US president on Sunday suggested a “regime change” would take place if its leaders were “unable to make Iran great again”.

His comments came just hours after JD Vance, the vice-president, and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, stressed that Washington was not seeking to topple the Iranian government following US air strikes on its nuclear facilities this weekend.

“It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change', but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change?” Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

In reference to his Maga (Make America Great Again) movement, he added: “MIGA!!!”

Since striking Iran in the early hours of Sunday, Mr Trump has pressed the country not to retaliate and urged it to return to the negotiating table immediately.

At a press conference at the Pentagon on Sunday morning, Mr Hegseth declared: “This mission was not, has not been, about regime change.”

Mr Vance said a short time later: “We don't want a regime change. We do not want to protract this.”

He added: “We want to end the nuclear program, and then we want to talk to the Iranians about a long-term settlement here.”

The following day, Mr Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that his post about “regime change” was “just raising a good question.”  

She said: “The Iranian people can control their own destiny.

“If the Iranian regime refuses to come to a peaceful and diplomatic solution why shouldn't the Iranian people take away the power of this incredibly violent regime that has been suppressing them for decades?”

Senior US officials have warned that forcing out Iran's government would leave a power vacuum and result in another protracted American war in the Middle East.

Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the UN, said on Sunday that Israel would like to see regime change in Iran but would not seek to engineer it.

“That's for the Iranian people to decide, not us,” he said.

John Bolton, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, claimed on Sunday that Iran was “on the verge” of regime change following the US attacks and said the president would be forced to use “brutal force” if Tehran retaliated.

Mr Trump previously vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, American officials revealed last week.

In the early hours of Sunday, the US launched strikes on Iran, hitting three nuclear bases at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Mr Trump described the action as “a spectacular military success” that had “completely and totally obliterated” Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities.

He said in an earlier Truth Social post: “We had a spectacular military success yesterday, taking the ‘bomb' right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could!) but, as usual, and despite all of the praise and accolades received, this ‘lightweight' Congressman is against what was so brilliantly achieved last night.”

Israeli officials on Sunday said they believe Iran's heavily-fortified nuclear site at Fordow sustained serious damage from the strikes but had not been completely destroyed. A US official told The New York Times it had been taken “off the table”.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, issued a more conservative assessment than the president on Sunday.

He said Iran's nuclear capabilities had been “degraded” and “set back from a technical standpoint”, but stopped short of saying they had been outright destroyed.

On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, claimed Israel was “close” to wiping out Iran's nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.

He vowed not to be dragged into a “war of attrition with Iran”, saying: “When we achieve our objectives, the fighting will stop.”

Abortion rights supporters say that it would protect telehealth providers as states increase efforts to target them.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

This article was originally published at The 19th.

Out-of-state doctors are pushing for laws that will make it harder to detect who prescribes and sends abortion medication, as anti-abortion lawmakers look for ways to stop the flow of pills to their states. 

Patients have continued to receive abortion pills in states with near-total bans, so much so that the number of abortions has actually increased since the fall of Roe v. Wade, despite near-total abortion bans. This is mostly thanks to “shield laws.” Working from states like New York, California and Massachusetts, providers meet virtually with pregnant patients in states with bans and write them abortion pill prescriptions. Patients receive the pills in the mail to take from home. One in 5 abortions are now done through telehealth, according to the Society of Family Planning, and about half of those are for people getting care because of shield laws. 

Now, doctors are working to anonymize that process by pushing to hide the name of the prescriber from the labels of mifepristone and misoprostol — the two drugs used in medication abortions. The effort marks a new step in the escalating battle between states over whether and how people in America can get abortions — and to what extent individual states' laws can influence medical care coming from another.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“We are seeing two very different worlds right now in the United States in terms of the directions of laws and policies,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who provides telehealth abortions from Massachusetts to people in states with bans. “Shield law states are doing more to not only protect reproductive rights within their own state, but to protect avenues for all abortion seekers in the country to be able to get safe and legal care.”

Typically, prescription bottles include information such as the name of the doctor who prescribed medication, details about the medication and appropriate dosage, and the name of the patient receiving medication. But that information has become invaluable in civil and criminal cases filed by anti-abortion law enforcement officers.

A handful of states — New York, Maine, Vermont and Washington — have already passed laws to remove prescriber names from abortion pill bottles. Proposed legislation in Massachusetts, currently working through the state Senate, would similarly allow this change, although at least one shield law practice in the state, Foster's Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, has already removed prescribing doctors' names from pill bottles citing guidance they received from the state attorney general. 

A proposal in California, the largest shield law state, would go a step further. The bill, currently making its way through the state Senate, would remove not only the name of the prescribing health care provider but also the patient receiving medication. Proponents say that could protect patients who are concerned about someone discovering they ordered abortion pills.

The legislative trend comes as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. Both Texas and Louisiana's attorneys general have pushed criminal and civil cases targeting Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician who allegedly prescribed abortion pills to patients in those states. The cases pose a first test of shield laws and are likely to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.

The Texas suit against Carpenter was filed after a pregnant woman in the state developed bleeding and went to the hospital, according to court filings from the state. The filings assert that the “biological father of the unborn child” found medications that appeared to be prescribed by Carpenter.

“If an abusive partner were to find a package of abortion pills in the trash can, if it says Dr. XYZ, already you have someone to name in a lawsuit,” said Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has advised state lawmakers on crafting shield laws. “If it doesn't have it, it's a critical piece of information. How do you know who prescribed the pills?”

Separately, legislators in Texas unsuccessfully sought to end telehealth prescriptions with a bill, which died in the legislature, that would have allowed anyone to sue people who prescribe or send abortion pills to Texans for at least $100,000. Louisiana lawmakers are poised to pass legislation that would create similar punishment structures, allowing the “biological father,” his parents, or the parents of the pregnant person to file civil suits against out-of-state abortion providers. 

Abortion rights supporters say that removing the doctor's name from a prescription label would add security for those who rely on shield laws but are nervous about heightened efforts to target providers, a concern that has only grown since this weekend's shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. News outlets have reported that the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, had a list of alleged targets in his car that included abortion providers.

“It goes a long way in ensuring that providers are protected at a time when we've seen increased violence and animus toward abortion providers and reproductive health providers generally,” said Lizzie Hinkley, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which worked to help pass such a bill in New York. “Anyone who has their name on a pill bottle will risk detection by hostile parties in states that have banned abortion.”

One California doctor who practices with telehealth practice A Safe Choice said he deliberately keeps a low profile. Only a few close friends know about his work providing abortions to people out-of-state. But through his organization, he hears almost once a week from other health care professionals who want to offer telehealth abortions to patients living under bans. He believes a bill like California's could encourage even more to do so.

“Allowing the provision of services without the providers needing to put their name on the prescription labels will add an additional layer of security and confidence for the providers,” said the doctor, who asked that his name be withheld because of the ongoing legal threats against abortion providers. “This is a very important next step.”

The California bill could have an outsized impact. Most shield law prescriptions are filled by California-based pharmacies. That includes those called in by doctors who are practicing in other states, such as New York, but who don't want to mail the pills themselves.

“There is no pharmacy in New York state that mails pills for us, so we have to rely on pharmacies in California,” said one physician in New York, who asked that her name be withheld because of the legal actions taken against Carpenter. “All the shield law providers across the country are waiting with bated breath for this bill to be passed.” 

New York has passed a law removing prescriber names from abortion medication labels created in the state, she said, but that hasn't affected her. Because she calls prescriptions into a pharmacy in California the labels are subject to the Golden State's laws — and as a result, her name is still listed on the bottle when she orders abortion pills for out-of-state patients. Her patients live in states all over the country.

“It's very stressful. I wish we could get California to move a bit faster,” she said.

The California bill has been approved by the state's lower chamber but is still awaiting Senate passage. It's faced little resistance and has received support from the state's attorney general and lieutenant governor. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has built a public profile in part through vocal support of abortion protections, has not weighed in, and his office said he does not comment on pending legislation.

Still, there are legal questions about bills like California's. Federal law requires that medication labels include the prescriber's name — a stipulation that some argue could conflict with and possibly override the state-level protection. 

But these questions haven't been raised regarding other similar laws. Some legal scholars argued that the federal statute is ambiguous, and that pharmacies could say the state law still satisfies federal requirement by including the name of a medical practice — as New York's and Maine's do — rather than of an individual prescribing doctor or nurse.

“If you have the address and the practice and you're able to easily identify where the prescription came from, that's the purpose of this rule,” said Rachel Rebouché, dean of the Temple University School of Law. “The issue is being able to, for safety reasons and for monitoring, understand that someone who has the authority to do this has done it. There's no question that putting the name of the practice does that.”

The blue-state push comes as abortion opponents have stepped up their efforts not only in individual states, but in their quest for national restrictions on mifepristone, calling for the federal government to prohibit dispensing it through telehealth. 

That campaign has included building a body of research that they say highlights its potential risks — which runs against mainstream medical findings and that some researchers have said rely on “junk science.” 

While President Donald Trump has remained quiet on abortion, members of his administration have suggested openness to curbing access to medication. This month, Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary committed to having his agency review mifepristone's approval, though it's not clear what that would ultimately mean. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he supports taking another look at the drug's safety. 

“In light of the situation at the FDA, it is urgent to ensure that California clinicians and pharmacists can prescribe and deliver mifepristone to the patients who rely on us,” Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a California-based doctor who also provides abortions in Kansas, said at a committee hearing for the state's bill. “This bill will allow us to continue to treat our patients even if politicians in Washington act against the science to further limit mifepristone.”

Walking through Providence, Rhode Island, it's hard to miss the flyers posted on storefronts, bulletin boards, and lamp posts rallying passersby with a defiant call to action: Let's Fight Trump's Fascism! Defend Our Communities! Build a Better World! Come to the Providence General Assembly.

For months, popular assemblies such as these — in Providence, Detroit, and Richmond, Virginia — have been diligently laying the groundwork for resisting Trump's agenda and building self-governance. In Providence, organizers with the General Assembly tabled at last weekend's No Kings demonstration, which drew thousands. Some members help operate a hotline for reporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sightings, a key part of deportation defense efforts that helps alert communities to raids, and makes large-scale, coordinated responses — like those in Los Angeles — more likely to materialize.

But what is a popular assembly, exactly? In Providence, assemblies have been held every other Saturday in a downtown Methodist church since November of last year. These gatherings offer a space for anti-fascist and progressive forces to coordinate, strategize, and make decisions together to build power that can be leveraged against the U.S. government. “We need regularly scheduled radically-democratic meetings to organize, coordinate, mobilize in active defense of our friends, neighbors, and loved ones,” the Providence General Assembly (PGA) writes in its mission statement, “and to fight to create the type of communities and world we want through our collective actions.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The assemblies are open to all. At a Providence assembly attended by Truthout in March, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming for newcomers. Attendees were greeted at the door by PGA organizers and directed to a table stocked with name tags, free masks, snacks, printed meeting agendas, and informational pamphlets. Community agreements — posted on the wall in both English and Spanish — encouraged participants to stay curious, open, and respectful, and to give and receive feedback with honesty and compassion.

To open the meeting, two facilitators welcomed the semicircle of about 75 people, guiding them through a preset agenda crafted by the Providence General Assembly's coordinating committee, a group open to anyone who's attended at least one gathering. Voices from across the room spoke up during the announcement period and open forum, with attendees raising hands to share updates, concerns, or reflections. Five working groups — Mutual Aid, Community Defense, Unhoused Solidarity, Class Struggle, and Anti-Imperialism — briefly summarized their recent efforts in report-backs. Mutual Aid was organizing a mental health free clinic, cooked free meals for the public every weekend, and was involved in starting a community garden at a local school. Anti-Imperialism was collaborating with Jewish Voice for Peace Rhode Island's campaign to divest from Israel bonds. Community Defense publicized the ICE Watch Defense Line and an upcoming demonstration at ICE headquarters. 

The meeting culminated with a proposal to organize a family-friendly May Day demonstration. Several members had brought forward this proposal through the PGA's formal decision-making process, which asks sponsors to submit proposals 24 hours in advance of the assembly and introduce them formally during the meeting, where it is then debated and discussed, and finally voted on. Proposals must win the support of at least two-thirds of assembly attendees to be adopted/passed.

A lively 20-minute discussion of the May Day demonstration followed, with time set aside for clarifying questions, suggested amendments, and objections. Some attendees weighed the benefits and drawbacks of securing a city permit, while others questioned the strategy of protesting in front of vacant buildings. One participant voiced concern about whether there was enough time to pull the event together. “We'll try our darndest!” a sponsor responded with a grin. Another sponsor invoked the memory of Providence's 2006 May Day demonstration, which had drawn hundreds of immigrant workers into the streets. They noted that the PGA was the most broad-based, nonsectarian organizing space seen in Providence in years. In the end, with no major objections and energy high in the room, the proposal passed easily — clearing the required two-thirds majority and sparking a round of applause and celebratory cheers.

Similar people's assemblies that have taken root in cities like Detroit, Michigan, and Richmond, Virginia, signal the rise of a national movement for self-governance in response to growing authoritarianism in the United States. 

Hundreds joined the first People's Assembly in Detroit on January 26, rallying around one clear and urgent goal. “We have a solid stance against ICE, that is the bottom line,” said Ame, a Detroit-based organizer who helped launch the initiative and withheld their last name because of privacy concerns. To put this stance into action, the assembly formed several working groups to support immigrant Detroiters in different ways.

The mutual aid group operates a hotline connecting residents with legal and material support, and offers weekly immigration office hours to provide legal education and assist with paperwork.

The political education group organizes events and actions, including know your rights training and public demonstrations.

Meanwhile, a third working group called Migra Watch patrols local neighborhoods and attends court hearings, monitoring ICE activity on the ground. When they witness an arrest, they try to collect the individuals' contact information in order to alert their families and help secure legal support.

“We want to make sure that ICE and all the agencies working with them know they're not welcome here,” Ame said. “We're not going to allow people to just be kidnapped and taken away, to have our communities ripped apart and destroyed.”

Most recently, the People's Assembly in Detroit has begun training local businesses on how to respond to ICE raids. On June 11, assembly organizers rallied outside of the McNamara Federal Building in downtown Detroit after several asylum seekers were detained following their court hearings due to expanded “expedited removal” policies. On June 8, assembly organizers attended a Detroit Public School's Community District Board meeting to demand that the board take a stand in support of Maykol, a student who was detained by ICE. “Maykol was 3.5 credits away from graduating,” said Ame. “The board made the statement, but he still got detained so we've been fundraising, noticing that people who have lawyers are less likely to get deported.”

Assemblies in Richmond have conducted visualizations and thought experiments about what large-scale self-governance could look like.

Across the board, the assemblies are committed to building people's power beyond the confines of the electoral system. A spokesperson for the Richmond People's Assembly, who goes by the moniker Ezra, explained that while voting and electoral strategies can sometimes lead to short-term improvements, they ultimately disempower communities by transferring power to officials who rarely bear the consequences of the policies they impose. The assembly hopes to return that decision-making power to the people who have to live with the outcomes of those decisions.

To pursue these goals, Richmond held its first citywide assembly on January 18, drawing a crowd of more than 500 people. During that initial gathering, a group of organizers introduced a proposal to create neighborhood-based assemblies. The proposal passed, and nine neighborhood assemblies have formed across the city in the months since. Since then, they've organized community CPR classes, “swap parties” with free clothing and other goods, community discussions with potlucks, block parties, and more.

“We wanted people to be able to address hyperlocal problems,” Ezra explained when asked about the neighborhood-based strategy. “We felt like we couldn't start at the citywide level without it just becoming an organization of organizers.” The goal is to engage residents who aren't already politically active — to avoid replicating the racial, class, and age conformity that can sometimes characterize grassroots organizing efforts. One neighborhood assembly is loosely connected to a squatted community garden that's drawn a diverse crowd — something Ezra sees as a meaningful step toward building broader solidarity. Still, they admitted that the strategy is a work in progress for the relatively short-lived experiment. “[The assemblies are] definitely still mostly folks who are already in organizing circles,” they said, “and that's something we're actively trying to push past.” 

Organizers with Detroit's assembly also promoted the strategy of supporting neighborhood assemblies in a piece they wrote for Left Voice, highlighting the need to support workers and community members at sites where ICE raids happen, like schools and hospitals (as opposed to solely forming “roaming squads” that may be disconnected from impacted communities). 

In Richmond, organizing efforts also extend beyond the neighborhood level by hosting quarterly city-wide gatherings, which offer workshops, informal socializing, and shared meals in addition to an assembly. “That flow of energy from a meeting setting into these more open forum workshops was really appealing to people,” Ezra reflected. “It's what helped folks stay engaged through what was nearly a 10-hour day.” 

At the heart of these gatherings is the assembly component, which links Richmond's nine neighborhood assemblies through a spokescouncil. Each neighborhood sends two spokespeople — not to make decisions on behalf of their group, but to communicate important information and report their group's interests to the wider assembly. This structure is designed to keep power decentralized by preventing a person or small group from wielding a disproportionate amount of influence over others. 

This spokescouncil model, Ezra explained, draws inspiration from international examples of direct democracy — most notably Rojava, a multiethnic, feminist movement involving more than 4 million people in North and East Syria. In Rojava, most neighborhoods host at least one “commune,” a form of popular assembly that functions as both a decision-making space and a hub for coordination. These communes manage society's core needs through dedicated committees for self-defense, food, water, education, electricity, heating oil, health, and garbage collection. Each commune is led by two co-presidents, one male and one female, who convene in regional assemblies. Similarly, every committee is represented by co-spokespeople who meet with their counterparts across the region, forming a federated structure of grassroots governance.

In Syria, years of grassroots organizing — door-knocking and deep conversations with neighbors about their shared struggles — helped build up social acceptance for revolutionary ideologies among the Kurdish population. So when many of Assad's forces withdrew from North and East Syria in 2012, amid the chaos of the Syrian Civil War, communities were ready to self-organize. Masses of people stepped in to fill the power vacuum to build a new, participatory form of governance. 

Without access to formal municipal power as in Rojava, assemblies in Richmond have conducted visualizations and thought experiments about what large-scale self-governance could look like. At the citywide gathering in April, the assembly used a recent water crisis in the city as a springboard for discussing current power structures in Richmond, and to imagine what it would take to build infrastructure capable of managing water for hundreds of thousands of people.

Turning such ambitious visions into reality requires scaling up our movements. For Ezra, the movement's ability to grow and generalize hinges on recognizing how organizational structures (or the lack of them) influence the quality and scope of our relationships. “People often say that this is relational work, and that is true, but it is only true so far as your relationships are in community, are in dialogue with structure,” they said. “There is a dialectic between relationship and structure that allows for organization. When we lean too far into either end, we will pigeonhole ourselves into either subcultural party scenes, or into a very rigid form of politics that never steps into the real world.” 

At a late-March assembly in Providence, participants similarly grappled with the dual challenge of building meaningful relationships while resisting the pull of subcultural insularity. A proposal to form a social committee for organizing and promoting nonpolitical events was ultimately voted down after a thoughtful and good-faith debate. While many assembly-goers agreed on the importance of building connections, they emphasized that relationships would develop organically within the working groups themselves and through shared struggle approached with sincerity, curiosity, and joy. 

That spirit came to life a month later during the May Day demonstration, when a crowd gathered together to gleefully thwack effigies of President Donald Trump and a Tesla Cybertruck. It was a collective and cathartic act symbolizing a vision shared by all three assemblies: the dismantling of oppressive systems and the creation of liberatory structures in their place, of a world where people live without the constant fear of displacement, deportation, and state violence

They are the authors of the forthcoming book Tomorrow Is Yesterday: Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel-Palestine.

 Hussein Agha and Robert Malley

To many outside the Middle East, the American and Israeli war with Iran reads like a linear narrative: the two allies' formidable militaries and intelligence agencies arrayed against their adversary, poised to prevail, on the cusp of indisputable, decisive triumph. The fight and its expected outcome are viewed through the prism of familiar antecedents: Hitler's Germany overwhelmed, defeated, willing to acquiesce to the victor's demands; Japan following suit. When proponents of this war speak of one side's surrender and of the other being on the right side of history, it is on such clear-cut notions of progress and finality that they rely. History, to them, advances in a straight line, swiftly heading to safe shores, and one had better choose the correct side or be left adrift.

To those who know the Middle East, such thoughts make little sense. They are hogwash.

The region has its own favored antecedents. As early as the 1970s, Jordan's crushing of Palestinian guerrillas prompted the emergence of the Black September organization and the Munich Olympic massacre of Israeli athletes. Israel invaded South Lebanon in 1982 and forced the Palestine Liberation Organization's exile to Tunisia. The result: the ascent of an energized Hezbollah and, in time, the movement of banished Palestinians closer to Israel, in Gaza and the West Bank. In the 1980s, Washington's support for Afghan mujahideen helped drive out Soviet forces. It also led to the rise of the Taliban and a generation of jihadist groups, including al-Qaeda, for whom Americans were the chief villains. After Washington's victory in the 1990-91 Gulf War, Osama bin Laden and his followers made the United States their primary target. After they carried out the 9/11 attacks, the George W. Bush administration invaded Afghanistan, routing the Taliban, and later toppled Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. Twenty years later, the Taliban returned to power. In Iraq, the Islamic State rose from the rubble, and pro-Iranian militias played a dominant role in the country.

When revolts broke out across the Middle East in 2010-11, Westerners embraced “the Arab Spring,” feted liberal activists, and hailed the spread of democracy. Darkness rapidly descended; the peaceful demonstrations and lofty values that inspired them became distant memories. The regime of Egypt's deposed president, Hosni Mubarak, eventually gave way to an even more brutal autocrat. The overthrow of Yemen's government hatched Houthi dominance; the fall of Libya's Muammar al-Qaddafi yielded bedlam, instability, and violence. Bashar al-Assad is gone yet Syria's fate is far from settled. History does not move forward. It slips sideways and lands in the most unexpected of places.

Israel may yet prevail in its war against Iran, just as it may in the Palestinian occupied territories, in Lebanon, and in Syria. It might emerge, triumphant, as the uncontested regional hegemon. Iran will appear a paper tiger; its non-state partners defeated or deflated; its nuclear program in shambles; its military a shadow of its former self. Israeli dreams of regime change may be unfulfilled, but chaos could reign. To all who saw Iran as a behemoth, were daunted by its deterrence and paralyzed by its threats, these are days of reckoning.

This could last for a while. The time lag between the immediate result and what happens as a result of that result may stretch: “Mission Accomplished” may go on for days, weeks, months, even years. Then what? It is tempting to read the immediate turn of events as the most pertinent. That is true only until the next. The story does not end. Force invites counterforce. Success generates reactions that yield its opposite. The closer Israel gets to total triumph, the closer it will be to complete uncertainty, to perils unleashed by pent-up humiliation, anger, and fury. That sort of victory is not a safe place.



For Israelis, the temptation to act was irresistible. They waited decades for the opportunity to take down their foes, immediate or remote, real or imagined. With all constraints gone, they believe themselves to be limited solely by what they can do—and they can do a lot. But the United States and European countries should know better. Jews did not forget their attachment to the Holy Land after 2,000 years of exile. Palestinians, Lebanese, and Iranians—those who still recall the seventh-century Battle of Karbala, which led to the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson Hussein—will not fail to remember the horrors that befell Gaza, the bombings of their cities, the massacres, the shame, the killings of their leaders, the West's duplicity, hypocrisy, and moral desolation. With memories so profound and vistas so far-reaching, much that is viewed as crucial today will be of little interest to the future.

The dangers that await may not be of the familiar sort. They could entail a revamping of Iran's “axis of resistance” no less thorough than the one Israel wreaked by force. Over the years, flush with a sense of power, Iran built up its conventional arsenal, believing it could deter and challenge Israel in an arena over which the Jewish state had long enjoyed mastery. Hezbollah and, following in its footsteps, Hamas erected quasi-states in Lebanon and Gaza, both with cumbersome civilian responsibilities and quasi-regular armies. The three saw these achievements as indices of potency, overlooked how vulnerable these feats had made them, how weakness sprang from apparent strength.

There is a reason why they initially embraced more mobile, elusive methods of guerrilla groups. Their power rested in asymmetry. When they deviated into trying to match their enemy, they went astray and lost the plot. They were exposed. In the days and years ahead, they may feel compelled to revert to older tactics. It may not be long before more Palestinians, Lebanese, Iranians, and others motivated by their cause—desperate, friends or family members wiped out, craving revenge, with darkness as their sole horizon—resort to unconventional forms of warfare, at times well planned, at others impromptu, today's more lethal and technologically adept versions of yesterday's hijacked planes and buses, hostage takings, and suicide attacks. Something new, different, more devastating, and at the same time a reversion to the past. Israeli achievements in technical intelligence, cyberattacks, pager detonations, precision killings, mass civilian carnage, and more, may point the way to methods that will be employed by all and sundry. Signs are visible already.

It takes time for history to reach its destination, and not before it sets out on many false trails. The years that lie ahead will not reflect tidy plans and rigorous policy prescriptions. They will be shaped by instinct and emotion, inspired by raw, deeply-rooted yearnings for historical redress and vengeance. This is not a world built by or for Americans. They will be at sea.

JOSEPH TORIGIAN is an Associate Professor in the School of International Service at American University and the author of The Party's Interests Come First: The Life of Xi Zhongxun, Father of Xi Jinping.

 Joseph Torigian

In 1980, Xi Zhongxun, a major Chinese Communist Party heavyweight and the father of the current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, visited one of the premier tourist attractions of central eastern Iowa: the Amana Colonies, a German heritage site founded on communitarian principles, now known for beer and crafts. The experience shook him. At 67 years old, Xi was leading a delegation of provincial governors to the United States. It was a historic moment in China's opening to Western business and investment. Xi, as leader of the southern province of Guangdong, was at the forefront of that process. Guangzhou, the provincial capital, had just seen the inauguration of the first U.S. consulate outside Beijing. Xi was also launching the Special Economic Zones—areas designed to attract foreign businesses—that would symbolize China's new relationship with the outside world.

The Americans at the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations who staffed the trip remembered Xi as a friendly and charismatic man, the kind of person who would make sure his translators had a glass of water. Yet he would sometimes go quiet as if he were preoccupied and could come across as reserved and distant.

That changed at the Amana Colonies. According to one person who was present, Xi was enthralled as he listened to the tour guide. His reaction was so strong that it seemed as if he “became a different guy,” according to a U.S. foreign service officer.

That change probably occurred because Xi saw in the heritage site a frightening possibility. Here was a community built on collectivist and utopian principles that had decided 88 years after its founding to disband. In other words, it was a story about how a communist society had reduced itself to a tourist destination.

At the time, a few years after the death of Mao Zedong, Xi and his comrades were worried that what they had built with all their sacrifices would not endure. From Xi's position as governor of Guangdong, it did not look good. Tens of thousands of people were fleeing the poverty of the communist mainland for capitalist Hong Kong. New economic ties with the outside world could help stem the tide and create prosperity, but fears of Western ideological infiltration were especially palpable in Guangdong because of its proximity to the British colony. Young people in Guangzhou were taking to the streets to demand that the party move faster in the new direction of “reform and opening.” And even though Mao's chaotic tenure had warned the party about the dangers of strongman rule and the explosiveness of succession politics, a new autocrat in Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, was using Machiavellian means to defeat Mao's initial successor, the more consensus-oriented Hua Guofeng.

Soon after his trip to the United States, Xi moved to work in Beijing to assume a weighty position in the Secretariat, the party's “brain.” It placed him at the very center of debates about how to save the revolution.

His son Xi Jinping has now inherited that mission. Inspired by his father, the son dreams of no less than breaking the cycles of dynastic collapse that have marked Chinese history for millennia. And he wants to achieve that through continuous “self-revolution,” a campaign that aims to keep the revolutionary spirit alive by calling on the Chinese people to continually study the lives of the founding generation.

In charting the party and the country's way forward, he is no doubt informed by his father's struggles through the convulsions that shook China in the twentieth century. A close examination of the life of Xi Zhongxun reveals the profound challenges that have marked party politics from the beginning, in particular in terms of the dilemmas posed by the role of ideology in Chinese political life and the party's plans for succession. They are dilemmas that can be managed, not problems to be solved. And they provide essential context for understanding what Xi Jinping is trying to achieve today and whether he will succeed in the future.

The elder Xi endured extraordinary suffering for the sake of the cause, at the hands of both Nationalist foes and the Communists themselves. His travails simultaneously reveal the dangers of taking ideology too seriously and not seriously enough. After his release from a Nationalist prison when he was 15 years old, Xi did not rekindle his enthusiasm for revolution by reading Karl Marx. As he later told his son, it was a novel, The Young Wanderer, by Jiang Guangci, that he found most inspiring. Its protagonist experiences one disaster after another and concludes that “the more pain that evil society brought me, the more powerfully did my resistance develop.”

Xi, then, was sensitive to the importance of cultural products for the communist cause. In 1952, he became minister of propaganda. He was tasked with educating a country of hundreds of millions of people about communism and why they should sacrifice to build it.

But ideology not only motivated Xi and helped him explain why the party deserved devotion. It also nearly got him killed. When the party persecuted him, which it did on numerous occasions, it was because differences of opinion were understood as manifestations of ideological heresy. That is why even though it was a novel that inspired Xi to stay with the revolution in 1928, it was yet another novel, Liu Zhidan, that got him purged in 1962. Mao concluded that Xi's decision to allow a woman cadre to write the book—a fictionalized narrative of a leading revolutionary from the Northwest—was a manifestation of “class struggle.” Xi was dispatched into the political wilderness for 16 years.

His fall foreshadowed one of the great tragedies of Chinese history: the Cultural Revolution. During those frenzied years in the 1960s and 1970s, authorities banished Xi from the capital and subjected him to solitary confinement and physical abuse. After Mao's death in 1976, leaders recognized that the Cultural Revolution was such a failure that the party would have to change in its aftermath. When Xi returned to work in Beijing in 1981, he faced a new question: how to maintain a sense of idealism and conviction when no one could explain what communism really was anymore, a reality that even Xi acknowledged.



Xi knew that achieving greater economic development would give the party the legitimacy it desperately needed. Yet he was also afraid of what might happen if that new economic model caused people to lose faith in the party's ideological commitments. He worried about how China would change with the arrival of Western investment, the introduction of market mechanisms, and the use of material inducements to encourage hard work. Xi wanted to give space to new voices that could justify the party's new economic direction, or even provide new ideas about how to achieve limited political reforms, but he was afraid of chaos and wanted the loudest critics to stop creating problems for him. There was always the risk that he could be associated with more strident calls for change and earn the ire of his superiors. It was a recipe for confusion and dysfunction. Throughout the 1980s, the party regularly launched crackdowns that raised fears of another Cultural Revolution and then rapidly pulled back when the campaigns threatened economic growth.

Finally, there were consequences for the party elite itself. In 1987, after student protests, Deng purged General Secretary Hu Yaobang from the leadership. The party accused Hu of “bourgeois liberalization.” Xi, his close associate, was said to have “gone even further” than Hu, according to Yang Shangkun, a Politburo member. Xi hated the charges. He knew that Hu never opposed Deng. The real problem was that balancing reform and opening with conservative principles had proved to be a near-impossible task. And Hu and Xi were blamed when the contradiction became too obvious to ignore.

Xi Jinping faces the same problem of balancing growth with ideology that his father did, but he has his own approach to solving it. The son clearly cares about economic development. Yet he is also preoccupied with instilling a sense of idealism and conviction in both the party and the rest of the Chinese population. He believes that the party should avoid the extremism of the Mao era but also needs to reinvigorate its members with a call to struggle and vigilance. He has tried to avoid the dramatic zigzags that marked the Deng period even as he has attempted to be flexible with limited course corrections.

The problem for him is that the “struggle” he demands of his people is an inherently ambiguous notion. Too much and too little are both dangerous. As the economy slows down, the challenge of meeting the material needs of China's population while pursuing strategic and ideological goals is likely to get worse. Xi Jinping's “middle path” approach could achieve the best of both worlds by using growth to facilitate greater security and stability (and vice versa), or it could simply be a recipe for muddling through.

Party leaders might have done a better job with thorny ideological debates if they had evaluated different approaches dispassionately. But the problem was that ideology mixed with another issue, the most explosive one in the history of the party: succession politics.

And no one witnessed the pathologies and dangers of succession politics more closely than Xi Zhongxun. Xi served premier Zhou Enlai in the 1950s and early 1960s and then General Secretary Hu Yaobang during the 1980s. In other words, he witnessed firsthand the relationships between the Chinese paramount leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and their most significant deputies.

Xi would have seen how party politics at the very top was about much more than executing the senior leader's wishes. The implementers were told to pursue multiple goals at the same time without clear guidance about which mattered more or how to achieve them. Commands would often include two contradictory orders separated by a “but”: make sure the campaign is thorough, they were told, but avoid going too far too fast. If they went too far in one direction, either to the “left” (too radical) or to the “right” (too cautious), they could face charges of ideological heresy. Setbacks might mean losing authority to someone else.

As paramount leaders, Mao and then Deng were often distant, vague, mercurial, and suspicious. If a deputy reported too much to them, they could feel overwhelmed and bogged down by details. But not enough communication could lead them to suspect that underlings were trying to run the country themselves. Private, frank meetings between leaders and their lieutenants were extremely rare, and even then there was no guarantee that they would reach a durable understanding. When deputies got it wrong, their bosses stripped them of power—or worse.



This was an almost impossible situation for deputies to navigate. Xi watched as Mao regularly humiliated Zhou Enlai. On one occasion in 1958, Zhou, after an excruciating self-criticism that lasted several hours, plaintively admitted to Xi that Mao had criticized him once again. Xi promised to share the blame with Zhou. He was shaken by how the experienced Zhou, who understood Mao better than most, could nevertheless face devastating setbacks.

Xi thought Mao's personality cult during the Cultural Revolution was disastrous. He was thus disappointed as Deng became another despot over the course of the 1980s. Xi suggested to Hu that he should speak to Deng more to make sure they understood each other. But Hu thought he had Deng's complete trust. He was wrong. When Deng said that he was planning to retire in 1986, Hu made a fatal mistake. He agreed that Deng should go, which in turn led Deng to conclude that Hu was eager to push him out. And so Hu was booted out. In the aftermath, it became clear to Xi that the party was less inclined to resolve the problems inherent in its leadership system than it was to repeat them.

Like Mao and Deng before him, Xi Jinping has arrogated to himself great power. His model of rule makes some sense given his father's experiences. If the jealousies and insecurities that come with succession politics are dangerous, then it is no surprise that Xi has not picked a successor. A named successor might create more than one center of authority in the party, and Xi does not want to risk the instability that might result if he has to purge such a figure. If too much daylight between a leader and his deputies is a problem, then we can understand Xi's decision to concentrate control in his own hands, as he did when he undermined Li Keqiang, the premier at the time, by restricting Li's latitude to make decisions about the economy.

Yet those are only temporary solutions. Sooner or later, Xi will be tempted to pick and test a successor. As he ages, he may lose energy and want to focus on bigger issues, which will mean delegating more authority to others. The same problems that tormented his father could reappear.

At the twilight of his career, in 1990, just a few months after the People's Liberation Army massacred many of the young protesters who had called for change in Tiananmen Square, Xi Zhongxun assumed one of his last titles: co-chairman of the Care for the Next Generation Committee. It was a fitting coda to a life that had been marked by constant worry about an existential question: Would younger and future generations accept the continuing legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party?

For Xi, of course, it was not just a professional concern but a personal one, too. He wanted his children to be just as dedicated to the cause as he was. He regaled them with stories of the revolution to inspire them and imposed brutal discipline to familiarize them with collective values.

Yet his children saw something else, as well. They saw how the party that Xi served executed policies that brought tragedy to the Chinese people. They saw the humiliation, persecution, exile, and incarceration to which the party subjected Xi. And they saw the guilt and shame he experienced as both a victim and a victimizer. They witnessed the same tragedy but lived very different lives. One of Xi's children, Heping, committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution. Another came to associate with veteran pro-reform officials and intellectuals. Others made a lot of money in business ventures.



Even Xi Jinping has admitted that the torment he endured as a young person led to doubts about the state and the party. Indeed, he was convinced that his ordeal was worse than what many others suffered during the Cultural Revolution, since he was the son of a leader who had been purged earlier than most senior revolutionaries. Nevertheless, he has spoken with great pride of the toughness these horrific experiences inculcated in him. And he has asserted that his ideals and convictions are unshakable precisely because he went through a period of confusion before recognizing that only the party's path was the right one.

Instead of turning him away from the party, these experiences seem to have led Xi to subscribe to a cause for which his father suffered so much and to seek to regain pride and legacy for a family that had been humiliated so many times. With that in mind, he followed his father into politics. But will future generations feel the same way as their parents? Xi believes that China's Western adversaries want to instigate young people today to demand radical political change. To combat this danger, Xi hopes to inspire China's youth with a mission of national rejuvenation, of sacrifice, of “eating bitterness” for the greater good.

Some will inevitably be proud to accept that task. But others may hear Xi Jinping's call not as a rallying cry but as a weary echo of the past. Many young Chinese people might be more interested in living less ardent lives than what Xi demands of them. The Xi family story raises questions about just how these young people can be won over. A message of suffering and struggle can indeed be meaningful for some—but for others, it may only lead to alienation.

            Hiding deep inside the body, a dangerous type of fat wraps itself around vital organs such as the kidneys, liver and heart — triggering inflammation that can lead to insulin resistance and chronic diseases which cut life short.
    


            Called visceral fat, it can make bellies expand — but not for everyone. Even people who are thin can carry too much visceral fat around their organs, a phenomenon known as “skinny fat.”
    


Belly fat linked to signs of Alzheimer's 20 years before symptoms begin, study says



            “Visceral fat is a marker for everything — insulin resistance, elevated cardiovascular risk, fatty liver and type 2 diabetes — all very bad outcomes that limit a long and healthy life,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
    


            Excessive deep belly fat is even linked to long-term cognitive health, said preventive neurologist Dr. Kellyann Niotis, who researches Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease risk reduction at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida.
    


            “Visceral fat is metabolically unhealthy and secretes a lot of inflammatory chemicals that can cause brain atrophy and impact cognition,” Niotis told CNN in a prior interview.
    


            As the size of a person's belly grows, studies show the memory center of the brain shrinks and hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease can appear — namely beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles. This accelerated march toward dementia can begin as early as the 40s and 50s, well before any cognitive decline is apparent, according to researchers.
    


            If visceral fat is about 10% of your body's total fat mass, that's normal and healthy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  So how do you know if that tummy starting to obscure your view of your feet is out of control? One way to tell is to measure your waistline.
    


            Non-pregnant women with a waist size greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) and men with a waist greater than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) are at higher risk from visceral fat, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            You can measure your waistline yourself: Without sucking in your tummy, wrap a tape measure over your waist at the top of your hip bone (typically across the belly button). Exhale normally and measure, making sure that the tape is parallel to the floor and snug, but not tight, across the skin. (No cheating by sucking in your stomach — this is your health at risk.)
    


Smoking may lead to more belly fat, a new study suggests. Here's why that's concerning



            Another key sign is lean muscle mass. If you have more body fat than muscle mass, you're more likely to have visceral fat throughout the body, even the muscles, Freeman said.
    


            You can measure lean muscle mass with a yearly DEXA scan, a large noninvasive X-ray machine that measures bone density, internal visceral fat and muscle mass. There are also over-the-counter biometric scales that track percentages of body and visceral fat and lean muscle mass.
    


            Then there is common sense, Freeman said. Poor exercise and eating habits are a red flag for belly fat, now and in the future.
    


            “Human beings were designed to be fit and strong and active,” he said. “Eating ultraprocessed foods and not doing cardio and strength training are good signs that if you don't have excess now, you may soon — even if you don't look ‘fat.'”
    


            Want to make a change?  Visceral fat is reversible with lifestyle changes, Freeman said.
    


            “The real holy grail, the elixir of youth, the key to staying young and aging gracefully is to remain strong and fit,” he said.
    


            Always check with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. Then start with cardio to get the heart pumping, Freeman said. A good method is to briskly walk for at least 30 minutes a day —“but when I say briskly, I mean fast enough to lose your breath and not be able to hold a conversation. Keep that up for a half hour at a minimum.”
    


Lose that belly by working out extra hard on weekends, study says



            The critical next step is to add resistance, otherwise known as strength training, he added.
    


            “When I tell people to go walking or biking or swimming or jogging, I usually recommend that they do resistance concurrently,” Freeman said. “Carry some weights with them, or put on a weighted backpack, put resistance on the bike or bike uphill, and put fins on their hands when they swim so that there's resistance in the water. Do whatever they need to try to combine the cardio with strength training.”
    


            Some of the most effective resistance exercises for building lean muscle and losing fat require multiple joints in the body to work together, according to the nonprofit American Council on Exercise.
    


            Dead lifts, lunges, planks, presses, pull-ups and push-ups require many muscles that elevate oxygen use and the release of hormones such as adrenaline that increase blood flow to muscles and boost overall heart rate — both key goals.
    


            As you build lean muscle mass, try to add weight, increase sets and repetition, and reduce the breaks you take between exercises. If you're unsure how to do that without injuring yourself, seek out the advice of a physical trainer, the council suggests.
    


            “If you're doing all the right things and you're not building muscle mass, talk to your doctor to rule out issues such as low testosterone that may be hindering your progress,” Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, told CNN previously.
    


            Plant-based diets are excellent ways to improve nutrition and lose belly fat, experts say.
    


            “Get rid of the standard American diet, filled with all the ultraprocessed foods and added fats, sugars and the like and switch to a predominantly whole foods diet,” Freeman said.
    


This diet with exercise reduces dangerous belly fat and more, study says



            The Mediterranean diet — which is more of a lifestyle than a diet — has won top honors since 2019 for its focus on eating fruits, vegetables, grains, olive oil, nuts and seeds, while emphasizing the importance of meals with family and friends and daily exercise. The diet also slashes consumption of sweets and recommends small amounts of dairy and meat, especially red meat. Fish, however, is a staple, especially fatty fish such as sardines.
    


            Older people who followed a lower-calorie Mediterranean diet and minimally exercised up to six days a week gained muscle and lost a significant amount of body fat by the end of a year and kept much of it off for three years, according to an October 2023 study.
    


            A May 2024 study found the Mediterranean dietary pattern cut the risk of death for women by about 25% for more than 25 years, with reductions in both cancer and  cardiovascular mortality.
    


How to start the Mediterranean diet — meal by meal



            Changing when you eat may also help. Try a pattern of eating called intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating, Freeman said. However, he added, it doesn't work for everyone.
    


            “People who are struggling with weight loss have to get their bodies out of its routine, and that's very hard to do,” Freeman said. “Some people, not everyone, respond by some degree to time-restricted eating.
    


            “You eat breakfast at 11 o'clock, you eat dinner by five o'clock — so six hours a day you're eating, and 18 hours a day you're not. Combine that with strength and cardio training and change the type of fuel to whole foods. You put all those together, and magic things start to happen.”

            President Donald Trump's order to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities presents a new test of the Constitution and the extent of presidential powers to conduct war despite a lack of congressional approval.
    


            The administration is relying on the president's authority under Article II of the Constitution, two senior administration officials told CNN, which says he has power to direct US military forces in engagements necessary to advance American national interests abroad. The White House counsel's office and the Justice Department were both involved in the legal analysis for the strikes. The administration relied, in part, on memos about war powers written by the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel under previous administrations of both parties.
    


            “The president is clearly well within his Article II powers here,” one former senior US official told CNN. “End of story.”
    


            But that's not a view held by many legal experts or universally endorsed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who point to the Constitution's unambiguous statement that only Congress can declare war, the absence of a law akin to the Iraq War-era Authorization for Use of Military Force and — critically — a lack of an imminent threat to the United States.

How Trump quietly made the historic decision to launch strikes in Iran



            In 1973, responding to the disastrous war in Vietnam, Congress overrode President Richard Nixon's veto to pass an important piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution, that sought to rein in presidents regarding the use of military force.
    


            “This is a large enough scale action that I think it's likely that it should be considered a war, and not merely a small, severely limited strike. Therefore, it requires congressional authorization,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and a scholar at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
    


            “The War Powers Act requires advance consultation with Congress, ‘whenever possible,' before entering US troops into hostilities,” Somin added. “Here, I think it pretty obviously was possible, and it also pretty obviously wasn't done.”
    


            The Supreme Court has been generous in approving Trump's expansive use of power, most notably its immunity ruling last year. That view has also contributed to the analysis, a senior White House official said.
    


            “This isn't some technical rulemaking,” said Chris Anders, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “It literally is one of the enumerated powers” of the Constitution.
    


            In the Federalist Papers, James Madison argued for an exception that's been hotly discussed since — that the president can use force if needed to “repel a sudden attack on the United States.”
    


            “If applied to Iran,” Anders said, it wouldn't meet that test. “The use of bombing runs against facilities that have been standing there for years, perhaps decades, and were not about to be part of a sudden attack on the United States.”
    


            A senior Justice Department official said if this conflict continues for an extended period, the administration may have to go to Congress for approval, but maintained that “bombing three nuclear sites” does not rise to the level of needing congressional approval. The official also noted the Trump administration has the support of senior House and Senate leaders.
    


            Democratic and Republican presidents have sidestepped Congress for strikes or military action for decades.
    


            Over the past 40 years, the Article II powers have been used for President George H.W. Bush's use of force against Panama to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega, President Barack Obama's use of air strikes in Libya and Trump's actions in his first term against Syria and Iran.
    


            “The commander in chief can take actions to protect American interests around the world,” John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, told CNN.
    


            “We've seen Iran sponsor terrorism in Lebanon in 1983, we've seen it help arm militias in Iraq that have killed Americans with RPGs made in Iran,” Bolton said. “They've been threatening our forces in the region for years.”

            Presidents have relied on a collection of legal experts from a variety of agencies to review their actions. Lawyers from the White House used the group, which included top national security legal experts from the Defense and State departments, the CIA, and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and National Security Division, to offer advice to the president before making a major national security decision.
    


            The Trump White House has relied less on those experts than previous administrations, current and former US officials say. His Justice Department has previously broadly embraced the idea of wide presidential power.
    


            “While the United States is not the world's policeman, as its power has grown, the breadth of its regional interests has expanded and threats to national interests posed by foreign disorder have increased,” the Office of Legal Counsel wrote in 2018 regarding air strikes against Syria.
    


            “He's basically repeating the abuses of a number of previous administrations, most notably Obama, with the 2011 Libya war,” Somin said. “But the bottom line is that this is a kind of abuse that's not unprecedented, albeit that doesn't make it right.”
    


            Enforcing anything against Trump may be impossible through the legal system, as courts have been skeptical of who has the right to sue him and whether such debates should be left for the political branches to address.
    


            The full House or Senate could in theory challenge Trump in court, as the then-Democratic-led House did during his first term regarding the border wall. But while a top federal appeals court backed the lawsuit based on a dispute over appropriations, it was later vacated as moot.
    


            “This is the basic question of constitutional authority. If they were to bring a lawsuit, the courts would not intervene,” Bolton said. “This is a fight between the two branches.”
    


            Bipartisan concerns, however, won't move the needle on their own without help from leadership, which is unlikely based on Saturday's comments from House Speaker Mike Johnson.
    


            “The President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight's necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,” Johnson said in a social media post.
    


            Republican Rep. Thomas Massie was taken aback.
    


            “There was no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would authorize that. And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the speaker of the House,” the Kentucky congressman said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” “Look, Congress was on vacation last week when all this was happening. We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back.”
    


            Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are seeking to reassert Congress' authority over military action with a co-sponsored war powers resolution. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said on “Fox News Sunday” that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing for a vote “as soon as possible” on a resolution so “all members of the Senate have to declare whether or not the US should be at war with Iran.”
    


            US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s were “at least” debated in Congress at the time with requests from then-President George W. Bush, Massie noted.
    


            “It should have been declarations of war, but at least they did an Authorization of Use of Military Force,” Massie said. “We haven't had that. This has been turned upside down.”

            Some lawmakers and legal experts are looking at the second Iraq War as precedent for congressional action — and also a warning to review the intelligence.
    


            “We are in yellowcake uranium-land,” a former national security official said, referring to botched intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. “Congress should be asking questions about what intelligence and what legal findings they did before taking this escalatory action.”
    


            Democratic and Republican administrations have repeatedly stretched the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the Iraq War, as legal authority for military action in locations outside of Iraq. An earlier AUMF that authorized action against al Qaeda and associated groups also has been used beyond what was conceived in the post-9/11 era.
    


            “The problem is that, historically, the only meaningful check on presidential abuses of the war powers has been pushback from Congress,” said Stephen Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “But that was when Congress took its constitutional and institutional responsibilities seriously.”
    


            The ACLU's Anders says there's still time for Congress to act on a bipartisan basis, suggesting public hearings to air the Trump administration's military and legal justifications. Congress could also look at restricting funds for such actions without its buy-in.
    


            It's also a chance for a true national debate.
    


            “One advantage that comes to the executive branch when it goes to Congress and asks for authorization that there's a clear examination of what the United States is getting into, so there's much more of a national buy-in,” Anders said.
    


            “That is part of the genius of the way the Constitution was set up.”

• Iran's operation against US base: Iran has begun an operation against a US base in Qatar, Iran state TV reports. The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter. 



• Response to US strikes: Iranian military officials and members of parliament have vowed that the US will pay a price for its strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump alluded to the possibility of regime change in Iran in a social media post Sunday. There has been no word yet from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
    


            • Damage assessment: The US bombing likely caused “very significant damage” to the underground parts of Iran's Fordow nuclear site, the UN's nuclear watchdog said Monday.
    


            • Iran-Israel conflict enters 11th day: Both countries have continued to trade strikes. Israel said it launched an attack at “the heart of Tehran,” including Iran's notorious Evin prison and access routes to the Fordow nuclear facility, while several waves of Iranian missile attacks were reported in Israel.
    


            A Doha resident and father of two told CNN that loud explosions rocked the city, but Qatari authorities did not give any warning to citizens to take shelter.
    


                    “Our kids were totally taken by surprise and didn't know what to do when we scrambled them to shelter. There was no warning from Qatar authorities to take shelter. There appear to be a lot of outgoing fire and intercepts,” he said.
                





            Qatar's defense ministry said its air defenses “successfully” intercepted a missile attack targeting the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, adding that the attack did not results in any deaths or injuries.
    


            Iran has launched a “powerful and destructive missile attack” on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in response to the US striking its nuclear facilities, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement.
    


            “The Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on Almighty God and the faithful, proud people of Iran, will never leave any aggression against its territorial integrity, sovereignty, or national security unanswered,” the statement read.
    


            US personnel at the embassies in Qatar and Bahrain are in “duck and cover” positions as Iran launches retaliatory missiles toward Qatar and Iraq, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The protective measure is taken when there is notification of imminent danger, sources said.
    


            The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine are in the Situation Room, according to a White House official.
    


            A senior official said earlier that White House and Defense Department officials were monitoring potential attacks threats to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. President Donald Trump toured the base last month, the first commander in chief to visit since 2003. It is the largest US military installation in the Middle East.
    


            “No visit in the Gulf would be complete without stopping to salute the people who keep America safe, strong and free,” Trump told the troops at the base on May 17.
    


            Iran has begun an operation against a US base in Qatar, Iran state TV has reported.
    


            An official briefed on the matter also said missiles have been launched by Iran on the US-run Al Udeid Air Base.
    


            American officials have been preparing for the likelihood that Iran could target US facilities in the wake of this weekend's strikes.
    


            France's foreign minister condemned Israel's strike on Iran's notorious Evin prison, known for housing political prisoners including two French nationals.
    


                    “The strike aimed at Evin Prison in Tehran put in danger two of our nationals, Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, hostages for the past three years. It's inacceptable,” Jean-Noël Barrot said in a post on X.
                





            Kohler, a 40-year-old teacher, was on holiday in Iran with her partner, Jacques Paris, in May 2022 when they were stopped by authorities and arrested on suspicion of espionage. In October 2022, Iranian state television broadcast a forced confession from the pair that saw Kohler unveil herself as an agent working for France's intelligence services, the DGES.
    


            French authorities and nongovernmental organizations including Amnesty International have repeatedly said the pair were coerced into making false confessions and have called for their immediate liberation.
    


            Barrot said in his social media post Monday he had demanded an update on their safety and called for “consular access as soon as possible.”
    


            Moscow's partnership with Tehran is “unbreakable,” Russian's deputy foreign minister said Monday, adding that Iran has the right to self-defense.
    


            Iran “is acting within the framework of the implementation of the right to self-defense, this is an absolutely legitimate and correct presentation,” Sergei Ryabkov told reporters, Russian state news agency TASS reported.
    


            “We interact with Iran in many areas,” the senior diplomat said, answering a question about whether Iran had requested military assistance from Russia.
    


                    “It is clear that it would be irresponsible on my part to disclose the content of those contacts that are ongoing, including today, taking into account all the circumstances,” he added. “I want to emphasize that our strategic partnership with Iran is unbreakable,” he said, according to TASS.
                





            Ryabko's comments come after Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored the Kremlin's support for Tehran earlier in the day during a meeting with Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Moscow.
    


            Taking a swipe at the United States' actions, he said: “We see that they are trying to deal with Iran, they are trying, at least, in the language of ultimatums. But this language is not being accepted: neither in Tehran, nor in other capitals.”
    


            “We need to stop the escalatory actions and we need to change the rhetoric, then there will be a greater chance of some kind of political solution,” the deputy minister added.
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran did not start or want war but would not leave what he called “aggression” against the country unanswered.
    


            “We will stand by the security of this beloved nation and respond to every wound on Iran's body with faith, wisdom and determination,” he said on X.
    


            The US has seen indications that Iran is making preparations to attack US military installations in the Middle East, including the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, according to two officials familiar with the matter.
    


            American officials have been preparing for the likelihood that Iran could target US facilities in the wake of this weekend's strikes.
    


            Iran launched several waves of missiles that were reported in Israel.
    


            Dashcam video captured today shows the moment when a missile hit near the city of Ashdod, Israel. Emergency service crews have been dispatched to areas that have been reported to have been impacted by strikes.

            Qatar decided to temporarily suspend air traffic in the country today as “precautionary measures” due to regional security concerns.
    


                    “In line with the State of Qatar's commitment to the safety of citizens, residents, and visitors, the competent authorities announce the temporary suspension of air traffic in the country's airspace,” the Qatari Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “This is part of a set of precautionary measures taken based on developments in the region,” it said.
                





            Authorities “are closely and continuously monitoring the situation, assessing developments in coordination with regional and international partners,” the statement added.
    


            Qatar's airspace shutdown coincides with Iran's threats to retaliate against the United States, following US strikes on its nuclear facilities over the weekend.
    


            Earlier, the US embassy in Qatar issued a warning to Americans in the Gulf country to “shelter in place until further notice” as tensions in the region spiral.
    


            The British government has followed the US in advising its citizens to shelter in place in Qatar.
    


            Citing the US warning earlier Monday, the UK government said in a statement:”Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that British nationals in Qatar shelter in place until further notice,” adding they provide further updates “as the situation develops.”
    


CNN's Andrew Potter and Kara Fox contributed reporting to this post. 



            Iran's air defense systems were activated to intercept “hostile targets” in Ahvaz city, in the southwest region of the country, state-affiliated Fars News Agency reported today.
    


                    “An explosion was heard in western Ahvaz, outside the urban area, and simultaneously, air defense systems were activated against hostile targets,” Fars said.
                





            The state-run IRIB network also reported that Ahvaz's air defenses had been activated, without providing more details.
    


            Israel launched a fresh new wave of attacks at the “heart of Tehran” and hit Iran's notorious Evin prison earlier today.
    


More on the prison: Security forces at the Evin detention center are known for their long record of human rights abuses. Political activists, journalists and musicians are among those who have been incarcerated at the facility.
    


            Watch the moment when Israeli strikes hit the prison:
    

The Israeli military attacked Iran's notorious Evin prison on Monday, according to Israel's defense minister and Iranian state news. Iran's state broadcaster IRIB published video of the entrance to the prison which has been geolocated by CNN.


            French national carrier Air France has suspended all scheduled flights to Tel Aviv until July 14, citing the security situation as Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks.
    


            After carrying out an assessment of the “situation on the ground,” the carrier made the decision to cancel all flights from Paris to Tel Aviv until July 14, the company said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday.
    


            Multiple other flights to destinations in the Middle East have been canceled over the past two days. Today, Air France flights to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia from Paris were both canceled.
    


            Air France said affected customers will be offered the option to postpone their flights or receive a reimbursement.
    


            The company stressed it has been “constantly monitoring developments in the geopolitical situation of the territories served and overflown by its aircraft, to ensure the highest level of flight safety and security.”
    


            Oil prices turned solidly negative today as energy markets shrug off the risk that the US strikes on Iran lead to even more instability in the region.
    


            US oil spiked as much as 6.2% yesterday, briefly touching $78.40 a barrel.
    


            However, that rally proved short-lived as oil futures have since gone into the red. As of 10:40 a.m. ET, US crude was down about 1% to $73.15 a barrel.
    


            Brent, the world benchmark, also fell about 1% after having surged Sunday night.
    


            The White House is closely monitoring the situation in the oil market.
    


            “EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post as US markets opened on Monday. “I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!”
    


Keep in mind: The fear is that Iran retaliates by trying to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Each day about 20 million barrels of oil flow through the narrow waterway.
    


            Oil markets are waiting for evidence of an actual disruption, Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN.
    


            “Traders have seen a lot of false alarms when it comes to geopolitical disruption risk in the oil market,” he said. “Unless there's a material interruption in gulf energy, production, or flows, I think any further spikes will be contained.”
    


            President Donald Trump has spent the last 24 hours closely tracking the developments — and the reaction — following US strikes on Iran Saturday night, according to multiple US officials.
    


            He has held regular meetings with his senior staff as he's been updated, the officials said. He still plans to attend the NATO summit in The Hague this week, though two officials cautioned that his travel plans could change if something major arises.
    


            Trump also warned “everyone” today to keep oil prices down. He told the US Energy Department to “Drill, Baby, drill.”
    


                    “EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” he posted on Truth Social Monday morning.
                





            “To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!  And I mean NOW!!!” he said in a second post.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier Monday warned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz — a move that could have disastrous consequences for global oil markets.
    


            A 95-year-old Holocaust survivor was killed in an Iranian missile attack in central Israel earlier this month, local officials reported today.
    


            Yvette Shmilovitz was killed in an attack on the Israeli city of Petah Tikva on June 16, the authorities said in a statement. Three other people were also killed.
    


            She is survived by her three granddaughters and four great-grandchildren, authorities said.
    


            As of Monday, at least 24 people have been killed in Israel, according to the country's government office.
    


                    “On behalf of the residents of the city, I send a heartfelt embrace to the family and offer strength during this difficult time,” the municipality statement read. “We bow our heads and mourn the murder of four residents of our city.”
                





            The Israeli military said it has thwarted “dozens” of Iranian drones in recent days using “advanced electronic warfare systems.”
    


                    “The UAVs arrive from Iranian territory into Israel and we help intercept them on an ongoing basis,” the Commander of the 5114th Battalion at the Spectrum Warfare Center, identified as “LTC B,” was cited as saying in a statement by the military.
                





            The Iranian government wants the United States to “directly pay for the war, rather than standing behind Israel and pursue its project without having to pay the cost,” a senior Iranian official told CNN on Monday.
    


            The decision by US President Donald Trump to order strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday sparked a wave of anti-US sentiment in Iran, with many calling for retaliation.
    


            A large anti-US and anti-Israel protest took place in Tehran on Sunday evening, with many in the crowd demanding revenge. Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran 11 days ago and the two countries have been striking each other daily since, leaving hundreds of people dead.
    


                    “Morale is high and the immense demand by the Iranian people to strike Israel is unprecedented,” the official told CNN, adding that calls by the Iranian public to strike Israel are “an element in intensifying Iran's battle plans.”
                





            The official told CNN that Iran believed that calls for a temporary pause to the war were a “deception in order to assess Iran's preparedness for continuing the war.”
    


            They added that Iran estimated the war could last up to two years and that Iran was prepared for that.

Follow:


            US President Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities puts the Middle East in a volatile position, with all eyes now on Tehran's next move.
    


            Speaking in Istanbul, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday his country has “a variety of options” when deciding how to respond to the US attacks.
    


            From striking US bases in the region, to possibly closing a key waterway to global shipping, Iran is likely mulling its next moves. All carry inherent risks for the Islamic Republic, Israel and the United States.
    


            Here's what to know:
    


Direct US involvement in the conflict could see Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) activate what remains of its proxies across Iraq, Yemen and Syria, groups which have previously launched attacks on American assets in the region.
    


            While Iran's strongest ally in the region was once Lebanon's Hezbollah, that group has been significantly weakened by Israeli attacks.
    


            The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) says the US maintains a presence at 19 sites in total across the region, with eight of those considered by analysts to have a permanent US presence. As of June 13, the CFR estimated some 40,000 US troops were in the Middle East.

‘Unprecedentedly dangerous': Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson on US strikes



            In Iraq, for example, there were 2,500 US troops as of late last year. An Iranian attack on these forces is not inconceivable. In 2020, an Iranian missile attack on a US garrison left more than 100 soldiers with traumatic brain injuries.
    


            The Iranians have said “several times” that if the US “joins this war and attacks their nuclear facilities, they will retaliate against US forces in the region, against US interests, and there are a lot of those,” CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid said.
    


            A resurgence of attacks from Yemen against US assets is already on the table. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels previously vowed to attack American ships in the Red Sea should the US join Israel's conflict with Iran. A prominent Houthi official said in a social media post early Sunday that “Trump must bear the consequences” of the US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            It is unclear if this marks the end of a US-Houthi ceasefire struck in May, in which Washington said it would halt its military campaign against the Houthis in exchange for the group stopping its attacks on US interests in the region.
    


            Knowing that it can't outright win a conflict against Israel and the US, experts have said that Tehran could seek to engage in a war of attrition, where it tries to exhaust its adversary's will or capacity to fight in a drawn-out and damaging conflict, which Trump at the outset of his presidency said he wanted to avoid.
    


            Iran also has the power to influence the “entire commercial shipping in the Gulf,” Ravid said, should it decide to close the Strait of Hormuz, a key oil shipping route.
    


            There have so far been no material disruptions to the global flow of oil. But if oil exports are disrupted, or if Iran tries to block the Strait of Hormuz, the global oil market could face an existential crisis.
    


            The strait links the Persian Gulf to the open ocean and is a key channel for oil and liquefied natural gas exports from the Middle East to the global market. About 20 million barrels of oil flow through the strait each day, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
    


            A prominent adviser to Iran's supreme leader has already called for missile strikes and the closure of the Strait of Hormuz.
    


            “Following America's attack on the Fordow nuclear installation, it is now our turn,” warned Hossein Shariatmadari, the editor-in-chief of the hardline Kayhan newspaper, a well-known conservative voice who has previously identified himself as a Khamenei “representative.”
    


            The Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy committee on Sunday proposed to the legislature that the Strait of Hormuz should be closed in response to the US attack, semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
    


            “The final decision lies with the Supreme National Security Council,” state-run Press TV cited committee member Esmaeil Kowsari as saying. Debate on its potential closure is ongoing in parliament, Ali Keshvari, a lawmaker, was cited as saying by Iran's official IRNA news agency on Monday.
    


            Geographic leverage over global shipping gives Iran the “capacity to cause a shock in oil markets, drive up oil prices, drive inflation, collapse Trump's economic agenda,” Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj news outlet, told CNN.
    


            Some experts say that Iran is very likely to race for a nuclear bomb now, even if the current regime collapses and new leaders come in place.
    


            “Trump just guaranteed that Iran will be a nuclear weapons state in the next 5 to 10 years,” Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said on X. “Particularly if the regime changes.”
    


            Parsi has said that even if the regime collapses and new military elements assume power, they are likely to be much more hawkish than the current regime and race toward a nuclear weapon as their only deterrent.
    


            Experts have previously said that Iran likely moved its stocks of enriched uranium from its key nuclear facilities amid Israeli strikes.. Nuclear power plants that generate electricity for civil purposes use uranium that is enriched to between 3.5% and 5%. When enriched to higher levels, uranium can be used to make a bomb Israel and the US accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons; Tehran insists its program is peaceful.
    


            Iran is also likely to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or the NPT, under which it has pledged not to develop a bomb.
    


            “Iran's response is likely not just limited to military retaliation. NPT withdrawal is quite likely,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, said on X.
    


            Iran's first response to the US' attack on its nuclear sites was to attack Israel, not US bases.
    


            Iranian missiles hit a group of buildings in Tel Aviv, where 86 people were admitted to hospital with injuries overnight and on Sunday morning, according to Israel's ministry of health.

In pictures: The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran



            Knowing it may not be able to sustain a full-on confrontation with the US, and hoping that Trump will scale back on his involvement following Sunday's strike, Iran may merely seek to perpetuate the status quo, fighting only Israel.
    


            Trump may follow the same playbook as in the 2020 attack that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, Shabani told CNN's Becky Anderson.
    


            Trump at the time wanted to “send a big message, get the headlines, show US resolve, but then avoid a wider war,” Shabani said.
    


            While Iran may feel it has to retaliate to save face, it may be a bloodless response, similar to what happened in 2020, when it launched a barrage of missiles at US bases in Iraq, which resulted in traumatic brain injuries to personnel but no deaths.
    


            Two military analysts have said Iran could resort to “asymmetric” measures – such as terrorism or cyberattacks – to retaliate against the US because Israeli attacks have reduced Iran's military capabilities.
    


            “I think the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) is probably trying to figure out what capabilities it has left” as its missile stockpile dwindles, said CNN national security analyst David Sanger.
    


            “I think (the IRGC is) going to be a little bit careful, and I suspect that's going to take us to all of the asymmetric things they can do: cyber, terrorism. I think that they're probably going to be looking for things where the US cannot just put up the traditional defenses,” he added.
    


            Similarly, retired Maj. Gen. James “Spider” Marks, head of geopolitical strategy at Academy Securities, an investment bank, told CNN that Israel “did a pretty good job of damaging Iran's capacity to launch its rather robust missile inventory.”
    


            But, “albeit wounded,” the IRGC still has “some tremendous capacity,” he said. “It has capabilities that are already within the region and then outside the region. We are vulnerable… around the world, where the IRGC has either influence or can make things happen asymmetrically.”
    


            Iran has refused to return to the negotiating table while under Israeli attacks.
    


            On Sunday, Araghchi said he does not know how “much room is left for diplomacy” after the US military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            “They crossed a very big red line by attacking nuclear facilities. … We have to respond based on our legitimate right for self-defense,” Araghchi said.
    


            Parsi said that by doing so, “the Iranians have cornered themselves.”
    


            “Their aim is to force Trump to stop Netanyahu's war, and by that show his ability and willingness to use American leverage against Netanyahu,” Parsi wrote. “But the flip side is that Tehran has given Israel a veto on US-Iran diplomacy – by simply continuing the war, Israel is enabled to block talks between the US and Iran.”
    


            Iranian and European officials met Friday in Geneva for talks, which an Iranian source said started out tense but became “much more positive.”
    


            Speaking Sunday, Araghchi said the US had decided to “blow up” diplomacy.
    


            “Last week, we were in negotiations with the US when Israel decided to blow up that diplomacy. This week, we held talks with the E3 (group of European ministers)/EU when the US decided to blow up that diplomacy,” Araghchi said on X.
    


            Vaez, of the International Crisis Group, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the “Iranians were reluctant to negotiate with a gun to their head, and that gun has already been triggered.
    


            “The more likely situation is that the talks are over for now.”

LEVELLAND, Texas (AP) — Dozens of researchers are chasing, driving and running into storms to collect fresh hail, getting their car bodies and their own bodies dented in the name of science. They hope these hailstones will reveal secrets about storms, damage and maybe the air itself.

But what do you do with nearly 4,000 melting iceballs?

A lot.

Researchers in the first-of-its-kind Project ICECHIP to study hail are measuring the hailstones, weighing them, slicing them, crushing them, chilling them, driving them across several states, seeing what's inside of them and in some cases — which frankly is more about fun and curiosity — eating them.

The whole idea is to be “learning information about what the hailstone was doing when it was in the storm,” said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini, one of the team's lead scientists.

It's peak hail season across the Great Plains, and dozens of researchers studying the extreme weather are chasing, driving and running into storms to collect fresh hail. Here's what happens to them after they've been collected.

It's pushing midnight on a Friday in a Texas Walmart parking lot, and at least 10 vans full of students and full-time scientists are gathering after several hours of rigorous storm chasing. Hailstones are in coolers in most of these vehicles, and now it's time to put them to the test.

Researchers use calipers to measure the width, in millimeters, of the hailstones, which are then weighed. So far after more than 13 storms, the biggest they found is 139 millimeters (5.5 inches), the size of a DVD. But on this night they are smaller than golf balls.




Once the measurements are recorded in a laptop, the fun starts in the back of a van with a shark-festooned beach blanket protecting the floor.

The hail is put on a vertical device's white holder. Jake Sorber, a meteorologist at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, squeezes a hand grip about a foot above it and another white block comes crashing down, crushing the ice to smithereens. In the front of the van, Ian Giammanco, another IBHS meteorologist, records how much force it took to cause the destruction.

“That tells us about its strength,” Giammanco said.

Different teams do this over and over, with the debris littering vans. It's all about trying to get good statistics on how strong the typical hailstone is. On this night, Gaimmanco and colleagues are finding the day's hail is unusually soft. It's surprising, but there's a good theory on what's happening.

“In hailstones we have layers. So we start off with an embryo, and then you've got different growth layers,” said Central Michigan University scientist John Allen. “That white growth is what's called dry growth. So basically it's so cold that it's like super cold liquid water freezing on surface. ... All the gas gets trapped inside. So there's lots of air bubbles. They tend to make a weak stone.”

But don't get used to it. Less cold air from climate change could conceivably mean harder hail in the future, but more research is needed to see if that's the case, Giammanco said.

“Damage from a hailstone is not just dependent on how fast and the exact amount of energy it has. It's how strong are these hailstones,″ Giammanco said. ”So a really soft one is not actually going to damage your roof very much, especially an asphalt shingle roof. But a really strong one may crack and tear that asphalt shingle pretty easily.”

Mostly researchers grab hail to test after it falls, wearing gloves so as not to warm or taint the ice balls too much.

But to collect pristine hail and get it cold as soon as possible, there's SUMHO, a Super Mobile Hail Observatory. It's a chest-high metal funnel that catches hail and slides it directly down into a cooler. No contamination, no warming.

Most of these pristine hailstones go directly to a cold lab in Colorado, where they are sliced with a hot wire band saw. The different layers — like a tree's rings — will help scientists learn about the short but rapid growth of the ice in the storm, Gensini said.

Scientists will also figure out what's in the hail besides water. Past research has found fungi, bacteria, peat moss and microplastics, all of which helps researchers know a bit more about what's in the air that we don't see.

After weeks of collecting these ice balls, Central Michigan student Sam Baron sampled the fruit of his labors.

“It tastes like an ice cube,” Baron said. “It's like the good ice that they serve at restaurants.”

U.S. President Donald Trump warned that he will not hesitate to strike other targets in Iran if peace does not come quickly in the Middle East. Trump said that while the nuclear facilities struck by the U.S. on Saturday were the most “lethal,” “there are many targets left.”

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — One of Layton Tallwhiteman's earliest memories was watching the news at his uncle's house in Montana in 2003 and seeing the U.S. bomb Baghdad to launch the war in Iraq.

Recollections of that war — waged in part to find weapons of mass destruction that did not exist – flooded back for Tallwhiteman after President Donald Trump ordered weekend bombing strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities amid its escalating conflict with Israel.

The administration has indicated it wants to avoid getting pulled into all-out war. Tallwhiteman, who grew up on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation southeast of Billings, is skeptical.

“Their idea is to eliminate the threat. Like Bush said in Iraq, ‘We're going to eliminate the threat. We're going to find weapons of mass destruction and eliminate them.' Did that work the way he planned? No, obviously it didn't,” said Tallwhiteman. The 30-year-old driver for a food distribution company said he usually votes Libertarian, but backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump last year.

Across the U.S. on Sunday, Americans expressed a mixture of support, apprehension and anxiety over the bombings, which officials said caused severe damage to Iran's nuclear sites. Administration officials said the strikes left room for Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear program. Yet if the conflict spirals, it could test Trump's foreign diplomacy skills and also his support at home.

B-2 bombers that participated in the weekend strikes returned home to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on Sunday. Nearby, retired Air Force veteran Ken Slabaugh said he was “100% supportive” of Trump's decision and the military personnel who carried it out.

Slabaugh said Iran has showed resistance to negotiations over its nuclear program for decades, a problem that he said Trump inherited. Iran can't be trusted, Slabaugh said, nor allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

“It simply had to be done,” he said of the strikes, adding that he's now concerned for members of the military around the world.

“I'm proud of the guys and the gals that are doing the work out there. Nobody in the world does this like we do, and we have the freedom and liberty we enjoy because of that,” Slabaugh said.

Hundreds of people gathered in New York's Times Square on Sunday to protest the bombings, waving signs that said “STOP THE WAR ON IRAN” and “TRUMP IS A WAR CRIMINAL.” Among them was Dana Cote, who was in the city when the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred. Cote worried that bombing Iran would “open a can of worms that we're not going to be able to close” and prompt extremists to again attack the U.S.

A much smaller group of pro-Trump supporters gathered nearby. They held up flags for Israel and Trump, and used air horns to try to drown out the demonstrators.

“I think it's the best thing that Trump could have done. It should have been done 40 years ago,” said Nancy Myer of New York.

In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Andrew Williams, 18, said he was surprised by the timing of the attack, given that many Republicans had expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war. Still, he thought it was necessary if Iran was building nuclear weapons.

“If we are able to get rid of that, that is something we should do,” Williams said.

Robert Wallette of Billings said Trump had “good reason” to conduct the bombing as a demonstration of American support for Israel.

“Iran's evil, evil people. They hate Americans,” he said.

Wallette, 69, a retired contract specialist at the federal Indian Health Service, said he hated Trump when the Republican was first elected because of his arrogant style.

His perspective started to shift after Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In 2024, Wallette voted for Trump based on his promises to curb illegal immigration, putting him among the 60% of voters backing Trump last year in Yellowstone County, which includes Billings.

Notwithstanding his support, Wallette was unsure if Trump can avoid the U.S. getting drawn into a deeper conflict with Iran.

“Other countries are getting involved and this may be out of his control,” he said.

Kent Berame, 32, of Davie, Florida, said it was a little outrageous for Trump to go rogue and approve the attack without explicit support from Congress. He said he doesn't agree with the United States supporting Israel's recent attacks on Iran.

“There's concern that we're putting troops in danger,” said Berame, a Democrat who owns his own marketing company. “And obviously there's a retaliatory response toward all of our bases over there.”

Berame said it's frustrating that the U.S. might be increasing hostilities with Iran just a few years after finally ending the war in Afghanistan.

“I don't want to see any U.S. soldiers in harm's way or in danger,” he said.

Back in Billings, Trump voter Patty Ellman said she worries about the U.S. getting sucked into another extended conflict. 

“We have enough going on in America to get into other countries' wars. Let's just take care of us right now,” she said.

Ellman, a 61-year-old who stepped in as caregiver for her ex-husband after he suffered a stroke, said the U.S. should retaliate if attacked, but otherwise stay out of Iran's conflict with other countries.

“That's their business,” she said. “We need to worry about Americans and how we're going to survive and are we going to have Social Security.”

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — At 4-foot-11, Kristin Chenoweth always wanted to play basketball. It never happened, but she still made it to the NBA Finals.

The award-winning actress, singer, Oklahoma native, Oklahoma Hall of Fame inductee and unabashed Thunder fan sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before Game 7 of the title series between the Thunder and the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night.

Chenoweth's performance aired live on ABC shortly before tipoff of the season's final game.

She has performed on some of the biggest stages in the world — but doing the anthem for a Thunder game gives her butterflies.

“Let me just say, if they had anxiety medication for Thunder fans, I'd be taking it,” Chenoweth, dressed in a Thunder sweatshirt, told The Associated Press after her soundcheck at the arena on Sunday.

Chenoweth's Thunder fandom has been no secret since the franchise's early years, though she also has professed at times to liking the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks as well. That said, the Thunder are clearly her top choice — so much so that she once told the Tulsa World she spent three hours bedazzling a Thunder hat. She went to Oklahoma City University after growing up in Broken Arrow, about 115 miles northeast of where the Thunder play.

And her 8-year-old dog's name is Thunder. She even dressed the pup up once in a Thunder outfit.

“I never miss a game unless I'm on stage,” Chenoweth said. “I was a cheerleader in high school in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and I loved football, but my favorite was basketball. I like how much of a team player you've got to be. ... And this is my team.”




Chenoweth has sung the anthem at a few Thunder games in the past, sometimes alone and at least once with children from her Chenoweth Broadway Bootcamp. That camp is part of the arts and education fund that she founded to cultivate “young artistic expression by enriching children's lives through the power of education, entertainment and experience.”

“I've had some pretty big moments in my life in the entertainment field, but this one, I don't know why, makes me nervous,” Chenoweth said. “I just am very honored that they asked. And I'm proud of these kids. I mean, we have come so far. Of course I want us to win. When the NFL has hired me for the anthem, you remain neutral. But the NBA didn't hire me for this, so I'm Thundering it up.”

And the anthem — which the soprano finished with her own flair — is a tough song to perform, she said. Singing the words written by Francis Scott Key about the defense of Fort McHenry is a duty she takes seriously.

“Actually thinking about what he saw, it's really important for me to remember the words and talk about what they meant then and what they mean to us now,” Chenoweth said.

Chenoweth won a Tony Award in 1999 for best featured actress in a musical for her role in “You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.” She received two Tony nominations for best leading actress in a musical, one in 2004 for playing Glinda in “Wicked” — she lost to co-star Idina Menzel — and the other in 2015 for playing 1930s Hollywood diva Lily Garland in “On the Twentieth Century.”

And in 2009, she won an Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy series for her work on ABC's “Pushing Daisies.” She returns to Broadway this fall, playing Jackie Siegel in ”The Queen of Versailles.”

“I still have the desire,” Chenoweth said. “I think really what inspires me lately is young talent. I'm seeing and watching and learning from them. Hopefully they're learning from me. And there's nothing better than watching a budding talent whether it's basketball or a singer, an artist, it's my jam. What keeps me going right now is other people inspiring me to do what I love.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's strike on Iran, the pushback from both lawmakers and Trump's call for a regime change.

The impact of the border crisis under the Biden administration likely added fuel to the fire of an Iranian sleeper cell threat domestically, according to a former top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who briefly led Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Following the strike on Iranian nuclear sites by the U.S. on Saturday, DHS issued a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning about the risk of domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed or inspired perpetrators.

""Definitely,"" former acting ICE director and Fox News contributor Jonathan Fahey said when asked if the Biden border crisis likely made matters worse domestically.

""I think one thing that's really concerning about that: One, they weren't doing any really meaningful vetting in the last administration. The second part of it is, you know, we have probably 2 million known gotaways come through the last administration, and the people that went through the non-ports of entry, we knew they went through but nobody caught them, so we have no idea who went through,"" he added.

Fahey noted that other countries were likely paying close attention to the heavy flow of people crossing into the country illegally. He briefly led ICE toward the end of Trump's first term and was the former deputy assistant secretary at the DHS.

""But the thing that's concerning is all of our adversaries knew at the time that we basically, in all intents and purposes, had an open border. So, to the extent they wanted to send people in to spy, to collect intelligence, to do us harm, to plan to do us harm in the future, they had carte blanche to get anyone in that they wanted to with really little or no resistance,"" Fahey said.

""That's what makes what Biden, the Biden-Mayorkas open border just so unconscionable,"" he said.

Fox News reported that roughly half of the 1,500 Iranian nationals who came through illegally during the Biden administration were let go into the U.S.

""The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the Homeland,"" the DHS bulletin stated.

""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks,"" it continued.

Other national security experts also doubled down that the releases and gotaways during the Biden administration continued to pose a risk.

""We don't know where those thousand Iranians are and who knows how many others got across the border. We missed an opportunity when they caught and released those thousand. We missed the opportunity to gather intel by interviewing them and thoroughly vetting them. We just simply let them go, which is gross negligence on the part of the Biden administration,"" former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker told Fox News Digital.

Border czar Tom Homan also sounded the alarm about gotaways on ""Sunday Morning Futures"" right after the Iran strikes.

""We don't know who they are, where they came from, because they got away because border patrol is so overwhelmed with the humanitarian crisis that Biden created. Over two million people crossed the border and got away. That is my biggest concern. And that's what created the biggest national security vulnerability this country's ever seen,"" Homan said. 

When it comes to known releases, the Trump administration released nobody in May, compared with roughly 62,000 releases under the Biden administration last May, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.

Chris Broussard joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the NBA Finals, the sale of the Los Angeles Lakers, and trade destinations for Kevin Durant. 

While the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated the team's first NBA title since relocating in 2008, the Indiana Pacers were reeling from Game 7's loss in the NBA Finals. 

It came down to one final game after a grueling battle throughout the regular season and postseason for both teams, but one was always going to come out victorious over the other. It was the home Thunder who ran away with it in the second half, and the emotions of the loss were hard for some Pacers players, including veteran guard T.J. McConnell. 

McConnell, who poured in 16 points after Indiana lost Tyrese Haliburton for the game with a right Achilles injury, was clearly emotional as he left the court following the 103-91 loss.

The devastation of falling just short was still setting in as he walked through the visitor's tunnel accompanied by Karen Atkeson, the Pacers' vice president of Player Relations. 

The two embraced as they walked toward the locker room, and McConnell stopped to lean on Atkeson's shoulder to presumably let out all of his emotions. 

THUNDER BLOW OUT PACERS IN GAME 7 TO WIN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP

An ESPN camera was capturing the moment, and Atkeson did not appreciate it, shooing away the cameraman while comforting McConnell. 

""Stop, stop,"" Atkeson was heard saying while waving the camera away from her and McConnell.

McConnell was also spotted sharing a hug with Pacers great Reggie Miller, who was in the Paycom Center supporting his former team in Game 7. Miller, in the back hallways leading to the locker room, consoled McConnell, who remained emotional after the game. 

The Pacers and Thunder were trading blows on the offensive end once the game began, but Haliburton's Achilles injury put a damper on what could have been a fantastic end for him after hitting all but one of his four three-point attempts in the first quarter.

Rep. Mike Haridopolos joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss an upcoming House vote on codifying DOGE spending cuts and the Senate working through President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.'

EXCLUSIVE: The Senate's DOGE leader is hoping to give the U.S. Treasury another boost in cutting the $36 trillion national debt, this time by selling off some major real estate in Washington, D.C., currently home to several prominent cabinet agencies.

The headquarters of the Departments of Energy, Housing & Urban Development, along with ancillary buildings home to other top agencies, would be sold off but without attrition or layoffs, as the employees therein would be relocated elsewhere, according to Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the caucus' chairwoman.

The ""For Sale Act"" would put the James Forrestal Federal Building on the market, one of six properties identified by the Senate DOGE Caucus as ripe for removal from the federal government's portfolio.

The imposing modernist structure, which hovers across L'Enfant Plaza as a cross between an office building and a pedestrian bridge, was once known as the ""Little Pentagon"" and home to overflow Department of Defense personnel during the Vietnam War.

The Department of Energy moved in after then-President Jimmy Carter created the agency in 1977.

Several other buildings along Independence Avenue in the Federal Center section of Washington – so named for its panoply of federal offices – would hit the market as well.

Directly west of the Forrestal, one of the Agriculture Department's outbuildings on Independence is on DOGE's list for mandatory sale.

That building is at about one-quarter capacity and is in need of nearly $2 billion in upgrades or maintenance, Republicans said.

Ernst quipped the Agriculture building is the perfect ""fixer-upper"" to be on the market.

It houses the Department of Health and Human Services and would also be required to be put on the market within 18 months of the For Sale Act's passage.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development's headquarters is also on the list, as the curved X-shaped granite building, officially called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is ""underutilized,"" according to DOGE's rubric.

The Theodore Roosevelt Building, at the foot of Interstate 66 just west of the White House, along with the Frances Perkins Federal Building on the other side of the city, rounds out the list.

The legislation would also have safeguards against foreign entities buying up the buildings – as China and other rivals have purchased land by proxy very close to sensitive installations like a major Air Force base in North Dakota.

Additionally, any entity in which a foreign national is a ""beneficial owner"" would be prohibited from participating in any federal real estate sales.

Taxpayers shell out about $81 million to maintain underutilized or unutilized federal offices, according to a Biden-era report to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget.

About 7,700 federal office spaces are vacant and 2,200 are majority-empty, according to a Congressional Research Service report.

Annual maintenance on 277,000 federal buildings tops $10 billion per year, according to an April Government Accountability Office report.

Ernst and DOGE previously successfully mandated the sale of the aging Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building in Federal Center. Within its 1.2 million square feet, only 72 people were working there as of 2024. 

It formerly housed offices for Voice of America and the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors.

Nick Wright reacts to the scuffle involving Caitlin Clark in the Indiana Fever vs. Connecticut Sun game. He breaks down whether Clark's rising stardom is making her a target on the court and what it means for her future in the WNBA.

Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham is gelling quite nicely with her new teammates this season, and her pre-game outfit before Sunday's matchup against the Las Vegas Aces proves that point. 

Her shirt, in particular, had quite the cheeky message of just how tight she is with a certain duo. 

Cunningham, who has recently seen her popularity in the WNBA grow after defending Caitlin Clark on the court against the Connecticut Sun, donned a shirt with herself, Clark and fellow guard Lexie Hull on it with the words ""Tres Leches"" printed as well.

""Tres Leches"" translates from Spanish to ""Three Milks"" – as we said, quite the cheeky message from Cunningham. 

However, in the spirit of athletes showcasing their support and bond with teammates, Cunningham leaves no reason to doubt how much she loves her women in the locker room on and off the court. 

She was also doing it with her words recently, as she spoke in fiery fashion to reporters about having to physically defend Clark this past Tuesday against Sun players. She called out the WNBA and its referees for ""not protecting"" Clark. 

SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM CALLS OUT WNBA REFS FOR NOT PROTECTING CAITLIN CLARK AFTER STARTING FIGHT TO PROTECT HER

She got into a physical altercation with Jacy Sheldon after the latter poked Clark in the eye, which quickly led to a skirmish when Marina Mabrey shoved the reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year onto the hardwood. 

Cunningham, Sheldon and Sun guard Lindsay Allen were ejected from the game with about 40 seconds left after Cunningham fouled Sheldon hard underneath the basket on a fast break. 

""During that, it was just part of the game,"" Cunningham told reporters. ""I think the refs had a lot to do with that. It was a build-up for a couple years now of them just not protecting the star player of the WNBA. At the end of the day, I'm going to protect my teammates. That's what I do.""

(IMAGN)

Last season, while Clark was breaking rookie and league records, there was a lot of debate about whether the league was protecting her on the court, as teams got very physical with her to potentially disrupt her game.

Since Cunningham joined the Fever this season, she has been vocal even on the sidelines when Clark or any of her teammates are getting roughed up. Additionally, when she has checked into the game, Cunningham is sure to step between anyone who is messing with her teammates, as evident during the incidents with Clark. 

As a result of being a good teammate to one of the league's faces, Cunningham's popularity has skyrocketed, and that shows in her social media following. She had fewer than 400,000 followers on TikTok prior to last Tuesday's game against the Sun. She now has 1.3 million and counting on that platform. 

On Instagram, the number was more than 300,000, and it now stands at more than 839,000.

If Cunningham was not already showing herself as the Fever's ""enforcer"" enough, she has the credentials to back it up, as she is a black belt in Taekwondo. 

Cunningham and the Fever, though, want to win games as well as make a physical statement when needed. They have dropped back-to-back games now after losing to the Aces on Sunday, when she had nine points, six rebounds and one assist over 24 minutes.

Terron Armstead retired from the NFL after 12 seasons with the New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins, and he has not spared any details when explaining why now is the right time to step away from the game. 

It is the first time since he was 5 years old, a total of 28 years, that he will not be playing for a football team this fall. However, Armstead shared some grueling injury stories that led the offensive tackle to hang up his cleats. 

Why did the 33-year-old share his personal injury journey? Now on the outside looking in, he wants to be the voice for players going through similar situations in the NFL today.

""Now that I'm done, I would like to start sharing more of my stories because there's players that are actively playing who are dealing with similar situations,"" he told Fox News Digital at Fanatics Fest on Friday. 

""So, I want to be a voice for them and allow the fans to know that they can't necessarily speak on their injury. Because you never want to have those built-in excuses before a game, like, ‘I lost on this play because of my knee.' You know what I mean? Never want to have that.""

NFL PRO BOWLER SHARES DEVASTATING TOLL INJURIES TOOK ON CAREER: 'LITERALLY COULDN'T WALK'

For NFL fans, it sometimes gets lost in the heat of competition and highlight-reel plays how much of a toll the 17-game-plus season can take on a player's body, especially a lineman like Armstead. Years of training and competing on the gridiron takes its toll, and Armstead said his ailment was a knee injury he constantly had to battle through since his third year in the league. 

""I didn't see a practice field at all, and not because I didn't want to or the Dolphins just wanted me to rest. It's like I literally couldn't walk,"" he said during an appearance on the ""Nightcap Show.""

""After a game on Sunday, I wouldn't be able to walk on my own, under my own power, until Wednesday, Thursday. So, I was only able to play under the pain meds. I couldn't put any pressure on my knee, so it was like, I can't keep doing that to myself.""

So, no, Armstead is not going to be one of those retirees who will get the urge to get back on the field come Week 1. 

""I think I'm done, I'm at peace with it. I'm excited to be on this side to talk about the game, share my knowledge and experience.

""After being in the game for so long, and playing football for so long since five years old, it's definitely bittersweet. It's my first year without it after 28 years, so I'll see what this life is going to be like without football. I'm so grateful and appreciative for it, but I'm excited for my future.""

While he may be off the sidelines, Armstead still wants to make an impact on the game he loves dearly, especially for those players who continue to put their bodies on the line each year to hunt for a Super Bowl title alongside their teammates.

Ric Bucher weighs in on whether Kevin Durant can still be the #1 option on a championship roster. He breaks down Durant's current game, leadership, and if he has what it takes to lead a team to an NBA title today.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, welcomed Kevin Durant to his new home as the 15-time NBA All-Star was reportedly traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

The massive trade will see Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 overall pick in the 2025 draft and five second-round picks go to the Suns, ESPN reported. The trade will not be official until July 6, when the offseason opens in the league.

Cruz congratulated the Rockets for the deal in a post on X.

""Congrats to the #Rockets! Losing Brooks really hurts—he's ferocious on defense—but KD is an absolute beast,"" Cruz wrote. ""GREAT trade!""

Rumors of the Suns trading Durant swirled for weeks after the team missed the playoffs with a 36-46 record in one season under Mike Budenholzer. Phoenix believed adding Durant to a team with Devin Booker, and later Bradley Beal, could help elevate them back to the NBA Finals.

2025 NBA CHAMPIONSHIP ODDS: THUNDER REMAIN FAVORITES AFTER GAME 6 LOSS

Phoenix was unable to propel itself back to the NBA Finals, losing in the Western Conference semifinals during the 2022-23 season, being ousted in the first round in the 2023-24 season and failing to even make the postseason this year.

Durant, 36, has still proven to be one of the top scorers in the game when healthy. He averaged 26.6 points per game and shot 52.7% from the field. He has been an All-Star each year he has been available to play since the 2009-10 season. He missed the entire 2019-20 season with an injury.

It has been a busy offseason for the Rockets so far.

MIRED IN INFIGHTING, WITH TRUMP FULL SPEED AHEAD, DEMOCRATS CAN'T FIND THEIR WAY. This newsletter is about the current dreadful state of the Democratic Party. But begin with this extraordinary fact: At this time eight years ago, in the first year of Donald Trump‘s first term as president, the Russia special counsel, Robert Mueller, had already been appointed and had been investigating Trump for a month. What Trump calls the Russia hoax dominated media coverage. Commentators slandered Trump on a daily basis. Trump's job approval rating fell into the high 30s in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. In the White House, the new president was distracted and on the defensive, knocked back on his feet from his first moments in office.

On the other side, the Democratic strategy was attack, attack, attack. They had a lot of help; major news organizations and a host of cable news producers gave them an opportunity to speculate about Trump-Russia every hour of every day. The big-picture plan was for Mueller to serve as the investigative arm for a hoped-for impeachment of Trump. In the meantime, RussiaRussiaRussia dominated politics in 2017, 2018, and much of 2019. Trump lost a lot of what could have been his most productive time as president.

The point of bringing this up is to contrast the situation then with the situation today. Now it is the Democrats who are distracted and back on their feet, with the party engaged in bitter infighting and struggling to come up with a unified strategy to oppose Trump. Meanwhile, Trump is pushing forward on all fronts, setting the agenda — just look at the recent bombing of nuclear sites in Iran — and putting together one of the most consequential presidencies in years.

Part of the problem is that Democrats are still in a state of shock. Go back to last summer, when an internal coup resulted in President Joe Biden's departure from the reelection race. Then go to November, when the party was stunned to lose to Trump. Then go to January-February-March of this year when they were overwhelmed by Trump's audacious use of executive authority in his first months in office. Democrats are still playing catch-up.

Perhaps their biggest problem is that they don't have a big, unifying cause, like the Russia narrative, to use as a cudgel against the Trump administration. It is hard to overstate the daily damage the Russia affair did to Trump in 2017, and its absence today has left Democrats in a far weaker position than they were back then.

Of course Democrats are trying. Some have adapted the lawfare they perfected during Trump's time out of office; just this year, Democratic proxies have sued Trump or his administration around 300 times. The idea is to find a friendly judge — not too hard to do — to issue a nationwide injunction to stop Trump from doing whatever it is that Democrats oppose. The party has had a good deal of success so far, but it's a short-term strategy, especially when they file preposterous cases that will lose in the appeals courts.

Recently, we've seen a number of Democrats pursue a new effort to use 1960s-style civil disobedience to get themselves detained, arrested, handcuffed, or otherwise in trouble while bringing attention to what they say are the administration's lawless ways. LaMonica McIver, Ras Baraka, Brad Lander, Alex Padilla, and others have tried it — so many that the Washington Post recently published a story headlined, “For Democrats, handcuffs are the latest symbol of resistance to Trump.”

It's kind of funny, but not really — it's more an indicator of the Democratic Party's impotence in the face of the Trump presidency. And behind the embarrassing stories, Democrats have substantial problems that could render the party ineffective for quite a while.

First, it has fallen behind in the money race — according to recent reports, the Democratic National Committee has $18 million in cash-on-hand compared to $67.4 million for the Republican National Committee. A top finance official with the Kamala Harris campaign recently told the New York Times that the party's donors are seeing “headline after headline of incompetence and infighting, and I think that is a real problem not just for the DNC but for the larger Democratic brand.”

Another source close to the DNC told the New York Post, “We are six months in and we're drowning. We have no clear path or plan. The midterms are going to come before we know it, and then we're going to be really f***ed.”

Many of the problems — and the bad headlines — concern the leadership of new DNC Chairman Ken Martin. A longtime head of the party in Minnesota, Martin seemed qualified enough, but his early months have been marked, according to critics, by too much squabbling and putting money in the wrong places.

Martin got into a fight with David Hogg, the young progressive firebrand, and ended up complaining bitterly about Hogg's treatment of him. “You essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to,” Martin, his voice choking up, told Hogg on a party Zoom call in May. “The other night I said to myself for the first time, I don't know if I want to do this any more.” 

Once that became public, many Democrats must have wondered about Martin: This is the guy we chose to lead us in the incredibly tough battle against Donald Trump, and he's getting weepy because David Hogg said mean things about him? No wonder one DNC member told Politico that Martin seemed “weak and whiny.” To make things worse, two big-money union heavyweights, Randi Weingarten of the teachers union and Lee Saunders of the public employees union, have both left their positions in the party.

Finally, Democrats are still on the wrong side of a number of issues, like immigration, wokeism, and national security. At any moment, they seem in danger of taking another turn in the wrong direction. Take Tuesday's Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. Politico recently reported that “Centrist Democrats are sounding the alarm that a surging democratic socialist mayoral candidate … could further set back the party's already beleaguered national brand.” That candidate, Zohran Mamdani, who is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, is a walking nightmare for Democrats who hope to win back voter support nationally.

Back in 2017, in Trump's first months in office, Democrats, even though they had just suffered a devastating defeat in the 2016 presidential election, didn't spend as much time worrying about their brand. They had RussiaRussiaRussia to use against the new president, and a willing press to megaphone every wild accusation they could find. Of course, in the most fundamental sense, the Mueller investigation went nowhere when the special counsel could not establish that collusion ever occurred, much less that it involved any top Trump campaign officials. But that didn't happen until 2019, giving Democrats and their media allies ample time to cripple Trump's new presidency. Now, Democrats have lost again to Trump, but this time they are still searching for the magic issue to use against him.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against President Donald Trump bombing the nation's three nuclear sites.

“I can assure you the administration is actively and closely monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz and the Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision,” Leavitt told reporters during a gaggle Monday morning.

The Strait of Hormuz is a key water route for oil and gas, with any disruption likely leading to higher gas prices in the U.S. A quarter of the world's oil passes through the strait, which is roughly 100 miles long and 21 miles wide.

The press secretary's comments mirror Secretary of State Marco Rubio‘s statements, also warning Iran against closing the strait.

“It would be a suicidal move on their part because the whole world would come against them if they did that,” Rubio said on CBS News's Face the Nation on Sunday. 

The president floated the possibility of “regime change” in Iran after other U.S. leaders, including Vice President JD Vance, claimed the attacks against the Middle Eastern nation were not an effort to topple its leaders. 

“It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday. 

Leavitt further explained that Trump was raising questions about the future of Iran if it continues on its quest for nuclear weapons. 

“The President was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking,” Leavitt explained. “If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks — we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know — but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night.”

A suicide bombing on Sunday at a church in Damascus, Syria, reportedly left 22 people dead and 63 injured.

The attack occurred at the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church in the Dweil'a neighborhood of Damascus. As people were praying during the service, the suspected Islamic State group attacker entered the church, wearing a mask to cover his face, and opened fire on the Christians. When a crowd rushed at the gunman to try to stop him from shooting, he then detonated his explosive device, killing himself and others at the church while wounding dozens more, according to the Associated Press.

No group or organization has claimed responsibility for the attack as of Sunday. However, Syria's interior and foreign ministries blamed the suicide bombing on the Islamic State group.

“A suicide attacker affiliated with the Daesh (IS) terrorist group entered the Saint Elias church in the Dweila area of the capital Damascus where he opened fire, then blew himself up with an explosive belt,” according to a statement from Syria's interior ministry.

Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa called the attack cowardly and said that it ran counter to the virtues that bring people together.

“This cowardly act goes against the civic values that brings us together,” Mostafa said. “We will not back down from our commitment to equal citizenship … and we also affirm the state's pledge to exert all its efforts to combat criminal organizations and to protect society from all attacks threatening its safety.”

The suicide bomber did not act alone. According to eyewitnesses of the attack, at least two other people were involved. A church priest claimed there was a second gunman involved in the attack who was firing at the church before the suicide bomber detonated his device, the Times of Israel reported.

Another witness, who identified himself as Rawad, described his recollection of the attack to the Associated Press.

“He was shooting at the church … he then went inside the church and blew himself up,” Rawad said.

The attack drew widespread international condemnation.

“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said. “We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”

“On behalf of @POTUS and the American people, we would like to express our condolences to the victims, families, and individuals impacted by the terrorist attack today at Mar Elias church in al-Duwaileh,” said Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, in a social media post on X.

“These terrible acts of cowardice have no place in the new tapestry of integrated tolerance and inclusion that Syrians are weaving,” he added. “We continue to support the Syrian government as it fights against those who are seeking to create instability and fear in their country and the broader region.”

Geir O. Pedersen, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, expressed “outrage at this heinous crime” and categorized it as a terrorist attack on the church. He also attributed the attack to the Islamic State group and called for “a full investigation and action by the authorities.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

NATO members are bending over backward to get in President Donald Trump‘s good graces ahead of a summit that will invite questions about how much they contribute to their own self-defense.

Member nations, anticipating Trump's complaints about their defense spending, are poised to announce plans to commit 5% of their gross domestic product to defense as they meet in the Netherlands on Tuesday and Wednesday at The Hague.

But after Trump's abrupt departure from last week's G7 summit in Canada, new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, is not relying on defense targets alone to please the president.

Rutte, for example, has implemented Department of Government Efficiency-like spending cuts at NATO that echo the Pentagon‘s own efforts to streamline operations.

Although most NATO secretary generals try to introduce reforms, there is “definitely” a sense of urgency this year because of Trump, according to Kathleen McInnis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“It's safe to say that the NATO headquarters is taking a hard look at efficiencies because they want to make sure, be able to make the case to not just President Trump, but other heads of state and government, that they are being wise and efficient with the allocation of resources for NATO common budgets, and the headquarters, and things like that,” McInnis told the Washington Examiner. 

NATO also announced last week that the summit would be truncated to minimize the chances of Trump leaving The Hague early. The concluding communique, too, is expected to be similarly short at only five paragraphs and will emphasize defense spending and Russia as a “direct threat,” but not a pathway to membership for Ukraine.

NATO leaders, more broadly, have a strong sense of how the summit will go under Trump, given this will be his fifth as president.

“This will be the fifth time we have watched this movie,” said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, so “there's some understanding about what his priorities are.”

“Allies know that they show up, they remain focused on the things that keep the U.S. engaged rather than enraged, they shake hands, and they go home,” Rizzo told reporters during her think tank's pre-summit press briefing.

“To me, that's fine because, in my opinion, you know, joint communiques, they're important, but they are largely symbolic,” she added. “The real work happens when you leave, and you go back to your various capitals and you go back to NATO headquarters, and you start to implement the actual agreements that were agreed upon.”

There will be practical consequences for Ukraine after Trump did not meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky last week during the G7. Zelensky's presence at this year's NATO summit will be purposefully understated as well because of Trump, with the leader attending a pre-meeting dinner with Dutch King Willem-Alexander but having no sitdown confirmed with Trump.

Just last year, then-President Joe Biden made a public show of support for Ukraine with the summit in Washington, D.C., resulting in a new Ukraine mission, the NATO Support for Training and Assistance in Ukraine command, and a directive to draft a Russia strategy. That directive has since been delayed because of disagreements over how to deal with the Kremlin.

On the conflict with Russia and Ukraine's aspirations of joining NATO, Rizzo conceded: “Looking back at last year's summit, where the statement was that Ukraine's bridge to NATO is going to be short and well lit — well, it seems like that bridge is actually very long and dimly lit.”

Max Bergmann, the director for CSIS's Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program, downplayed concerns about Trump's commitment to NATO and multilateralism after his early departure last week from the G7, arguing “Europeans were already rattled” following statements from the administration on its desire to deprioritize Europe and NATO from the likes of Vice President JD Vance.

“Trump's departure from the G7 was sort of seen as perhaps necessary, given the events in Iran, but also a sign of Trump not caring that much,” Bergmann told the Washington Examiner during a briefing call with his think tank.

“I think where Europeans tend to come down is they are merely hoping to get through these summits with a sort of commitment to have another summit next year or in the future,” he added. “And they're just sort of hoping to kind of get through these events without sort of a broader rupture in the alliance.”

At the same time, there are hopes that Trump's expressions of frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead him to drive a harder line with the Kremlin, particularly as momentum builds in the Senate for sanctions on Moscow.

“The fact is, unless Putin can pull off a miracle and prove to Trump that he can give the Americans everything they want out of Iran without going to war, Trump will still be pulled back along with the American Senate and others into a confrontational relationship with Vladimir Putin,” said Benjamin Jensen, director of the CSIS Futures Lab.

“I know that Trump left the G7 early. I know his administration says disparaging things,” he added. “But I think it's better to really look at those larger structural conditions and the fact that even a smaller U.S. presence with intelligence support, long-range fires, and logistics still will help — with the new defense plans that were developed — Europe defend itself against an emboldened Russia.”

The summit's single, two-and-a-half-hour leaders meeting will underscore the 5% defense spending pledge, alongside discussions about the NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion framework.

Under that framework, NATO member states are working together to build their domestic industrial bases, encourage coproduction, and share best practices to spend 3.5% on hard defense capabilities, with the remaining 1.5% to be spent on other security-related needs and so-called “resilience” costs. 

Examples related to infrastructure are constructing bridges that can withstand the weight of tanks, cybersecurity, and space.

While Estonia, Greece, Poland, Turkey, and the U.S. are already close to spending 3.5% of their GDP on hard defense capabilities, Spain has undermined the 3.5% proposal, with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez advising his counterparts last week that his country “cannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP.” 

When asked about NATO's 5% defense spending pledge, Trump told reporters that the U.S. should not have to make the same commitment because it has been “paying almost 100% of the cost” for most of the alliance's history.

“NATO is going to have to deal with Spain,” he said Friday in New Jersey before a fundraiser. “Spain has been notorious for low pay. You know who else was a low payer? Just about the lowest. A place called Canada, because Canada said, ‘Why should we pay when the United States will protect us free?'”

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official described the defense spending pledge as “historic” because it will “strengthen the alliance's combined military capabilities and ensure greater stability in Europe and the world.” 

“This effort builds on the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending increases already achieved across the alliance since 2017 thanks to President Trump's diplomacy in his first term,” the administration official told reporters during a press call.

“The president will urge allies to revitalize their industrial capacities in order to create Western supply chains capable of producing the critical minerals, infrastructure, weapons, and other products necessary for the security of America and her allies,” the official added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Congressional Democrats and some Republicans have cried foul over President Donald Trump's ordered bombing of Iran‘s nuclear facilities on Saturday. Critics of the military operation claim that Trump did not have the constitutional authority to order the bombings and that it was a violation of power. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) argued to the contrary, specifically citing that Article II of the Constitution granted Trump the authority to do so.

Graham justified his decision Sunday in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's Meet the Press. Welker asked the Republican senator if he believed Trump should have received congressional authority before the bombing. Graham responded that Trump is in charge and that the country can't have “535 commander in chiefs.”

“What do you say to your fellow members of Congress who say that President Trump should have gotten congressional approval before taking this action?” Welker asked. “Did the president violate the Constitution by acting unilaterally?”

“No, he was within his Article II authority,” Graham replied. “Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can't be the commander in chief. You can't have 535 commander in chiefs.”

Graham said Congress could vote to eliminate funding for the president's actions but noted that it is the president's discretion to make such a decision. He also highlighted that other presidents made similar decisions regarding bombings and that when it comes to military actions, Congress is responsible for declaring war. Anyone arguing otherwise is wrong, according to Graham.

“If you don't like what the president does in terms of war, you can cut off the funding,” Graham said. “But declaring war is left to the Congress. We've declared war five times in the history of America. All of these other military operations were lawful. He had all the authority he needs under the Constitution. They are wrong.”

Welker referenced previous military conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, when presidents sought congressional authority. Graham rationalized that those were different and referenced recent times in which the president authorized military strikes without asking for congressional authority.

“Well, there's a lot of actions where the president didn't go to Congress,” Graham told Welker. “This was something that had to be done quietly. Last thing you want to do is come to Congress with an attack this sensitive.”

​​TIM KAINE PREDICTS WAR RESOLUTION WILL GET REPUBLICAN VOTES

Much of the concern over the United States launching strikes on Iran is that it will eventually lead to deploying troops to fight another war in the Middle East. When asked about “boots on the ground,” Graham dismissed such a thought and said he believed it would not come to that. Instead, he predicted that Israel would no longer tolerate a rogue Iranian regime that is dedicated to its destruction. Rather than the U.S. deploying its own troops, Graham predicted a persistent Israeli military offensive.

“I don't think I see boots on the ground in our future, but I do see Israel not stopping,” Graham said. “Israel is not going to live this way anymore. They're not going to be subject to missile attack every day and every night, living in bunkers. They're going to go after the heart of this regime. They're going to take it down one of two ways: make it change or replace it.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Just how much should you drink?

There is a lot of advice out there about how much alcohol one should drink. There is research suggesting that drinking could be dangerous, and research that indicates drinking is good for you.

Which is it? Obviously, too much drinking is bad for one's health — and drinking to excess can destroy the human body. But is moderate drinking good — or, at least, fine?

Dylan Scott, Vox's senior health reporter, has been looking into this matter for some time, and I recently asked him to sum up what he's learned. Here's what he had to say:

You've done some reporting on alcohol recently and whether it's safe. Is it?

There is widespread agreement that heavy drinking is not good for you — doctors and scientists have known for literally centuries that a lot of drinking is dangerous. 

And the more you drink, the greater your risk. Your risk starts to increase pretty exponentially once you're having more than one or two drinks at a given sitting, especially if you're drinking every day. 

There is still a lot of debate about the safety of drinking small amounts of alcohol and whether it can have very small health benefits. On that front, studies can seem to contradict themselves.

I talked to one scientist who has published some research documenting cardiovascular benefits from drinking a little bit of alcohol, and I also recently talked to the author of a 2017 statement from the leading cancer physician medical society, which was basically intended to be a wake-up call to the public that alcohol is a carcinogen. 

Yet those two people, despite appearing to be on opposite sides of the debate, would basically be in total agreement, about the negative consequences of more than one drink for a woman every day or more than two drinks for a man every day. 

Alcohol is a carcinogen? 

Yes, but let me take a step back. 

What has stuck out to me in reporting about alcohol is that the problem isn't so much the substance itself as it is widespread misunderstanding about what moderate drinking means.

That's 12 oz. of a 5 percent beer, 1.5-oz. glass of 80-proof liquor, and 5 oz. of a 12 percent glass of wine. 

There's a trope among doctors that most people think they're moderate drinkers but aren't thinking about those numbers as they drink. I might pour a glass of wine and think I'm having one glass of wine, but a doctor would see two glasses of wine if it's a really generous pour.

Coming back to your question, if you didn't know alcohol is a carcinogen, you're not alone. I learned in my reporting that only 40 percent of people know alcohol is a carcinogen, which shows there's still a lot of work to do in educating people about the health risks.

Public health experts told me that they want to be more vocal about some of alcohol's risks, especially about it being something that builds a dependency. Between that, and alcohol being a carcinogen, you can start to see why knowing what levels of drinking are actually moderate is really important.

That's interesting, and it makes me wonder about those headlines that claim a new study has found a glass of red wine a day is the key to longevity or something like that. Is there anything to those?

After my reporting, I do think there is some room for debate about whether a very modest amount of alcohol consumed in a very particular way might confer some small cardiovascular benefit.

That said, even the doctor I talked to who's authored studies finding some benefit, said, “This is not an elixir.” He was clear that his work shouldn't be read as saying, “Alcohol is going to reduce your chance of diabetes, improve your heart health, or what have you.”

So, you're saying I shouldn't start drinking, hoping it will make me a healthier person.

Yes. The doctors I've spoken to have said things like, “I would never tell somebody to start drinking because it's not going to help you.”

The basic thing to remember, though, is if you're a light drinker, any potential problems caused by alcohol aren't something worth worrying about. 

People should be aware of the risks but shouldn't panic about them. Really, my two big takeaways on alcohol are: Heavy drinking is dangerous, and it's easy to drink too much. Those are the things to watch out for.

The problem with pancreata.

Below is a graph showing a trend that exploded during the 2020s:

What is this depicting? Compute use for AI? Crispr gene edits per year?

No, this is another, much less-known example of massive growth these past several years. This is a chart of the number of pancreases (or, to use the correct plural, “pancreata”) collected each year from dead bodies in the US for research purposes:

How this happened is no mystery. The surge is, by all accounts, due to a regulation that took effect in 2021 focused on groups called organ procurement organizations (OPOs).

You probably haven't heard of OPOs, but if you or anyone you know has ever received an organ transplant, they're the ones who procured it. OPOs are nonprofit, nongovernmental bodies to which the US outsources the job of collecting organs from deceased organ donors. Each OPO has a monopoly on recovery of all organs in a particular geographic area; there are 55 groups, some of which only cover part of a state and some of which cover multiple states.

For some time now, critics have argued that OPOs are massively underusing deceased donor organs. One report from 2019 estimated that every year 28,000 usable organs (mostly badly needed kidneys but also pancreata, hearts, livers, etc.) are removed from deceased donors but never used; another put the number at 75,000. This, when the national waitlist for organs is more than 100,000 people long.

OPOs are not paid to collect these organs per se: They are entitled to 100 percent reimbursement of costs they report related to retrieving, preserving, and delivering organs, with ultimate payment coming from Medicare or transplant centers (which in turn charge Medicare and other insurers). This system, critics have long charged, does not provide enough incentive to procure harder-to-retrieve organs from patients who may be older or have certain medical conditions.

To get OPOs to collect more organs, the Trump administration in 2019 issued an executive order calling for new rules governing how the organizations are certified by the federal government, rules that were finalized two years later. This was high stakes: If an OPO loses certification, it has to shut down, and another OPO gets its territory. The rules were meant to more strictly grade OPOs on the share of organs they eventually transplant than the earlier, laxer rules did.

But there was a catch. In addition to organs recovered from deceased donors and transplanted, pancreata recovered and used for research would count toward recertification as well. Not any other organs for research — just pancreata.

What happened next can be see in the chart above: a massive, sudden surge in the number of research pancreata being recovered by OPOs, beginning in 2022, the precise year the new evaluation system took effect.

I've long been fascinated by this trend, which OPO critics call the “pancreas loophole” and OPO defenders describe as a perfectly legal response to overly onerous regulations. The numbers represent thousands of real, physical human pancreata, taken from real, recently deceased donors, that wouldn't have been taken from those bodies without this regulation.

I've tried in recent months to make sense of how this happened, and what it means. I'm not the only one; the Senate Finance Committee has been investigating, and released a report in early June on the problem.

There is still plenty that remains unknown about the fate of these pancreata (if you work at an OPO or research center and know more details, please email me). But what is clear is that they represent an approach by the federal government toward increasing organ supply that absolutely no one is happy with. If the point of the regulations is to help people in need — including the millions of Americans with diabetes, a disease of the pancreas — evaluating OPOs based on the number of pancreata they donate to researchers simply doesn't make any sense. 

But to understand how we started judging them this way regardless, you have to go all the way back to an obscure law passed in George W. Bush's first term.

Everyone knows, in broad strokes, what the heart or the lungs do. But the pancreas doesn't have the same level of fame. Its basic purpose is to excrete enzymes, hormones, and other compounds to both 1) help the body digest food and 2) regulate blood sugar levels.

The latter function is performed by the islets of Langerhans, cells in the pancreas (named after their discoverer, 19th-century German researcher Paul Langerhans) that secrete two different hormones: insulin (to lower blood sugar) and glucagon (to raise it).

In Type 1 diabetes, the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin is impaired and thus blood sugar levels are dangerously elevated; in some kinds of Type 2 diabetes, the body develops resistance to insulin's effects. Typically, people with diabetes deal with this through injecting insulin directly, a process that has become much more sophisticated in recent decades as finger pricks and needles have given way to insulin pumps that can directly measure and adjust blood sugar levels.

But even with advanced care, diabetes carries lifelong medical consequences, so researchers have long sought a more permanent fix: What if you could replace or supplement the faulty islet cells in patients with diabetes with healthy islet cells? Could you, then, cure diabetes at the source and avoid the need for insulin injections and the risk of long-term health effects altogether?

In the most extreme version of this approach, a complete new pancreas is transplanted into a patient with diabetes, like swapping out a faulty part. This is a proven treatment (915 occurred in 2023) and when done it works well, essentially curing the recipient's diabetes. 

But there are major downsides: you have to undertake major abdominal surgery with a small but real chance of failure, and if that succeeds, you have to remain on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of your life to prevent organ rejection. 

For that reason, physicians generally rule that the costs of a pancreas transplant outweigh the benefits for most people with diabetes. Living with an insulin pump is better than risking surgery and having a permanently compromised immune system. Very few of the 38 million Americans living with diabetes, then, are going to be candidates for a pancreas transplant.

This math changes, however, if the patient in question also needs a kidney transplant. Diabetes accounts for nearly half of all new cases of kidney failure, so a higher share of people with diabetes than people without find themselves in this situation. In these cases, since the patient is already going to have surgery and be on immunosuppressants, throwing in a new pancreas to the surgery and curing their diabetes in the same operation that cures their kidney failure begins to look like an attractive option. That's why almost no one gets a pancreas transplant in the US without getting a kidney transplant too.

For decades, researchers searching for effective diabetes treatments have experimented with an approach called islet cell transplantation.

Rather than transplant the whole pancreas, the procedure merely transplants insulin- and glucagon-producing islet cells into the recipient's liver. It's far less invasive, and can be done with local anesthesia and without an overnight hospital stay (though, skeptics argue, often less effective than whole pancreas transplantation too). If the islet cells come from a deceased donor, it does mean a lifetime of immunosuppression, but in “autograft” procedures, which use a subset of still-healthy islets from one's own impaired pancreas, immunosuppression isn't necessary.

Islet cell transplantation, though, remains little-used and mostly experimental in the US. Part of the reason why is regulatory: While pancreases are legally “organs,” and therefore excluded from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA has asserted its authority to also regulate islet cells as human tissues and to require premarket approval before they can be transplanted into a patient, just like a drug would. 

To gain such approval, it would be necessary to conduct clinical studies to demonstrate that the islet cells are “safe and effective”; once approved they would need to be produced in compliance with “good manufacturing practices.” To receive islet cells not approved by FDA, a patient would need to join a clinical study (if one is being conducted) or go to a country (including Canada, Australia, and several EU and Asian countries) with different regulations.

FDA's requirements have unsurprisingly slowed the islet cell transplant field down. The most recent data comes from 2021, when only 10 such procedures were performed in the US. In 2012, 111 were performed, but the number has steadily fallen ever since. It's orders of magnitude rarer than a whole-pancreas transplant.

But islet cell transplants have some champions, including politicians. In 2004, Congress passed, and George W. Bush signed, the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act. It was sponsored by Rep. George Nethercutt Jr. (R-WA), who said he was driven by his daughter's diabetes to try to expand access to islet cell transplants so patients could “live without being dependent on insulin injections.”

Nethercutt's bill sought to speed up research progress by, among other measures, ensuring adequate supply of pancreata for scientists. The law includes a provision stating, “Pancreata procured by an organ procurement organization and used for islet cell transplantation or research shall be counted for purposes of certification or recertification.”

That meant that when regulators in 2019 were reconfiguring certification rules for OPOs to encourage them to effect more transplants, they had to include a carve-out for pancreata used for islet cell research. The carve-out existed from the very first draft proposal that Trump's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released, and stayed into the final rule in 2021.

That rule's changes applied for evaluations of organ procurement organizations starting in August 2022. In the years 2018 through 2021, OPOs collected around 500–600 pancreata for research each year. In 2022, that figure was 1,432, a three-fold increase. In 2024, the number hit 2,053. The effect of the new regulation was clear.

It's important to note that there are no indications that the pancreata being collected by OPOs for research are cutting into the supply of pancreata for donation. The share of dead people whose pancreata are suitable for transplant is incredibly low, because of the exacting standards for donor age and health.

“Only a certain number of donors are going to be young enough (probably less than 50, maybe less than 45) and lean enough (maybe less than 30 BMI, probably less than 27 or 28),” Jonathan Fridell, a transplant surgeon and director of the pancreas transplant program at IU Health in Indianapolis, told me. “We're still going to look at the people that are older, still look at the people that are heavier, but the likelihood that they're going to have a transplantable pancreas is lower.” There are thus plenty of non-transplantable pancreata left over that could be used for research once the prime ones are taken away for surgery.

The problem with the surge in research pancreata, then, isn't that it's taking pancreata away from recipients who need them. It's subtler than that. By racking up large numbers of pancreata for research, OPOs are improving the grades they receive from federal regulators, and avoiding the risk of losing certification and having to turn over territory to another OPO. This grading and decertification process was meant to incentivize OPOs to collect more organs for transplant, especially kidneys, which are both easier to transplant than pancreata and more desperately needed. But the research pancreata provide a way around that incentive.

Calculate the grades that OPOs would get without these pancreata versus the ones they are getting now, and you'll find the results are radically different. 

CMS classifies OPOs into three tiers: 1, 2, and 3, with tier 3 OPOs facing decertification. Using data obtained from the organ procurement transplant network, we are able to calculate which tier each OPO would be in with and without their research pancreata based on their performance in 2023. The year that is actually binding for OPOs and determines whether they will be decertification is 2024, for which data does not yet exist, but the 2023 data gives us some indication of which OPOs are using pancreata to save themselves.

For two OPOs, including research pancreata meant they went from tier 3, which would result in decertification, to tier 2: Donor Network of Arizona, which covers that whole state; and OneLegacy, which includes most of Southern California including Los Angeles and Orange counties. Another, Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates, went from tier 2, where it could face pressure to improve performance, to tier 1, suggesting it excels.

These are not small institutions. OneLegacy is by far the largest OPO in the country by volume of organs collected and population covered. Its CEO, Prasad Garimella, earned $1.1 million in total compensation in 2023, the last year for which public IRS filings are available. It stood a real chance of being decertified if it did not meet the new organ collection standards. And it went from reporting 83 pancreata collected for research in 2021 to 441 in 2022 and 492 in 2023. An over fivefold increase, in one year — and no wonder, given its existence was at stake.

(In response to a request for comment, OneLegacy stated, “When recovering organs for transplant, OneLegacy will allocate pancreata to reputable islet cell research agencies only if they are not viable for transplant into patients. Over 99.6% of pancreata recovered by OneLegacy for research between 2018-2022 were allocated to two National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK) laboratories.”)

Again, the 2023 data is not binding. The 2024 data will be. But unless something changes with the way the government evaluates these pancreata, some major OPOs will avoid dire consequences for the sole reason that they started collecting hundreds of pancreata for research.

The increase is so obviously a result of the new rules that OPOs don't even bother to deny it. Responding to the Senate report earlier this month, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, which lobbies for the groups and against the CMS's stricter rules, said simply, “Today, pancreata recovered for research remain part of the performance evaluation metrics, and OPOs have operated in accordance with the rule.” In other words: yeah, we found a loophole. And what are you going to do about it?

It's an attitude that has pervaded the industry since the loophole came to light. In a listserv thread discussing the new rules, leaked to the Senate Finance Committee, an OPO employee wrote, “If you have a donor with only a pancreas for research, that is an organ donor for the Donor Rate. Otherwise, a donor is any donor with at least 1 organ transplanted. Savvy (or cynical?) OPOs ought to start a pancreas for research program immediately.”

But there's a question that remains unanswered: Where did all these thousands of pancreata go?

It is clear that the vast majority of research pancreata did not go into islet transplants. We are talking about thousands of organs, not the few dozen that plausibly could have been transplanted as part of islet procedures in the past couple of years.

Indeed, OPOs have admitted as much. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asks OPOs for data on organs recovered every year, and in August 2024 clarified that it would only count pancreata as “‘used' for research if they are accepted for use in bona fide islet cell research conducted by a qualified researcher, such as research approved by the National Institutes of Health.” It then asked OPOs to resubmit their data, clarifying which organs were for islet cell research specifically.

Once they did, the number of reported pancreata fell dramatically:

In 2023, the total went from 3,338 pancreata before the guidance, to 1,812 after, a drop of 46 percent. Some OPOs, like Legacy of Hope in Alabama, now reported zero pancreata for research; before the guidance narrowed qualifying purposes, Legacy of Hope had claimed 226 pancreata.

But even after the change in guidance, we're left with smaller numbers that are still much too big to be explained by bona fide islet cell transplants. There simply were not 1,812 islet cell transplants in the US in 2023, but there were 1,812 pancreata credited as donated for islet cell research. And that number is still over triple the number claimed in 2021, meaning the increase sparked by the new OPO rules largely remains even after the government's clarification. Research by David Goldberg, Erin Tewksbury, and Matthew Wadsworth has shown that the number of pancreata reported as recovered by OPOs also swamps the number that the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP), a consortium that collects and extracts islet cells from pancreata, reports receiving from these OPOs.

One of the points of the Senate investigation was to determine where exactly these pancreata went. The Senate Finance Committee, with the benefit of subpoena power, went about asking major OPOs for what actual purpose the research pancreata were used. The main answer they received was “we don't know.”

“Many of the OPOs stated that it is the responsibility of the research facilities or institutions receiving the pancreata to inform the OPOs on the purpose, methods, and efficacy of the research being conducted on the pancreata and other organs that OPOs supply,” the report states. In other words, OPOs themselves don't keep track. “Many of these OPOs,” the report continues, “have sent pancreata to biobanks and other institutions or facilities that hold pancreata for an unknown period to be used for purposes that may be undefined or nonexistent.”

Put another way: These pancreata could, for all the OPOs or the Senate knows, be sitting on a freezer somewhere, not transplanted into anyone. Or maybe not even sitting there at all. Greg Segal, an activist advocating for reform to the pancreas loophole, testified before a House committee that staff at one OPO, joked “that they're conducting research on the efficacy of garbage disposal A versus garbage disposal B” when disposing of pancreata.

Throughout all this, OPOs have had one consistent message: They've complied with the law, as they see it.

“Pancreata recovered for research remain part of the performance evaluation metrics, and OPOs have operated in accordance with the rule,” the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, the groups' lobbying shop in Washington, said in its statement after the Senate investigation was released. “When CMS issued clarifying guidance in 2024 limiting this metric to pancreata used for islet cell research, OPOs responded immediately and worked with the agency to validate data and ensure compliance.”

Jedd Lewis, CEO of the Organ Preservation Alliance and a decades-long veteran of the transplant field, notes that CMS's rule neglected to define what it means to use a pancreas for research, despite many OPOs and industry experts specifically flagging the problem for CMS before that rule took effect. And CMS's new guidance last year did little to solve the problem, he argues.

“Last years' memos simply identified the scope of pancreas donations that OPOs would be judged on as those for ‘islet cell research.' But CMS didn't define what that actually means …and on its face it's a huge scope of research,” Lewis wrote in an email. “There are so many … ways that researchers are looking at how those cells function: studying the pancreas whole, slicing it into thin sections, isolating the individual islet cells, even breaking the cells into the component parts.” That's all valuable research, he argues, and clearly relates to islet cells, even if the pancreata are never actually used in islet cell transplants.

Wadsworth, a coauthor on the study finding a surge in research pancreata and CEO of the LifeConnection OPO in northwest Ohio, concedes that counting pancreata that did not produce islet cells for transplant may technically be legal. But he still thinks it's wrong. 

“I worked with this surgeon early on in my career who said ‘just because you can do something doesn't mean you should,' Wadsworth noted. “Based on what's written, maybe they didn't do anything wrong, but you don't have to look far back in history to find examples where something wasn't illegal, but it definitely wasn't right either.”

LifeConnection, Wadsworth says, was able to comply with the spirit of the CMS regulations by finding counties in its jurisdiction where low numbers of organs were being procured, and working on fixing the problem hospital-by-hospital. It's harder than just harvesting pancreata, but it means organs get transplanted to people who need them.

One irony of the controversy is that most OPOs, and their representatives, don't believe that research pancreata should count for their evaluations. “AOPO has concerns about including pancreata utilized for research in the data used to calculate the numerator of either proposed measure,” the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations wrote in an early 2020 comment as the regulations were being developed. “The utilization of pancreata for research is driven by demand of local researchers. Inclusion of pancreata for research in the data utilized for the numerator may skew comparisons of OPOs in that category and potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.”

But both the OPOs and their regulator, CMS, were bound by the 2004 law requiring that research pancreata, at least that for islet cell research, must count for these evaluations.

We are running out of time to fix this problem. If nothing changes, OPOs will be evaluated on the basis of data they've submitted now, including hundreds of pancreata that were never used for islet cell transplants. Whether you think that reflects OPOs complying in good faith, or subverting the system, it's not a policy anyone should think makes much sense.

CMS has some ability to act here — but perhaps the best fix would come from Congress in the form of a legal provision clarifying the 2004 act. Simply repealing the provision restricting how OPOs can be evaluated would be simplest — but even better would be pairing it with a legal change that could help islet transplantation research far more than the 2004 has to date.

Recall that islet transplants currently don't count as organ transplants in the US. They count as treatments with biological tissue ““If islet cells are solely organs, because they are a subpart of the pancreas, which is an organ under transplant law, then the FDA should not have jurisdiction,” Gail Javitt, a veteran lawyer working on FDA regulatory issues at the firm Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, told me. “However, FDA has taken a different position, that islet cells are a cellular therapy and must undergo premarket approval just like a drug would.” If you want to use it for treatment of a patient, you have to go through them. That has had the practical impact of slowing down the availability of islet cells for transplantation in this country.”

Legally clarifying that islet cells are organs, not cellular therapies, and that they are excluded from FDA oversight then, could go a long way to promoting the treatment. Last Congress, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Matthew Rosendale (R-MT) each introduced bills making this change, with exclusively Republican co-sponsors.

But this need not be a partisan issue at all, and if you paired this provision with a repeal of the 2004 law permitting OPOs to count pancreata for research as part of its transplant metrics, you could arrive at a close to ideal system. OPOs would be evaluated on their ability to transplant islet cells, because they'd be organs like any other. They would not be able to get higher ratings by recovering pancreata for research that might just languish on a shelf.

This does require Congress to make a small change. But it's a small change that should be basically uncontroversial. There's nothing for most OPOs or for advocates trying to maximize donations to dislike here, and there's lots for islet cell researchers to love. It's a small fix that could go a very long way.

Videos reveal the hidden lives of animals in the borderlands and how the wall affects them.

The border wall between the US and Mexico is, of course, a barrier meant to prevent human migrants from crossing into America as they seek work, family, or refuge from violence. 

It's also a significant barrier to ranging wildlife. 

The border wall, a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's agenda, cuts through a rugged, unique ecosystem home to hundreds of native species, from jaguars and pumas to black bears and deer. These animals often need to move to survive, whether to find a source of water or a mate. 

We know the wall is impassable for many species, potentially lowering their chance of survival. How exactly the border affects this rich ecosystem, however, has largely been a mystery. 

A new study, among the first of its kind, finally offers some answers — by essentially spying on animals near the border. For the research, ecologist and lead author Ganesh Marín, then a doctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, set up 85 motion-sensing cameras in northeastern Sonora, Mexico, along and south of the US border in Arizona and New Mexico. Throughout the course of the research, when animals walked by, the cameras began recording. 

Over roughly two years, from 2020 to 2022, the cameras captured hundreds of hours of footage, including more than 21,000 clips with mammals, said Marín, a National Geographic Explorer and postdoctoral scientist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Partners. 

“This place is so special because you see these tropical species, like ocelots and jaguars, at the same time as beavers and black bears,” Marín told me earlier this year when I was reporting on borderland jaguars. 

Some of the recordings are pretty incredible. In this clip, for example, a young puma, or mountain lion, makes a chirping sound, likely calling for its mother. 

Or check out this jaguar approaching the camera. This particular cat is known as Bonito. Scientists first detected this cat in 2020 and can identify him by his markings. 

Marín's cameras detected another jaguar, as well, called Valerio. He was seen by cameras multiple times in a protected area known as Cuenca Los Ojos just south of the border in Sonora. 

The camera traps caught black bears and their cubs… 

…bobcats and coyotes… 

…and even an ocelot, an elusive predatory cat. 

Analyzing the videos ultimately revealed several important details about wildlife in the borderlands. Marín found that large mammals, such as black bears and deer, as well as some smaller herbivores, spend less time near the border than in other, more remote stretches of his study region. That suggests these animals avoid border infrastructure. 

Other species, like the pronghorn, which have been seen on the US side of the border, didn't appear in his cameras at all. That may be because they have trouble crossing a highway that runs roughly parallel to the border in Sonora, according to Marín and his co-author, John L. Koprowski, a biologist at the University of Wyoming.

Meanwhile, smaller common predators like coyotes and bobcats appeared more tolerant to human activity: They were more likely to use habitats with cattle, cars, and dirt roads, according to the footage. 

The study adds to a growing body of research showing that the border and infrastructure around it is disrupting wild animal communities.

“Amazing wildlife is present in the borderlands due to the binational efforts to protect and restore the flow of life between both countries,” Marín said in an email. “We should not define this beautiful region and the creatures that roam by the existence of an imposed division.”

And six other big questions about the bombing, explained.

The United States bombed Iran on Saturday night, joining an Israeli-led offensive aimed at demolishing the Iranian nuclear program. The American assault targeted three facilities associated with the program at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow — the last of which was widely seen as too fortified for the Israelis to disable without American help.

President Donald Trump, addressing the nation on Saturday night, claimed that the US had won a great victory. The attacks were a “spectacular military success,” he said, that “totally obliterated” Iran's nuclear program. No future strikes were planned unless Iran retaliated; if it did, Trump warned, “future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.”

But it is very far from clear how true any of this is. We do not yet have conclusive evidence on the damage done to Iranian facilities, and there is at least some reason to believe that key elements of the program escaped US and Israeli bombs.

More broadly, the nature of the US-Iran relationship is long and difficult, with so much mutual distrust and hatred on both sides that it's easy to imagine scenarios by which what's designed to be one-off strikes escalate into something much bigger.

What follows is an attempt to help you understand the big questions swirling around the US-Iran fighting: what we know about the bombing itself, to be sure, but also the deeper context and history necessary to understanding why America is willing to risk yet another war in the Middle East.

By far the most important reason both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump struck now is a perception among their countries' respective security establishments that, in recent months, Iran — suddenly and surprisingly — became vulnerable.

Both countries' security establishments have long seen Iran as an enemy. In particular, Israel has argued that Iran getting nuclear weapons would be disastrous — greatly strengthening a serious foe and, at worst, jeopardizing Israel's very existence. 

Yet war with Iran has long been seen as a fearsome prospect. Iran had funded and cultivated formidable proxy forces — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — that would be sure to unleash their arsenals on Israel if war broke out. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was also a longtime ally of Iran, and any prolonged Israel-Iran conflict would involve Israel repeatedly flying over Syrian airspace and potentially draw Syria into the war too.

In retrospect, Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel ended up triggering a chain of events in which all of those obstacles fell away, one by one.

First, Israel went into Gaza and killed thousands of Hamas militants (in addition to causing enormous civilian casualties). Second, last September, Israel decimated Hezbollah with its “exploding pager” attack and other operations. Third, in December, Assad's regime suddenly collapsed, and the rebels who took over have not seemed to be spoiling for a fight with Israel. (Separately, Iran's air defenses had also been badly weakened due to Israeli strikes last year.) 

So basically, US and Israeli military planners believed that the Iranians were sitting ducks — and had far less ability to retaliate. The logic went: They're vulnerable, so why not stop them from getting nukes now?

Still, Trump remained reluctant to green-light an attack, and when Israel went forward with one, he initially kept his distance. But the quick success of Israel's strikes seemingly confirmed Iran was quite weak. Hawks argued to Trump that this was a golden opportunity to easily destroy Iran's nuclear program with little or no cost to American lives, and he decided to give it a shot. 

—Andrew Prokop

According to the Pentagon, US B-2 bombers dropped 14 30,000-pound “massive ordinance penetrator” (MOP) bombs on the Iranian enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow while submarines launched Tomahawk missiles at a third site at Esfahan. On Saturday night, Trump declared that the three sites had been “totally obliterated.”

The following day, Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine was a bit more cautious, telling reporters, “final battle damage [assessments] will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction.”

Satellite images show heavy damage at all sites, but initial Israeli assessments suggest that the site at Fordow — located deep underground — was not completely destroyed. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that, given its location, the level of damage at Fordow was impossible to assess without access to the site. 

Perhaps more importantly, analysts are skeptical that the Tomahawk missiles were enough to destroy the underground tunnels at Esfahan, where the bulk of Iran's uranium stockpile was believed to have been stored, and it's possible that much of the stockpile was relocated prior to the airstrike. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio conceded in an interview on Sunday that “no one will know for sure for days” whether the uranium was moved. 

Iran's nuclear program definitely suffered a major, perhaps devastating, setback, but the status of its uranium stockpile and its ability to rebuild its destroyed infrastructure are still unknowns. 

—Joshua Keating

Last week, an Israeli airstrike destroyed two 1970s-era, US-made F-14 fighter jets, which were still in the Iranian air force's inventory: a reminder that the US and Iran had once been military partners. 

That changed in 1979 when Iran's pro-American autocratic ruler, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown and the regime known as the Islamic Republic, which still rules Iran today, was established. 

Resentment of the US ran deep among the revolutionaries: The CIA had organized a coup that overthrew Iran's democratically elected government in 1953 and backed the Shah's autocratic regime in the years that followed. The revolution's hardline religious ideology sought to rid Iran and its region of American political and cultural influence. “Death to America” and “death to Israel” have been popular chants at pro-government rallies in Iran since the revolution. 

Shortly after the Shah's overthrow, radical Iranian students overran the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage for over a year. Relations between the two countries never recovered. 

The US imposed tough economic sanctions against Iran and backed Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime during the long and devastating Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. During the 1980s, Iran began building a network of proxy groups to advance its interests throughout the Middle East. Most notable was the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, responsible for the 1983 bombing of a US Marine barracks in Lebanon that killed more than 240 US troops. 

After the US invasion of Iraq, Iranian-backed militia groups carried out hundreds of attacks on US troops, often using Iranian-designed improvised explosive devices to devastating effect. The Pentagon has blamed Iran for the deaths of at least 600 US troops during this period. US troops in the Middle East still periodically come under fire from Iranian proxy groups, including, most recently, Yemen's Houthis. 

Though the US has long been alarmed by Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the country was included in George W. Bush's “axis of evil” along with Iraq and North Korea, the last four US administrations have avoided taking military action against Iran's nuclear program, instead relying alternately on escalating economic sanctions and diplomatic negotiations in an attempt to head off an Iranian bomb. 

—Joshua Keating

Trump's attack on Iran came after months of factional infighting on the US right. On one side were the hawks: the traditional GOP establishment, who wanted aggressive action against those they deemed America's enemies, including Iran. On the other side was an upstart “America First” faction — informally led by Tucker Carlson and Vice President JD Vance — that feared being pulled into another Middle Eastern war that doesn't truly serve America's interests. 

The two groups battled for months over administration appointments, while their outside allies argued in the press. 

Initially, it seemed the America Firsters had won Trump over. In contrast to the “maximum pressure” sanctions of his first term, he began his second term claiming he wanted serious negotiations over their nuclear program. In April, Trump reportedly waved off an Israeli proposal to strike and pursued talks instead.

But the hawks soon struck back, uniting around a demand that any deal should not allow Iran to pursue any nuclear enrichment whatsoever — a demand Trump soon echoed. No deal on those terms materialized, Trump eventually decided he wouldn't stand in Israel's way anymore, and now he's sent US bombers into the fray too. The hawks are overjoyed.

—Andrew Prokop

The US intelligence community had previously assessed that Iran halted its efforts to build a nuclear weapon in 2003, but international monitors say Iran has also been dramatically increasing its uranium enrichment activities since 2018, when Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions. And while officially, Iran has insisted that it's only seeking a civilian nuclear program, officials in Tehran have also been talking more openly about the value of actually having a nuclear weapon. 

In May, the International Atomic Energy Agency assessed that Iran had amassed a stockpile of 408 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent. Just 42 kilograms could be enough to build an atomic bomb if enriched to 90 percent, a relatively simple technical step. US officials had said that Iran could produce enough uranium for a bomb in one to two weeks and build a weapon in just a few months.

But acquiring the ability to build a bomb and actually building one are not the same thing. In March, Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, testified to Congress that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini [sic] has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.”

The government of Israel, which has long advocated military action against Iran's nuclear program, was not so confident. In recent weeks, they had reported gathered intelligence leading them to believe Iran's nuclear weapons program had reached a “point of no return”. According to reporting by the Economist, this included evidence that Iranian scientists had squirreled away quantities of nuclear material that international inspectors were unaware of, and that these scientists had met with commanders of Iran's missile program about producing a weapon. 

The Wall Street Journal and other outlets reported last week that US intelligence agencies had not found the Israeli evidence convincing and stood by the assessment Gabbard had shared in March that Iran had not made a decision to build a nuclear weapon. 

This may be a difference in interpretation rather than evidence: Rather than waiting for Khamenei to make an active decision, the Israelis appear to have believed that they had to act once it got to the point that there was no guarantee they could stop it in time if Iran did rush for a bomb. 

In any event, Trump now appears to find the Israeli case more compelling than that of his own intelligence agencies. Asked about Gabbard's statement last week, Trump said, “I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having a weapon.”

—Joshua Keating

So far, Iran's military response to both US and Israeli attacks has been underwhelming. Tehran is clearly hobbled by the damage Israel did to its proxy militias, Hezbollah and Hamas, and its ballistic missiles are not capable of threatening the Israeli homeland in the way that many fear.

But there are two things Iran hasn't tried that are, after American intervention, more likely to be on the table.

The first is an attack on US servicemembers stationed in the Middle East, of which there are somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 at present. Of particular note are the US forces currently stationed in Iraq and Syria. Iraq is home to several Iranian-aligned militias that could potentially be ordered to directly attack American troops in the country or across the border in Syria.

The second is an attack on international shipping lanes. The most dangerous scenario involves an attempt to use missiles and naval assets to close the Strait of Hormuz, a Persian Gulf passage used by roughly 20 percent of global oil shipping by volume. 

If Iran either kills significant numbers of American troops or attempts to do major damage to the global economy, there will surely be American retaliation. In his Saturday speech, Trump promised that if Iran retaliates, “future [American] attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.” An effort to detonate the global oil market would, without a doubt, necessitate such a response: the US cannot allow Iran to hold its economy hostage.

We do not, to be clear, know whether Iran is willing to take such risks — or even if they can. Israeli attacks have devastated its military capabilities, including ballistic missile launchers that allow it to hit targets well beyond its borders. 

—Zack Beauchamp

It is all too easy to see how these initial strikes could escalate into something much bigger — if Iran's nuclear program remains mostly intact, or if Iran retaliates in a way that forces American counter-escalation. 

The strike could escalate into a war if the strikes did not fully succeed and the United States decides to finish the job, committing itself to, at minimum, an indefinite bombing campaign — and at most a war of regime change. Or the United States and Iran could become locked in an escalating cycle of violence, with retaliation from Iran provoking more attacks from the United States.

It's also possible neither occurs, and this stays as limited as currently advertised. Key decision points are ahead, like whether Trump orders another round of US raids on Fordow or Iran tries to close the Strait of Hormuz — and it's hard to know which choices the key actors in Washington, Tehran, and Jerusalem will make. 

—Zack Beauchamp

Two charts that show how the attack on Minnesota lawmakers is part of a dangerous trend.

A series of high-profile incidents of political violence — targeting members of both major political parties — have grabbed the nation's attention.

Earlier this month, a gunman shot two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers in their homes. State Rep. Melissa Hartman and her husband were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were injured.

In April, a man who allegedly “harbored hatred” for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro set fire to the Democrat's home while he and his family were sleeping inside.

President Donald Trump faced two assassination attempts during his 2024 campaign. A former Coast Guard officer who identified with Antifa, a far-left antifascist militant movement, was also arrested earlier this month for issuing violent death threats against Trump. 

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

In October 2022, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked by an assailant who broke into their home looking for her. 

And on January 6, 2021, rioters descended on the US Capitol to stop the certification of Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, threatening to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence for allowing it to move forward.

It might feel like, based on the severity and frequency of these headline incidents, American political violence is surging. Members of Congress appear to think so: Lawmakers from both parties are now asking for more funding to enhance security and investigate and prosecute more threats made against them.

But while there are signs in the data that indicate political violence is indeed on the rise, depending on how you define it, it's challenging to determine exactly by how much. 

“It's more anecdotal than anything else,” said Katherine Keneally, director of threat analysis and prevention at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “There's some data to back up that the tensions are increasing and creating a more volatile environment, but to say it's increased by X amount since 2023 is a little trickier.”

A volatile political environment and changes in social media policies that have caused misinformation to spread more quickly appear to be what's driving the increase, at least in part. But understanding the root causes requires ascertaining the scale of the problem in a way that researchers have struggled to capture comprehensively. 

There are all sorts of difficulties associated with measuring political violence. 

First, there's the definitional dilemma of what incidents to include when counting acts of political violence. For instance, some might count arrests for disrupted plots; others might not. 

Then, there is the challenge of actually gathering the data. Some sources may overly rely on media reports in an era when local news is under-resourced and might not reliably record every incident. And in the US, individuals unaffiliated with armed groups have become the primary perpetrators of political violence. That makes political violence even harder to track because perpetrators are often interacting in fragmented, low-transparency spaces online, from private chats to forums, rather than congregating in a single organized group. 

Despite the difficulties with measurement, some sources — particularly those looking at specific forms of political violence — suggest that overall levels of political violence have increased in recent years. 

US Capitol Police have been recording concerning statements and direct threats made against members of Congress, their families, and their staff since 2017, seeing significant spikes after the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections.

Researchers at Princeton University's Bridging Divides Initiative also recorded a similar spike in threats to local officials in 2024. 

In 2025 so far, they identified more than 170 total incidents across nearly 40 states, with national issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and the war in Gaza being major bipartisan drivers. About a quarter of them involved hate speech. And in a sign of how political discourse has devolved, about 20 of them involved local officials threatening or harassing each other. 

However, researchers acknowledge that they are only scratching the surface and that a broader analysis of the threat environment must begin well before anyone reaches the point of directly threatening to harm someone or actually harming them.

“The data only looks at the point at which people successfully conduct acts of violence,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. “I think we need to start far earlier in the process and far more holistically to really capture the root causes of this issue, which is rhetoric.”

American political violence looks different now than it did during major periods of political upheaval in the past.

In the 1970s, it was driven predominantly by far-left, anti-war groups such as the Weather Underground, which were primarily engaged in the destruction of property. But the nature of political violence, as well as its perpetrators, has changed in the decades since.

“I think the modern iteration of mainstream right-wing political violence is targeting individuals, mass violence, targeted assassinations, which I think takes on a very different tenor than the destruction of property,” Lewis said. 

There are several reasons for this shift, with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and hate speech online being a major one.

“We're in a very pretty difficult position in the country right now.”

Content moderation on mainstream social media sites was never a complete cure for that, but studies have suggested that it was a mitigating factor. Twitter (now X), Meta, YouTube, and others have scaled back content moderation staff or rolled back policies designed to root out misinformation that might motivate political violence. In the months after Elon Musk bought X and implemented those policies, hate speech on the platform rose by 50 percent, according to a study by researchers at the University of California Berkeley, UCLA, and the University of Southern California.

“I think that we really need to recognize the fact that there is a significant subset of people, especially online, especially on these social media platforms, that do not share our common understanding of reality,” Lewis said. “If you spend your weekend on Twitter, which I would not recommend doing, you would genuinely say that the suspect [in the Minnesota shootings] shot these Democratic politicians because they went against the leftist, Marxist party line.”

In truth, federal prosecutors have declined to state a specific motive. But if anything, the evidence suggests he identified with the far-right rather than the far-left: His friends described him to Fox News as a Trump supporter, his social media posts embraced extreme anti-abortion views, and he had a hit list of 45 elected Democrats.

There's also, according to researchers, a cultural shift — and not a healthy one.

People also now seem more willing to see political violence as a solution to the policies and beliefs they disagree with, regardless of party affiliation, Keneally said. 

During the 2024 presidential election, polling from NORC and the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats found 7 percent of Americans agreed that the “use of force is justified” to help Trump claim the presidency; 10 percent said it was justified to prevent him from doing so.

Now that Trump is president again, many communities feel under threat from his policies, which may make them more accepting of political violence. A March Scientific American survey of predominantly Democratic voters at two major protests found that about a third said political violence may be necessary to “save” America. It's worth noting that these respondents aren't representative of Democrats overall, but it shows that acceptance of political violence isn't just a right-wing phenomenon.

“We're in a very pretty difficult position in the country right now,” Keneally said. “I think this combination of this changing political environment, social media, and people feeling like they don't have any other solution is making it at least feel like it's worse.”

Global investors are on alert about a 90-mile sea passage in the Middle East, fearing that any block of the Strait of Hormuz could derail global shipping and oil.

Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply after the US struck Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday, prompting fears of retaliation from Tehran. Beyond concerns about defense and security, markets are concerned about the fallout for oil prices and the global economy should Iran block shipping in the Strait of Hormuz — a threat Tehran has repeated for years.

""If Iran chooses to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, it'd be categorically negative,"" Kyle Rodda, a senior financial markets analyst at Capital.com, told Business Insider.

""In the worst-case scenario, it would be incredibly impactful: higher fuel prices, higher inflation, slower growth, and interest rates higher than where they'd otherwise be,"" Rodda said.

One of the most geopolitically sensitive maritime routes, the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles across at its narrowest point. It connects the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, with Iran to its north and the United Arab Emirates and Oman to its south.

According to the US's Energy Information Administration, the Hormuz is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, carrying about 20 million barrels of oil a day.

Most energy shipments through the Strait of Hormuz have no other means of exiting the Persian Gulf, the starting sea point for major oil producers like Saudi Arabia to export their energy to the rest of the world.

About a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquified natural gas trade moves through the Hormuz, so any disruption to shipping would hit the energy markets hard.

""The bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities by the US over the weekend increased supply risks significantly for the oil and LNG market,"" wrote Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy at ING, on Monday.

Iran doesn't have the legal authority to shut down marine traffic in the Hormuz. But it could disrupt the movement of vessels by other means, for example by damaging oil and shipping infrastructure.

On Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against the US's action. The final decision still lies with the country's top security officials, according to Iran's state-owned Press TV.

Analysts said they think an Iranian blockade is probably more about political posturing than real action.

""While the headlines sound dramatic, the reality is that Iran's parliament holds no executive power over military or strategic decisions, particularly not ones with such far-reaching geopolitical and economic consequences,"" Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, told BI.

""Iran is well aware that any direct disruption to global oil flows through the Strait would likely trigger a significant military and economic response, possibly escalating the conflict beyond its control,"" she added.

The US is an energy giant and has become a net energy exporter since 2019, so it's less prone to physical supply shock from a blockade of the Hormuz.

However, the US could still be hit by the fallout from worsening global economic conditions.

""Any negative impact would be through deteriorating financial conditions or through higher for longer rates as the Fed has another reason to delay cuts,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a Monday note.

Asian countries would be the most affected by a blockade of the Hormuz, said Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova.

In 2024, over 80% of crude oil, condensates, and LNG that moved through the Hormuz headed to Asia, according to the EIA.

""Asia, which consumes the lion's share of Middle Eastern oil, would be most vulnerable, with India, Japan, South Korea, and China facing logistical uncertainties and costlier re-routing,"" said Sachdeva.

In 2023, a third of the oil that passed through the Hormuz headed to China, Bloomberg calculated.

South European countries dependent on Gulf oil could also face higher import costs, although Saudi Arabia and the UAE can reroute significant volumes of such exports via pipelines and via a pipeline and the UAE port of Fujairah.

Energy is a key input cost, so any gains in oil prices are likely to drive up inflation broadly.

The US's strike on Iran sent oil futures up to a five-month high late on Sunday. Oil prices are now up about 10% since Israel's strikes on Iran in June.

These developments are taking place amid the summer driving season, when US gas demand peaks. Should the gains in oil prices be sustained, pump prices are likely to rise in the weeks ahead.

According to the EIA, the price of gas typically rises by 2.4 cents per gallon when crude oil prices rise by $1. This translates into a gain of about 20 cents per gallon at current levels for oil futures.

The limited Austin rollout fell far short of the company's pitch that a generalized, scalable solution is imminent.

Driverless?

Photographer: Tim Goessman/Bloomberg

 For Tesla Inc., the distance between a disastrous robotaxi launch and a merely disappointing one was just a foot or two. The “safety monitor” who was sat in the front passenger seat of the handful of Tesla robotaxis that began operating in a limited part of Austin on Sunday was the contradictions of Elon Musk's autonomous ambitions made flesh.

 To be clear, it is sensible to have a human driver ready to intervene when robotaxis first get out on the road; just as Waymo LLC, owned by Alphabet Inc., did. Whether they sit in the actual driving seat or a short distance away on the passenger side makes little practical difference, provided they can still stop the vehicle or reach across and adjust the wheel if necessary.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The head of one of the world's most valuable gold miners believes there's only one reason to buy a gold mining stock — and too few companies in the industry are offering it to investors.

“The only reason you want to buy an equity is if it gives you a better return than just buying gold,” Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Ammar Al-Joundi said in an interview with Bloomberg.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Germany is planning to lift core defense spending to 3.5% of gross domestic product over the next five years as part of a massive increase in government investment in the military.

The boost in defense outlays will help Germany meet the NATO alliance's new goal of committing at least 3.5% of GDP to defense, up from 2% currently. An additional 1.5% in military-related spending will be required to reach the 5% benchmark that US President Donald Trump has demanded — and which NATO members are set to back at this week's summit in The Hague.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Iran said US strikes on its nuclear sites over the weekend have delivered an “irreparable blow” to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — a bedrock, international agreement preventing the spread of atomic bombs.

Iran's envoy for the International Atomic Energy Agency, Reza Najafi, described US attacks as an act of aggression that “delivered a fundamental and irreparable blow to the international non-proliferation regime conclusively demonstrating that the existing NPT framework has been rendered ineffective.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Israel-Iran War:

Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced “absolutely unprovoked aggression” against Iran, as he met a top official from Tehran the day after the US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Putin described the attack as “totally unfounded and unjustified” as he met Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in the Kremlin on Monday. The Russian leader added that he wanted to discuss with the Iranian envoy “how to get out of today's situation.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Iran on Monday launched what its armed forces called a ""powerful and destructive missile strike on the United States' Al-Udeid military base in Qatar.""

Explosions were heard in the skies over Doha, the capital of Qatar. The Al-Udeid Air Base is located near Doha.

Qatar's Defense Ministry said its air defense had successfully intercepted the missile attack on Al-Udeid, and that there were no reported deaths or injuries.

NBC News reported that U.S. forces were braced for an imminent attack from Iran on sites in Iraq and Bahrain.

The attack came two days after U.S. B-2 bombers and cruise missiles struck nuclear development facilities in Iran.

The price of crude oil fell in trading on Monday after news of the attack broke.

Qatar closed its airspace shortly before the attack was reported.

President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine, and other officials were in the White House's Situation Room monitoring developments in the Middle East.

Trump visited the U.S. base in Qatar in mid-May.

Qatar's Foreign Minstry spokesman, in a statement on X, said, ""We express the State of Qatar's strong condemnation of the attack on Al Udeid Air Base by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, and consider it a flagrant violation of the State of Qatar's sovereignty and airspace, as well as of international law and the United Nations Charter.""

""We affirm that the State of Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner proportional to the nature and scale of this blatant aggression and in accordance with international law,"" the spokesman said.

President Donald Trump on Monday demanded that ""everyone"" keep oil prices down or they would play ""into the hands of the enemy,"" as the conflict in the Middle East escalates following U.S. strikes on Iran.

""EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!,"" the president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

U.S. crude oil was down 75 cents, or 1.02%, to $73.09 per barrel in the wake of Trump's post. Global benchmark Brent fell 73 cents, or 0.95%, to $76.28 per barrel.

Trump's message comes after the U.S. bombed Iran's key nuclear sites over the weekend, putting the world on edge that the Islamic Republic might target energy supplies in the Middle East and cause a spike in global oil prices.

It wasn't clear who specifically Trump was speaking to in his post, though he seemed to be addressing the U.S. oil industry. Some oil companies had warned earlier in the year that they might have to cut production after prices tumbled to multiyear lows on Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ boosting supply.

""To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!,"" Trump said in a subsequent post on Monday. Oil production decisions in the U.S. are made by private companies in response to market dynamics. The Energy Department does not drill for oil.

""As the President said, producers must keep oil prices down or risk playing into the hands of the enemy,"" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said when asked who Trump was addressing.

The oil market has been largely unfazed by the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, with futures trading largely flat through much of Monday morning. Brent had jumped more than 5% on Sunday evening to crack $81 before easing. WTI also reached its highest levels since January before pulling back.

In this article

Novo Nordisk on Monday said it is ending its collaboration with Hims & Hers due to concerns about the telehealth company's sales and promotion of cheaper knock-offs of the weight loss drug Wegovy. 

Shares of Hims & Hers fell roughly 28% on Monday, while Novo Nordisk's stock fell more than 6%.

Novo Nordisk in April said it would offer Wegovy through several telehealth companies such as Hims & Hers to expand access to the blockbuster injection now that it is no longer in short supply in the U.S. 

The end of the Wegovy shortage meant compounding pharmacies were legally restricted from making and selling cheaper, unapproved versions of the drug by May 22 – with rare exceptions. Telehealth companies have said patients may still need personalized compounded versions of Wegovy in situations where it's medically necessary.

But Novo Nordisk on Monday said Hims & Hers has ""failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs"" under the ""false guise"" of personalization. The drugmaker also accused Hims & Hers of ""deceptive"" marketing that is putting patient safety at risk.

""We expected that the efforts towards compounding personalization would diminish over time. When we didn't see that, we had to make a choice on behalf of patients,"" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, told CNBC. ""We've been firm all along that patient safety is our primary focus.""

""Our expectation was that [Hims & Hers'] business focus would transfer toward real, safe, approved medications,"" he said. Moore said Novo Nordisk will not incur any fees from terminating the collaboration, as it was established through a third-party that manages the drugmaker's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy

In a statement on X, Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said the company is ""disappointed to see Novo Nordisk management misleading the public.""

Dudum said in recent weeks, Novo Nordisk's commercial team has ""increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients."" He added Hims & Hers plays a role in protecting the ability of providers and patients to control individual treatment decisions, and ""will not compromise the integrity of our platform to appease a third party or preserve a collaboration.""

He said Hims & Hers will continue to offer several treatments, including Wegovy, to allow providers to meet the individual needs of patients.

In a note on Monday, Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight said the end of the collaboration increases Hims & Hers' legal risk ""substantially."" He added that he was surprised the partnership, when initially announced, did not include any efforts to curb the telehealth company's compounding efforts.

During Food and Drug Administration-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug. 

But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.

Novo Nordisk said it will continue offering the branded version of Wegovy through telehealth organizations that ""share our commitment to safe and effective medical treatment for patients living with chronic diseases.""

Moore said Novo Nordisk has seen several other mass compounding pharmacies reduce or stop making and selling Wegovy knock-offs. He added that the company will ""engage on the legal front"" and with the FDA to ensure that illegal compounding diminishes.

In a release on Monday, Novo Nordisk said it conducted an investigation that found the active ingredients used in Wegovy knock-offs sold by telehealth companies and compounded pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China. The drugmaker also cited a report from the Brookings Institution in April, which found that a large share of those Chinese suppliers were never inspected by the FDA, and many that were inspected had drug quality assurance violations. 

""These medicines that are coming into our country from sources around the world are not even approved in those countries that they originated, and it's a problem,"" Moore said.

More tankers are reversing course away from the Strait of Hormuz as concerns rise on the possible closure of the vital choke point of trade.

Yui Torikata, senior liquid market analyst at industry data firm Kpler, said the situation is fluid.

The firm's data is showing a notable event occurred between early Sunday and early Monday, when at least six vessels — two very large crude carriers, three chemical tankers, and one refined products carrier—diverted their courses away from the Strait of Hormuz.

The specific vessels identified are:

All vessels are in ballast, meaning they either are empty or carrying light loads.

""However, the situation has already evolved,"" Torikata said. ""As of this morning, three of those six vessels —the South Loyalty, Coswisdom Lake, and Damsgaard — have again changed direction and are now heading back towards the Strait of Hormuz. The other three vessels are currently idling off the coasts of Khor Fakkan and Muscat.""

""This specific weekend event should be seen in a broader context,"" Torikata said. ""In the immediate wake of the Israel-Iran conflict, the number of available empty [ballast] crude carriers within the Middle East Gulf zone fell to a record low, indicating significant reluctance from shipowners to enter the area. However, that trend has since reversed.""

""The count of available tankers recovered toward the weekend, and the number of crude carriers in the Gulf of Oman signaling their intent to enter the Mideast Gulf has also recovered from the low seen on June 16,"" she added. ""This suggests that, for now, the overall flow of vessels into the region is being sustained despite the recent, specific diversion event.""

The moves follow a U.S. attack Saturday on what have been identified as three major nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran.

Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said the reports by the UK Maritime Trade Operations on widespread electronic interference and GPS jamming and location spoofing are adding to vessel owners' worries.

Frontline tanker Front Eagle and dark fleet tanker Adalynn collided last week near the Strait of Hormuz. Following the collision, a fire on the deck of the Front Eagle erupted and was extinguished.

""Combined with increasing insurance costs, some owners will simply avoid the area — like Frontline,"" Lipow said.

The tanker company recently said it would stop accepting new contracts to sail through the Strait of Hormuz.

""Other companies are likely to follow its lead,"" shipping publication Lloyd's List wrote in a recent report on the Frontline decision.

""This causes a de facto partial supply disruption if there is a lack of tankers to carry the oil that needs to be exported,"" Lipow said.

""Some tanker owners may feel that China, who buys 90% of Iranian crude oil along with significant quantities of oil from the Middle East, is pressuring Iran not to disrupt shipping,"" Lipow added. ""While oil exports are Iran's economic lifeline and it would not be in Iran's interest to halt its own exports, if cornered, Iran might decide to inflict as much economic pain as it can on the rest of the world.""

Iran's parliament voted on Sunday to block the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report from Iran's state-owned Press TV that CNBC could not independently verify. A final decision rests with the country's national security council.

British maritime security firm Ambrey issued an alert that five U.S.-affiliated merchant ships departed the Arabian/Persian Gulf since the U.S. military operations, and no ships publicly affiliated with the U.S. appear to have entered the area since the U.S. strikes. ""Ambrey is aware of at least five merchant ships that were destined to enter the Arabian/Persian Gulf but about-turned or chose to wait,"" it wrote. 

Ambrey added that at least two of these ships did not have a public U.S.-affiliation, indicating broader concern in the market. Meanwhile, it noted several U.S.-flagged merchant ships that have gathered in UAE territorial seas. Ambrey's view of the situation is that Iran is ""almost certain to respond militarily to the U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities. This is likely to include attacks or seizures of US-affiliated shipping,"" it wrote.

Lipow said the conflict could spark additional geopolitical instability.

""While China has condemned the United States attack on Iran, we have not seen China provide Iran with any kind of support other than words,"" Lipow said. ""Russian attacks Ukraine, the United States attacks Iran, now China may feel emboldened to attack Taiwan.""

Jakob Larsen, head of security at Bimco, the world's largest direct-membership organization for shipowners, charterers, shipbrokers and agents, warned Iran could attempt a wider disruption of commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz through attacks on merchant ships. Anti-ship missiles or drones of both airborne and surface types could be used in these attacks, he said.

""The laying of sea mines would constitute another dangerous development, but Iran's intent to do so is questionable due to the risk to Iran-affiliated commercial ships and the risk of environmental disaster in case a ship is damaged,"" Larsen said.

The Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points. The inability of oil to traverse through, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays.

In 2023, oil flows through the waterway averaged 20.9 million barrels per day, accounting for about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Hormuz handles less than 4% of global container trade, but the ports of Jebel Ali and Khor Fakkan in the UAE are critical intermediary points for global shipping networks in the region.

The majority of cargo volumes from those ports are destined for Dubai, which has become a hub for the movement of freight with feeder services in the Persian Gulf, South Asia and East Africa.

Correction: This article was updated to correct the spelling of the Strait of Hormuz.

Health plans under major U.S. insurers said Monday they have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations – a process that is often a major pain point for patients and providers when getting and administering care.

Prior authorization makes providers obtain approval from a patient's insurance company before they carry out specific services or treatments. Insurers say the process ensures patients receive medically necessary care and allows them to control costs. But patients and providers have slammed prior authorizations for, in some cases, leading to care delays or denials and physician burnout.

Dozens of plans under large insurers such as CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Humana, Elevance Health and Blue Cross Blue Shield committed to a series of actions that aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers, according to a release from AHIP, a trade group representing health plans. Though the companies cheered the changes, they could cut into profits if they lead to patients using care more often.

""The American health care system must work better for people, and we will improve it in distinctive ways that truly matter,"" said Steve Nelson, president of CVS' insurer, Aetna, in a statement. ""We support the industry's commitments to streamline, simplify and reduce prior authorization.""

Insurers will implement the changes across markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans. The group said the tweaks will benefit 257 million Americans.

The move comes months after the U.S. health insurance industry faced a torrent of public backlash following the murder of UnitedHealthcare's top executive, Brian Thompson. It builds on the work several companies have already done to simplify their prior authorization processes. 

Among the efforts is establishing a common standard for submitting electronic prior authorization requests by the start of 2027. By then, at least 80% of electronic prior authorization approvals with all necessary clinical documents will be answered in real time, the release said. 

That aims to streamline the process and ease the workload of doctors and hospitals, many of whom still submit requests manually on paper rather than electronically. 

Individual plans will reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. 

""We look forward to collaborating with payers to ensure these efforts lead to meaningful and lasting improvements in patient care,"" said Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, in the release. 

UnitedHealthcare, in a statement, said it ""welcomes the opportunity to join other health insurance plans in our shared commitment to modernize and streamline the prior authorization process.""

The company said it builds on its previous efforts, including steps to reduce the number of services requiring prior authorization. It also includes UnitedHealthcare's national Gold Card program, which recognizes and awards providers who ""consistently adhere to evidence-based care guidelines"" by reducing their total prior authorization requests.

In this article

Tesla's Model Y robotaxi finally hit the road this weekend, sending shares of the electric vehicle maker up 10% on Monday.

The EV giant debuted autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, opening the service to a limited number of riders by invitation only.

Those invited included longtime Tesla fans, promoters and shareholders, many of whom generate income from posting Tesla- and Musk-related social media content on platforms including X and YouTube.

CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social network X that customers were charged a flat fee of $4.20 per ride.

""Super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!! Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla,"" he said in a post.

One passenger in Tesla's early access program for the Model Y robotaxis wrote on X that they did 11 rides with the service with ""zero issues."" Musk reposted numerous firsthand encounters with the services.

Other road users and researchers observed the robotaxis appearing to violate traffic rules in Austin.

The Verge reported a Tesla Model Y robotaxi briefly traveled the wrong way down a road in Austin. Tesla-critical author Ed Niedermeyer shared a video from Austin showing a Tesla robotaxi braking hard in the middle of traffic in response to ""stationary police vehicles outside its driving path.""

Musk has long promised a Tesla robotaxi fleet to investors, amping up the pressure to deliver in recent months.

Once considered a pioneer, Tesla is now trying to catch up to Alphabet's Waymo in the West, and Chinese competitors including Baidu's Apollo Go, WeRide and Pony.ai. Waymo has reported that it is now delivering more than 250,000 commercial driverless rides per week and surpassed 10 million trips last month. Apollo Go reported that it has surpassed 11 million trips.

Musk told CNBC's David Faber last month that Tesla aims to have ""hundreds of thousands, if not over a million"" self-driving cars in the U.S. by the end of next year. In May, Musk first announced plans to launch the service in Austin, with later debuts set for Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Heading into the launch, Tesla faced pushback from a group of Democratic lawmakers in Texas and public safety advocates who urged the company to delay the debut.

The company has not yet released the systems being tested on Texas streets, known as FSD Unsupervised, to general Tesla owners.

Tesla sells its new EVs with partially automated driving systems marketed as the standard Autopilot, and premium FSD Supervised systems. These include features such as automatic lane-keeping and navigation, and have been linked to accidents, including fatalities, according to data tracked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Iran may be threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz but experts told CNBC that it's also the one with the most to lose.

In major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country's parliament on Sunday approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report from Iran's state-owned Press TV that CNBC could not independently verify. 

The step would risk alienating Tehran's neighbors and trade partners.

The decision to close the waterway now rests with the country's national security council, and its possibility has raised the specter of higher energy prices and aggravated geopolitical tensions, with Washington calling upon Beijing to prevent the strait's closure.

Vandana Hari, founder of energy intelligence firm Vanda Insights, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" that the possibility of closure remains ""absolutely minimalistic.""

If Iran blocks the strait, the country risks turning its neighboring oil producing countries into enemies and risks hostilities with them, she said.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration revealed that Iran had shipped 1.5 million barrels per day via the Strait of Hormuz in the first quarter of 2025.

Furthermore, a closure would also provoke Iran's market in Asia, particularly China, which accounts for a majority of Iranian oil exports.

""So very, very little to be achieved, and a lot of self inflicted harm that Iran could do"" Hari said.

Her view is supported by Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research at advisory firm Signum Global Advisors.

Iran will not want to antagonize China, he said, adding that disrupting supplies will also ""put a target"" on the country's own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime ""at a time when there is little reason to doubt U.S. and Israeli resolve in being 'trigger-happy.'""

Clayton Seigle, senior fellow for Energy Security and Climate Change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that as China is ""very dependent"" on oil flows from the Gulf, not just Iran, ""its national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait.""

There are currently there are no indications of threats to commercial shipping passing the waterway, according to the Joint Maritime Information Center. ""U.S. associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption, which is a positive sign for the immediate future.""

The Strait of Hormuz is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and about 20% of the world's oil transits the waterway. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the ""world's most important oil transit chokepoint.""

""Iran's operations in and around Hormuz are unlikely to be 'all or nothing' – but instead move along a sliding scale from total disruption to none at all,"" said Signum's Bishop.

""The best strategy [for Iran] would be to rattle Hormuz oil flows just enough to hurt the U.S. via moderate upward price movement, but not enough to provoke a major U.S. response against Iran's oil production and export capacity,"" he added.

On Sunday, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a post on X that pump prices in the U.S. could climb to $3.35-$3.50 per gallon in the days ahead, compared to the national average of $3.139 for the week of June 16.

Should Iran decide to close the strait, it would likely use small boats for a partial blockade, or for a more complete solution, mine the waterway, according to David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy.

In a Sunday note, S&P Global Commodity Insights wrote that any Iranian closure of the strait would mean that not only Iran's own exports will be affected, but also those of nearby Gulf nations, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.

That would potentially remove over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets, and affect regional refineries by causing feedstock shortages, the research firm said. The disruption to supply will impact Asia, Europe as well as North America.

Besides oil, natural gas flows could also be ""severely impacted,"" S&P said, with Qatar's gas exports of about 77 million metric tons per year potentially unable to reach key markets in Asia and Europe.

Qatar's LNG exports represent about 20% of global LNG supply.

""Alternative supply routes for Middle Eastern oil and gas are limited, with pipeline capacity insufficient to offset potential maritime disruptions through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea,"" S&P added.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia pointed out that ""there is limited scope to bypass the Strait of Hormuz."" Pipelines in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have only a spare capacity of 2.6 million barrels a day between them, while the strait oversees the transport of an estimated 20 million barrels of oil and oil products per day, the bank said in a note.

All these present upside risk to energy prices, with Goldman Sachs estimating that the market is pricing in a geopolitical risk premium of $12.

If oil flows through the strait were to drop by 50% for one month and then were to remain down by 10% for another 11 months, Brent is forecast to ""briefly jump"" to a peak of around $110, Goldman said.

Brent oil futures currently stand at $78.95 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures were trading at $75.75.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

The race to create publicly traded bitcoin treasuries is accelerating — and so is the capital pouring in.

ProCap Financial, the latest entrant, has raised more than $750 million and is going public through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I, according to an announcement Monday.

Led by investor and podcast host Anthony Pompliano, ProCap raised more than $750 million in its funding round, including $235 million in convertible debt, with equity making up the rest. The new firm aims to hold up to $1 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet and generate revenue through a full-stack, bitcoin-denominated financial services platform.

The rush into bitcoin treasuries — inflated by cheap capital, yield promises, and brand name endorsements — is starting to resemble a bubble.

""There's an old George Soros quote that goes, 'When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire,'"" Pompliano said. ""There's a reason the bubble forms — because the trend works.""

ProCap joins a growing cohort of bitcoin-heavy ventures using reverse mergers and blank-check vehicles to tap into public markets.

From Trump Media's $2.5 billion bitcoin treasury plan to Jack Mallers' Twenty-One and the Nakamoto fund, a growing number of firms are racing to offer stock market exposure to bitcoin.

Some, like Tron founder Justin Sun, are using reverse mergers to take crypto businesses public — in Sun's case, folding his blockchain platform into a Nasdaq-listed toy manufacturer. Others, like Mallers, are launching purpose-built bitcoin holding firms backed by heavyweight investors including Tether and SoftBank.

While Trump Media isn't a crypto-native firm, it has embraced the playbook of raising money to buy bitcoin and promoting the asset through affiliated ventures.

All are following a path blazed by Strategy's Michael Saylor: Turning public companies into bitcoin proxies.

But ProCap says it's pushing beyond that model, aiming not just to hold bitcoin but to build a financial services platform on top of it.

""Most other firms raised capital that's just sitting in cash while they wait for deals to close,"" Pompliano told CNBC. ""We're buying bitcoin immediately.""

He added that ProCap's equity investors are getting direct exposure from day one.

The structure gives ProCap a rare first-mover edge in a space where many deals are still weeks or months from closing, with some yet to even file their S-4s — the regulatory documents required to complete a merger. It also sets the stage for a new phase of the bitcoin proxy trade: not just holding bitcoin, but generating yield from it.

""We want to build the leading bitcoin-native financial services company,"" Pompliano said. ""Like a traditional Wall Street firm, but on top of a bitcoin balance sheet instead of dollars.""

ProCap plans to offer services like lending, trading, and capital markets — all denominated in bitcoin. The goal is to recreate the architecture of a Goldman Sachs or Cantor Fitzgerald, rebuilt from the ground up in crypto.

""The goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution,"" he added. ""That resonates very differently with capital allocators.""

ProCap's pitch to investors is that it's not just chasing momentum. It's building the infrastructure for what Pompliano calls a new financial system — one that runs on bitcoin, but looks and feels familiar to the institutions still sitting on the sidelines.

""Many companies don't care about the cost of capital. We do,"" he added. ""We're traditional capital allocators — we care about building a sustainable business that generates cash flow.""

Russia's response to Iran's call for help is being closely watched on Monday after the U.S. bombed Tehran's nuclear facilities over the weekend — but Moscow might not be quick to offer its ally a hand.

The attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, which President Donald Trump described as an ""obliteration,"" has left the Islamic Republic scrambling for support from the few friends it has on the global stage. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi headed to Moscow on Monday for ""serious consultations"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin over how to answer the assaults.

Iran has helped Russia with military drones throughout the war in Ukraine, but analysts now say there might be very little Moscow can or will to do to reciprocate.

""Iran has massively supported Putin's war against Ukraine with weapons and technology. On his trip to Moscow, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi may now ask Moscow to return the favour,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in a note Monday.

""However, Putin has probably little to offer beyond some words. He needs his weapons himself for his continued aggression against Ukraine,"" he noted.

Russia also has to tread a fine line between placating and assisting ally Iran and keeping the U.S. sweet, as it looks to re-establish ties with Donald Trump's Russia-friendlier administration.

""If Putin were to annoy Trump over Iran in any significant way, Trump may change tack and impose new heavy sanctions on Russia and/or weaken Putin's position in other ways,"" Schmieding said.

So far, Moscow's response to the escalating crisis has been muted, with Russia calling on Iran and Israel to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis.

The Iranian conflict could strengthen Russia's position in Ukraine modestly, analysts say, as it distracts Western attention — and potentially resources — away from Ukraine. Higher oil prices could also mean more export revenue for oil producer Russia's war coffers.

At the same time, Russia is watching on as another Middle Eastern ally is weakened, eroding its own foothold in the region in the process. Russia has already seen one valuable alliance crumble recently by way of last year's ousting of Bashar al Assad's regime in Syria putting the future of Moscow's air and naval bases in the country in doubt.

Russia stands to further lose out on potentially lucrative investments and infrastructure projects, if Iran is severely destabilized. The issue for Moscow is to now gauge how much it has to win or lose by helping or abandoning Iran.

""Moscow itself appears to be undecided what to make of a new war in the Middle East,"" Nikita Smagin, an expert on Iranian foreign and domestic policies at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in analysis.

""On the one hand, Russia has invested heavily in various projects in Iran over the past three years, all of which could now go to waste. At the same time, Moscow hopes to benefit from Middle Eastern instability through rising oil prices and declining interest in Ukraine.""

Ruling out the possibility of Russia giving Iran any military assistance, Smagin said the bigger issue for Moscow is the threat to all the Iranian ventures it has actively invested in recently, including oil and gas projects, infrastructure and transit routes.

""A few days before the start of the Israeli operation, the Iranian ambassador to Moscow said that Russia was the country's largest foreign investor in 2024. The ambassador did not specify any investment volumes, but Russian investments were estimated at $2.76 billion the previous year. Moscow planned to invest about $8 billion in oil and gas projects alone,"" Smagin said.

""Now the future of those projects is in doubt.""

The U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran might seem like a geopolitical flashpoint that would send markets tumbling. Instead, investors are largely shrugging off the escalation, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained — and even bullish for some risk assets.

By 9:30 a.m. in London on Monday, the MSCI World index, which tracks over a thousand large and mid-cap companies from 23 developed markets, was just 0.1% lower.

European shares pared early losses to trade in firmer territory, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 marginally higher following a sell-off at the open. U.S. stock futures also ticked higher, with futures tied to the S&P 500 gaining 0.2%.

Safe-haven assets also saw a muted response. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note gained 2 basis points, while spot gold shed 0.2% to trade at around $3,359 per ounce. The safe-haven Swiss franc was last seen flat against the U.S. dollar, which rose against several currencies on Monday morning.

In general, the market reactions after the U.S. strikes have been less aggressive, especially relative to just over a week ago when Israel launched airstrikes against Iran.

""The markets view the attack on Iran as a relief with the nuclear threat now gone for the region,"" said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush, adding that he sees minimal risks of the Iran-Israel conflict spreading to the rest of the region and consequently more ""isolated.""

While the gravity of the latest developments should not be dismissed, they are not seen as a systemic risk to global markets, other industry experts echoed.

On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the United States had attacked Iranian nuclear sites. Traders are now keeping a close eye on any potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities.

Iran's foreign minister warned that his country reserved ""all options"" to defend its sovereignty. According to Iranian state media, the country's parliament has also approved closing the Strait of Hormuz, a pivotal waterway for global oil trade, with about 20 million barrels of oil and oil products traversing through it each day.

""It all depends on how Iran responds,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. ""If they accept the end of their military nuclear desires… then this could be the end of the conflict and markets will be fine,"" he told CNBC. Boockvar is not of the view that Iran will carry out the disruption of global oil supplies.

The worst-case scenario for markets would occur if Iran were to close the Strait, which is unlikely, said Marko Papic, chief strategist at GeoMacro Strategy.

""If they do, oil prices go north of $100, fear and panic take over, stocks go down ~10% minimum, and investors rush to safe havens,"" he said.

However, markets are subdued now given the ""limited tools"" that Tehran has at its disposal to retaliate, Papic added. 

The idea of shutting down the Hormuz waterway has been a recurring rhetoric from Iran, but it has never been acted upon, with experts highlighting that it is improbable.

In 2018, Iran warned it could block the Strait of Hormuz after the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions. Similar threats were made earlier in 2011 and 2012, when senior Iranian officials — including then-Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi — said the waterway could be closed if Western nations imposed more sanctions on Iran's oil exports due to its nuclear activities.

""Tehran understands that, if they were to close the Strait, the retaliation from the U.S. would be swift, punitive, and brutal,"" Papic added.

In a similar vein, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni said the latest events have not shaken his conviction in the U.S. bull market.""Geopolitically, we think that Trump has just reestablished America's military deterrence capabilities, thus increasing the credibility of his 'peace through strength' mantra,"" he said, adding that he is targeting 6,500 for the S&P 500 by the end of 2025.

While predicting geopolitical developments in the Middle East is a ""treacherous exercise,"" Yardeni believes that the region is in for a ""radical transformation"" now that Iranian nuclear facilities have been destroyed.

Fireworks could kick off during NATO's annual summit this week, as the U.S. pushes its allies to sharply increase their defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP).

The 5% figure is made up of 3.5% of GDP that should be spent on ""pure"" defense, with an extra1.5% of GDP going to security-related infrastructure, such as cyber warfare capabilities and intelligence.

While member states say they're happy to hit that milestone, and some countries are not too far off that mark, others don't even meet the 2% threshold that was agreed over a decade ago.

While they might pledge to increase defense spending, whether these promises materialize will be the key question.

Talk is cheap and timelines can be vague — but concerted action is what the U.S. and President Donald Trump, who's attending a NATO summit for the first time since 2019, will want to see.

NATO members on Sunday agreed in principle to a big increase in their defense spending, Reuters reported, but Spain has already pushed back.

After diplomats on Sunday agreed on a compromise text pertaining to the spending rise, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Spain would not have to meet the 5% target as it would only have to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet NATO's core military requirements.

""We fully respect the legitimate desire of other countries to increase their defense investment, but we are not going to do so,"" Sanchez said in an address on Spanish television, according to the news agency. 

""The U.S. is looking for everybody to say, 'Yeah, we mean it. We have a plan. 5% is real. We're going to get there',"" Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and distinguished fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said Wednesday.

""But one thing to watch for is if the messaging is actually on point. Some of the messaging from some of our European allies, at least when they back brief their own media and their own parliaments is, 'Yeah, 5% but it's really 3.5% and 1.5%, and that can be pretty much anything' ... So there's going to be a whittling down [of defense spending pledges] almost immediately,"" Volker noted at a CEPA briefing ahead of the NATO summit.

""And if that is over emphasized, you're going to have a clash with the U.S.,"" Volker added.

The stakes are high as allies meet in The Hague in the Netherlands on June 24-25, given ongoing conflict in Ukraine and war in the Middle East threatening to destabilize the global economy.

Defense analysts say this year's meeting could be the most consequential in the alliance's 77-year history, with the U.S.' spend-pushing heavily forewarned before the summit.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was emphatic as he said 5% ""will happen"" at a separate NATO gathering earlier this month, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte also widely plugging that message to allies too.

Defense spending has been a thorny subject for NATO members for years, and a persistent source of annoyance and anger for Trump, who was demanding that allies double their spending goals from 2% to 4% of GDP all the way back in 2018.

NATO defense expenditure has nevertheless sharply picked up among NATO members since Trump was last in power.

Back then, and arguably at the height of the White House leader's irritation with the bloc, only six member states met the 2% target, including the U.S. Times have changed, however; by 2024, 23 members had reached the 2% threshold, according to NATO data.

While some greatly surpassed that target — such as Poland, Estonia, the U.S., Latvia and Greece — major economies including Canada, Spain and Italy have lagged below the contribution threshold. No NATO member has so far reached the 5% spending objective, and some are highly likely to drag their feet when it comes to getting to that milestone now.

The U.K., Poland and Germany have already said they intend to increase defense spending to the requisite target, but their timeline is unclear. The UK is also reportedly trying to delay the spending rise among by three years, according to the i newspaper. CNBC has reached out to Downing Street for comment.

Spain and Italy are seen as major holdouts against the 5% target, after only committing to reach the 2% threshold in 2025. Canada meanwhile spent 1.3% of GDP on defense in 2024, NATO estimates suggest, even less than Italy, Portugal or Montenegro.

Spending 5% on defense is a target, but not a given, Jason Israel, senior fellow for the Defense Technology Initiative at CEPA, said Wednesday.

""Every single country ... is trying to figure out how they're going to thread that needle of being able to make the commitment, but also make the accounting work when every single nation has to make trade offs against what is generally unpopular, massive increases in defense spending,"" he noted, stressing it's a ""long way from commitments ... to actual capability,""

European aerospace and defense companies are following NATO spending commentary and commitments closely, but say they're stuck in limbo between pledges and action by way of concrete government procurement.

The leaders of Leonardo, Embraer and Saab told CNBC last week the continent needs to act decisively and collectively to make long-term commitments to defense spending and investment contracts to enable companies like theirs to scale-up their production capacity and manufacturing capabilities.

""If we go for 3.5% [of pure defense spending] across the European part of NATO, that will mean a lot, and more will be needed in terms of capacity. But we need to understand the capability targets better,"" Micael Johansson, the chief executive of Swedish defense company Saab, told CNBC.

""We can do more, and I think we need to come together in Europe to create more scale, also in what we do to align demand, align requirements, so we can actually be competitive player in internationally. So there's a lot to do still,"" he said.

Roberto Cingolani, CEO of Italian defense firm Leonardo, agreed that ""there's a lot of work to be done.""

""Leonardo has a capacity boost program at the moment because we are quite aware of the fact that we have to increase the production of specific platforms, defense systems, electronics and technology solutions. It is not only matter of money, it's matter of priority. It's matter of reducing the fragmentation among countries in Europe,"" he told CNBC's Charlotte Reed at the Paris Air Show.

Defense companies needed to know what will be expected of them ahead of time, Cingolani said, given the complex nature of global supply chains that underpin the defense industry.

""We have approximately 5000 companies in the supply chain, and we are in 160 countries in the world. So it's very complicated,"" he noted. ""You have to invest in supply chain. You have to make investments. You have to protect the supply chain. But of course, we also have to face a shortage of raw materials ... There is no no simple solution. If there were a solution, we would have done it already,"" he said.

Oil markets are entering a new phase of uncertainty after the U.S. joined the war between Iran and Israel, with experts warning of triple-digit prices.

Investors are closely watching for Tehran's reaction following the U.S.' strikes on its nuclear facilities, with Iran's foreign minister warning his country reserved ""all options"" to defend its sovereignty. 

Oil futures were up over 2% as of early Asia hours. U.S. WTI crude rose more than 2% to $75.22 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was up nearly 2% at $78.53 per barrel.

""There is real risk of the market experiencing unprecedented supply disruptions over coming weeks, of a much more severe nature than the oil price shock in 2022 in wake of the Ukraine war,"" said MST Marquee's senior energy analyst Saul Kavonic.

While the market reaction post U.S. strikes has been less aggressive, relative to just over a week ago when Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, industry watchers believe that the latest developments usher in a new era of volatility for the oil markets, especially as they await for potential Iranian countermeasures.

Threats of blocking Strait of Hormuz, after Iran's parliament approved closing it as per state media, have added to market jitters.

The strait, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, is a critical artery for global oil trade with about 20 million barrels of oil and oil products passing through it per day. That makes up almost one-fifth of global oil shipments.

If Iran does close the Strait of Hormuz, Western forces will likely ""directly enter the fray"" and try to reopen it, Kavonic told CNBC, adding that oil prices could approach $100 per barrel and retest the highs seen in 2022, if the closure goes beyond more than a few weeks.

""Even a degree of harassment of passage through the Strait, short of a full closure, could still see a serious heightening of oil prices,"" said the senior energy analyst.

Kavonic's view is echoed by other industry experts.

The U.S. and allied military would eventually reopen the Strait, but if Iran employed all its military means, the conflict could ""last longer than the last two Gulf Wars,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group. And should Iran decide to attack Gulf energy production or flows, it has the capability to disrupt oil and LNG shipping, resulting in sharp spike in prices. ""A prolonged closure or destruction of key Gulf energy infrastructure could propel crude prices to above $100,"" he said.

The CBOE crude oil volatility index, which measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility in crude oil prices, is at March 2022 levels it hit shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine.

While there has been some level of uncertainty with regards to how developments in the Middle East could play out for oil supplies, Lipow Associates' Andy Lipow noted that the current developments carry a different weight.

""This time feels different, given the barrage of missiles that have been fired for over a week and now the direct involvement of the USA,"" he said, adding oil could hit $100 per barrel should exports through the Strait of Hormuz be affected.

While an attempt to block the Hormuz waterway between Iran and Oman could have profound consequences for the wider economy, threats of blocking the strait have mostly been rhetorical, with experts saying that it is physically impossible to do so.

""So the picture is a little bit mixed, and I think traders will err on the side of caution, not panicking unless there is more real evidence to do,"" said Vandana Hari, founder and CEO, Vanda Insights.

Iran in 2018 threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions after the U.S. exited the nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions. Similar threat were issued in 2011 and 2012, when senior Iranian officials — among them then–Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi — warned of a possible closure if Western nations imposed more sanctions on Iran's oil exports over its nuclear activities.

Additionally, it is worth noting that Iranian energy infrastructure has not been a target thus far even with the recent conflagrations, said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth.

""It appears that both sides have an incentive to keep oil out of the line of fire, at least for now,"" she said.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

Europe's Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed 0.25% lower on Monday, though sector performances diverged. 

Banks, chemicals and insurance were the biggest losers, each down around 1%, while utilities and technology gained 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. 

France's CAC 40 index closed 0.7% lower, Germany's DAX 0.3% lower and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 0.2% lower. 

— Jenni Reid

Despite the huge spike in Middle East tensions over the weekend, with knock-on effects impacting shipping routes and oil prices, moves in financial markets have been relatively muted on Monday.

That's because corporations are much better prepared for high-risk events than they once were, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC's Annette Weisbach at Germany's Day of Industry 2025 event in Berlin this afternoon.

""It's obviously another crisis situation, but you see actually that overall, the capital markets remain calm,"" Sewing said.

""Companies and corporates and the whole industry actually had the time and have prepared themselves for these kind of escalations. That doesn't mean that we don't take them seriously. We have to take them very seriously. But each and every participant in the industry is better prepared for those situations than any time before, and therefore we see overall, a calm reaction.""

A lot still rests on whether there is further escalation, he noted, but for years boards have been improving their risk management and now pay closer attention during periods of uncertainty.

Shares of London-listed Spectris are topping the Stoxx 600 this afternoon, up nearly 16%, after the maker of industrial equipment announced it had agreed to be acquired for £3.8 billion ($5.13 billion) by U.S. private equity firm Advent International.

Spectris investors will receive £37.63 cash per share under the deal recommended by both boards, an 83% premium to the volume-weighted average price in the month to June 6.

""Since 2019, we have repositioned Spectris as a focused, high quality, compound growth business with advantaged positions in attractive end markets,"" Spectris CEO Andrew Heath said in a statement.

""Advent's offer recognises the quality of Spectris, our talented people, and our strong growth prospects. In light of a strong set of intentions set out today, the Board have confidence that Advent is committed to supporting Spectris with investment that will drive growth and accelerate delivery of our strategic objectives.""

Europe's Stoxx 600 index remains 0.48% lower, but action over on Wall Street is more subdued despite the spike in Middle East tensions over the weekend, with the main indexes near the flatline. 

Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 45 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 hovered around breakeven, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2%.

Some investors appear to believe there will be a limit to further escalation in conflict between the U.S. and Iran from here, while steadier oil price movements are also calming market jitters. ICE Brent Crude futures were 0.3% higher at $77.32 a barrel at 2:40 p.m. in London.

Novo Nordisk has reportedly ended its partnership to provide its weight-loss drug Wegovy through telehealth provider Hims & Hers, knocking down the share price of the Californian firm.

Reuters news first reported, citing a statement from Novo, that the deal signed two months ago in April was being terminated. Hims & Hers' shares have sunk more than 16% in premarket trading.

In April, the two companies said they had agreed to a ""long-term"" partnership to bring ""more accessible, more affordable"" weight-loss drugs to Americans at a reduced price of $599 per month. That deal came after the Danish company came under criticism from some U.S. lawmakers for the high cost of its drugs.

Novo Nordisk and Hims and Hers did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries.

The sell-off in European defense stocks has gathered pace late morning.

German defense contractors RENK Group, Hensoldt, Rheinmetall, Sweden's Saab, Italy's Leonardo and  France's Thales are among the biggest decliners in the Stoxx Europe 600 index.

It contrasts with the shares in U.S. defense companies gaining ground premarket. RTX Corp and Northrop Grumman shares are up 0.9%. Other aerospace and defense stocks in the S&P 500 moving higher are L3Harris and General Dynamics, up by 0.8%  and 0.5%, respectively.

Shares of diversified Boeing and General Electric are the only two major defense contractors in the red. Lockheed Martin shares are 0.3% in the black.

The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, the bombs dropped on Iran, were developed by Boeing and were carried on B-2 bomber aircraft developed by Northrop.

Iran may be threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, but experts told CNBC that it's also the one with the most to lose.

In major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country's parliament on Sunday reportedly approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, risking alienating its neighbors and trade partners.

Regional defense stocks were lower on Monday as investors assessed the fallout of the U.S. joining Israel's strikes on Iran.

The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index was last seen around 0.5% lower, starting the week on a negative note after gaining 1.1% over the course of last week.

German defense giant Rheinmetall was 1.7% lower during early trade, paring earlier losses, while Sweden's Saab shed 1.3% and France's Thales was down by around 0.8%.

Bucking the trend was Polish defense equipment manufacturer Lubawa, which jumped 3.5% during early trade.

As markets digest the U.S. strikes on Iran over the weekend, the dollar is on the rise, while other currencies typically seen as safe havens have lost momentum.

The U.S. dollar index — which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals — was 0.3% higher by 8:25 a.m. in London. So far this year, the dollar index has shed around 8.8%.

The safe haven Swiss franc was flat against the dollar during early European trade, paring gains seen ahead of the regional open.

Meanwhile, the Japanese yen — also typically seen as a safe haven during times of geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty — lost ground. The Japanese currency shed 0.7% against the dollar on Monday morning, 0.5% against the euro and 0.7% against the British pound.

Market watchers noted on Monday that the yen would come under pressure if the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway crucial to the transit of oil, is closed.

""Eyes are on how Iran would retaliate — a potential withdrawal from its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,"" analysts at Maybank said in a Monday morning note. ""Risk sensitive (AUD, NZD, CAD) and net oil importers (KRW, JPY, TWD, PHP, INR) could continue to remain under pressure.""

""We think USD/JPY works as a hedge against an escalation in geopolitical tension in the Middle East with positive carry,"" analysts at Bank of America said in a Friday note.

""The US is largely energy-independent. Japan imports almost all of petroleum it needs and more than 90% of its petroleum imports come from the Middle East, the highest dependency among G10 economies. USD/JPY can reprice higher if the oil price remains elevated.""

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis fell nearly 6% shortly after the opening bell, before swiftly paring some of its losses after a brief trading suspension. The stock was last seen trading down 2.1%.

That comes shortly after new CEO Antonio Filosa announced the firm's new management team on his first day in the job.

""It is my great privilege to take the lead of Stellantis, a global company with deep regional roots,"" Filosa said in a statement.

Alongside taking the reins, the company said, Filosa will retain his role as head of North America and American brands.

Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann will take on responsibility for mergers and acquisitions and joint ventures, while Jean-Philippe Imparato continues in his role as head of enlarged Europe and European brands, which will now also include the struggling luxury Maserati unit.

We're 10 minutes into Monday's trading session, and European shares are trading lower as the Middle East conflict — and America's involvement in it — remains in focus.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen 0.4% lower, with every sector barring oil and gas in negative territory. All major bourses are in the red, with France's CAC 40, down 0.7%, leading losses.

The U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran might seem like a geopolitical flashpoint that would send markets tumbling. Instead, investors are largely shrugging off the escalation, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained — and even bullish for some risk assets.

Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a choppy start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 0.3% lower at 8,747, Germany's DAX down 0.4% 23,222, France's CAC 40 0.5% lower at 7,536 and Italy's FTSE MIB 0.6% lower.

Global market sentiment could plummet further this week after the United States entered Israel's war against Iran over the weekend, launching strikes against three nuclear sites in Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz. The move by U.S. President Donald Trump surprised investors because he had said last Friday that he would make a decision to attack Iran ""within the next two weeks,"" according to the White House.

The latest attacks caused oil prices to rise further and have stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Asia-Pacific markets declined overnight, while U.S. stock futures fell ahead of Monday's session.

United States on Saturday conducted air strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites, entering Israel's war against Tehran. The timing was unexpected. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was still considering U.S. involvement and would arrive at a decision ""within the next two weeks.""

Financial and political analysts had largely taken that phrase as code word for inaction.

""There is also skepticism that the 'two-week' timetable is a too familiar saying used by the President to delay making any major decision,"" wrote Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.

Indeed, Trump has commonly neglected to follow up after giving a ""two week"" timeframe on major actions, according to NBC News.

And who can forget the TACO trade? It's an acronym that stands for ""Trump Always Chickens Out"" — which describes a pattern of the U.S. president threatening heavy tariffs, weighing down markets, but pausing or reducing their severity later on, helping stocks to rebound.

""Trump has to bury the TACO before the TACO buries him ... he's been forced to stand down on many occasion, and that has cost him a lot of credibility,"" said David WOO, CEO of David Woo Unbound.

And so Trump followed up on his threat, and ahead of the proposed two-week timeline.

""There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,"" Trump said on Saturday evening.

But given Trump's criticism of U.S. getting involved in wars under other presidents, does America bombing Iran add to his credibility, or erode it further?

The U.S. strikes Iran U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the United States had attacked Iranian nuclear sites, pushing America into Israel's war with its longtime rival. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Sunday that ""Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated."" The decision to attack Iran engages the American military in active warfare in the Middle East — something Trump had vowed to avoid.

Iran calls attacks 'outrageous'Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty and people after the ""outrageous"" U.S. attacks on three of its major nuclear enrichment facilities. Iranian state-owned media, meanwhile, reported that Iran's parliament backed closing the Strait of Hormuz, citing a senior lawmaker. The U.S. on Sunday called on China to prevent Iran from doing so.

Stock futures in U.S. retreatU.S. futures slid Sunday evening stateside as investors reacted to Washington's strikes on Iran. On Friday, U.S. markets mostly fell. The S&P 500 lost 0.22%, its third consecutive losing session, while the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.51%. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.08% gain. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index ticked up 0.13%, but ended the week 1.5% lower.

Oil jumps but bitcoin slumpsOil prices jumped Sunday evening in the U.S., its first trading session after Saturday's strikes. U.S. crude oil rose $1.76, or 2.38%, to $75.60 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was up $1.80, or 2.34%, to $78.81 per barrel. Meanwhile, bitcoin prices briefly dipped below the $99,000 mark Sunday, its lowest level in more than a month, before paring losses. It's now trading around $100,940, down 1.5%.

[PRO] Eyes on inflation reading Where markets go this week will depend on whether the conflict in the Middle East escalates after the U.S.' involvement. Investors should also keep an eye on economic data. May's personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation, comes out Friday, and will tell if tariffs are starting to heat up inflation.

How regime change in Iran could affect global oil prices

Senior Israeli officials said this week that their military campaign against Iran could trigger the fall of the regime, an event that would have enormous implications for the global oil market.

There are no signs that the regime in Iran is on the verge of collapse, said Scott Modell, CEO of the consulting firm Rapidan Energy Grop.

But further political destabilization in Iran ""could lead to significantly higher oil prices sustained over extended periods,"" said Natasha Kaneva, head of global commodities research at JPMorgan, in a note to clients this week.

There have been eight cases of regime change in major oil-producing countries since 1979, according to JPMorgan. Oil prices spiked 76% on average at their peak in the wake of these changes, before pulling back to stabilize at a price about 30% higher compared to pre-crisis levels, according to the bank.

Social media personality and crypto investor Anthony Pompliano unveiled a $1 billion merger on Monday to create ProCap Financial, a Bitcoin-native financial services firm that will soon join a growing list of companies stockpiling the asset on the Nasdaq.

Pompliano, who began promoting ProCap in April, said on X, formerly Twitter, that he had recently raised $750 million from “leading institutional investors on Wall Street” for the blank-check firm, alongside heavy hitters in the cryptosphere.

“It's time to get to work,” Pompliano said, noting that ProCap will develop “products and services to produce revenue and profit from the bitcoin on our balance sheet over time.”

ProCap will merge with Columbus Circle Capital, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker name CCCM, ProCap said in a press release. Entities in the proposed transaction raised $516 million in equity and $235 million through convertible notes, the firm added.

Pompliano's announcement comes amid a sharp uptick in firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, including Trump Media's $2.5 billion raise to buy Bitcoin last month, and GameStop's recent adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Although many firms are simply buying Bitcoin and holding it, Pompliano underscored in a statement that capital will be put to work.

 

“Our objective is to develop a platform that will not only acquire bitcoin for our balance sheet, but will also implement risk-mitigated solutions to generate revenue and profits from our bitcoin holdings,” he said.

Bitcoin-buying firms like Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, have been able to transform themselves over time. In a recent note from Coinbase, however, analysts warned that the trend may not be sustainable and could one day yield “systematic risks” for the entire crypto sector. 

The logic goes that a sharp drawdown in Bitcoin's price could force these firms, which often turn to debt to fund purchases, could be forced to sell the asset en masse.

Worldwide, 134 public companies have purchased 835,000 Bitcoin worth $85 billion, according to Bitcoin, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Bitcoin was changing hands around $102,000 on Monday, a 2.2% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

 Bitcoin has lost more than 8% over the past week as geopolitical tensions and military action between Israel and Iran ramped up. 

Bitcoin prices dipped below six figures for the first time since early May, but the weakness is only temporary, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. 

Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell to their lowest level for more than six weeks in late trading on Sunday when they dipped below $98,500, coming after a US airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. 

However, the sub-six-figure drop didn't last long, and the asset had reclaimed $101,000 during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. 

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said on X that the “weakness shall pass” and Bitcoin will “leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” He said that this will be driven by more central bank money printing. 

In a note shared with Cointelegraph, 10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said that as long as Bitcoin remains above the short-term realized price of $98,000 and the $102,000 trend support, “traders can continue to look for tactical rally opportunities.”

However, he cautioned that a break below this range “would shift the focus to risk management, especially in the absence of strong upside catalysts.”

Bitcoin has been in a five-week consolidation phase, with three failed attempts to break above $110,000 due to short-term macroeconomic shocks, from tariff concerns in May to the Israel–Iran escalation in June.

Thielen told Cointelegraph that he expects the sideways trading to continue for a few months. “Our view is that we consolidate over the summer,” he said. 

Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at digital asset platform OSL, remains bullish.

“Despite Bitcoin briefly dipping below $100,000 amid heightened geopolitical tensions following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, its resilience suggests strong institutional support and long-term bullish sentiment,” he told Cointelegraph on Monday. 

He added that structural demand for both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) persists as market volatility “underscores crypto's sensitivity to macro risks, highlighting the ongoing pattern to absorb shocks and continue in a general bullish trend.” 

Meanwhile, Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph that altcoins could start to perform better in the coming months. 

“While Bitcoin's volatility has been the focus after the US-Iran escalation, the altcoin market is showing signs of divergent strength,” he said, adding: 

Most of the altcoins were in the red at the time of writing, with the overall crypto market capitalization down 1.5%, or around $50 billion, over the past 12 hours in a fall to $3.21 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for recovery following a geopolitical tension-triggered sell-off over the weekend after the United States (US) struck Iran's nuclear sites in support of Israel's campaign. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $100,000, reaching a low of around $98,200, before reversing the trend and rising above $101,000 on Monday. 

Major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are paring losses while offering signs of recovery, underpinned by renewed sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market.

US President Donald Trump ordered strikes on three main Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday, unleashing mayhem in global markets, which saw Bitcoin price drop below the $100,000 mark, its lowest point since May 8.

The strikes dimmed hopes for a potential ceasefire, as reported by Reuters. ""It's irrelevant to ask Iran to return to diplomacy,"" Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Istanbul on Sunday. 

Following the attacks, President Trump urged Iran to return to the negotiating table but warned against retaliatory attacks on US assets and personnel in the Middle East region.

Volatility in the market is likely to remain elevated, with traders treading cautiously. Liquidations exploded above the $1 billion mark on Sunday, offering a glimpse of the damage that could happen if the conflict between Iran and Israel keeps escalating.

Inflows into digital asset financial products, including spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), extended the bullish streak, reaching $1.24 billion last week. CoinShares reported that year-to-date inflows have hit a record $15.1 billion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated the inflows with $1.1 billion and $124 million, signaling strong sentiment despite escalating geopolitical tensions. Ethereum posted its ninth consecutive week of inflows, bringing the total inflow for this period to slightly above $2.2 billion.

""This marks the longest run of inflows since mid-2021, reflecting continued robust investor sentiment toward the asset,"" the CoinShares weekly report states.

Bitcoin's price hovers at around $101,457 at the time of writing as traders focus on the possibility of the uptrend extending further. According to QCP Capital's Monday market update, ""BTC's reclaim of $100k this morning suggests that the weekend drawdown was macro-driven, with investors turning to crypto as a hedge while awaiting equity futures to open.""

Technically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that momentum is gradually shifting bullish as it reverses the trend, pointing toward the 50 midline. Recovery beyond this neutral level could boost the uptrend, paving the way for further gains this week.

Key monitoring levels, especially for intraday traders, include the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $99,212, which is set to serve as support, and the 50-day EMA at $102,954, a former support level that has been flipped into resistance. A break above the 50-EMA hurdle would expand the bullish scope above $105,000, a psychological round-number resistance.

Ethereum's price shows subtle signs of a minor recovery on Monday, steadying during the European session, buoyed by support at $2,111 and buy-the-dip initiatives. Although the RSI is near the oversold region, a reversal is underway at 35. The 100-day EMA at $2,366, the 50-day EMA at $2,417 and the 200-day EMA at $2,469 mark key resistance levels. Closing above these levels will likely boost ETH's bullish structure.

On the contrary, the Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator, which tracks the amount of money entering Ethereum, suggests a strong bearish grip as it slides toward the oversold area. In other words, traders may lack the conviction to keep the recovery steady in upcoming sessions.

Meanwhile, the leading cross-border money transfer token, XRP, shows signs of weakness despite reclaiming ground slightly above support at $2.00. If downside risks intensify, traders may want to prepare for the possibility of losses extending to lows last seen in April, such as $1.80 and $1.61.

The path of least resistance appears firmly downward, accentuated by the RSI pointing downwards and approaching oversold territory. On the upside, the 200-day EMA at $2.09, which served as support last week, could cap gains, favoring consolidation above the support level of $2.00.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East caused a liquidation havoc of over $1 billion in the cryptocurrency market over the weekend, following US President Donald Trump's direct involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran.

The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for recovery following a geopolitical tension-triggered sell-off over the weekend after the United States (US) struck Iran's nuclear sites in support of Israel's campaign.

Quant edges higher by 1% so far on Monday, after winning the Best Programmable Payment Platform at the Future of Finance Awards. The optimism surrounding Quant grows in the derivatives market, evident with the QNT Open Interest spike.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounds slightly, trading around $102,000 at the time of writing on Monday after dipping to $98,200 the previous day. Institutional investors further supported the price recovery as MetaPlanet added 1,111 BTC to its treasury reserve.

Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Despite heightened geopolitical tension risks, crypto proves its mettle with steady inflows and strong ETF performance.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Digital asset investment products recorded their tenth straight week of inflows, bringing in $1.24 billion last week, according to data from CoinShares.

This continued streak has pushed year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $15.1 billion, a new record for this year.

The inflows come at a time of heightened geopolitical tension, particularly following Israel's military action against Iran. The move sparked fears of wider conflict, leading to a sharp selloff across financial markets, including crypto.

Despite the volatility, institutional interest in digital assets remained firm.

CoinShares' Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that inflows were strongest early in the week but later slowed. He noted:

“The surge in activity earlier in the week tapered off in the latter half, likely due to the US Juneteenth holiday and emerging reports of US involvement in the Iran conflict.”

Bitcoin remained the primary driver of capital, pulling in $1.1 billion over the past week. This marks its second week of positive inflows, even as prices experienced a correction.

CoinShares highlighted that many investors took advantage of the dip to increase their positions, underscoring Bitcoin's growing appeal as a macroeconomic hedge.

Notably, US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) played a central role in this flow, attracting $1.02 billion in net inflows. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out with $1.23 billion in weekly inflows, bringing the total assets under its management to more than $74 billion.

Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products saw minor outflows of $1.4 million, suggesting a drop in bearish sentiment.

Ethereum continued its strong performance, extending its inflow streak to nine consecutive weeks.

CoinShares reported that the digital asset saw $124 million in new inflows last week, pushing its total to $2.2 billion since mid-April.

Like Bitcoin, spot Ethereum ETFs also played a significant role in the inflow streak, with the nine products logging inflows on 25 of the past 30 trading days, totaling nearly $1.5 billion.

Meanwhile, market observers have linked ETH's inflow rise to several key factors, including the recent Pectra upgrade and increasing institutional interest in the crypto.

Other altcoins also showed resilience by attracting modest inflows last week.

Solana saw $2.78 million in new capital, while XRP brought in $2.69 million, reflecting continued but cautious appetite for alternative Layer 1s.

Bitcoin treasury adoption by public companies has become the new altcoin season for cryptocurrency speculators, Adam Back said on Monday.

Bitcoin BTCUSD treasury season “is the new ALT SZN for speculators,” said Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “Time to dump ALTs into BTC or BTC treasuries,” he added.

Bitcoin treasury firms are buying BTC “on repeat to increase Bitcoin per share,” tapping into different funding methods such as convertible note offerings to accumulate more of the world's first cryptocurrency, making them attractive for investors, Back explained.

His comments come amid a wave of growing corporate Bitcoin adoption, which saw the number of public companies holding Bitcoin double since June 5.

At least 240 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 firms just weeks ago, accounting for about 3.96% of the total BTC supply, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Back previously predicted that institutional and government adoption would make Bitcoin a $200 trillion market opportunity as Bitcoin treasury firms front-run hyperbitcoinization — a theoretical future where Bitcoin becomes the world's largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics.

However, Bitcoin treasury firms also present growing concerns for shareholders. For instance, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet's Bitcoin premium soared to $596,154 on May 27, meaning stockholders are paying more than fivefold for Bitcoin exposure via Metaplanet shares.

Bitcoin investments may offset altcoin losses

Still, Back argued that Bitcoin-focused firms offer a possible path to recover losses from altcoins. 

“I was encouraging them to find a way out of alts,” said Back in an X response on Monday. “Maybe they can make back their losses by switching to BTC by way of treasury companies,” he added.

Corporate adoption continues to accelerate. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a “long-term” Bitcoin treasury reserve.

Three days earlier, Paris-based cryptocurrency company The Blockchain Group announced plans to raise $340 million for a corporate Bitcoin treasury, signaling growing institutional interest in Europe.

Despite their lack of momentum, altcoins are also benefiting from institutional adoption. Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment manufacturer, announced plans to raise $500 million to establish a Fetch.ai (FET) token treasury, Cointelegraph reported on June 11.

Web3 Harbour, in collaboration with PwC Hong Kong, will launch five action groups in August on stablecoins, funds and other critical segments

In a call to action for greater investment to accelerate the development of blockchain infrastructure, industry group Web3 Harbour and accounting firm PwC Hong Kong released the “Hong Kong Web3 Blueprint” on Monday, capitalising on recent momentum in the city.

Highlighting the “transparency, security, and user empowerment” of decentralisation, the blueprint seeks to leverage what it calls “Web3 superpowers” through the development of “five key enablers”: talent, market infrastructure, standards, regulation, and funding and economic contribution. It calls on participants to focus on open finance, trade finance, capital markets, asset management and carbon markets.

The report was put together with input from Web3 Harbour members and other industry stakeholders. Web3 Harbour chairman Gary Liu, formerly CEO of the Post, said greater private-public collaboration was among its goals, but it was primarily a guide for where the private sector should focus its efforts.

“This is us laying out what the private sector is going to be focused on so that Web3 technologies and virtual or decentralised assets become truly part of the financial infrastructure here in Hong Kong,” Liu said.

Stablecoins keep their value steady by being pegged to a reference asset, typically backed one-to-one with fiat currency such as the US dollar.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

Modern warfare operates in an increasingly contested environment where adversaries possess not only advanced weapon systems but also sophisticated cyber capabilities that can disrupt critical defense technologies.

The complexity of contemporary missile defense systems requires seamless integration between multiple subsystems and the main weapon platform.

As demonstrated during Operation Sindoor, the transition from weapon induction through deployment to active employment demands robust networking capabilities that can maintain operational integrity under hostile conditions.

Blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution to enhance the reliability and security of missile defense systems.

This article examines how blockchain can strengthen missile defense capabilities by improving data integrity, securing communications, and creating resilient command structures.

Blockchain technology provides missile defense systems with two critical capabilities: maintaining data integrity and securing communications during crisis operations. By implementing a controlled blockchain mechanism, military forces can ensure that essential operational data remains accessible across multiple domains while enabling efficient networking between subsystems and primary weapon platforms.

Traditional centralized command and communication structures present significant vulnerabilities in contested environments. A centralized system creates single points of failure that adversaries can exploit through cyber attacks, potentially compromising entire missile defense networks.

Blockchain addresses this vulnerability by enabling decentralized command and communication architectures. This distributed approach makes it substantially more difficult for adversaries to disrupt missile defense operations, as they would need to compromise multiple nodes throughout the network rather than attacking a single central point. The implementation of strong cryptographic algorithms further protects sensitive information and restricts unauthorized access during critical operational periods.

This decentralized structure supports a “defense by denial” strategy, preventing adversaries from neutralizing defensive capabilities to enable their own offensive operations.

Missile defense systems undergo distinct operational phases from initial fielding through deployment to active employment. Blockchain technology facilitates smooth transitions between these phases by preventing data tampering and maintaining comprehensive integrity records throughout the system lifecycle.

One of blockchain's significant advantages lies in its ability to maintain complete maintenance records within the distributed ledger system. These comprehensive records prove invaluable during system upgrades, technological modifications, and eventual decommissioning processes. When acquiring new missile defense capabilities, historical maintenance data helps military planners understand existing system limitations and specify requirements that address these shortcomings.

During peacetime, missile defense systems require frequent testing to ensure operational readiness. Blockchain-enabled data management systems can effectively capture, store, and analyze test data, providing insights that enhance system performance and reliability.

In crisis situations, blockchain systems enable rapid data coordination by sharing minimal but critical information packets that support split-second decision-making processes. Post-engagement data analysis helps military commanders assess mission success or failure and refine future operational strategies.

Blockchain technology offers significant potential for arms control verification processes. The technology can provide transparent, tamper-proof records of launch platforms and interceptor systems, facilitating effective verification mechanisms. This capability supports both crisis management and peacetime monitoring requirements.

The United States Navy is actively developing blockchain integration for its missile defense systems. The Simba Chain project focuses on supply chain security and data management for the Aegis ballistic missile defense system, ensuring secure supply lines and robust data handling capabilities.

Additionally, the Powerful Authentication Regime Applicable to Naval Operational Flight Program Integrated Development (PARANOID) program represents another blockchain initiative designed to secure weapon system software throughout development and deployment phases.

Despite its advantages, blockchain technology faces inherent limitations that create potential vulnerabilities in missile defense applications. The most significant concern involves the possibility of adversaries compromising a substantial portion of the blockchain network, which could disrupt the operational effectiveness of the entire missile defense system.

Other challenges include the computational overhead required for blockchain operations, potential latency issues in time-critical scenarios, and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect the blockchain infrastructure itself.

Blockchain technology offers compelling advantages for enhancing missile defense system security, reliability, and effectiveness. Its ability to provide decentralized command structures, maintain data integrity, and secure communications addresses many vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized systems. However, successful implementation requires careful consideration of the technology's limitations and the development of appropriate safeguards to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

As military forces continue to operate in increasingly contested environments, blockchain technology represents a valuable tool for maintaining defensive superiority and ensuring mission success in critical scenarios.

Directive Games migrates its web3 MMO Civitas to Immutable zkEVM, promising faster play, lower fees and gas-free trading for all users.

The studio chose Immutable's zero knowledge rollup because it processes many more transactions per second than Ethereum while keeping full EVM compatibility. Lower fees mean fewer technical hurdles and let the team focus on new features rather than server work.

Immutable also provides a ready-made suite of developer tools, easing future content drops and live-ops events.

Welcome to Immutable, Civitas!@playcivitas is a city-building strategy game that allows anyone to build an entire virtual civilization.– Build and govern your own city-state in a persistent online world– Shape your civilization's future with AR, onchain tools, and subDAO… pic.twitter.com/h42Opaz6Dn

Civitas now uses Immutable Passport, an email-based wallet that removes gas costs for gameplay and for trading in-game items. New players no longer need to set up a separate wallet or buy ETH before they can try the city-building strategy game. For veterans, the faster chain should reduce wait times when minting land, crafting Ever Crystals or moving resources between guild members.

Current avatars in the Chosen of Civitas collection stay on Ethereum mainnet but will work seamlessly with all assets on Immutable zkEVM. Holders keep receiving monthly Ever Fragments that combine into Ever Crystals, which boost land productivity inside the MMO.

The evolving dynamics of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) has a subject for global discussion in recent times. The issue can be contributed to the possible effects of private-sector digital currency issuances on financial market stability and monetary policy.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as “a public digital form of money issued by a central bank, denominated in the national currency, and typically convertible to other forms of central bank money.”

The World Bank on the other hand defines CBDC as it as “a central bank liability that is digitally created and recorded on centralized or decentralized ledgers, denominated in an existing unit of account, and convertible in physical cash, commercial bank money and other forms of money on demand by the holder at authorized entities.”

In 2023, central banks were heavily involved in an emerging trend aimed at enhancing cross-border payments. They were trying to develop and issue their own version of digital currency similar to crypto, called CBDC or central bank digital currency.

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) design is driven by characteristics like anonymity, interest-bearing, availability, transfer mechanism and restrictions on holding. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can take different forms, such as digital equivalents of existing notes and coins or a version deposited in a central bank or banking system.

CBDC vs. Cryptocurrency

In contrast, electronic money is the electronic store of monetary value while digital currencies exist only in digital form without a physical counterpart. E-money is the digital equivalent of cash stored electronically on a device, regulated by a financial authority, whereas virtual currency is an unregulated digital currency without legal tender status.

Like cryptocurrency, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a virtual currency that relies on blockchain technology to function. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), at first glance, looks especially similar to stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) – the cryptocurrencies that are pegged to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar. The key difference, however, is that CBDC are issued and regulated by a central bank. Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins come from private individuals or companies.

CBDC Use Cases & Challenges

According to Statista, the value of transactions processed via central bank digital currency is forecast to grow by 260,000 percent between 2023 and 2030. This is according to a market estimate based on various conditions and sources available in early 2023.

The key drivers for CBDC development varied between developed and emerging countries. Central banks from developed countries hoped to preserve their monetary sovereignty or to improve payment efficiency.

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can mimic physical cash properties, acting as a substitute and preventing private sector dominance in money creation. In developing economies, cash remains widely used and CBDC introduction might significantly change cash usage.

Other explorative advantages of CBDC include supporting a country's efforts towards a cashless society, preserving the monetary authority's role as money issuer, promoting competition and innovation in the National Payment System (NPS).

Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can also reinforce the crucial role of central bank money in the digital world and provides a safe alternative to private sector instruments. It is also worthy to note that a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can facilitate government payments and transfers especially during emergencies to support rapid and targeted relief.

Additionally, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can improve payment system performance, promote fast, secure, efficient payments and supports financial inclusion.  However, financial inclusion with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) implementations is difficult to prove due to their diverse features and functions based on policy choices and the market environment.

First, central banks should consider how the design of a CBDC can derive value from these attributes, making it more accessible to all, before deciding whether to issue CBDCs to promote financial inclusion. Besides, CBDCs will require burdensome identification processes and compliance with AML/CFT regulations.

CBDC on Monetary Policy

A central bank implements monetary policy by controlling the money supply, adjusting interest rates, and ensuring price stability. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is expected to have a limited impact on monetary policy implementation, but its design features could affect the effectiveness of monetary policy. If widely accessible and interest-bearing, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) could increase the elasticity of money demand and strengthen the transmission mechanism.

Risk of Bank Run

A primary concern for some schools of thought is that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) can potentially trigger a systemic bank run on commercial banks due to large-scale withdrawals of bank deposits, prompting savers to place their funds into rewards-based CBDC holdings.

Introducing CBDC deposits can decrease private credit supply by commercial banks, raising nominal interest rates and lowering reserve-to-deposit ratios, which could lead to bank panic. The introduction of a CBDC could also fundamentally alter the roles of the private sector and central bank, replacing commercial bank money with safe central bank money. However, some argue that CBDC might increase the speed and ease of withdrawals at regular bank runs in a crisis but may not inherently increase insolvency fears unless it competes too aggressively with commercial banks for deposits.

If poorly implemented, CBDC can lead to a Diamond-Dybvig (DD) model bank-run by weakening banks' liquidity positions. A Diamond-Dybvig (DD) model bank run occurs when depositors believe others will withdraw, they rush to do the same, causing a self-fulfilling crisis, even if the bank is solvent. This type of bank-run comes at the cost of the central bank being the sole provider of deposits, which could deviate from the socially optimal contract.

A central bank's socially optimal contract refers to the design of policies, frameworks, and incentives that align with the central bank's objectives of social welfare maximization. Studies have examined three cases using digital CBDC money theory: zero-remunerated CBDC, intermediate CBDC, and complete conversion of bank deposits into CBDC.

The occurrence of the DD model bank-run is complex, and there is proof that two financial instruments will coexist but not entirely replace each other. People may prefer bank deposits for services and relationships with banks while turning to CBDC for risk-free holdings and transactions.

The extent to which CBDCs compensate holders with interest rates will depend on whether they are sufficiently high to compete with banks' savings accounts. As CBDCs are considered a central bank liability, this approach could make central banks a single point of failure. Some probable solutions to bank- runs include requiring higher capital and ensuring emergency lending facilities to the banking system.

Higher capital requirements force banks to maintain a buffer of equity relative to their assets, ensuring they can absorb losses during crises. Alternatively, banks can increase more stable funds like equity funding by retaining earnings or issuing longer-term bonds. If deposits migrate from commercial banks to CBDC, the central bank must intervene by replenishing reserves to maintain liquidity. A central bank may also impose restrictions on the holding and withdrawal of CBDC by an end-user.

Conclusion

CBDCs can promote financial inclusion, improve payment system performance, and support country efforts to move toward a cashless society. However, CBDCs also raise concerns about bank runs, monetary policy implementation, and the need for careful consideration of design features, anonymity, and privacy aspects. Overall, CBDCs have the potential to transform the financial system, but their development and implementation require careful planning and consideration of potential risks and benefits.

Last week, as much of the world focussed on Iran and Israel, the crypto lobby was celebrating a huge victory in Washington. “History is being made,” Jeremy Allaire, the founder and chief executive of Circle, a stablecoin platform, wrote on X, shortly after the Senate voted through the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to facilitate the growth of the digital currency, and to give it, and other crypto assets, the stamp of legitimacy.

Stablecoins, which are designed to retain a constant value of one dollar, making them much less volatile than regular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, currently exist in a regulatory gray area, in which regulators have treated some, but not all, of them as securities subject to the securities laws. Although companies such as Tether and Circle created stablecoins that now have a combined market cap of more than two hundred and fifty billion dollars worldwide, major banks and other traditional financial institutions largely stayed away from them, put off by regulatory uncertainty and crypto's association with illicit transactions. The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) may well change all this and bring crypto into the mainstream financial system. It treats stablecoins as a means of payment rather than as securities, and it creates a set of rules for their issuer to follow, under the oversight of state and federal regulators.

The bill passed with support from fifty Republicans and eighteen Democrats. Allaire said that the final passage of the act, which still has to go through the House of Representatives, “will drive US economic and national competitiveness for decades to come.” The Republican senator Bill Hagerty, of Tennessee, who sponsored the bill, made similarly expansive claims. But to many public-interest groups, and to Senate Democrats who voted against the legislation, its progress through the Senate mainly illustrated the power of the crypto lobby, which now exercises enormous influence at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. “The GENIUS Act is an important step, but it is just one of many actions that the crypto industry and its allies in the White House and Capitol Hill are taking to launch an uncontrolled experiment in unleashing crypto on the economy and the financial system,” Mark Hays, an associate director of crypto and fintech at Americans for Financial Reform, a Washington-based advocacy group, told me.

During the Biden Administration, a number of crypto exchanges failed, and the creator of one of them, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted of eight counts of fraud and conspiracy. (He had illegally transferred customers' deposits to his hedge fund.) Over at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, the Biden-appointed chair, said at the time that the crypto industry was “rife with fraud and manipulation,” and his agency sued some of its most prominent firms, including Coinbase, the United States' top crypto exchange, claiming that they were violating securities laws. Last year, a survey from the Pew Research Center found that more than sixty per cent of Americans had little or no faith in the safety of crypto as an investment.

But, also in 2024, three super PACs financed by the crypto industry spent an estimated two hundred and sixty-five million dollars to elect pro-crypto candidates and defeat crypto skeptics, such as Sherrod Brown, the senior Democratic senator from Ohio. With last week's vote, the crypto lobby “recouped some of its huge investment,” Bartlett Naylor, a financial-policy analyst at the consumer-advocacy group Public Citizen, told me. “The crypto sector's financial contributions converted some elected politicians to a pro-crypto stance, and it scared the bejeezus out of a lot of others,” he added.

Defenders of the GENIUS Act say that it will protect holders of stablecoins by requiring their issuers to adhere to a set of codified rules, which include keeping the holders' money in safe reserve assets, such as Treasury bills and bank accounts; publishing the composition of these reserves on a monthly basis; and, in the case of issuers with a market capitalization of more than fifty billion dollars, publishing audited financial statements annually. The bill also stipulates that stablecoin issuers must observe some money-laundering laws, and that, if they enter bankruptcy, the holders of their stablecoins will have first claim on their assets. “The Genius bill will ensure stablecoin reserves will be safe and boring, and that consumers will have a direct legal claim on the underlying assets,” Christian Catalini, a research scientist at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, who set up the university's Cryptoeconomics Lab, wrote to me in an e-mail.

Critics of the bill say that its protections don't go nearly far enough. “It's a collection of half measures that will create a regulatory imprimatur for stablecoins without removing the dangers associated with them,” Hays said. “We see in this bill a failure to learn from the regulatory mistakes of the past.” He compared it to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which ostensibly set up a new regulatory framework for derivatives but actually weakened oversight in key areas—a failure that became patent during the global financial crisis of 2007-09. “We've seen this show before,” Hays added.

The Senate legislation contains a conflict-of-interest provision that would “prohibit any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service.” However, legal experts say this restriction, like other ethics laws, wouldn't apply to the President or Vice-President, an exemption that is far from trivial. In March, World Liberty Financial, a crypto startup that is majority-owned by the Trump family, announced that it was issuing a new stablecoin, USD1. Since the Trump family is now a player in stablecoins, it potentially stands to benefit greatly from an expansion in their use. (The market cap of USD1 already stands at about $2.2 billion.) “If this bill passes the full Congress, it is certainly possible that Trump's stablecoin could become one of the dominant parts of the crypto ecosystem, which would be extremely rewarding to him,” Hays said.

The Trump family's efforts to enrich itself by issuing a “$Trump” meme coin have already received a great deal of attention. (Earlier this month, the Forbes reporter Dan Alexander estimated that Trump's meme-coin haul could be worth more than three hundred million dollars.) Critics say that the existence of a Trump-owned stablecoin creates new possibilities for interested parties to funnel money to him and his companies. Early last month, one of World Liberty Financial's co-founders said that its new stablecoin would be used in a two-billion-dollar investment that an entity tied to the government of the United Arab Emirates was making in Binance, the world's top crypto exchange. The company's founder, the Chinese billionaire Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced in the U.S. to four months in prison last April, after pleading guilty to money-laundering violations, and he is now reportedly seeking a Presidential pardon. At the end of May this year, the S.E.C. announced that it was dismissing a civil suit against Binance.

Two progressive Democratic senators who opposed the GENIUS Act—Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts—are demanding an inquiry into the U.A.E.-Binance transaction, which they claim could violate federal bribery laws. Merkley and Warren also demanded, and failed to secure, stronger anti-corruption provisions in the GENIUS Act, which, Merkley said, “stamps a congressional seal of approval on President Trump selling access to the government for personal profit.”

The legislation's sponsors deny this, of course. Its supporters also claim that bringing stablecoins into areas of finance outside crypto would generate broad economic benefits. Catalini, who previously worked with Facebook on its abandoned effort to create a cryptocurrency, told me that one of the most notable benefits would be “faster, lower-cost, global payments.”

Catalini was referring to online payments for everything from Etsy purchases to airline tickets and international money transfers. Traditionally, the payments infrastructure in the United States has been dominated by Visa and Mastercard, which operate their own networks and charge businesses hefty commissions for transferring their customers' money. In recent decades, new payments services have appeared, such as PayPal and Klarna, but Catalini said that they deliberately limit interoperability, to keep up their profit margins: you can't send money from a PayPal digital wallet to a Cash App wallet. In a world where online payments were carried out using stablecoins, which are represented on a blockchain—an anonymous and distributed digital ledger that lies at the foundation of crypto transactions—this would change, Catalini insisted. “Wallets, fintechs, and services will be interoperable by default.”

According to recent news reports, some big non-crypto firms, including Amazon, Walmart, and Meta, are considering launching their own stablecoins, while banks such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America are discussing teaming up to create one. All this activity suggests that more is at stake here than trading in crypto assets. “We will see massive entry, both by incumbents and challengers,” Catalini predicted. Critics of crypto say that this isn't necessarily a good thing. “Essentially, stablecoin, this private form of money, is going to be part of the mainstream financial system,” Corey Frayer, the director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, told me. “People will be using Bezos bucks, Zuckerberg bucks, Trump bucks for payments. It's going to be incredibly confusing. And there will be no guarantee that these new forms of dollars will always be worth a dollar.”

During the Biden Administration, Frayer served as an adviser on crypto issues to Gensler at the S.E.C. Several times in recent years, he reminded me, stablecoins have traded well below a dollar—in May, 2022, when the stablecoin Tether fell to ninety-five cents; and again, in March, 2023, during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, when the value of Circle's USDC coin fell below eighty-seven cents. Back then, there were relatively few linkages between crypto and most of the banking system, which limited the fallout from ructions in the crypto world. But, if stablecoins expand greatly and hold much of their cash in bank accounts, or if banks create their own stablecoins, a run on stablecoins—in which their holders try to turn them into actual cash—could conceivably generate a run on the banks. “The stablecoin bill creates a transmission channel from the extremely volatile crypto ecosystem to the traditional financial sector, and that's incredibly dangerous,” Frayer said.

Ultimately, Frayer went on, the proliferation of stablecoins could turn the U.S. financial system into a twenty-first century version of the pre-Civil War system, in which many private banks issued their own currencies, and businesses and savers had to decide whether to trust them. In this era of “wildcat banking,” the value of money fluctuated widely, and there were frequent runs and bank failures. To address this chaos, and to help fund the war against the Confederacy, Lincoln's government eventually passed the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864, which imposed stricter capital and reserve requirements on banks and helped to create a single national currency.

A version of Frayer's argument has also been made by Barry Eichengreen, a leading economic historian who teaches at Berkeley. “The problems that bedeviled 19th-century dollars are likely to be equally debilitating to the stablecoin ecosystem,” Eichengreen wrote in a guest essay for the Times last week. Pointing to this historical experience, Frayer said, “It is an ironic situation that we should be on the verge of returning to a system of private monies after everything we have learned.” If the political embrace of crypto continues unchecked—House Republicans are considering broadening the GENIUS Act to deregulate other areas of the industry—“irony” could end up being too weak a word. ♦

The company plans to launch a digital asset platform that includes a new stablecoin (FIUSD) that will be added to Fiserv's banking and payments infrastructure by the year's end, according to a Monday (June 23) press release. The platform will help the firm's regional and community bank clients embrace stablecoins' entry into the traditional finance space.

“FIUSD presents Fiserv customers with access to a new, more efficient and interoperable digital asset service for their banking and payment flows,” the release said.

Offering the coin across Fiserv's network, which includes relationships with roughly 10,000 financial institutions and 6 million merchant locations worldwide, will “provide instant scale for FIUSD while creating a digital asset network that clients can use to build new products and services,” per the release.

Fiserv intends to use stablecoin infrastructure from Paxos and Circle with the goal of making it interoperable with several stablecoins, and it will be available to Fiserv clients through the Solana blockchain, according to the release.

“In addition, the company is exploring the use of deposit tokens to maintain the benefits of stablecoins in a more capital-friendly structure for banks,” talking with other possible partners to find more use cases for stablecoins and tokenized deposits, per the release.

Fiserv Chief Operating Officer Takis Georgakopoulos said in the release that the new effort will help “democratize access” in the stablecoin market.

“Together with our other cloud-native banking and merchant platforms, we believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem,” Georgakopoulos said in the release.

The announcement is the latest example of the growing embrace of stablecoins, with retailers such as Walmart and Amazon looking to launch coins of their own.

“The rationale is straightforward,” PYMNTS noted in a report last week on the Walmart/Amazon rivalry. “By creating blockchain-based currencies that are pegged to fiat money, these retailers could sidestep traditional payment processors, reduce transaction fees and accelerate settlement times.”

In addition, a group of the country's largest banks — J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — are reportedly exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin.

“The timing of this venture is no coincidence,” PYMNTS wrote in May. “For years, stablecoins … have promised to blend the best of both worlds: the efficiency of blockchain transactions and the stability of fiat currency.”

Capitol Technology University is stepping deeper into the crypto space through a new partnership with the Maryland Blockchain Association (MDBA). Announced on March 14, the collaboration aims to grow awareness and access to blockchain and cryptocurrency education. It also opens up new career paths for students interested in emerging tech.Based in Laurel, Capitol Tech has built a reputation for preparing students in cybersecurity, engineering, data science, and other tech-focused fields. The Maryland Blockchain Association, meanwhile, has become a key voice in shaping local blockchain policy and educating the public. Together, the two organizations are combining forces to expand hands-on learning, host blockchain-related events, and explore creating a full blockchain academy in the state.



The goal is clear: give students more chances to learn real skills tied to crypto and Web3, and help Maryland stay competitive as tech moves fast. While many schools are still figuring out how to bring blockchain into the classroom, Capitol Tech is going all-in through this move.

The partnership also opens the door to joint events, including hackathons and workshops that connect students directly with professionals in the space. MDBA already works with state leaders and major companies, and this alliance means students will now have better access to real-world knowledge and potential mentors.

While blockchain education is still catching up to the technology itself, it's gaining ground, especially as demand grows not just for coders, but for people who understand how crypto works in finance, policy, and security. And for students trying to get ahead in this area, learning now is a good move.



Crypto learning is not just about college classrooms either. It is moving into workshops and short-term programs, many of which are tied to real projects or startup ideas. Some people even highlight the hottest upcoming crypto presales, where new tokens are introduced before they hit major exchanges. Understanding these early-stage launches, how they work, and what makes one more promising than another is becoming a valuable skill on its own. For young investors or developers, this is one way to connect theory to practice.

For Maryland, this partnership could also help attract more tech-focused talent to the state. With the rise of remote work and decentralized finance, many students want skills that let them work from anywhere. In 2022, the demand for skilled professionals in the blockchain field rose by 552%, and that was three years ago, when crypto wasn't as popular as today. 

MDBA's mission has always been to push blockchain innovation forward across the DMV area: D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. It does that by working with lawmakers, running public education efforts, and making sure the technology is understood, not just hyped. Adding a university partner like Capitol Tech gives it another tool to build a stronger foundation in the state.



This move also comes as other universities nationwide and worldwide begin experimenting with blockchain programs. A few large universities now offer full degrees in blockchain, while others include it as part of business or tech majors. Capitol Tech's approach focuses on practical experience and partnerships, which could give students a clearer edge when it's time to enter the job market.

There's also a growing sense that crypto is shifting from being a niche interest to something more widely accepted. With that comes the need for people who understand it well enough to guide smart decisions, whether it's in development, regulation, or finance. Training students now, while the space is still growing, makes them more prepared for what's ahead.

For Capitol Tech students, this partnership is more than just a logo swap or guest lecture series. It's a chance to get involved with the tech as it changes and to explore new ways of building a future in crypto, blockchain, and beyond. Maryland might not be the first state you think of when it comes to crypto innovation, but moves like this are putting it on the map.

                            The company plans to allocate approximately 85 percent of the IPO proceeds toward operational expenditures of its subsidiary Crypto Futures Exchange (CFX).

Anthony Pompliano is taking his bitcoin-native financial platform ProCap BTC public through a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I (CCCM), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cohen & Company.

The transaction, announced Monday, positions the new entity, ProCap Financial, Inc., as one of the largest bitcoin treasuries ever to hit public markets.

In what's being called the largest initial fundraise for a public bitcoin BTC$102,431.68 treasury company to date, ProCap raised $550 million in preferred equity and secured $225 million in convertible notes, giving future shareholders immediate exposure to bitcoin through a structure designed to acquire BTC ahead of the deal's close.

Led by Pompliano, a well-known investor and vocal bitcoin advocate, ProCap aims to operate at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. 

The company plans to generate profit not just by holding BTC but by actively deploying its bitcoin balance sheet across yield-generating strategies that mitigate risk and capitalize on crypto-financial infrastructure.

""The legacy financial system is being disrupted by bitcoin,"" Pompliano said in a statement. ""ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors.""

The merger values the combined entity at up to $1 billion, depending on the final bitcoin purchase price at closing. ProCap's BTC assets will be custodied until the transaction completes, giving investors near-instant BTC exposure without waiting for the company to go public.

The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2025, pending SEC review and shareholder approval.

The Financial Times first reported that Pompliano was set to become the CEO of ProCap BTC, and that the company was planning to raise $750 million to acquire bitcoin.

Dogecoin staged a sharp recovery following a dramatic weekend selloff, during which the token plummeted to a low of $0.143 before rebounding above $0.153. The move came amid surging trading volume — over five times the daily average — confirming buyer interest at critical support levels and hinting at a potential momentum shift as broader markets remain turbulent.

DOGE posted a volatile 9.1% range over the 24-hour window, falling from $0.157 to $0.143 before rebounding to close near $0.153. Most dramatic selling occurred during hours 13–14, where volume spiked to over five times the average, establishing a firm floor at $0.145.

In the final hour of trading, Dogecoin surged from $0.152 to $0.153, with a notable breakout above $0.153432 occurring after 04:58. Volume surged again at 05:11 (10.7M), confirming buyer strength and pushing DOGE to a new local high.

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.

As Asia begins the trading week, bitcoin {{BTC}} is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside.

While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction, markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation.

The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran's response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing.

Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode.

In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC's weekend drop, like ether ETH$2,280.21, XRP XRP$2.05, and solana's SOL SOL$136.80, are also clawing back losses.

For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break.

Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information.

Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license.

Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets.

OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter.

Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month.

The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites.

There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52%.

 Michael Saylor's Strategy bought another 245 Bitcoin last week after doubling down on his long-term BTC price prediction, forecasting BTC to hit $21 million in 21 years. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest public Bitcoin investor, disclosed its latest BTC purchases as the cryptocurrency slid in response to escalating geopolitical fears last week.

Strategy acquired 245 Bitcoin (BTC) for $26 million during the week ending Sunday, the company announced in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday.

The cost of Strategy's latest Bitcoin haul averaged $105,856 per coin, with Bitcoin plummeting from about $108,900 on June 16 to an intraweek low of just below $99,000, according to CoinGecko data.

Its recent purchases, including a $1 billion Bitcoin buy, have boosted the company's holdings to 592,345 BTC bought for about $41.9 billion at an average price of $70,681 per coin.

The latest purchase is one of Strategy's smallest buys in recent months. It is the smallest since March, when the firm bought 130 BTC for $10.7 million.

Like the March transaction, last week's purchase came during a price pullback, prompting some observers to question why the company didn't buy more at lower prices.

Strategy's approach to buying bigger amounts at higher prices aligns with Saylor's Bitcoin accumulating philosophy and commitment to “buying the top forever.”

In late 2024, Saylor pledged to keep buying BTC at peak prices no matter how high prices would go.

“I'm sure that I will be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin — probably $1 billion a day of Bitcoin at $1 million a coin,” he said.

Following its latest purchases, Strategy has maintained its Bitcoin yield, an indicator reflecting the percentage increase in the value of its BTC fortune over a specific period of time.

According to Strategy's data, its year-to-date BTC yield after the new purchases stood at 19.2%, just 0.01% above the yield in the previous $1 billion BTC buy announced on June 16.

The latest BTC yield surge brings Strategy closer to its targeted YTD yield goal of 25% by the end of 2025. The company previously targeted a smaller yield of 15% but increased it on May 1.

Strategy's new Bitcoin purchase announcement came shortly after Saylor raised his long-term price prediction on Saturday, forecasting the cryptocurrency to hit $21 million in 21 years.

 Trezor warned of ongoing phishing attempts exploiting its support contact form. 

Hardware wallet producer Trezor warned users about an ongoing phishing campaign that mimics the company's official customer support replies.

In a Monday X post, Trezor warned that the firm is aware “attackers abused our contact form to send scam emails appearing as legitimate Trezor support replies.” The company reminded its customers not to share wallet backups, noting that they should always be kept “private and offline.”

Trezor said it “will never ask for your wallet backup,” confirming that the emails may appear as legitimate but are not.

Trezor noted that the issue has now been contained. Trezor clarified that no email breach had occurred; attackers submitted requests to the firm's support system on behalf of affected users, which triggered automated replies.

Those requests resulted in an auto-reply coming from the Trezor support system. The firm claimed that its “contact form remains safe and secure.”

Trezor did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment.

Phishing attacks are prevalent in the cryptocurrency industry, with spearphishing attacks targeting high-net-worth individuals often resulting in substantial losses. Mehdi Farooq, an investment partner at crypto venture capital firm Hypersphere, recently revealed that he lost a significant portion of his life savings in such a targeted phishing attack.

In late May, a single victim was scammed two times within three hours, losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins. Hacks to expose one's phishing bait to a large number of potential victims are also not uncommon.

A few days ago, the crypto price tracking service CoinMarketCap removed a malicious pop-up notification from its website, prompting users to verify their cryptocurrency wallets. A similar attack was also conducted on Cointelegraph in a now-resolved incident.

On Saturday, Cointelegraph experienced a brief compromise of its banner publishing system. The breach resulted in a malicious advertisement promoting a fake token airdrop. The unauthorized code was removed, and additional security measures have since been implemented to prevent similar incidents.

 Grant Cardone's real estate investment firm has bought 1,000 Bitcoin as part of its new treasury strategy combining real estate and crypto. 

Real estate mogul Grant Cardone has announced the firm's first Bitcoin purchase as it becomes the latest firm to embrace a digital asset treasury strategy.

Cardone Capital added 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, becoming the “first ever real estate/Bitcoin company integrated with full BTC strategy,” CEO Grant Cardone said on X on Saturday. 

The billionaire entrepreneur added that the strategy was “combining the two best-in-class assets,” real estate and Bitcoin, and added that the firm expects to add another 3,000 BTC to its treasury this year.

The purchase is worth just over $101 million at current market prices and will place Cardone Capital above mining firms Core Scientific and Cipher Mining in terms of Bitcoin holdings, according to BiTBO.

Cardone Capital is a private equity real estate firm that was launched in 2017. It pools investor capital to acquire multifamily residential properties and currently manages more than 14,000 units with an estimated $5.1 billion in assets under management 

In May, the real estate investment firm launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund, a dual-asset fund consisting of a 346-unit multifamily commercial property located on the Miami River in Miami, and $15 million in Bitcoin.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the time, Cardone said his brother inspired him to “create a fund where we buy real estate, add Bitcoin, and then use the cash flow from the real estate purchase to buy more Bitcoin.”

Cardone Capital isn't the only company buying Bitcoin over the past week. Japanese Bitcoin investment strategy firm Metaplanet has also been increasing its treasury with the announcement of the acquisition of an additional 1,111 BTC on Monday. 

The latest purchase, at a price of $105,700 per Bitcoin, brings the total holdings to 11,111 BTC, worth around $1.12 billion at current market prices. 

Meanwhile, Strategy founder Michael Saylor has hinted at another Bitcoin purchase with his regular weekend post of the portfolio tracker, which has preceded a Monday acquisition in previous weeks. 

“Nothing Stops This Orange,” Saylor said, captioning the chart, which showed a treasury value of just under $61 billion.

 Bitcoin has lost more than 8% over the past week as geopolitical tensions and military action between Israel and Iran ramped up. 

Bitcoin prices dipped below six figures for the first time since early May, but the weakness is only temporary, according to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. 

Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell to their lowest level for more than six weeks in late trading on Sunday when they dipped below $98,500, coming after a US airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. 

However, the sub-six-figure drop didn't last long, and the asset had reclaimed $101,000 during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. 

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes said on X that the “weakness shall pass” and Bitcoin will “leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” He said that this will be driven by more central bank money printing. 

In a note shared with Cointelegraph, 10x Research head of research Markus Thielen said that as long as Bitcoin remains above the short-term realized price of $98,000 and the $102,000 trend support, “traders can continue to look for tactical rally opportunities.”

However, he cautioned that a break below this range “would shift the focus to risk management, especially in the absence of strong upside catalysts.”

Bitcoin has been in a five-week consolidation phase, with three failed attempts to break above $110,000 due to short-term macroeconomic shocks, from tariff concerns in May to the Israel–Iran escalation in June.

Thielen told Cointelegraph that he expects the sideways trading to continue for a few months. “Our view is that we consolidate over the summer,” he said. 

Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at digital asset platform OSL, remains bullish.

“Despite Bitcoin briefly dipping below $100,000 amid heightened geopolitical tensions following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, its resilience suggests strong institutional support and long-term bullish sentiment,” he told Cointelegraph on Monday. 

He added that structural demand for both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) persists as market volatility “underscores crypto's sensitivity to macro risks, highlighting the ongoing pattern to absorb shocks and continue in a general bullish trend.” 

Meanwhile, Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph that altcoins could start to perform better in the coming months. 

“While Bitcoin's volatility has been the focus after the US-Iran escalation, the altcoin market is showing signs of divergent strength,” he said, adding: 

Most of the altcoins were in the red at the time of writing, with the overall crypto market capitalization down 1.5%, or around $50 billion, over the past 12 hours in a fall to $3.21 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

How Bird Flu Became a Human Pandemic Threat

The first hints that a new strain of avian illness is emerging could be found on this beach on Delaware Bay, where migrating birds flock. Here's what virus detectives who return there every year know right now.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

H5N1 bird flu has been making a lot of headlines since last year, and for good reason: since March 2024 this subtype of bird flu has infected upwards of 1,000 herds of dairy cattle, raising concerns about the virus's ability to pass between mammals.

This week Science Quickly is doing a three-part deep dive to bring you the latest research on bird flu. From visiting dairy farms to touring cutting-edge virology labs we'll explore what scientists have learned about bird flu—and why it poses such a potential risk to humans.

Lauren Young: Out on Norbury's Landing, a small strip of sandy beach at the southern tip of New Jersey on the Delaware Bay, Pamela McKenzie peers through her binoculars at a massive flock of shorebirds.

McKenzie: It's just, like, a sea of red bellies.

Young: A flurry of different migratory birds, including red knots, ruddy turnstones and sanderlings, are making a pit stop on their long migration up to the Arctic Circle.

The birds are just in sight, and Pam desperately wants to get closer without disturbing them. But there's a problem: the high tide has filled a small channel that's blocking our path.

Young (tape): Wow, there's, like, tons of them over there. That's wild.

McKenzie: Of course, right where we need to go.

Young: So most people go to the beach for the cool waves, the salty breeze and the sunshine. Some might go to collect seashells. But Pam is out here collecting bird poop.

Every year in mid-May she hops between the various beaches of Delaware Bay, scooping poop that just might contain avian influenza viruses. By the second day of this year's collection her team had already found samples that came back positive for different bird flu viruses, but not the headline-making H5N1—at least not yet.

McKenzie: What's unique about Delaware Bay is that it's a hotspot for influenza. Every year these birds migrate here, and we find influenza—and different influenza—every year.

Young: Pam is a virus detective. As director of surveillance for the St. Jude Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response she and her fellow research scientists take an annual visit to Delaware Bay. They do this to stay on top of the avian influenza viruses actively circulating in the flocks of migrating shorebirds.

Robert Webster: One of the very important contributions that the laboratory here at St. Jude has made was the realization that influenza in aquatic birds replicates mainly in the intestinal tract and the birds poop it out.

Young: That's Robert Webster. He first visited Delaware Bay in 1985. Robert began St. Jude's influenza surveillance research at the bay, which has continued for the last 40 years.

Webster: Vast quantities of virus [were] in the feces. And so going back to Delaware Bay we didn't have to catch the birds; we simply followed them and took fecal samples from the beach when they pooped.

Young: The reason the shorebirds are here, pooping out a lot of influenza, has to do with the full moon—the first full moon in May, to be exact. The moon's gravitational pull causes the high tides to swell, drawing in thousands of horseshoe crabs, tussling in huge mating piles along the waterline. And the birds know this is the start of the crabs' mating season.

[CLIP: Waves crash on the beach, and birds caw.]

Young: Standing on the shore of Norbury's Landing on a blustery mid-May afternoon, I watched this scene unfold.

Young (tape): So that one is attached and mating.

McKenzie: Yeah, so if she was over here laying eggs, it would be trying to fertilize the eggs, and—like right here: see how its claws are attached to her?

Young: The heavily armored crabs look a bit alien, and sometimes a bit silly, as they draw odd tracks in the sand like uncoordinated Roombas. The ancient arthropods burrow into the sand and lay millions of gelatinous eggs. Those eggs provide the perfect buffet for the migrating birds that need to bulk up before their next leg in their journey.

McKenzie: They're pretty thin though, so they'll be around for a while. They're not nice and fat.

Young: And Pam needs the birds to eat because she needs them to poop.

As time passes and the tide retreats, first the birds swoop in to feast, and then Pam comes in, hot on their trail of droppings. After 15 years of doing this work Pam has developed a special eye for bird poop. She can make a pretty good first guess of what poop belongs to the migratory bird she's most interested in.

McKenzie: Here's one. That's one. It's probably a sanderling, like, small—you know, it's small, so probably a small bird. So this right here, this is so crass [laughs], but it's like a little log, and ruddy turnstones tend to drop logs, so.

Young: Fresh poop is best—damp but not drenched from the tide. This increases the odds it'll contain live virus that can be sequenced back at the lab. Once Pam spots a promising, intact poo she'll use a swab to swiftly scoop the sample from the sand and into a vial.

St. Jude's research center holds a library of more than 20,000 viruses, including isolates of various iterations, or subtypes, of avian influenza collected from Delaware Bay and other locations around the world.

Influenza subtypes are generally classified based on two specific surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. They represent the H and the N in flu names you've probably seen, like the common seasonal flu subtypes H1N1 and H3N2.

There are 144 H and N possible combinations of avian influenza. And over the years the St. Jude team has detected nearly every subtype in fecal samples collected at Delaware Bay. That includes the subtype that's been on our minds a lot lately.

Webster: Amongst those was H5N1, indeed, but not from the European or Chinese ones.

Young: The particular shorebirds stopping by Delaware Bay might not be carrying the kind of bird flu that could be dangerous to domestic animals or humans. But with the right genetic mixing we could potentially see outbreaks of a new “killer” strain like the one currently ripping through U.S. farms.

Since 2022 a deadly new strain of H5N1 has infected more than 170 million domestic poultry, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The virus has raised our egg prices, led to the culling of millions of chickens and infected upwards of 1,000 herds of dairy cattle since March 2024.

But to really understand the high-pathogenic H5N1 in our cows and chickens—and where it might go from here—we have to go back in time and look at wild birds.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: Wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, are hosts, or reservoirs, of different influenza viruses. They're categorized as either low-pathogenic or highly pathogenic, depending on how well they cause disease in chickens. A highly pathogenic, or “high-path,” virus, as many influenza researchers like to call it, can wipe out an entire poultry flock in just a few days.

The earliest records of high-path avian influenza are believed to come from the late 1800s, when what was known at the time as “fowl plague” ripped through poultry in Europe. Sporadic spillovers from wild to domestic birds have continued ever since.

Keiji Fukuda: In the influenza field it was clear that there was a very large group of influenza viruses, which infected birds and sometimes infected animals, and then there was a much smaller group of human influenza viruses, which infected people.

Young: That's Keiji Fukuda, a retired physician and influenza epidemiologist who worked for various institutions, including the University of Hong Kong, World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Fukuda: We thought these were separate groups of viruses and that animal influenza viruses did not infect humans.

Young: That changed in 1997, when a previously healthy three-year-old boy in Hong Kong was hospitalized and developed a severe pneumonia. Six days later the boy died. Influenza researchers around the world were called upon to help identify the exact type of virus. Robert was one of them.

Webster: It couldn't be identified at CDC. It couldn't be identified in London or in Holland, where they sent it, and they applied to me for the whole range of influenza virus reference serum, and they identified this virus as an H5, an H5N1. And no one would quite believe that this virus had killed the child.

Young: That shocked scientists and public health leaders, including molecular virologist Nancy Cox. She's retired now but worked at the CDC from 1975 to 2014 and was leading the agency's influenza branch in 1997.

Nancy Cox: We didn't expect to see high-path avian influenza viruses infecting humans. We just didn't expect that. We hadn't seen it before. It was really quite out of left field.

Young: Questions started flying rapid-fire.

Fukuda: How could this boy have become infected?

Cox: Where'd this virus come from? Could it have been a laboratory contaminant from eggs that had come in from an infected farm?

Fukuda: Was this boy associated with any kind of unusual exposures?

Cox: Were there other cases that had yet to be identified in Hong Kong?

Young: Everyone hoped the child was a tragic one-off case. But a few months later their worst fears became a reality: more people developed H5N1 infections.

Keiji, who was also with the CDC at the time and had worked with local public health officials on the ground on the first case, returned to Hong Kong.

[CLIP: A reporter interviews Keiji Fukuda during a 1997 press conference: “[Is there a] possibility this virus could, could become stronger in, in terms of its efficiency?”]

[CLIP: Fukuda responds to the reporter: “Well, by stronger, you mean it could become more adapted to humans and sort of pass through? Yes, there is that possibility.”]

Young: That was younger Keiji back in 1997, talking to a reporter at a press conference in Hong Kong as the outbreak was unfolding.

Fukuda: We're dealing with a virus which has remained persistent for at least some period of time, and we have no idea: “Is this the beginning of another pandemic?” And the investigations took on a whole different flavor. It was very serious.

Young: Keiji says the team eventually determined that the virus seemingly spread through traditional live bird markets, often referred to as wet markets. As is the case in many Asian cultures it is common for people in Hong Kong to purchase fresh poultry, including chicken, duck and goose, that is often killed on-site.

Guided by public health advisers, government officials ordered that the markets suspend sales and get cleaned—and that farms and markets cull all poultry.

Fukuda: At that time it was a very kind of disquieting decision and implementation. You know, we had never before recommended the culling of such a large number of birds.

Young: Although it was a brutal decision for farmers and sellers the tactic worked, effectively squashing an outbreak that seemed on the verge of taking off. By the end of the outbreak six people had died of the 18 with confirmed infections. Thankfully there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, which is key to kick-starting a pandemic.

The genetic sequences of the virus also revealed genes tracing back to its likely reservoir: waterfowl, or geese. Here's Nancy.

Cox: What we saw at the very beginning of the H5N1 outbreak back in 1997 is that the viruses that we identified from poultry and from people were really very, very similar.

Young: But she says a lot has happened since the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak.

Cox: Now we've had this virus circulating globally, and what we're seeing is a huge amount of diversity, and what does that mean? It means that we have a lot more opportunities for the virus to develop the ability to infect humans more efficiently and then eventually, potentially, to become transmissible from human to human.

Young: As H5N1 has fanned across the globe over the years its activity has been a bit like a simmering volcano: occasionally waking up in dramatic spurts, only to go quiet again. And each time it flares up the virus gets a new opportunity to tweak itself—ever so slightly.

Wendy Puryear: During that whole 30-year time period there continued to be ongoing evolution and shifts and changes in the virus.

Young: Wendy Puryear is a scientist studying influenza evolution and adaptation at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University.

Puryear: It's an RNA virus, and that means that it is sloppy in the way that it replicates, so there's constantly slight changes that are being introduced every time that virus goes through a replication cycle.

Young: Wendy's research at Tufts focuses on the surveillance of different subtypes of influenza and wildlife. She's been watching with increasing unease how changes, or mutations, are creating a vast diversity of H5N1 viruses—including ones that might be better at infecting different animals.

Puryear: Prior to the COVID pandemic the thing that many of us were very concerned would be the next pandemic of large impact on human health was influenza. So this is one that we've been worried about for a long time.

Young: Wendy says H5N1 keeps hitting mutation milestones that are getting too close for comfort.

Puryear: We keep going further down that road of “at least it hasn't.”

“At least it hadn't gone into a lot of wild animals and was disseminating around the globe.”

Young: Now lineages of the virus have been detected in animals in nearly every continent. H5N1 has established itself in domestic poultry in various countries in Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, Africa and Europe.

And [starting] a few years ago the number of bird species carrying H5N1 has ballooned. More than 500 different avian species, ranging from seabirds to songbirds, have tested positive for H5N1, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Puryear: “Well, now it is. Well, at least it wasn't going into mammals.”

Young: Then around 2020 and 2021 highly pathogenic H5N1 started to infect different mammals, to date affecting more than 90 different species in total, including coyotes, minks, opossums, skunks and rodents.

The virus had previously been found in the occasional fox or tiger, typically predators that might've eaten an infected wild bird. But the list of newly infected mammal species is growing in a way that hasn't been seen before.

Pruyear: “At least there wasn't evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission.” Well, then we had that in marine mammals in South America.

Young: In 2022 and 2023 the virus spread among various marine animals along the coast of Peru and Chile, killing more than 30,000 sea lions. It happened so rapidly that scientists suspected it must have traveled directly between animals.

The virus made its way around to the Atlantic coast. Groups of dolphins, porpoises and otters were also infected.

Puryear: “Well, at least it's not in a context that we're in close proximity between humans and those mammals.” Well, now it's in dairy cattle.

Young: No one expected the virus to hit U.S. dairy cows. How it got onto farms in the first place is still a bit of a mystery; you'll hear a lot more about that in the next episode of this three-part series. But it's important to say that scientists do have a strong hunch about how the virus made that jump—and you probably guessed it: wild birds.

Louise Moncla: There's this whole diversity of low-path viruses that don't really cause as many problems that circulate endemically in these wild birds in North America.

Young: That's Louise Moncla. She's a pathobiologist leading a lab at the University of Pennsylvania that's building a family tree of avian influenza viruses.

Moncla: Through this process called reassortment this incurring kind of new virus that entered started mixing with those viruses, and so we now have this diverse mixture of viruses sort of circulating in wild birds, resulting in the emergence of these new genotypes ...

Young: New genotypes, or unique genetic profiles, like the high-path H5N1 that scientists think started infecting dairy cows. This genetic mixing, or reassortment of different influenza viruses, occurs when they co-infect one host: a bird, an animal or, worse, a human. That opens up the window for genetic information to be exchanged.

Here's Wendy again to unpack a bit of what Louise said.

Puryear: Not only do you have this regular evolution that happens with the virus being sloppy in how it replicates, but the fact that it has its genome on separate pieces, its genetic information is actually—those genes are on separate chunks of, of RNA, and that means that it can take a whole gene and swap it out with a different form of influenza, so that gives a whole new kinda Frankenstein version of the virus that can then move forward.

Young: And this process of virus info swapping can potentially spiral into something much bigger—and deadlier.

Here's Louise again.

Moncla: Reassortment is a really important process for influenza evolution because it has led to every past pandemic that we know about. So we usually get influenza pandemics when viruses from two different species mix via reassortment and [that] results in a virus for which a host population like humans doesn't have any prior immunity.

Young: But those viral swap meets leave footprints—clues that help researchers like Wendy and Louise track influenza evolution through time and space. Louise's flu family tree models, for instance, allow for real-time tracking of noteworthy genetic changes in H5N1. The tree's branches show small shifts from the virus's sloppy reproduction and the big evolutionary leaps from reassortment.

Moncla: If you sample and sequence those viral genomes, you can use those mutations to link cases together. So these genomes provide this nice little map of how this virus has been moving between different host species or populations or geographic areas.

Young: And wild birds help paint a picture of where the virus might be now and where it might go next. These feathered virus carriers have effectively moved influenza around the world and into our domesticated animals.

But Louise, Wendy, Nancy, Keiji and folks at St. Jude are all quick to say that migrating birds and wildlife shouldn't be blamed for H5N1's current stronghold—it's the way that humans monitor and respond to the situation.

Moncla: Now that these viruses are really being driven by transmission of wild birds we need to understand how these viruses evolve in wild birds a lot better. And so something I'm really hoping continues to happen is surveillance in wild birds. You know, so without this kind of continuous surveillance effort in wild birds we wouldn't have been able to understand the outbreak in dairy cattle or these human spillovers and where they're coming from.

Young: Wild birds can't be stopped, but they can be watched—just like how the St. Jude group is surveying the shorebirds at Delaware Bay, year after year.

[CLIP: Birds caw.]

Young: Back in Delaware Bay, armed with vials of bird poop and a compact scientific camper van, another virus hunter is doing exactly that.

Lisa Kercher: My name is Lisa Kercher. I am the director of laboratory operations for the Webby Lab group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, which is a—our lab group is a large influenza research laboratory.

Young (tape): Great, and tell us where we are right now.

Kercher: Yes, we're sitting in a 19-foot toy hauler that is a trailer camper that has been built out to work as a molecular biology lab.

Lisa Kercher, the director of laboratory operations for the Webby Lab group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, stands in the doorway of her converted camper that she has retrofitted as a mobile avian influenza testing laboratory. Next to her is her trusty lab assistant, Jax, a Labrador Retriever.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: Lisa lives part time in her truck and camper, living and sleeping alongside carefully stored poop samples preserved in cold liquid nitrogen. The space is a cozy fit for the two of us and her sweet English Labrador retriever, Jax.

Like a lot of campers it's got a small kitchen, bathroom and a very comfortable bed, according to Lisa, but she's customized the space with a makeshift lab bench.

Kercher: I have like already shattered the door once and had to have it replaced.

Young (tape): No...!

Young: Her working area is stocked with protective gear, reagents, pipettes, well plates and a variety of miniature equipment, including a PCR machine that can quickly amplify DNA from samples Pam collected the day before.

Kercher: It can then immediately run a PCR for flu and for H5, and I know on my little laptop here if that's positive within about an hour. And so by the time I'm driving home I have the prevalence of the flu that was in these shorebirds for the time I was here. So it's a great first step.

Young: At that point in site collecting she had processed 250 fecal samples. By the end of the week the team will have collected 1,000. Later the samples will be transported to St. Jude's main labs in Tennessee to verify Lisa's initial readings.

Before she started doing this real-time surveillance work two years ago, the team wouldn't know what avian influenza subtypes they had on their hands until about six months after the sample collections.

Kercher: It's very hard to do epidemiology of how the virus is moving and tracking when you spend six months waiting for the sequence to come out of a national lab or any big lab. It's just hard logistically to then backtrack and figure that out. You can do it, but it's usually a year later. And then you are usually faced with a whole different virus by that time. So the point of doing it faster is so that you can do risk assessment in more real time.

Young: But if Lisa wants to be really fast, she needs more data. The poo samples from the beach are valuable sources of viral sequences, but they can't offer the full flu picture.

Kercher: So when you get a flu virus from a fecal sample you have to give it a name, you have to same say the species that it came from. How do you know?

Young: Like solving any mystery the researchers want to answer the big whodunit—or in this case, who-dung-it.

Knowing the exact bird species that pooed the poo requires more testing and more time, and it's not something that she can do from inside the camper lab. That's why Lisa is teaming up with local wildlife ecologists. Enter Larry Niles and his bird-catching cannon.

Young (tape): So what do we have here today? What, what are we looking at with the, the little squeaking noises we've got going on?

Larry Niles: Most of those noises are from the sanderling. We caught almost 100 sanderlings.

Young (tape): Wow.

Niles: We caught a handful of [red] knots and ruddy turnstones.

Larry Niles holds a sanderling that is about to be weighed and measured and sampled at a beach in Delaware Bay in New Jersey.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: The day before visiting the mobile lab I was on the beach with Lisa and Larry. He co-leads the Delaware Bay Shorebird Project with Wildlife Restoration Partnerships. Larry has been catching shorebirds here as part of his conservation work for the last 29 years. And yes, his group uses something called a cannon net to nab these birds because ...

Niles: See, shorebirds very difficult to catch because they're hard to get close to because they're used to being out on flats like sand flats. Today we used two cannon, and see, the advantage of that is: the net, which is about 40 feet [roughly 12 meters] long, when we hook it up to the cannons, that net goes so fast that it gets over the birds before they have the time to react.

Young: The birds are temporarily corralled in cloth-covered boxes, waiting for Larry and the other researchers and volunteers to gently pull them out to collect various data points. They'll measure the birds' wings and beaks, weigh them and take a blood and feather sample before they're released back to the horseshoe-crab-egg feast on the beach.

And though Larry has his own research to do on the ecology of the birds—their health, their population numbers and what might threaten those things—he says it's a real bonus to have virus detectives like Pam and Lisa to work with, side by side.

Niles: I'm not a virologist; I'm an ecologist. But I understand the ecology of things, and I think melding the ecology of birds with the ecology of these viruses, that's our part—working with the virologists so that together we could figure it out.

Young: For Lisa, getting access to the shorebirds directly unlocks all sorts of crucial information.

Kercher: So, when you're getting the samples straight from the birds then you already know the species, so that just makes it a little bit easier.

Young: And it's along these migratory routes, called flyways, where the birds, the ecologists and the virologists with camper labs need to meet.

Kercher: When the avian virus jumps into a mammal it has the opportunity to mutate into becoming more mammalianlike, and that is why we are so concerned in the flyway.

Young: There are four main flyways, [also] called avian superhighways, that run through North America. Since getting her mobile lab up and running Lisa has driven it thousands of miles up and down these flyways to sites in Alberta, Canada, and northwest Tennessee. But these avian superhighways have also become increasingly concerning for H5N1.

Lisa Kercher, the director of laboratory operations for the Webby Lab group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, works in her converted camper on avian fecal samples.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Kercher: Those birds are carrying this virus in greater numbers and in lots more areas where there's potential for spillover into domestic poultry farms. And of course, this happened in the dairy farms—it spilled over into the cattle, so this virus is now very prevalent all over North America. But the flyways are important because the birds that carry it are moving quickly down the flyway in a very short period of time, and you have a lot of opportunity for spillover there.

Young: Lisa says that speed matters for a rapidly changing virus like H5N1. She could imagine her mobile lab getting scaled up into a large biosurveillance network: multiple satellite labs dotted up and down all the flyways, relaying genetic sequences to other influenza trackers like Louise and Wendy but also to farmers on the ground trying to keep their chickens and cows healthy.

Kercher: Wouldn't it be great if the farmer had a way to go on his computer and look at a dashboard and say, “Wow, I wonder where the flu is?” They need to know where it is circulating in the wild birds. And if they knew where it was ahead of time—or at least where it was coming from—they would have an opportunity, if they chose, to up their biosecurity a little bit.

Young: Until then virus detectors like Pam and Lisa continue to keep a watchful eye on the surprising twists and turns of H5N1, looking to the birds and the clues they leave behind.

Kercher: We'll never catch up with Mother Nature. We're never gonna catch up with the virus and how it mutates. But if we can get closer and approach it more, you can then look for mutations, much quicker things that make the virus resistant to antivirals or things that make it more mammalian adaptable. You would wanna know that sooner rather than later.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode, but there's lots more to come. Tune in on Wednesday for part two of our special series on bird flu, which explores how avian influenza made its unprecedented leap into cattle.

Majestic First Images from Rubin Observatory Show Universe in More Detail Than Ever Before

Astronomy fans can zoom in practically forever into the stunning first images from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

A small section of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's total view of the Virgo Cluster shows two prominent spiral galaxies (lower right), three merging galaxies (upper right), several groups of distant galaxies, many stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and more.

Editor's Note (6/23/25): This story will be updated with additional images and details shortly after 11 A.M. EDT.

Welcome to a mind-blowing new era of astronomy.

The long-awaited Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a cutting-edge new telescope perched atop a mountain in Chile, is releasing its first images of the universe on June 23—and its views are just as jaw-dropping as scientists hoped. (The observatory is holding a celebratory event today at 11 A.M. EDT to reveal additional images that you can watch a livestream of on YouTube. In addition, organizations are hosting watch parties open to the public around the world.)

The new images come from only 10 hours of observations—an eyeblink compared with the telescope's first real work, the groundbreaking, 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project. On display are billowing gas clouds that are thousands of light-years away from our solar system and millions of sparkling galaxies—all emblematic of the cosmic riches that the observatory will ultimately reveal.

A brief excerpt from a longer video made from more than 1,100 images captured by the Rubin Observatory begins with a close-up of a spiral galaxy and then zooms out to reveal about 10 million galaxies. Those 10 million galaxies are roughly 0.05 percent of the approximately 20 billion galaxies that Rubin will capture during its 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Credit: NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory

“In a lot of ways, it almost doesn't matter where we look,” said Aaron Roodman, a physicist at Stanford University and program lead for the Rubin Observatory's LSST Camera, in a preview press conference held on June 9.

“We're going to see changing objects; we're going to see moving objects; we're going to get a view of thousands and thousands of galaxies of stars in any field we look at,” he said. “In some sense, we could have looked anywhere and gotten fantastic images.”

In the end, the team decided to share several mosaics of images from the observatory that highlight its extremely wide field of view, which can capture multiple alluring targets in a single snapshot.

This image combines 678 separate images taken by the Rubin Observatory in just more than seven hours of observing time. Combining many images in this way clearly reveals otherwise faint or invisible details, such as the clouds of gas and dust that comprise the Trifid Nebula (top right) and the Lagoon Nebula, which are several thousands of light-years away from Earth.

The view above of the Triffid Nebula (top right) and Lagoon Nebula includes data from 678 individual images captured by the Rubin Observatory. Scientists stack and combine images in this way to see farther and fainter into the universe. The Triffid Nebula, also known as M20, and the Lagoon Nebula, also known as M8, are star-forming regions both located several thousand light-years away from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius.

The observatory also captured an initial view of the Virgo Cluster, a massive clump of galaxies located in the constellation of the same name. Individual detail images (at top and below) show a mix of bright Milky Way stars against a backdrop of myriad more distant galaxies. In addition, the team has released a teaser video of a stunning zoomable view of some 10 million galaxies that was created by combining some 1,100 images taken by the new observatory.

In a small section of the Rubin Observatory's total view of the Virgo Cluster, bright stars in the Milky Way galaxy shine in the foreground, and many distant galaxies are in the background.

NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory

The Rubin Observatory has promised to reveal additional imagery during the unveiling event later today, including the full video of the massive view of countless galaxies and another video depicting the more than 2,000 asteroids the telescope has already discovered in just 10 hours of observations.

These first glimpses from Rubin showcase the observatory's unprecedented discovery power. The telescope will survey the entire southern sky about once every three days, creating movies of the cosmos in full color and jaw-dropping detail.

“We've been working on this for so many years now,” says Yusra AlSayyad, an astronomer at Princeton University and the Rubin Observatory's deputy associate director for data management. “I can't believe this moment has finally come.”

For like... a week though. Don't worry.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Tesla has a planned production pause for the week of June 30, which has caught the attention of many news outlets. And while its stock took a brief nose dive, we don't think it's all that big a deal. These shutdowns are standard procedure elsewhere in the automotive industry, and don't actually present much cause for concern. Tesla is also delaying its Robotaxi rollout in Austin, TX, which may be a contributing factor, but the political situation between Elon Musk and President Trump is likely the biggest catalyst for the fluctuations in Tesla stock.

The manufacturing halt will allow Tesla to perform maintenance and improvements in key areas of its Cybertruck and Model Y production lines. Factories are only expected to be offline for the week of June 30th, with normal service set to return the following week. During the shutdown, employees will have the option to use paid time off or come into the factory voluntarily for training and/or cleaning. Many report that the shutdown will help ramp up production, but Tesla hasn't specifically said what areas it has targeted.

Previous Shutdowns?

Shut downs are nothing new for Tesla—or any automaker, for that matter. It's already halted production three times over the past seven months. The first shutdown (in December of 2024) was motivated by a battery supply issue, which was resolved fairly easily. Four months later (in April), Tesla reduced Cybertruck production by relocating a number of workers from the production lines. The most recent shutdown of the Model Y and Cybertruck lines (in May) was followed by training that aimed to improve the culture at the factory. 

Three shutdowns in such a short period of time could potentially be cause for concern, but they may also mark a shift in production strategy or challenges in maintaining consistent output. Consumers and Tesla stockholders will really just have to wait and see where this takes them. The brand releases its Q2 delivery numbers in July, which should provide a much clearer picture of its trajectory. 

Business Insider reports that it's fairly common for automakers to pause production lines for weeks, especially during the summer months when sales are low. For context, Ford suspended its F-150 assembly line in the fall of 2024 for seven weeks, and the vehicle still kept its spot as the best-selling pickup truck in the United States. Along with keeping things lightweight during slow sales periods, these shutdowns can also help automakers manage an inventory surplus or supply shortage.

Tesla's stock may be down now, but it's rarely maintained a downward spiral. The all-American automaker is going through a rough period, but always seems to find the eject button when it needs to.

How do you intuitively know that you can walk on a footpath and swim in a lake? Researchers from the University of Amsterdam have discovered unique brain activations that reflect how we can move our bodies through an environment. The study not only sheds new light on how the human brain works, but also shows where artificial intelligence is lagging behind. According to the researchers, AI could become more sustainable and human-friendly if it incorporated this knowledge about the human brain.

When we see a picture of an unfamiliar environment -- a mountain path, a busy street, or a river -- we immediately know how we could move around in it: walk, cycle, swim or not go any further. That sounds simple, but how does your brain actually determine these action opportunities?

PhD student Clemens Bartnik and a team of co-authors show how we make estimates of possible actions thanks to unique brain patterns. The team, led by computational neuroscientist Iris Groen, also compared this human ability with a large number of AI models, including ChatGPT. ""AI models turned out to be less good at this and still have a lot to learn from the efficient human brain,"" Groen concludes.

Viewing images in the MRI scanner

Using an MRI scanner, the team investigated what happens in the brain when people look at various photos of indoor and outdoor environments. The participants used a button to indicate whether the image invited them to walk, cycle, drive, swim, boat or climb. At the same time, their brain activity was measured.

""We wanted to know: when you look at a scene, do you mainly see what is there -- such as objects or colors -- or do you also automatically see what you can do with it,"" says Groen. ""Psychologists call the latter ""affordances"" -- opportunities for action; imagine a staircase that you can climb, or an open field that you can run through.""

Unique processes in the brain

The team discovered that certain areas in the visual cortex become active in a way that cannot be explained by visible objects in the image. ""What we saw was unique,"" says Groen. ""These brain areas not only represent what can be seen, but also what you can do with it."" The brain did this even when participants were not given an explicit action instruction. 'These action possibilities are therefore processed automatically,"" says Groen. ""Even if you do not consciously think about what you can do in an environment, your brain still registers it.""

The research thus demonstrates for the first time that affordances are not only a psychological concept, but also a measurable property of our brains.

What AI doesn't understand yet

The team also compared how well AI algorithms -- such as image recognition models or GPT-4 -- can estimate what you can do in a given environment. They were worse at predicting possible actions. ""When trained specifically for action recognition, they could somewhat approximate human judgments, but the human brain patterns didn't match the models' internal calculations,"" Groen explains.

""Even the best AI models don't give exactly the same answers as humans, even though it's such a simple task for us,"" Groen says. ""This shows that our way of seeing is deeply intertwined with how we interact with the world. We connect our perception to our experience in a physical world. AI models can't do that because they only exist in a computer.""

AI can still learn from the human brain

The research thus touches on larger questions about the development of reliable and efficient AI. ""As more sectors -- from healthcare to robotics -- use AI, it is becoming important that machines not only recognize what something is, but also understand what it can do,"" Groen explains. ""For example, a robot that has to find its way in a disaster area, or a self-driving car that can tell apart a bike path from a driveway.""

Groen also points out the sustainable aspect of AI. ""Current AI training methods use a huge amount of energy and are often only accessible to large tech companies. More knowledge about how our brain works, and how the human brain processes certain information very quickly and efficiently, can help make AI smarter, more economical and more human-friendly.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Quantum dice: Scientists harness true randomness from entangled photons","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250622225927.htm","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 08:29:07 GMT","

Randomness is incredibly useful. People often draw straws, throw dice or flip coins to make fair choices. Random numbers can enable auditors to make completely unbiased selections. Randomness is also key in security; if a password or code is an unguessable string of numbers, it's harder to crack. Many of our cryptographic systems today use random number generators to produce secure keys.

But how do you know that a random number is truly random? Classical computer algorithms can only create pseudo-random numbers, and someone with enough knowledge of the algorithm or the system could manipulate it or predict the next number. An expert in sleight of hand could rig a coin flip to guarantee a heads or tails result. Even the most careful coin flips can have bias; with enough study, their outcomes could be predicted.

""True randomness is something that nothing in the universe can predict in advance,"" said Krister Shalm, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Even if a random number generator used seemingly random processes in nature, it would be hard to verify that those numbers are truly random, Shalm added.

Einstein believed that nature isn't random, famously saying, ""God does not play dice with the universe."" Scientists have since proved that Einstein was wrong. Unlike dice or computer algorithms, quantum mechanics is inherently random. Carrying out a quantum experiment called a Bell test, Shalm and his team have transformed this source of true quantum randomness into a traceable and certifiable random-number service.

""If God does play dice with the universe, then you can turn that into the best random number generator that the universe allows,"" Shalm said. ""We really wanted to take that experiment out of the lab and turn it into a useful public service.""

To make that happen, NIST researchers and their colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder created the Colorado University Randomness Beacon (CURBy). CURBy produces random numbers automatically and broadcasts them daily through a website for anyone to use.

At the heart of this service is the NIST-run Bell test, which provides truly random results. This randomness acts as a kind of raw material that the rest of the researchers' setup ""refines"" into random numbers published by the beacon.

The Bell test measures pairs of ""entangled"" photons whose properties are correlated even when separated by vast distances. When researchers measure an individual particle, the outcome is random, but the properties of the pair are more correlated than classical physics allows, enabling researchers to verify the randomness. Einstein called this quantum nonlocality ""spooky action at a distance.""

This is the first random number generator service to use quantum nonlocality as a source of its numbers, and the most transparent source of random numbers to date. That's because the results are certifiable and traceable to a greater extent than ever before.

""CURBy is one of the first publicly available services that operates with a provable quantum advantage. That's a big milestone for us,"" Shalm explained. ""The quality and origin of these random bits can be directly certified in a way that conventional random number generators are unable to.""

NIST performed one of the first complete experimental Bell tests in 2015, which firmly established that quantum mechanics is truly random. In 2018, NIST pioneered methods to use these Bell tests to build the world's first sources of true randomness.

However, turning these quantum correlations into random numbers is hard work. NIST's first breakthrough demonstrations of the Bell test required months of setup to run for a few hours, and it took a great deal of time to collect enough data to generate 512 bits of true randomness. Shalm and the team spent the past few years building the experiment to be robust and to run automatically so it can provide random numbers on demand. In its first 40 days of operation, the protocol produced random numbers 7,434 times out of 7,454 attempts, a 99.7% success rate.

The process starts by generating a pair of entangled photons inside a special nonlinear crystal. The photons travel via optical fiber to separate labs at opposite ends of the hall. Once the photons reach the labs, their polarizations are measured. The outcomes of these measurements are truly random. This process is repeated 250,000 times per second.

NIST passes millions of these quantum coin flips to a computer program at the University of Colorado Boulder. Special processing steps and strict protocols are used to turn the outcomes of the quantum measurements on entangled photons into 512 random bits of binary code (0s and 1s). The result is a set of random bits that no one, not even Einstein, could have predicted. In some sense, this system acts as the universe's best coin flip.

NIST and its collaborators added the ability to trace and verify every step in the randomness generation process. They developed the Twine protocol, a novel set of quantum-compatible blockchain technologies that enable multiple different entities to work together to generate and certify the randomness from the Bell test. The Twine protocol marks each set of data for the beacon with a hash. Hashes are used in blockchain technology to mark sets of data with a digital fingerprint, allowing each block of data to be identified and scrutinized.

The Twine protocol allows any user to verify the data behind each random number, explained Jasper Palfree, a research assistant on the project at the University of Colorado Boulder. The protocol can expand to let other random number beacons join the hash graph, creating a network of randomness that everyone contributes to but no individual controls.

Intertwining these hash chains acts as a timestamp, linking the data for the beacon together into a traceable data structure. It also provides security, allowing Twine protocol participants to immediately spot manipulation of the data.

""The Twine protocol lets us weave together all these other beacons into a tapestry of trust,"" Palfree added.

Turning a complex quantum physics problem into a public service is exactly why this work appealed to Gautam Kavuri, a graduate student on the project. The whole process is open source and available to the public, allowing anyone to not only check their work, but even build on the beacon to create their own random number generator.

CURBy can be used anywhere an independent, public source of random numbers would be useful, such as selecting jury candidates, making a random selection for an audit, or assigning resources through a public lottery.

""I wanted to build something that is useful. It's this cool thing that is the cutting edge of fundamental science,"" Kavuri added. ""NIST is a place where you have that freedom to pursue projects that are ambitious but also will give you something useful.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Superbugs in your shrimp: Deadly colistin-resistance genes ride on imported seafood","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250622115159.htm","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 05:21:12 GMT","

Resistance to colistin, a potent antibiotic, is on the rise.

Colistin is a potent, last-resort antibiotic, used only to treat people with dangerous, life-threatening bacterial infections that have developed resistance to other drugs. But it's not foolproof. Worldwide, resistance to colistin is spreading, further diminishing treatment options and putting infected people at higher risk.

Researchers from the University of Georgia recently identified a way that colistin resistance genes are spreading: Imported seafood. In a new study, microbiologist Issmat Kassem, Ph.D., and his group have reported the first isolation of colistin-resistance genes in bacteria found in imported shrimp and scallops, purchased from 8 food markets around Atlanta, Ga. Kassem will be presenting the findings this week in Los Angeles at ASM Microbe 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. An accompanying paper will be published in the ASM journal mSphere.

""We love our seafood,"" Kassem said. Many people don't know that most seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, he said, including about 90% of shrimp. Imported seafood is screened for contaminants but the process doesn't catch everything, especially antimicrobial resistance genes. ""The bacteria that were carrying colistin resistance genes are not normally screened."" Kassem and his group also found that some of the resistance genes are carried on plasmids -- round bits of genetic material that can be transmitted from bacteria to bacteria.

Antimicrobial resistant infections kill hundreds of thousands of people globally every year, and antimicrobial resistance is a rising public health menace. Colistin was first introduced in the 1950s to treat infections by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, but it takes a heavy toll on patients, including increased risk of damage to the nerves and kidneys. It was discontinued in the U.S. in the 1980s. However, Kassem noted, other countries continued to use it in agricultural settings, both to treat infections and to promote animal growth. Colistin was eventually reintroduced to human medicine because it was one of the few options available to treat certain bacterial infections. The World Health Organization categorizes colistin as a high priority critically important antibiotic, which means it is an essential option for treating serious human infections.

In 2016, researchers discovered a mobile colistin resistant gene, or mcr, that was ""mobile"" because it could be transferred via lateral transmission, in plasmids passed among bacteria. Before then, Kassem said, researchers believed colistin resistance was inherited, not shared, ""which means it could not jump between different bacteria.""

Researchers have now identified at least 10 mcr genes and many alleles, or variations. Kassem, who has been studying antimicrobial resistance for 2 decades, suspected it might spread through the importing and exporting of food.

""Our food is sourced from different places,"" he said. ""If you go out to lunch today, your plate might have ingredients from 6, 7, 8 countries. Some countries do not have strict regulations for using antibiotics in food animal production, so imported food can be a vehicle for transmission of resistance."" In previous work, his group found mcr genes in samples from wastewater in Georgia; they also found the bacterial host that was carrying the plasmid containing the genes. It wasn't normally screened in food coming into the United States, he said. In studies published since then, researchers have found mcr genes in plasmids elsewhere.

When they screened seafood purchased from markets in Georgia, they found the same bacterial host, the same plasmids and the same genes that they'd previously identified in wastewater. ""The good news is that we didn't find it in locally produced seafood,"" Kassem said.

He cautioned that the group identified 1 source of colistin resistance, but there could be other, and they're likely spreading. ""We live in a very connected world,"" he said. ""We move a lot, we travel a lot, our food travels, and we are going to spread whatever emerges, even across national borders. So, it's important to invest in monitoring systems and expand them and collaborate, especially on the global level, on the issue of antimicrobial resistance.""

Insulin resistance detected by routine triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index can flag people with early Alzheimer's who are four times more likely to present rapid cognitive decline, according to new research presented at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025.1

Neurologists at the University of Brescia reviewed records for 315 non-diabetic patients with cognitive deficits, including 200 with biologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. All subjects underwent an assessment of insulin resistance using the TyG index and a clinical follow-up of 3 years. When patients were divided according to TyG index, those in the highest third of the Mild Cognitive Impairment AD subgroup deteriorated far more quickly than their lower-TyG peers, losing >2.5 points on the Mini Mental State Examination per year (hazard ratio 4.08, 95% CI 1.06-15.73). No such link appeared in the non-AD cohort.

""Once mild cognitive impairment is diagnosed, families always ask how fast it will progress,"" said lead investigator Dr. Bianca Gumina. ""Our data show that a simple metabolic marker available in every hospital laboratory can help identify more vulnerable subjects who may be suitable candidates for targeted therapy or specific intervention strategies.""

While insulin resistance has been linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, its role in how quickly the condition progresses has received less attention. This study aimed to fill that gap by focusing on its impact during the prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, when patients follow highly variable trajectories. The researchers used the TyG index, which offers a low-cost, routinely available surrogate for insulin resistance, to explore whether metabolic dysfunction could help predict the pace of cognitive decline after diagnosis.

In AD specifically, insulin resistance is believed to impair neuronal glucose uptake, promote amyloid accumulation, disrupt the blood-brain barrier, and fuel inflammation - pathways that are less relevant or differently regulated in other neurodegenerative diseases.

""We were surprised to see the effect only in the Alzheimer's spectrum and not in other neurodegenerative diseases,"" Dr. Gumina noted. ""It suggests a disease-specific vulnerability to metabolic stress during the prodromal window, when interventions may still change the trajectory.""

The researchers at University of Brescia, led by Professor Padovani and Professor Pilotto, found that high TyG was also associated with blood-brain barrier disruption and cardiovascular risk factors, yet it showed no interaction with the APOE ε4 genotype, indicating that metabolic and genetic risks may act through distinct pathways.2

Identifying high-TyG patients could refine enrolment for anti-amyloid or anti-tau trials and prompt earlier lifestyle or pharmacological measures to improve insulin sensitivity. The researchers are currently investigating whether TyG levels also track with neuroimaging biomarkers to aid earlier detection and stratification.

""If targeting metabolism can delay progression, we will have a readily modifiable target that works alongside emerging disease-modifying drugs,"" concluded Dr. Gumina.

The chemical reaction to produce hydrogen from water is several times more effective when using a combination of new materials in three layers, according to researchers at Linköping University in Sweden. Hydrogen produced from water is a promising renewable energy source - especially if the hydrogen is produced using sunlight.

The production of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the EU as of 2035. Electric motors are expected to become increasingly common in vehicles - but they are not suitable for all types of transport.

""Passenger cars can have a battery, but heavy trucks, ships or aircraft cannot use a battery to store the energy. For these means of transport, we need to find clean and renewable energy sources, and hydrogen is a good candidate,"" says Jianwu Sun, associate professor at Linköping University, who has led the study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

The LiU researchers are working on developing materials that can be used to produce hydrogen (H2) from water (H2O) by using the energy in sunlight.

The research team has previously shown that a material called cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) has beneficial properties for facilitating the reaction where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. The material can effectively capture the sunlight so that the energy therein can be used for hydrogen production through the photochemical water splitting reaction.

In their current study, the researchers have further developed a new combined material. The new material consists of three layers: a layer of cubic silicon carbide, a layer of cobalt oxide and a catalyst material that helps to split water.

""It's a very complicated structure, so our focus in this study has been to understand the function of each layer and how it helps improve the properties of the material. The new material has eight times better performance than pure cubic silicon carbide for splitting water into hydrogen,"" says Jianwu Sun.

When sunlight hits the material, electric charges are generated, which are then used to split water. A challenge in the development of materials for this application is to prevent the positive and negative charges from merging again and neutralising each other. In their study, the researchers show that by combining a layer of cubic silicon carbide with the other two layers, the material, known as Ni(OH)2/Co3O4/3C-SiC, becomes more able to separate the charges, thereby making the splitting of water more effective.

Today, there is a distinction between ""grey"" and ""green"" hydrogen. Almost all hydrogen present on the market is ""grey"" hydrogen produced from a fossil fuel called natural gas or fossil gas. The production of one tonne of ""grey"" hydrogen gas causes emission of up to ten tonnes of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and climate change. ""Green"" hydrogen is produced using renewable electricity as a source of energy.

The long-term goal of the LiU researchers is to be able to use only energy from the sun to drive the photochemical reaction to produce ""green"" hydrogen. Most materials under development today have an efficiency of between 1 and 3 per cent, but for commercialisation of this green hydrogen technology the target is 10 per cent efficiency. Being able to fully drive the reaction using solar energy would lower the cost of producing ""green"" hydrogen, compared to producing it using supplementary renewable electricity as is done with the technology used today. Jianwu Sun speculates that it may take around five to ten years for the research team to develop materials that reach the coveted 10 per cent limit.

The research has been funded with support from, among others, the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT), the Olle Engkvists Stiftelse, the ÅForsk Foundation, the Carl Tryggers Stiftelse and through the Swedish Government Strategic Research Area in Advanced Functional Materials (AFM) at Linköping University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Artificial intelligence isn't hurting workers—It might be helping","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250623072753.htm","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 14:03:45 GMT","

As artificial intelligence reshapes workplaces worldwide, a new study provides early evidence suggesting AI exposure has not, thus far, caused widespread harm to workers' mental health or job satisfaction. In fact, the data reveals that AI may even be linked to modest improvements in worker physical health, particularly among employees with less than a college degree.

But the authors caution: It is way too soon to draw definitive conclusions.

The paper, ""Artificial Intelligence and the Wellbeing of Workers,"" published June 23 in Nature: Scientific Reports, uses two decades of longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Using that rich data, the researchers -- Osea Giuntella of the University of Pittsburgh and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Luca Stella of the University of Milan and the Berlin School of Economics, and Johannes King of the German Ministry of Finance -- explored how workers in AI-exposed occupations have fared in contrast to workers in less-exposed roles.

""Public anxiety about AI is real, but the worst-case scenarios are not inevitable,"" said Professor Stella, who is also affiliated with independent European bodies the Center for Economic Studies (CESifo) and the Institute for Labor Economics (IZA). ""So far, we find little evidence that AI adoption has undermined workers' well-being on average. If anything, physical health seems to have slightly improved, likely due to declining job physical intensity and overall job risk in some of the AI-exposed occupations.""

Yet the study also highlights reasons for caution.

The analysis relies primarily on a task-based measure of AI exposure -- considered more objective -- but alternative estimates based on self-reported exposure reveal small negative effects on job and life satisfaction. In addition, the sample excludes younger workers and only covers the early phases of AI diffusion in Germany.

""We may simply be too early in the AI adoption curve to observe its full effects,"" Stella emphasized. ""AI's impact could evolve dramatically as technologies advance, penetrate more sectors, and alter work at a deeper level.""

Key findings from the study include:

Due to the data supply, the study focuses on Germany -- a country with strong labor protections and a gradual pace of AI adoption. The co-authors noted that outcomes may differ in more flexible labor markets or among younger cohorts entering increasingly AI-saturated workplaces.

""This research is an early snapshot, not the final word,"" said Pitt's Giuntella, who previously conducted significant research into the effect of robotics on households and labor, and on types of workers. ""As AI adoption accelerates, continued monitoring of its broader impacts on work and health is essential. Technology alone doesn't determine outcomes -- institutions and policies will decide whether AI enhances or erodes the conditions of work.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Recycled plastic is a toxic cocktail: Over 80 chemicals found in a single pellet","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250623072802.htm","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 14:14:45 GMT","

A single pellet of recycled plastic can contain over 80 different chemicals. A new study with researchers from University of Gothenburg and Leipzig shows that recycled polyethylene plastic can leach chemicals into water causing impacts in the hormone systems and lipid metabolism of zebrafish larvae.

The plastic pollution crisis has reached global levels, threatening both planetary and human health, and recycling is proposed as one of the solutions to the plastics pollution crisis. However, as plastics contain thousands of chemical additives and other substances that can be toxic, and these are almost never declared, hazardous chemicals can indiscriminately end up in recycled products.

Increasing gene expressions

In a new study, researchers bought plastic pellets recycled from polyethylene plastic from different parts of the world and let the pellets soak in water for 48 hours. After which zebrafish larvae were exposed to the water for five days. The experimental results show increases in gene expression relating to lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and endocrine regulation in the larvae.

""These short leaching times and exposure times are yet another indicator of the risks that chemicals in plastics pose to living organisms. The impacts that we measured show that these exposures have the potential to change the physiology and health of the fish,"" says Azora König Kardgar, lead author and researcher in ecotoxicology at the University of Gothenburg.

""Never full knowledge"" 

Previous research has shown similar effects to humans, including threats to reproductive health and obesity, from exposure to toxic chemicals in plastics. Some chemicals used as additives in plastics and substances that contaminate plastics are known to disturb hormones, with potential impacts on fertility, child development, links to certain cancers, and metabolic disorders including obesity and diabetes.

""This is the main obstacle with the idea of recycling plastic. We never have full knowledge of what chemicals will end up in an item made of recycled plastic. And there is also a significant risk of chemical mixing events occuring, which render the recycled plastic toxic,"" says Bethanie Carney Almroth, professor at the University of Gothenburg and principal investigator on the project.

Different chemicals

Apart from the study on the impact that recycled plastics have on zebra fish larvae, the researcher also conducted a chemical analysis of the chemicals leaching from the plastic pellets to the water. And they found a lot of different chemical compounds, but the mixture altered between different samples of pellets.

""We identified common plastics chemicals, including UV-stabilizers and plasticizers, as well as chemicals that are not used as plastics additives, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and biocides. These may have contaminated the plastics during their first use phase, prior to becoming waste and being recycled. This is further evidence of the complicated issue of plastics waste flows, and of toxic chemicals contaminating recycled plastics,"" says Eric Carmona, researcher at Department of Exposure Science, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig.

""Ban hazardous chemicals""

Representatives from the nations of the world are preparing to head to Geneva, Switzerland, in August, for what is planned to be the final negotiating meeting for a Global Plastics Treaty at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee under the United Nations Environmental Program. The authors of the work stress that negotiators and decision-makers must include provisions to ban or reduce hazardous chemicals in plastics, and to increase transparency and reporting along plastics value chains. Plastics cannot be recycled in a safe and sustainable manner if hazardous chemicals are not addressed.

""This work clearly demonstrates the need to address toxic chemicals in plastics materials and products, across their life cycle,"" says Professor Bethanie Carney Almroth. ""We cannot safely produce and use recycled plastics if we cannot trace chemicals throughout production, use and waste phases.""

Facts: Polyethylene (PE)

Polyethylene, abbreviated PE, is a type of plastic used in a lot of packaging materials like bottle caps, plastic bags, agricultural mulch films, insulation for wiring and cables, pipes, ropes, toys and household items. It is the most widely produced and used polymer. On plastic products made of polyethylene, the number in the recycling code is either 2 or 4.

Nature has evolved an exquisite yet limited set of chemical reactions that underpin the function of all living organisms. By contrast, the field of synthetic organic chemistry can access reactivity not observed in nature, and integration of these abiotic reactions within living systems offers an elegant solution to the sustainable synthesis of many industrial chemicals from renewable feedstocks. Here we report a biocompatible Lossen rearrangement that is catalysed by phosphate in the bacterium Escherichia coli for the transformation of activated acyl hydroxamates to primary amine-containing metabolites in living cells. Through auxotroph rescue, we demonstrate how this new-to-nature reaction can be used to control microbial growth and chemistry by generating the essential metabolite para-aminobenzoic acid. The Lossen rearrangement substrate can also be synthesized from polyethylene terephthalate and applied to whole-cell biocatalytic reactions and fermentations generating industrial small molecules (including the drug paracetamol), paving the way for a general strategy to bioremediate and upcycle plastic waste in native and engineered biological systems.

The development of biocompatible reactions—non-enzymatic chemical transformations that can be interfaced with cellular metabolism—is a nascent approach to expanding the synthetic repertoire of living systems1,2,3,4,5. Using synthetic strategies established in modern organic chemistry, biocompatible reactions can be applied to the control of cellular function6,7,8,9, the diversification of metabolites in vivo10,11,12 and biological access to otherwise recalcitrant feedstocks for industrial biotechnology13,14,15. This approach complements existing methods for abiotic catalysis in cells16,17,18, including directed evolution19,20, the creation of non-native active sites using artificial cofactors or unnatural amino acids21, and the bottom-up design of enzymes using computational methods22. However, the reconstitution of new-to-nature biocatalysts in vivo is challenging and has often limited their application to in vitro reactions. The metabolic integration of non-native chemistries in living cells and particularly within the context of cellular metabolism remains a great challenge in the field of chemical biotechnology2.

Strategies to increase the limited toolbox of metabolic chemistry for microbial synthesis would enable the bioproduction of an increased range of industrial small molecules from sustainable feedstocks using engineered biology, lowering existing chemical manufacturing routes reliance on diminishing fossil fuels. Recent work in this area is limited to the use of artificial metalloenzymes in microbial cells that have been metabolically engineered to generate substrate(s) and apoenzyme, followed by transport of a non-native cofactor to the cell interior for biosynthesis23. To this end, Huang et al. reported the non-natural cyclopropanation of metabolically derived limonene in engineered Escherichia coli using an intracellular Ir-CYP119 metalloenzyme and exogenous ethyl diazoacetate24. Import of the Ir-porphyrin cofactor for biosynthesis was enabled by co-expressing the hug operon haem transport system from Plesiomonas shigelloides alongside a heterologous limonene biosynthetic pathway and together enabled the bioproduction of an unnatural cyclopropane-containing terpenoid in 0.25 mg l−1 and a 1:7.0:2.3:1.5 ratio of diastereoisomers. Biocompatible cyclopropanation chemistry has also been demonstrated at the outer membrane of E. coli and in membrane-associated micelles using a non-enzymatic Fe-phthalocyanine catalyst to intercept styrene generated in vivo from d-glucose via engineered metabolism (95% yield, 553 mg l−1)25. More recently, however, Huang et al. have achieved the complete integration of non-native carbene-transfer-based cyclopropanation chemistry into microbial metabolism in the bacterium Streptomyces albus J107426. Here, the authors combine a heterologous styrene biosynthesis pathway from L-phenylalanine with the native biosynthesis of the diazo-containing natural product azaserine and an Ir(Me)MPIX artificial metalloenzyme to enable the bioproduction of an unnatural cyclopropane-containing metabolite from entirely biobased building blocks in vivo (0.22 mg l−1). In addition to combining the end products of two metabolic pathways using an artificial enzyme, in a different report, Liu et al. used a hemin-catalysed oxidative decarboxylation reaction to convert metabolically generated α-acetolactate to diacetyl and subsequently (S,S)-2,3-butanediol in engineered Lactococcus lactis27. Most recently, Dennis et al. demonstrated the biocompatible organocatalytic α-methylenation of metabolically generated butyraldehyde, which was then subsequently reduced to 2-methylbutanal in engineered E. coli28. Together, these studies demonstrate the metabolic flexibility of microorganisms and how chemical principles can be used within metabolic pathways using abiotic catalysis to generate new-to-nature small molecules in cells.

An unexplored area of biocompatible chemistry is the non-enzymatic rearrangement of activated carboxylate substrates and their integration with native and engineered metabolic pathways in cells. Discovered in 1872 by Wilhelm Lossen, the Lossen rearrangement is characterized by the thermal- or metal-catalysed expulsion of a carboxylate from a bis-acylated hydroxylamine substrate29 (Fig. 1a). The rearrangement typically involves a phenyl hydroxamate ester and proceeds under basic conditions via 1,2-aryl migration to form an isocyanate that rapidly reacts with water under aqueous conditions to form a carbamic acid, followed by decarboxylation to the primary amine product30,31. The reaction is synthetically useful as the Lossen rearrangement substrate can be formed from readily available carboxylic acids, avoids the use of azide reagents (cf. the Curtius rearrangement) and occurs under mild conditions32,33. Overall, the reaction generates primary amines from carboxylate substrates with an accompanying one-carbon contraction, contrasting with the enzymatic chemistry enabled by ammonia lyases and aminotransferases34,35,36. Lossen-type rearrangements have been observed in vitro as unproductive substrates37 using chymotrypsin and are found as intermediates responsible for hydroxamic acid toxicity in Salmonella typhimurium TA9838. However, to the best of our knowledge, the Lossen rearrangement has never been interfaced with microbial metabolism for biocompatible chemistry and therefore remains a functional group transformation that is unique to the field of synthetic organic chemistry.

LG, leaving group.

Here, we report the biocompatible Lossen rearrangement of acyl hydroxamates in living cells and interface this abiotic reaction with cellular metabolism for native and de novo biosynthesis in E. coli. The reaction occurs in vivo, under ambient conditions, is non-toxic to E. coli and is catalysed by phosphate in cells. We go on to synthesize the Lossen rearrangement substrate from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and show through auxotroph rescue experiments how E. coli growth and metabolism can be dependent upon a plastic-bottle-derived small molecule (Fig. 1b). Finally, metabolic cooperation with the Lossen rearrangement is demonstrated through the conditional biotransformation of exogenous alkenes and of PET-derived para-aminobenzoate (PABA) to the analgesic and antipyretic drug paracetamol (para-hydroxyacetanilide). Overall, this work expands the available toolbox of metabolic chemistry for small-molecule synthesis in native and engineered cells.

Inspired by Li et al. on the Fe-phenanthroline-catalysed Lossen rearrangement of heteroauxin-derived substrates in dichloromethane at room temperature and the reported hemin-catalysed N–O insertion chemistry in artificial enzymes39,40,41,42, we reasoned that a biocompatible metal catalyst would be effective in generating an intermediate nitrenoid from an O-pivaloyl (O-Piv)-substituted benzhydroxamate substrate under aqueous conditions39. We therefore set out to investigate whether the Lossen rearrangement was biocompatible and whether it could be interfaced with microbial metabolism to enable non-natural biosynthesis. To test catalyst reactivity and biocompatibility simultaneously, we designed an auxotroph rescue experiment where a para-carboxyl O-pivalolylhydroxamate Lossen rearrangement substrate 1 would generate the essential metabolite PABA in situ. PABA is essential for folic acid biosynthesis in bacteria, and organisms deficient in PABA cannot grow due to defects in nucleotide and DNA metabolism6,43. Auxotrophic organisms (including humans) must therefore sequester these essential nutrients from their surrounding environment or from other (micro)organisms living in close proximity. Therefore, a successful Lossen rearrangement of 1 would generate PABA and result in growth of the auxotrophic cells that could be detected by optical density (OD600) measurement (Fig. 2a). Moreover, toxic catalysts would inhibit cell growth irrespective of PABA generation and, therefore, successful growth would be a positive indicator of both catalyst activity and biocompatibility. To this end, O-Piv benzhydroxamate 1 was synthesized in two steps from 4-formylbenzoic acid via amide bond formation with O-Piv hydroxylamine followed by aldehyde oxidation using periodic acid and catalytic pyridinium chlorochromate (Supplementary Scheme 1). We selected a series of K-12-derived Keio collection knockout strains including E. coli BW25113∆pabB deficient in the catalytic subunit of aminodeoxychorismate synthase that is involved in the penultimate step of PABA biosynthesis (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). The catalyst screen was populated with metal complexes that have been reported in the literature to promote the Lossen or Curtius rearrangement and/or analogous reactions under mild or aqueous reaction conditions39,44,45. These include FeCl2, hemin, iron phthalocyanine, ferroin, ZnTPP, Zn(PPIX) and Zn(acac)2. Lossen substrate 1 (10 µM) was added to growth tubes containing M9-glycerol medium and catalyst (10 mol%) followed by E. coli BW25113∆pabB inoculated from a saturated starter culture grown in M9-glycerol medium containing PABA (105 dilution). Cultures were then incubated for 72 h at 37 °C at 220 r.p.m. (Fig. 2a). As expected, no cell growth was observed in the absence of PABA. However, we were surprised to observe that cell growth occurred in every other tube (Fig. 2b,c). Crucially, growth was observed in control cultures containing 1 and no catalyst, indicating that the Lossen rearrangement of 1 was biocompatible and either occurring spontaneously in growth media, being promoted by cellular components (for example, membranes) or being catalysed by a native enzyme in E. coli (Fig. 2d,e). To eliminate the latter two, PABA was quantified using a N-(1-napthyl)ethylenediamine colorimetric assay in control reactions performed in M9-glycerol only (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 2). Indeed, PABA was detected in the absence of cells and was not detected when 1 was incubated in ultrapure H2O. Sequential elimination of each component of M9 medium (NH4Cl, CaCl2, MgSO4 and HPO42−) and comparison with PABA generation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) revealed that the Lossen rearrangement of 1 was mediated by phosphate. Aniline formation from N-methyl O-acetyl benzhydroxamic acid 3 or benzhydroxamic acid 4 was also abolished under these conditions (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 3), demonstrating that the reaction probably proceeds via initial N–H deprotonation followed by 1,2-aryl migration, rather than ester hydrolysis followed by a phosphate-catalysed rearrangement of the corresponding hydroxamic acid (Fig. 2g). Spectrophotometric analysis of the cultures revealed that the highest OD600 was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of 1 and either FeCl2, ferroin or Fe(acac)3 (Fig. 2c). Intriguingly, these complexes are the weakest Fe binders, and therefore the higher growth of these cultures is probably due to a non-enzymatic phosphate-catalysed Lossen rearrangement followed by increased Fe availability to the microorganism during the log-phase of growth, which is limiting in the tested conditions. Auxotroph rescue was also confirmed in Keio knockout strains E. coli BW25113∆pabA and E. coli BW25113∆aroC, and both displayed either an extended lag phase or lower final cell density when compared with E. coli BW25113∆pabB grown in the presence of PABA or 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The toxicity of 1 to E. coli BW25113∆pabB was determined by a serial dilution and plate count assay. All substrates were biocompatible with E. coli growth by OD600 and colony-forming units (CFU) per millilitre in the 10–1,000 µM range (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4). A panel of O-acyl substrates containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups were screened and converted to aromatic amines with no notable rate increase by colorimetric assay, except for a rapid product formation when using pentafluorobenzyl substrate S2 (Supplementary Fig. 3) and abolished Lossen reactivity using the hydrophilic O-succinyl substrate S6 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Competing hydrolysis to benzhydroxamic acid 4 was observed for the O-Ac substrate and so 1 was selected for further study. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantification over time in the presence and absence of replicating E. coli BW25113∆pabB cells revealed increased substrate consumption after >24 h at the point where cells enter log-phase growth, indicating that the Lossen rearrangement of 1 is not only biocompatible but also potentially accelerated in the presence of metabolically active cells (Fig. 2h).

Despite our initial focus on developing biocompatible reactions for synthesis in microbial cells, this intriguing observation suggested a method for the bioremediation of 1 derived from waste materials. For example, the synthesis of 1 can be envisioned from terephthalic acid—the depolymerization monomer of PET plastic waste. We therefore reasoned that we could synthesize 1 from PET and by introducing PABA auxotrophy into a microbial strain effectively condition cell growth to the presence of PET-derived small molecules, offering a strategy for the remediation of this prolific waste material and environmental pollutant into microbial biomass. Industrial PET production worldwide is currently 56 million tons per year, and approximately 80% of this is designed to be single-use, leading to around 24 million tons of PET waste each year that is either incinerated or sent to landfill46. To this end, a synthesis of 1 was optimized from a discarded plastic bottle in two steps via the hydrolysis of PET flakes to terephthalic acid, followed by amide coupling with O-Piv hydroxylammonium triflate and propylphosphonic anhydride (T3P) to generate PET-1 (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Scheme 1). Auxotroph recovery and growth of E. coli BW25113∆pabB was observed using this PET-derived substrate, accompanied by quantitative reduction in substrate concentration and no detectable PABA after 48 h (Fig. 3b–d). Growth in the presence of PET-1 had a comparable rate (0.25 h−1 for PABA and 0.33 h−1 for PET-1 after 40 h), final cell density (OD600) and viability count (CFU ml−1) at stationary phase and led to a similar decrease in substrate compared with using 1 (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 5).

Having confirmed that the Lossen rearrangement was biocompatible and could be used to bioremediate PET-derived substrates, we next moved on to examine whether rescued cells could be used for biocatalytic reactions (Fig. 4a). We decided to focus this study initially on the whole-cell C=C bond reduction of maleates and keto-acrylates reported by Brewster et al. under fermentation conditions using native reductases in E. coli47. The substrates dimethyl maleate (DMM, 5) and keto-acrylates (E)-7 and (Z)-7 were synthesized and added to cultures of E. coli BW25113∆pabB grown in the presence of 1. Pleasingly, all the substrates were quantitatively reduced to dimethyl succinate 6 or γ-ketoester 8 by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) after 24 h at 37 °C and product formation was observed only in the presence of PABA or 1, indicating that the biocompatible Lossen rearrangement could be used to control the chemical output of a microbial fermentation (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). Having interfaced the Lossen rearrangement with cell growth, metabolism and native biosynthetic reactions, we moved on to assess whether the Lossen rearrangement product could be syphoned into a de novo metabolic pathway in vivo. To test this, we decided to target the biosynthesis of paracetamol (para-hydroxyacetanilide) 10 from 1 in engineered E. coli. Both 1 and 10 are non-toxic to E. coli BW25113∆pabB at concentrations up to 1 mM (265 mg l−1; 1) and 6.6 mM (1 g l−1; 10) (Supplementary Fig. 8). Paracetamol is the first-in-line World Health Organization-recommended treatment for pain and fever worldwide48. It is currently manufactured from phenol (derived from fossil fuels by the cumeme process) via nitration, reduction and N-acetylation with acetic anhydride before being formulated into an orally available medication49. By contrast, 10 can be synthesized in cells from PABA via 4-aminophenol (4-AP, 9) by two enzymes: (1) an O2- and NADH-dependent aminobenzoate hydroxylase (ABH60) from the fungus Agaricus bisporus and (2) a K211G mutant of the acetyl CoA-dependent arylamine N-acyltransferase from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PANAT)50 (Fig. 4c). Paracetamol biosynthesis has been reported from d-glucose in E. coli but not from a waste feedstock or a PET-derived substrate. To this end, the genes encoding ABH60 and PANAT were synthesized and cloned into a Joint Universal Modular Plasmid (JUMP) vector generating plasmid pSWL112 (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 3). The kanamycin resistance cassette from E. coli BW25113∆pabB Keio strain was removed using a pCP20-encoded flippase before transformation with pSWL112, generating an engineered and auxotrophic strain to produce paracetamol that could be recovered using 1 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). However, HPLC analysis of cultures of E. coli BW25113∆pabB_pSWL112 grown in the presence of 1 identified 4-acetamidobenzoic acid (4-AB, 31 mg l−1) as the sole product from the paracetamol pathway, resulting from unproductive N-acetylation of PABA by PANAT and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 10b). To overcome this, a series of modified JUMP plasmids were designed containing abh60 and panat genes under the control of constitutive and inducible promoters to optimize flux from PABA to paracetamol. Two optimization strategies were trialled: (1) growth of E. coli BW25113∆pabB_pSWL156_ pSWL354 or E. coli BW25113∆pabB_pSWL156_ pSWL355 in the presence of 1 with constitutive expression of abh60 (pSWL156, J23100-abh60) and panat expression in plasmids pSWL354 (/Pbad-panat) and pSWL355 (/Ptet-panat) induced after 72 h (Supplementary Figs. 10b and 12); or (2) the separation of ABH60- and PANAT-catalysed reactions using 2 E. coli strains (BW25113∆pabB_pSWL156 or BW25113∆pabB_pSWL350, with BL21(DE3)_pSWL157 (/T7IPTG-panat)) (Supplementary Fig. 13) by the addition of pre-expressed E. coli BL21(DE3)_pSWL157 cells (OD600 of 20) after growth of the PABA auxotroph expressing ABH60 in the presence of 1. Both approaches eliminated 4-AB production and generated paracetamol in 12 mg l−1 (Supplementary Fig. 10b) and 19 mg l−1 (29% yield), respectively, from 1 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 14; see Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16 for a comparison with different promoter types and control reactions). To enhance the synthetic utility of paracetamol synthesis from 1 and PET-1, a one-pot two-step procedure was optimized where the Lossen rearrangement was first initiated at 50 °C in aqueous phosphate buffer (200 mM, 50 °C, pH 8.0) followed by addition of induced E. coli BW25113ΔpabB_p354 and E. coli BW25113ΔpabB_p350 whole cells expressing panat and abh60, respectively (1:200, 37 °C, OD600 of 12.5–25). Under these conditions, quantitative yield of paracetamol was observed from PABA and in 86% from 1 (Fig. 4d). Using the plastic-waste-derived substrate PET-1 under analogous biotransformation conditions afforded paracetamol in 83% yield. Finally, reducing the arabinose concentration during protein expression enabled a reduction in the ratio of panat and abh60 expressing strains to 1:100 and increased the final yield of paracetamol 10 to 92% from PET-1 (Fig. 4d). Intensification of this process will focus on in situ biocatalytic depolymerization of industrial PET samples for both bioremediation and bio-upcycling at bioreactor scale to further improve overall productivity and product isolation. This will be accompanied by quantitative sustainability analyses via life cycle assessment to ensure process optimizations achieve maximum environmental sustainability gains. Future work will also focus on further optimization of the de novo pathway to maximize flux into paracetamol biosynthesis using synthetic biology approaches as well as applying the biocompatible Lossen rearrangement to other chemo-enzymatic cascades and fully integrating this new-to-nature reaction within metabolically evolved microorganisms.

This study reports the discovery of a biocompatible Lossen rearrangement that can be interfaced with cellular metabolism in the bacterium E. coli. The non-enzymatic reaction proceeds in the presence of bacterial cells, is non-toxic and is catalysed by mono- or di-basic phosphate at neutral pH, highlighting a multifaceted role of phosphate ions in living cells for pH homeostasis, membrane biosynthesis and now biocompatible non-enzymatic chemistry. The biocompatible reaction also forms primary amine products in vivo via a mechanism that is distinct from known biosynthetic logic and, therefore, provides a useful tool in metabolic engineering for the generation of amine-containing metabolites. We demonstrate through auxotroph rescue how PABA can be generated by the Lossen rearrangement in vivo and used to control microbial growth and chemistry in fermentation and whole-cell reactions. Synthesis of the Lossen rearrangement substrate was achieved from a waste PET bottle and incorporated metabolically to generate biomass and control whole-cell biotransformations. The substrate was syphoned into a de novo biosynthetic pathway to paracetamol, demonstrating the production of this essential medication from plastic waste via a strategy that cannot be achieved using chemical synthesis or biological synthesis alone. Biocompatible chemistry should therefore be considered as complementary to nascent work in enzyme design and engineering for abiotic chemistry and integrated cooperatively as a tool in living cells to expand the synthetic chemistry that is possible within engineered biological systems.

Metrics details

Chemotherapies are often given without precision biomarkers, exposing patients to toxic side effects without guaranteed benefit. Here we present chromosomal instability signature biomarkers that identify resistance to platinum-, taxane- and anthracycline-based treatments using a single genomic test. In retrospectively emulated randomized-control biomarker clinical trials using real-world cohorts (n = 840), predicted resistant patients had elevated treatment failure risk for taxane (hazard ratio (HR) of 7.44) and anthracycline (HR of 1.88) in ovarian, taxane (HR of 3.98) and anthracycline (HR of 3.69) in metastatic breast and taxane (HR of 5.46) in metastatic prostate. Nonrandomized emulations showed predictive capacity for platinum resistance in ovarian (HR of 1.46) and anthracycline in sarcoma (HR of 3.59). We demonstrate feasibility using whole-genome sequencing, capture-panel sequencing and cell-free DNA. Our findings highlight the clinical value of chromosomal instability signatures in predicting resistance to chemotherapies across multiple cancer types, with the potential to transform the one-size-fits-all chemotherapy approach into precise, tailored treatment.

Cytotoxic chemotherapies exploit the defective properties of a cancer cell, such as impaired DNA repair mechanisms, to preferentially drive cancer cells to programmed cell death1. Chemotherapies also have detrimental effects on healthy cells, potentially causing severe side effects despite administration alongside modern-day supportive care2. Many of these agents were approved for clinical use before the adoption of therapy selection biomarkers, which is in contrast to new targeted therapies that increasingly require the presence of companion diagnostic tests to guide treatment selection3. Identifying inherent resistance to these agents could allow patients to avoid unnecessary side effects and receive an alternative therapy, ultimately improving overall health outcomes. Furthermore, precision use of cytotoxics could reduce healthcare costs by lowering expenditure on ineffective cancer therapies and additional medical interventions for treatment-related complications.

Before adoption in the clinic, therapy selection biomarkers must undergo clinical performance and utility evaluation4. Ideally, these evaluations are done using a prospective randomized-control biomarker trial. In these cases, treatment is randomized across each of the biomarker positive and negative groups and the performance is evaluated within each group5. This ‘phase 3 biomarker trial' design, while determining both the predictive performance and clinical utility of the biomarker, usually requires a large (and sometimes impractical) number of patients. As such, alternative designs with smaller patient numbers can be used, which trade off the capacity to assess either predictive performance or clinical utility. For instance, enrichment designs only randomize across one biomarker arm, eliminating the ability to assess utility in the other arm6. Single treatment arm or ‘phase 2 biomarker trials', where all patients receive the experimental treatment and differences in outcome are compared between biomarker positive and negative groups, requires the smallest number of patients, but does not truly determine whether the biomarker is predictive or prognostic7.

Considering the often prohibitive financial costs and burden of patient suffering associated with running a randomized-control trial (RCT), there has been a shift toward retrospective analysis of existing trial data for biomarker evaluations8. For new therapies, real-world data9 have also been used to emulate trials10 to seek approvals11,12. As chemotherapies are ubiquitous in cancer treatment, there is an exciting opportunity to combine existing methodologies of real-world emulation with accepted biomarker trial designs to emulate phase 2 and phase 3 biomarker trials.

We have recently developed a class of biomarker, chromosomal instability (CIN) signatures, that has the potential to predict therapy response13,14. As the full spectrum of signatures can be quantified in a tumor using a single genomic test, we hypothesize that CIN signatures might be used to predict resistance to multiple chemotherapies at diagnosis. Here, we present three CIN signature-based biomarkers for predicting resistance to treatment with platinum-based chemotherapies, taxanes and anthracyclines. We use real-world cohorts totaling 840 patients to emulate phase 2 and phase 3 biomarker trials for clinical performance evaluation. Finally, we show the feasibility of calling these biomarkers on targeted-capture gene panel sequencing of tumor tissue and shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) of plasma.

The presence of CIN in a tumor has long been recognized to contribute to chemotherapy sensitivity15. The opposite also holds true, where tumors with stabilizing genomes tend to be resistant16. In a recent proof-of-principle study, we showed that CIN signatures can further refine treatment response prediction, identifying patients resistant to platinum-based chemotherapies13. Here, we aimed to reformulate and extend these biomarkers as predictors of chemotherapy resistance across multiple tumor types.

First, we constructed a biomarker of resistance to platinum treatment. Initially, we apply our CIN signature framework to determine tumors with and without detectable CIN. Those tumors without CIN are classified as resistant. For tumors with CIN, similar to our original study13, we use a ratio of two signatures of impaired homologous recombination (IHR), where CX2 > CX3 indicates resistance (Fig. 1a). This is based on observations that CX2 represents a type of IHR that does not confer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies, whereas CX3 does13. This sensitivity is based on a principle of synthetic lethality, where cells with CX3-based IHR cannot tolerate the damage introduced by platinum treatment. A critical step to enable application of this classifier to multiple tumor types is the computation of a robust scaling model for the signatures. Here, we compute a multitumor-type scaling using all BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant cases present in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This scaling shows improved overall survival prediction for patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapies when applied to an esophageal cohort from the original study13 (Fig. 1b).

The dashed lines show the lower and upper CX5 activity thresholds that match the expected rate of cells as resistant (30% to 60%). e, The workflow for using CIN signatures as biomarkers for predicting resistance to anthracyclines. f, A contingency table showing the agreement between the observed and the predicted response of patient-derived models to doxorubicin in vitro. Samples with at least one of the three amplification-related signatures (CX8/CX9/CX13) showing an activity higher than the optimal threshold were predicted as resistant.

Next, we built a biomarker of taxane resistance using IHR signature CX5, which was previously shown to be correlated with paclitaxel response in vitro13, again under the principle of synthetic lethality (Supplementary Table 1). As with the platinum biomarker, samples without CIN are considered resistant. For samples with CIN, we sought an optimal threshold on CX5 signature activity to classify a sample as resistant (Fig. 1c). To do this, we used 287 cell lines treated with paclitaxel and explored a range of signature values to find the optimal activity threshold to separate cells based on the area under the dose response curve (AUC) density (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1). To ensure multitumor-type applicability, we scaled signature activities across the whole TCGA, resulting in an optimal threshold of z score-scaled signature activity of CX5 < 0 to classify a tumor sample as resistant (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Finally, as anthracyclines are widely used across multiple tumor types, we sought a biomarker of resistance to anthracycline treatment. Like many other genotoxic chemotherapies, anthracyclines can cause DNA damage resulting in extrachromosomal DNA encapsulated in micronuclei17. When micronuclei rupture and release their contents into the cytoplasm, this can trigger the activation of cGAS–STING signaling, resulting in proinflammatory signaling through type I interferon18. It has also been established that such immune system activation is crucial for the success of anthracycline treatments19. However, how tumors resist anthracycline treatment is less well known. Tumors exposed to chronic cGAS–STING activation have been shown to undergo a switch to noncanonical NF-κB signaling, ultimately promoting metastasis and immune evasion20. Therefore, it is possible that tumors resistant to anthracyclines may tolerate the ongoing formation of micronuclei via this switching mechanism. This switching mechanism is seen as an important bottleneck during tumor evolution18 and may represent a vital distinction between anthracycline sensitive and resistant tumors. As the amplified DNA commonly found in micronuclei can be incorporated back into the genome as homogeneously staining regions21, it may be possible to identify tumors that have survived this evolutionary bottleneck from their genomes. CIN signatures CX8, CX9 and CX13 represent focal amplifications linked to extrachromosomal DNA13,14. We therefore hypothesized they could be used to identify micronuclei-tolerant, and thus anthracycline-resistant, tumors. Indeed, we found the presence of these signatures in ovarian cell lines to be associated with reduced micronuclei formation capacity, suggesting the presence of tolerance mechanisms (Supplementary Note 1).

Therefore, we sought to construct a predictor where the presence of any of these three signatures would indicate resistance to anthracycline treatment (Fig. 1e). To estimate optimal thresholds for these signatures, we used a cohort of 8 patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids and 15 primary tumor spheroids isolated from ascites and treated with the anthracycline doxorubicin in vitro (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). Signature activity was computed from sWGS of the organoids and spheroids before treatment and treatment response was estimated using the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50). Samples were ranked by IC50 and labeled as sensitive or resistant based on the expected number of sensitive samples given the observed sensitivity to first-line platinum treatment in the donor patients (platinum-resistant patients are expected to have an 18% response rate to doxorubicin monotherapy22,23,24,25,26,27,28, whereas sensitive patients have a 28% response rate29). A threshold of 0.01 for CX8, and 0.009 for CX9 and CX13 showed optimal classification of the patient-derived models (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Note 1).

To test the performance of these resistance biomarkers in a clinic-like setting, we wanted to see whether we could use real-world data. To determine the feasibility of this strategy, we assembled a cohort of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). HGSOC is an ideal test bed as all three chemotherapies (platinum based, taxanes and anthracyclines) are routinely used to treat patients. Here, we aimed to emulate three different phase 2 single-arm biomarker trials using 50 patients from the OV04 study where we could assess biomarker performance after first-line platinum treatment, post-first-line anthracycline treatment and post-first-line taxane treatment (Extended Data Figs. 2–4, Supplementary Figs. 2–4 and Supplementary Table 3).

For each patient, we sequenced tumor material collected at diagnosis using sWGS, derived copy number profiles and applied our three classifiers. Then, if eligible, patients were included in the emulation of a phase 2 biomarker trial, with a single-arm study design where all patients received the chemotherapy of interest (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or older, confirmed HGSOC, had progression free survival (PFS) intervals measurable by CA125 using the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria30,31 and recorded tumor stage. The primary objective of the trial emulation was to test the biomarker's ability to predict resistance with an endpoint of CA125-based PFS.

For each of the three emulations, we considered patients who received treatment lines containing first-line platinum-based chemotherapies, post-first-line taxanes and post-first-line anthracyclines. Treatment lines were accepted that were either monotherapy or given in combination with other treatments. Predicted resistant and sensitive arms were compared using Cox proportional-hazards models, correcting for tumor stage, age at diagnosis, treatment line (for taxane), general aneuploidy (via the weighted genome instability index (wGII)) and whether the patient received maintenance therapy (during first-line treatment or before treatment with taxane or anthracycline). We defined maintenance therapies as either niraparib, olaparib, bevacizumab or letrozole. For taxane and anthracycline treatments, eligibility criteria and survival analysis design was given careful consideration to control for the effects of first-line platinum-free interval on treatment response at second line32 (see Supplementary Note 2 for details).

The 22 (out of 45) patients predicted as platinum resistant showed significantly increased risk of progression after treatment with platinum (hazard ratio (HR) of 2.340, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.155–4.742, P = 0.0183; Fig. 2a). The 17 (out of 29) patients predicted as taxane resistant also showed significantly increased risk of progression after treatment post-first-line with taxane (HR of 6.567, 95% CI 1.489–28.957, P = 0.013; Fig. 2b). Finally, the 13 (out of 30) patients predicted as anthracycline resistant showed increased risk of progression after treatment with anthracycline post-first-line (HR of 20.020, 95% CI 1.059–378.635, P = 0.010; Fig. 2c). For all analyses, the significance level for detecting an effect was 0.05.

PFS was used as the endpoint. All analyses were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. An asterisk denotes significant results. Dots and error bars represent the HR and its 95% CI, respectively. Multiple testing correction was not applied as each combination of biomarker and cohort is unique.

Since the pilot study confirmed that retrospective real-world data can be used to test performance, we sought orthogonal validation using additional real-world data to emulate either phase 3 RCTs (Extended Data Fig. 5b), phase 3 RCT enrichment trials (Extended Data Fig. 5c) or phase 2 single-arm trials (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

To achieve this, we assembled a series of pan-cancer real-world retrospective cohorts33,34 consisting of patients with primary or metastatic disease who were treated with one of the chemotherapies of interest or with an alternate standard of care (SoC), had clinical response data enabling time to treatment failure (TTF) calculation and had sufficient quality genomic data to compute CIN signatures. To identify which cohorts were powered for phase 3 or phase 2 analysis, we used the HRs determined from the pilot study, alongside censoring and prediction ratio data from the cohorts, to carry out calculations for a one-tailed power analysis with a power of 0.8 and a significance level of 0.05 (Supplementary Table 4). Cohorts that had sufficient sample sizes to meet the power requirements were then taken forward for analysis (summarized in Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). We were sufficiently powered to perform phase 3 emulation assessments for patients with relapsed ovarian, metastatic breast and metastatic prostate cancer treated with taxanes, and patients with relapsed ovarian and metastatic breast treated with anthracyclines. We were sufficiently powered to perform phase 2 emulation assessments (but not phase 3) for patients with primary ovarian cancer treated with platinum and sarcoma treated with anthracyclines.

In the phase 3 RCT emulations, patients were classified as resistant or sensitive to the chemotherapy of interest based on our biomarkers. Within these sensitive or resistant groups, patients were then retrospectively assigned to the experimental arm (treated with the chemotherapy of interest) or to the control arm (treated with an appropriate SoC therapy). Inverse probability weighting was applied to account for potential treatment selection biases across patients due to year of treatment/biopsy. The experimental and control arms were then compared using Cox proportional-hazards models for both the predicted resistant and predicted sensitive populations, with TTF as the primary endpoint.

In the phase 2 single-arm emulations, patients that were treated with the chemotherapy of interest were classified as resistant or sensitive based on our biomarkers, then these groups were compared using a Cox proportional-hazards model with TTF as the primary endpoint.

Prediction of resistance to platinum-based treatment in primary HGSOC was assessed using a cohort of 352 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over, had grade 3 and stage III/IV cancer, with no requirement for measurable disease (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0). Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model by age at diagnosis (<65 or ≥65 years) and controlling for tumor stage (III or IV). Patients predicted as platinum resistant showed significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with those patients classified as sensitive (HR of 1.459, 95% CI 1.121–1.899, P = 0.0049; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5).

The limited sample size precluded us from correcting the model by other clinical covariates. All analyses were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. An asterisk denotes significant results. The dots and error bars represent the HR and its 95% CI, respectively. Multiple testing correction was not applied as each combination of biomarker and cohort is unique. Inverse probability weighting was applied in all analyses to account for treatment selection biases across patients due to year of treatment/biopsy.

Prediction of resistance to taxane-based treatment in relapsed HGSOC was assessed across a cohort of 112 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Eligibility criteria, trial design and survival analysis were given careful consideration to control for the effects of first-line platinum-free interval on treatment response at second line32 (Supplementary Note 2). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over, had grade 3 and stage III/IV cancer, with no requirement for measurable disease. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of taxane treatment post-first line. Patients were assigned to the control arm if they received treatment containing any of the five most common non-taxane- and non-platinum-based therapies, being doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, topotecan and vinorelbine. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using stratified Cox proportional-hazards models by age at diagnosis (<65 or ≥65 years), including an interaction between first-line TTF and treatment group (see Supplementary Note 2 for details).

In patients predicted to be resistant, the use of taxane-based treatment resulted in significantly higher risk of treatment failure compared with the SoC treatment (HR of 7.435, 95% CI 3.967–20.458, P = 0.0003; Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting predicted resistant patients do not derive benefit from taxane treatment. By contrast, the predicted sensitive patients showed no significant difference in TTF between the experimental and control arms (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 7). This is in agreement with previous studies reporting comparable response among different chemotherapies after first-line treatment35. We found similar results when restricting the analysis to patients receiving single-agent taxane treatments, indicating that the differences in TTF between the experimental and control arms were not caused by the co-therapy administered (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9).

The prediction of resistance to anthracycline-based treatment in HGSOC was conducted in a cohort of 115 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over and had grade 3 and stage III/IV cancer. There was no requirement for measurable disease. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of anthracycline and patients were assigned to the control arm if they received treatment containing any of the five most common non-anthracycline- and non-platinum-based therapies, being gemcitabine, vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide, taxane and topotecan. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using stratified Cox proportional-hazards models by age at diagnosis (<65 or ≥65 years) and controlling for platinum sensitivity (≤6 months or >6 months first-line TTF).

In patients predicted to be resistant, the use of anthracycline-based treatment resulted in significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with the SoC treatment (HR of 1.881, 95% CI 1.029–3.439, P = 0.040; Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 10). By contrast the predicted sensitive analyses showed no significant difference in TTF between the experimental and control arms (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 11). Similar results were found restricting to single-agent anthracycline treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13).

Prediction of resistance to anthracycline-based treatment in sarcoma was assessed across 27 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or over with no requirement for measurable disease. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model controlling for the presence of isophosphamide as a co-therapy36. Tumor stage annotation was not available for this cohort and so was not included in the analysis. Patients predicted to be resistant demonstrated a significantly increased risk of treatment failure when they received anthracycline-based treatment compared with those predicted as sensitive (HR of 3.591, 95% CI 1.193–10.811, P = 0.023; Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 14).

Prediction of resistance to taxane-based treatment was conducted in a cohort of 238 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or over and had presented with metastatic tumors. Treatment lines were only considered if they occurred immediately after a biopsy event. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of taxane or to the control arm if they had received any of the five most common non-taxane therapies given within the cohort: abiraterone, enzalutamide, olaparib, pembrolizumab or radium-223. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using Cox proportional-hazards models controlling for age at diagnosis (46–85 years). Tumor stage annotation was not available for this cohort.

Patients predicted to be resistant demonstrated a significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with SoC (HR of 5.462, 95% CI 2.189–13.628, P = 0.0003; Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 15), while no significant differences were detected between treatment arms for patients predicted to be sensitive (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 16). Similar results were observed when limiting the analyses to single-agent taxane treatment (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18).

Gleason grade was not available for correction. b,c, Cox proportional-hazards regression models showing TTF in metastatic breast patients predicted as resistant to taxane (b) and anthracycline (c). Regression models were controlled for age at diagnosis. The limited sample size in the anthracycline-sensitive arm precluded us from performing a survival analysis. All analyses were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. An asterisk denotes significant results. The dots and error bars represent the HR and its 95% CI, respectively. Multiple testing correction was not applied as each combination of biomarker and cohort is unique. Inverse probability weighting was applied in all analyses to account for treatment selection biases across patients due to year of treatment/biopsy.

Prediction of resistance to taxane-based treatment was conducted across 134 patients with metastatic breast cancer (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or over and had presented with metastatic tumors. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of taxane and to the control arm if they received gemcitabine or capecitabine, in some cases in combination with bevacizumab, vinorelbine, gemcitabine or carboplatin. Patients were not included if they received hormone therapies. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model controlling for age at diagnosis (33–80 years).

Patients predicted to be resistant demonstrated a significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with SoC (HR of 3.976, 95% CI 1.196–13.219, P = 0.024; Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 19), while no significant differences were detected in survival time between the treatment arms for patients predicted to be sensitive (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 20).

The prediction of resistance to anthracycline-based treatment in breast cancer was conducted in a cohort of 108 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over and had stage III/IV cancer with no requirement for measurable disease. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of anthracycline-based treatment and assigned to the control arm if they received treatment containing any of the five most common non-anthracycline therapies, being bevacizumab, vinorelbine, gemcitabine or carboplatin. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using Cox proportional-hazards models controlling for age at diagnosis.

Patients predicted to be resistant showed significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with SoC (HR of 3.685, 95% CI 1.866–7.277, P = 0.0002; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 21). We were not powered to determine performance in the predicted sensitive group, thus this emulation is considered to have an enrichment design (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

In the analyses presented here, our CIN signature biomarkers were determined using copy number profiles derived from either deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or sWGS, or Affymetrix SNP6 arrays. However, these assays are not yet routine in clinical practise. Comprehensive capture gene panels currently dominate the diagnostic DNA testing landscape in oncology. Therefore, we wanted to assess the feasibility of using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) assay to apply our resistance classifications. In addition, we also assessed the feasibility of using sWGS from liquid biopsies collected at the time of diagnosis. For eight tumors in the Cambridge Translational Cancer Research Ovarian Study 04 (OV04) pilot study with greater than 40% tumor purity, we performed profiling of the same DNA aliquot as the sWGS using the TSO500 assay; and for 29 patients, plasma samples were used to extract cell-free DNA, which underwent sWGS (Extended Data Table 3).

For samples profiled with the TSO500 assay, the copy number profiles derived showed a median percentage of genome-wide copy number difference of 16% (Supplementary Fig. 22). CIN signatures computed across these samples showed a median cosine similarity with the matched sWGS of 0.92 (Fig. 5a). Applying our classifiers showed 93% concordance, with only one sample given a prediction that did not match the sWGS-based prediction (Fig. 5b).

Only tissue biopsies from patients with high-quality sWGS-derived copy number profiles that met the inclusion criteria were also sequenced with TSO500. A cosine similarity close to 1 indicates similar activities between sample-matched data. b, A contingency table showing the number of patients predicted as sensitive or resistant using our signature-based clinical classifiers in tumor samples sequenced by sWGS and TSO500. c, A bar plot showing signature activities in matched tumor tissue (T) and plasma (P) samples from the same patient.

A cosine similarity close to 1 indicates similar activities between patient-matched biopsies. d, A contingency table showing the number of patients predicted as sensitive or resistant using our signature-based clinical classifiers in tumor tissue and plasma biopsies. The numbers in gray boxes represent the patient IDs.

For cell-free DNA samples, DNA copy number profiles were generated and samples were categorized based on their circulating tumor DNA fraction as either low or high. Of the 29 patients who had plasma samples available, 9 samples (31%) were considered to have high circulating tumor DNA fraction and were subjected to CIN signature analysis. The remaining plasma samples had insufficient overall tumor DNA to assess CIN using the currently available CIN signature methods. Between plasma and tumor tissue pairs, the median percentage of genome-wide copy number difference was 20.8% (Supplementary Fig. 23), and activity levels of CIN signatures had a median cosine similarity of 0.90 (Fig. 5c). Resistance classification for relevant therapies across the patients showed 83.3% concordance (Fig. 5d), with two patients showing alternate predictions for platinum and one patient for taxane. These results suggest that for approximately 31% of patients with ovarian cancer, our predictors may be applied using a simple blood test, without the need for a tumor biopsy or a surgical specimen, although testing over larger cohorts is necessary.

In this study, we demonstrate the potential for CIN signature biomarkers to predict resistance to multiple chemotherapies. Previous approaches have largely focused on platinum-based chemotherapies and rely on cell culture or gene expression assays37,38. However, these tests have failed to reach widespread adoption in the clinic. The OncotypeDX recurrence score is the only test to have been widely adopted; however, it is not a direct test for chemotherapy response, rather it determines whether a patient will be adequately managed with hormone therapies alone (compared with a combination with chemotherapy)39. Homologous recombination deficiency tests such as Myriad myChoice or HRDetect may also have the potential to predict response to platinum-based treatment40. However, these do not appear to perform as well as our CIN signature biomarkers (Supplementary Note 3). The ability to predict resistance to multiple chemotherapies from a single genomic assay is thus a unique offering.

Our analysis encompassed three common chemotherapies, platinum-based, taxanes and anthracyclines. When testing the performance of our biomarkers we leveraged real-world data to retrospectively emulate phase 3 RCTs. However, we were unable to emulate a phase 3 biomarker trials for our platinum biomarker in ovarian and anthracycline biomarker in sarcoma. This was due to an absence of alternative SoC treatments at first line. Instead, we pursued phase 2 single-arm studies. Further follow-up work is required to assess the true predictive capacity of the resistance biomarkers in this context.

Further work will also be necessary to understand the regulatory pathway of a clinical decision support test for already approved chemotherapies. One of the main challenges to overcome will be the heterogeneity of genomic testing in a clinical environment. Currently, different hospital systems employ different genomic assays including gene panel sequencing and WGS. Thus, the use of CIN signature biomarkers for chemotherapy response prediction will need to be enabled across a variety of technologies. In this regard, we showed a proof-of-concept that our resistance classifications may be applied using the regulatory approved TSO500 assay, alongside shallow and deep WGS, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Furthermore, in a subset of patients, it may be possible to perform the predictions using liquid biopsies. However, further studies will be necessary to determine the optimal clinical implementation strategy and will need to assess the trade off between taking a biopsy or blood draw as well as assessing the risk of biopsy, the cost of applying the test to blood draws or tissue, the fraction of patients with adequate biopsy material and the stage at which the test is administered, to name a few.

Importantly, our study introduces biomarkers for patient stratification for multiple medicines that were not originally developed as targeted therapies. CIN signature analysis can be applied widely across cancer types13 and thus our results have broad future implications for patient stratification and precision medicine in cancer.

Details on statistical analyses are outlined in each relevant section of Methods and the Supplementary Information. All code is provided to completely reproduce all analyses performed in this study and all experimental details are outlined in relevant sections of Methods and the Supplementary Methods. For biomarker discovery and optimization, no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. For biomarker performance assessment, power analyses were conducted to ensure the clinical cohorts were well powered (detailed in the Supplementary Methods). In vitro experiments and single-arm trials were not randomized. For retrospectively emulated phase 3 trials, patients were pseudo-randomized to the control and experimental arm. Patients were filtered for biomarker clinical assessment based on the exclusion criteria detailed in the ‘Cohort curation' sections of the Supplementary Methods. Flowcharts detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria for all cohorts used in this study are available via Figshare at ref. 41.

Clinical data and samples for patients with HGSOC were collected as part of the prospective Cambridge Translational Cancer Research Ovarian Study 04 (CTCROV04) approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (REC07/Q0106/63). OV04 is an ongoing observational study that records patient clinical data and collects patient material for the purpose of biomarker and scientific discovery. Patients provided written, informed consent for participation in this study and for the use of their donated tissue for the laboratory studies carried out in this work. The samples included primary ascites spheroids, tumor tissue, plasma samples and tumor tissue-derived organoids and cell lines. DNA was extracted and sequenced, copy number profiles derived, CIN signatures computed and biomarkers called (see details below). Treatment histories for each patient are shown in Supplementary Figs. 24–73. Clinical data (where applicable) were curated and response determined (further details in the Supplementary Methods).

In this study, we used data from the TCGA consisting of high-quality copy number profiles from 7,880 patients and matching clinical records for 7,105 patients, representing 33 cancer types. These data were curated to provide clinical response data and biopsy-level activities of CIN signatures for biomarker performance analysis (further details in the Supplementary Methods).

In this study we use data from The Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF), which manages a multicenter database of genomic and clinical data collected from 2,979 patients with metastatic cancer in the Netherlands. This dataset, representing 35 cancer types, was curated to provide clinical response data and biopsy-level activities of CIN signatures for biomarker performance analysis (further details in the Supplementary Methods).

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut as 8 μm sections and tumor-enriched regions were recovered by macrodissection based on regions marked on an adjacent hematoxylin and eosin-stained section by the study pathologist. DNA was extracted from 3–10 sections at 8 μm thickness using the QIAmp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, 56204) with the following modification to the original protocol: an additional incubation step with buffer ATL at 95 °C for 15 min was introduced before adding proteinase K. The paraffin was removed using a xylene/ethanol method. DNA extraction from fresh frozen tumor tissues and spheroids fraction was performed using the Allprep DNA/RNA tissue kit (Qiagen, 80204) following the manufacturer's instructions.

We focused on selected plasma time points collected before the primary line of chemotherapy treatment and before anthracycline treatment (usually before the second or third line of therapy). DNA was extracted from 2 or 4 ml of plasma using the QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit (Qiagen, 55114) or QIAsymphony (Qiagen, 937556), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Organoids were derived as previously described42. Samples were obtained from patients via surgical resection, ward drains or surgical washings. Solid tumors were assessed by a pathologist and only tumor samples with ≥50% tumor cellularity were selected for organoid model derivation. Organoid culture medium was refreshed every 2 days. To passage the organoids, the domes were scraped and collected in a Falcon tube, TrypLE (Invitrogen, 12604013) was added and they were incubated at 37 °C for approximately 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 800g for 2 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 7.5 mg ml−1 BME-2 supplemented with complete media and plated as 20 μl droplets in a six-well plate. After allowing the BME-2 to polymerize, complete medium was added and cells incubated at 37 °C. DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA (Qiagen, 80204) extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Ascitic fluid was collected from patients, with between 100 ml and 2 l volume. The fluid was initially gently centrifuged at 800g for 5 min and the majority of the supernatant was removed. The sample was filtered using autoclaved muslin cloth and the flow through was then filtered again using a 40 μm cell strainer. Spheroids from the strainer were then recovered by a 10 ml wash with PBS and centrifuged at 1,500g for 5 min. The spheroid fraction was divided in two: a cell pellet for DNA extraction and resuspension of cells in filtered acellular ascitic supernatant and 8% dimethylsulfoxide for the drug screen. Spheroids were thawed and put in media overnight to fully recover before dispensing for the drug screen. DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA (Qiagen, 80204) extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F12 or RPMI1640 plus 10% of fetal calf serum. Cell line identities were confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling. Cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection kit (Lonza, LT07-118). The sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay was used for quantifying cell numbers and cell proliferation in culture. DNA extraction from cell pellets of approximately 2 × 106 million cells per sample was performed using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA (Qiagen, 80204) extraction kit following the manufacturer's recommendations.

WGS libraries were prepared from 50 ng DNA using Illumina DNA prep (S) Tagmentation (Illumina, 20025523) and SMARTer Thruplex DNA-Seq (Takara, R400676) reagents, following the manufacturer's protocol. Library quality and quantity were assessed with D5000 on a 4200 Tapestation, a Fragment Analyzer next-generation sequencing (NGS) kit (Agilent Technologies, 5067-5582) and the Qubit BR dsDNA assay, according to the supplier's recommendations. Libraries were then diluted to 10 nmol l−1 and pooled together in equal ratios and sequenced using paired-end (PE) 50 mode on a NovaSeq6000 S2 flow cell 100 cycles kit (Illumina, 20028316), aiming for 80 million reads per sample.

A total of 10 µl of extracted circulating nucleic acids was taken as input for whole-genome library preparation using the SMARTer ThruPLEX DNA-Seq (Takara, R400676) library prep kit with the following modifications: no DNA shearing was performed, 14 PCR cycles were applied, library purification using Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter, 10136224) was performed separately for each sample and elution was performed using 20 µl of Tris EDTA buffer. Generated libraries were quantified using the Fragment Analyzer NGS kit (Agilent Technologies, cat no. DNF-467-0500) diluted to 10 nmol l−1 and pooled in the same proportions. All libraries were sequenced using the NovaSeq6000 S2 flow cell 300 cycle kit (Illumina, 20028314) using PE 150 bp mode to achieve at least 80 million reads per sample.

Hybridization-based NGS libraries were prepared from 40 ng DNA using the TruSight Oncology 500 Library Preparation kit (Illumina, 20076480), following the manufacturer's protocol. Library quality and quantity were assessed with the High Sensitivity/D5000 Screentape assay (Agilent Technologies, 5067-5592) on a 4150/4200 Tapestation Quant-IT/Qubit dsDNA HS (Qiagen, Q32851) assay system according to the supplier's recommendations. Libraries were then pooled together in equal ratios and sequenced using PE 150 bp mode on a NovaSeq S1 flow cell 300 cycles kit (Illumina, 20028317) or S4 flow cell 300 cycles kit (Illumina, 20028312) aiming for 100 million reads per sample.

Reads were aligned as single-end against the human genome assembly GRCh37 using BWA-MEM v0.7.17 (ref. 43), following which duplicate reads were identified and marked using the MarkDuplicates tool in the GATK v4.1.8.1 (ref. 44) tool suite.

After alignment, relative copy number was computed using QDNAseqmod45 with a bin size of 50 kb. Bins mapped to centromeres and regions of undefined sequence in the reference genome hg19 were excluded. Read counts were corrected for the relationship between sequence mappability and GC content.

Absolute tumor copy number (the number of chromosome copies of each DNA segment in the tumor cells in a sample) was computed for every bin across each sample. Each segmented relative copy number bin estimate j was transformed from relative copy number (rCN) to absolute copy number (aCN) by

where purity is the fraction of tumor cells in the sample and d is a constant proportional to the read depth, which is computed from the mean relative copy number of the sample, r, and the average absolute copy number of the tumor cells in the sample, ploidy, by

Both purity and ploidy were unobserved in the data and were estimated using a grid search of purities ranging from 0.05 to 1 in 0.01 increments and ploidies ranging from 1.8 to 8 in increments of 0.1, minimizing the following mean squared error:

Cell lines and organoid samples were assumed 100% pure, so purity was fixed to 1 and a search was only performed across ploidy states. Purity/ploidy values were excluded from consideration if they resulted in a fit which showed greater than 10 megabases of the genome with homozygous loss. For tissue samples, an additional filter was used, removing fits which did not show at least one genomic segment at every integer copy number state from 1 to ploidy.

After alignment, PE raw reads were split into equally-sized bins of 50 kb in size. Bins were annotated with GC content, mappability and replication timing, after a bin-level filtering based on a panel of 40 normal samples sequenced by deep whole-genome sequencing as part of the 1000 Genomes Project46. The remaining annotated bins were then interrogated for overlaps with target regions (bed file). Only bins with less than 25% overlap with the target regions and a maximum of 10 total overlaps per bin were kept. For the remaining set of bins, we removed on-target reads and counted the number of reads per bin. To correct for artificially high off-target read counts in parts of the genome with high sequence similarity to the target regions, we generated a score per bin that quantified the magnitude of this bias and used it for a single linear model fit and correction. For bins with any overlap with the bed file, we filled the gap caused by the removal of the on-target reads with a pseudocount estimation using the per-bin mean off-target read count. GC and replication timing corrections were performed using locally estimated scatter plot smoothing fitting and correction. We segmented these data using the same segmentation procedure used in QDNAseqmod45. Absolute copy numbers were inferred as described above in the section ‘OV04 sWGS'. For purity/ploidy selection, we fixed a range of ±0.2 with respect to the ploidy and ±0.05 with respect to the ploidy using the paired sWGS curated data.

We downloaded copy number profiles derived using PURPLE from a total of 5,200 samples released by the HMF34,47. As PURPLE47 determines the allele-specific copy number of every base of the genome, the genome binning resolution is substantially higher compared with the resolution of the copy number profiles used to derive feature components of the CIN signature encoding13. To avoid incorrect mapping of signatures due to differences in segmentation resolution, copy number profiles were binned into 30 kb bins and then resegmented. In our previous work13, we estimated this bin size as appropriate to have a segmentation agreement between copy number calls derived from SNP6 arrays and WGS/whole-exome sequencing. The copy number value of each 30 kb bin was computed by averaging the copy number value of the segments spanning a given bin. For bins spanning multiple copy number segments, this resegmentation may generate artificial segments with a 30 kb length. Segments with a 30 kb length were therefore removed to avoid this artificial oversegmentation, and we then applied a smoothing procedure for merging continuous segments with a ±0.1 difference in copy number.

ASCAT-derived TCGA copy number profiles were downloaded from ref. 48.

We quantified the activities of 17 CIN signatures13. We extracted five copy number features (segment size, breakpoint count per 10 MB, changepoint of copy number, breakpoint count per chromosome arm and length of segments with oscillating copy number) from the absolute copy number profiles to then compute a sum-of-posterior probability vector per sample. The sum-of posterior probability vectors were finally used to compute signature activities using the LCD function found in the YAPSA49 package in R, and the signature definition matrix. To ensure robustness of the signature activities and to enable trust in small signature activities, we applied the signature-specific thresholds derived from the TCGA pan-cancer cohort in our previous work13.

We emulated phase 3 biomarker trials to compare the TTFs of patients in the experimental arm (where patients received the chemotherapy of interest) with the TTFs of patients in the control arm (where the patients received an appropriate alternative SoC treatment) (Supplementary Fig. 74).

To construct the experimental arm, we selected the closest treatment line to diagnosis containing the chemotherapy of interest (platin/taxane/anthracycline), either administered in combination with another therapy or as a single agent. For HMF patients with multiple metastatic biopsies, each treatment line was linked to the most recent biopsy, better reflecting the patients' tumor state at the time of treatment. To account for metastasis progression, only treatments given immediately after a biopsy were retained. In ovarian cancer cohorts, we excluded platinum treatment to avoid the effect of the response to this chemotherapy on TTF intervals (see further details in Supplementary Note 2). To validate that TTF differences between predicted resistant and sensitive patients were not influenced by the co-therapy, we also performed this analysis by limiting to single-agent administration where possible.

To construct the control arm, we first excluded all treatment lines that did not contain the chemotherapy of interest. As the filtering at this stage was performed at the level of the treatment line instead of at a patient level, it was possible for patients to have treatment lines in both experimental and control arms. Hence, patients appearing in both arms were removed from the control. Then, the control arm was further filtered to retain only the most common SoCs, which were identified based on frequency. The top five monotherapies formed the control arm. Platinum was excluded from SoCs in relapsed ovarian cancer.

Both arms were further filtered to remove treatment lines with an insufficient therapy exposure: at least three cycles or a treatment length of at least 28 days. Finally, only one treatment line per patient was used in the survival analysis, prioritizing the first viable treatment. Patients without clinical follow-up beyond 1 year were excluded if their last treatment line had a TTF exceeding 730 days.

We emulated a phase 2 trial for assessing biomarker performance to predict resistance to first-line platinum in ovarian cancer and to first-line anthracycline in sarcoma. Patients with stage I tumors, non-calculable TTF, fewer than three cycles of treatment or fewer than 28 days were excluded. We included all ovarian and sarcoma TCGA patients who received treatment, alone or in combination, at first line.

Patient counts for single-agent and combination treatments are shown in Supplementary Figs. 75–78.

The performance assessment of our signature-based biomarkers to identify patients resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, taxanes and anthracyclines was carried out using Cox proportional-hazards modeling (function coxph from the survival package in R50). We used the function cox.zph to test the proportional-hazards assumption for all Cox proportional-hazards model fits. Further details on survival time period calculations and inverse probability weighting can be found in the Supplementary Methods. Detailed results of all the survival analyses performed in this study can be seen in Supplementary Figs. 5–21. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated using the survfit function from the survival package in R50, and used to represent differences in treatment effectiveness across treatment arms in a univariate mode (Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7).

We compared absolute copy number profiles (by using the getDifference function from our CNpare tool in R51), signature activities (by computing cosine similarity) and drug resistance predictions (by observing classification concordance) obtained from tissues sequenced using sWGS and the regulatory approved Illumina TSO500 assay. Supplementary Fig. 22 illustrates differences between matched sWGS- and TSO500-derived copy number profiles of all patients, while Fig. 5a shows signature composition concordance between pairs.

We also assessed concordance between tissue and plasma samples collected from the same patient following the same approach. Supplementary Fig. 23 illustrates differences between matched tissue- and plasma-derived copy number profiles of all patients, while Fig. 5c shows signature composition concordance between pairs.

a) Implementation of a robust signature scaling procedure for pan-cancer application of the platinum biomarker13. All BRCA1/2 mutants in the TCGA dataset (n=375) are used as reference for scaling signature activities of new samples (see Methods). b) Optimisation and pan-cancer implementation of a clinical biomarker for predicting taxane resistance. Biomarker optimisation was initially performed using a collection of 285 cancer cell lines treated with taxanes. To achieve a pan-cancer implementation, all TCGA samples were used as reference for scaling signature activities of new samples (see Methods). c) Identification, optimisation and implementation of a biomarker for predicting resistance to anthracyclines. In vitro models derived from 23 ovarian cancer patients were treated with doxorubicin and then used to identify and optimise the biomarker (see Methods).

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, leaving astronomers in awe of the unprecedented capabilities of the observatory's 3,200 megapixel digital camera — the largest in the world. The images were created from shots taken during a trial that started in April, when construction of the telescope was completed.

“Wow. You want to observe the grandeur of the Universe? This is the way to observe it!” says astronomer Robert Williams, former head of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.

Major telescope hosts world's largest digital camera: how it will transform astronomy

One of the images shows the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, in a region of the Milky Way that is dense with ionized hydrogen and with young stars or those in the process of forming. The picture was created from 678 separate exposures taken by the observatory's Simonyi Survey Telescope in just over seven hours. Each image was monochromatic and taken with one of four filters, resulting in the rich colours of the final product.

The Rubin, which sits atop Cerro Pachón in the Andes Mountains in central Chile, is a US$810 million, US-led facility. The observatory has a very large field of view that will be able to cover the entire southern sky every 3–4 nights. Other telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, have superior sensitivity to tiny details and take in one small section of the sky at a time.

The latest images were put together mainly for aesthetic impact and to showcase how the observatory's digital camera can scan large swaths of sky with high sensitivity and in a short time. As such, they are quite different from the type of ‘data products' that astronomers around the world will use for research purposes, says Sandrine Thomas, deputy director for the observatory's construction, who is based in Tucson, Arizona. And yet, they are a reminder of what drives astronomers in the first place. “We go into astronomy because we like to look at the sky — and at the beauty of it,” she says.

Metrics details

Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a promising source of new pharmaceuticals, yet the therapeutic potential of fungal RiPPs remains largely underexplored. Here we report asperigimycins as a distinct class of fungal RiPPs, featuring a unique heptacyclic scaffold consisting of a benzofuranoindoline core and three additional macrocycles, primarily assembled by six distinct fungi-specific DUF3328 oxidases. Inspired by the enhancement of anticancer activity through the N-terminal pyroglutamate in naturally occurring asperigimycins C and D, we chemically modify the inactive asperigimycin B with a series of lipid substitutions at its N-terminus. A derivative with a C-11 linear fatty acid, 2-L6, achieves nanomolar anticancer potency comparable to that of clinically approved antileukemia drugs. High-throughput CRISPR screening identifies the SLC46A3 transporter as a critical factor mediating 2-L6 cellular uptake into human cells. Our findings highlight the promise of engineering asperigimycins as therapeutic leads for cancer treatment.

α-amanitin and omphalotin A from basidiomycetes (left panel) and ustiloxin B, epichloëcyclin B, victorin C, phomopsin A, and asperipin-2a from ascomycetes (right panel). The structure of epichloëcyclin B was proposed by MS/MS data. The structure of asperipin-2a was revised in 2020 by chemical synthesis72.

This figure showed major clusters in the molecular network. Node sizes represent relative precursor ion intensity. Pie charts represent relative spectral counts of defined groups with different colors. Clusters circled are labeled with the potential compound types identified by GNPS analysis for the corresponding cluster.

a. COSY and HMBC correlations. b. ROESY correlations. The relative configuration of 1 was assigned by detailed interpretation of the ROESY spectrum, in which the correlations of H-27/H-22 and H-27/H-21 revealed that these protons are cofacial. Correlations between H-4/H-6, H-6/H-10, and H-10/H-12 indicated that H-6 and H-12 are the same oriented, while the small coupling constant ( < 3 Hz) suggested that H-12 and H-13 are the same oriented. H-36, H-37, and H-38 were assigned as the same oriented since the ROESY correlations were observed between H-36/H-38 and H-37/H-38. In general, all the amino acid residues were proposed to be L-configuration, thus the absolute configuration was determined as 2S, 4S, 6S, 12R, 13S, 18S, 21S, 23S, 27R, 34R, 38S, 41S. Considering the similar chemical shifts and biosynthetic origins, the stereochemistry of 2-4, was proposed to be the same as those of 1. c. Lowest-energy conformer of compound 1.

Determining the similarities and differences between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) is an important goal in both computational cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, promising a deeper understanding of human cognition and safer, more reliable AI systems. Much previous work comparing representations in humans and AI has relied on global, scalar measures to quantify their alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses, these measures only inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine it. To address this challenge, we propose a generic framework to compare human and AI representations, based on identifying latent representational dimensions underlying the same behaviour in both domains. Applying this framework to humans and a deep neural network (DNN) model of natural images revealed a low-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In contrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic properties, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. Although in silico experiments showed seemingly consistent interpretability of DNN dimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed substantial differences in how they process images. By making representations directly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for representational alignment and offer a means for improving their comparability.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive performance, matching or surpassing human performance in various perceptual and cognitive benchmarks, including image classification1,2, speech recognition3,4 and strategic gameplay5,6. In addition to their excellent performance as machine learning models, DNNs have drawn attention in the field of computational cognitive neuroscience for their notable parallels to cognitive and neural systems in humans and animal models7,8,9,10,11. These similarities, observed through different types of behaviour or patterns of brain activity, have sparked a growing interest in determining both factors underlying these similarities and differences between human and DNN representations. From the machine learning perspective, understanding where DNNs exhibit a limited alignment with humans can support the development of better and more robust artificial intelligence (AI) systems. From the perspective of computational cognitive neuroscience, DNNs with stronger human alignment promise to be better candidate computational models of human cognition and behaviour12,13,14,15.

Much previous research on the alignment of human and artificial visual systems has compared behavioural strategies (for example, classification) in both systems and has revealed important limitations in the generalization performance of DNNs16,17,18,19,20. Other work has focused on directly comparing cognitive and neural representations in humans to those in DNNs, using methods such as representational similarity analysis (RSA21) or linear regression22,23,24,25. This quantification of alignment has led to a direct comparison of numerous DNNs across diverse visual tasks26,27,28,29, highlighting the role of factors such as architecture, training data or learning objective in determining the similarity to humans25,26,29,30.

Despite the appeal of summary statistics, such as correlation coefficients or explained variance, for comparing the representational alignment of DNNs with humans, they only quantify the degree of representational or behavioural alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses about potential causes for misalignment, such scalar measures are limited in their explanatory scope of which properties determine this degree of alignment, that is, which representational factors underlie the similarities and differences between humans and DNNs. Although diverse methods for interpreting DNN activations have been developed at various levels of analysis, ranging from single units to entire layers31,32,33,34,35, a direct comparability to human representations has remained a key challenge.

Inspired by recent work in cognitive sciences that has revealed core visual and semantic representational dimensions underlying human similarity judgements of object images36, here we propose a framework to systematically analyse and compare the dimensions that shape representations in humans and DNNs. In this work, we apply this framework to human visual similarity judgements and representations in a DNN trained to classify natural images. Our approach reveals numerous interpretable DNN dimensions that appear to reflect both visual and semantic image properties and that appear to be well aligned to humans. In contrast to humans, who showed a dominance of semantic over visual dimensions, DNNs exhibited a striking visual bias, demonstrating that downstream semantic behaviour is driven more strongly by different, primarily visual, strategies. Although psychophysical experiments on DNN dimensions underscored their global interpretability, a direct comparison with human dimensions revealed that DNN representations, in fact, only approximate human representations but lack the consistency expected from property-specific visual and semantic dimensions. Together, our results reveal key factors underlying the representational alignment and misalignment between humans and DNNs, shed light on potentially divergent representational strategies, and highlight the potential of this approach to identify the factors underlying the similarities and differences between humans and DNNs.

To improve the comparability of human and DNN representations, we aimed to identify the similarities and differences in core dimensions underlying human and DNN representations of images. To achieve this aim, we treated the neural network analogously to a human participant carrying out a cognitive behavioural experiment and then derived representational embeddings using a recent variational embedding technique37 from both human similarity judgements and a DNN on the same behavioural task (Methods). This approach ensured direct comparability between human and DNN representations. As a behavioural task, we chose a triplet odd-one-out similarity task, where from a set of three object images i, j and k, participants have to select the most dissimilar object (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Section D provides an analysis of the role of task instructions on triplet choice behaviour). In this task, the perceived similarity between two images i and j is defined as the probability of choosing these images to belong together across varying contexts imposed by a third object image k. By virtue of providing minimal context, the odd-one-out task highlights the information sufficient to capture the similarity between object images i and j across diverse contexts. In addition, it approximates human categorization behaviour for arbitrary visual and semantic categories, even for fairly diverse sets of objects36,37,38. Thus, by focusing on the building blocks of categorization that underlies diverse behaviours, this task is ideally suited for comparing object representations between humans and DNNs.

First, a dot-product similarity space is constructed from the DNN features. Next, for a given triplet of objects, the most similar pair in this similarity space is identified, making the remaining object the odd one out. For humans, this sampling approach is based on observed behaviour, which is used as a measure of their internal cognitive representations. c, Illustration of the computational modelling approach to learn a lower-dimensional object representation for human participants and the DNN, optimized to predict behavioural choices made in the triplet task. d, Schematic of the interpretability pipeline that allows for the prediction of object embeddings from pretrained DNN features.

For human behaviour, we used a set of 4.7 million publicly available odd-one-out judgements39 over 1,854 diverse object images, derived from the THINGS object concept and image database40. For the DNN, we collected similarity judgements for 24,102 images of the same objects used for humans (1,854 objects with 13 examples per object). We used a larger set of object images since the DNN was less limited by constraints in dataset size than humans. This allowed us to obtain more precise estimates of their representation. To derive DNN representations, we chose a pretrained VGG-16 model41, given its common use in the computational cognitive neurosciences. Specifically, this network has been shown to exhibit good correspondence to both human behaviour17 and measured neural activity9,27,42 and performs well at predicting human similarity judgements24,25,30,43,44,45. VGG-16 was trained on the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset46, which contains a diverse range of image categories, such as animals, everyday objects and scenes. However, for completeness, we additionally ran similar analyses for a broader range of neural network architectures (Supplementary Section A). We focused on penultimate layer activations as they are the closest to the behavioural output, and they also showed closest representational correspondence to humans (Supplementary Section B). For the DNN, we generated a dataset of behavioural odd-one-out choices for the 24,102 object images (Fig. 1b). To this end, we first extracted the DNN layer activations for all the images. Next, for a given triplet of activations zi, zj and zk, we computed the dot product between each pair as a measure of similarity, then identified the most similar pair of images in this triplet and designated the remaining third image as the odd one out. Given the excessively large number of possible triplets for all 24,102 images, we approximated the full set of object choices from a random subset of 20 million triplets47.

From both sets of available triplet choices, we next generated two representational embeddings, one for humans and one for the DNN, where each embedding was optimized to predict the odd-one-out choices in humans and DNNs, respectively. In these embeddings, each object is described through a set of dimensions that represent interpretable object properties. To obtain these dimensions and for comparability to previous work in humans36,37,38, we imposed sparsity and non-negativity constraints on the optimization, which support their interpretability and provide cognitively plausible criteria for dimensions36,39,48,49,50,51. Sparsity constrained the embedding to consist of fewer dimensions, motivated by the observation that real-world objects are typically characterized by only a few properties. Non-negativity encouraged a parts-based description, where dimensions cannot cancel each other out. Thus, a dimension's weight indicated its relevance in predicting an object's similarity to other objects. During training, each randomly initialized embedding was optimized using a recent variational embedding technique37 (see the ‘Embedding optimization and pruning' section). The optimization resulted in two stable, low-dimensional embeddings, with 70 reproducible dimensions for DNN embedding and 68 for human embedding. The DNN embedding captured 84.03% of the total variance in image-to-image similarity, whereas the human embedding captured 82.85% of the total variance and 91.20% of the explainable variance given the empirical noise ceiling of the dataset.

Having identified stable, low-dimensional embeddings that are predictive of triplet odd-one-out judgements, we first assessed the interpretability of each identified DNN dimension by visualizing object images with large numeric weights. In addition to this qualitative assessment, we validated these observations for the DNN by asking 12 (6 female and 6 male) human participants to provide labels for each dimension separately (see the ‘Labelling dimensions and construction of word clouds' section). Similar to the core semantic and visual dimensions underlying odd-one-out judgements in humans described previously36,37,39, the DNN embedding yielded many interpretable dimensions, which appeared to reflect both semantic and visual properties of objects. The semantic dimensions included taxonomic membership (for example, related to food, technology and home) and other knowledge-related properties (for example, softness), whereas the visual dimensions reflected visual-perceptual attributes (for example, round, green and stringy), with some dimensions reflecting a composite of semantic and visual properties (for example, green and organic) (Fig. 2a). Of note, the DNN dimensions also revealed a sensitivity to basic shapes, including roundness, boxiness and tube shape. This suggests that in line with earlier studies52,53, DNNs indeed learn to represent basic shape properties, an aspect that might not be apparent in their overt behaviour54.

a, Visualization of example dimensions from human- and DNN-derived representational embeddings, with a selection of dimensions that had been rated as semantic, mixed visual–semantic and visual, alongside their dimension labels obtained from human judgements. Note that the displayed images reflect only images with a public domain license and not the full image set76. b, Rating procedure for each dimension, which was based on visualizing the top k images according to their numeric weights. Human participants labelled each of the human and DNN dimensions as predominantly semantic, visual, mixed visual–semantic or unclear (unclear ratings are not shown; 7.35% of all dimensions are for humans and 8.57%, for VGG-16). c, Relative importance of dimensions labelled as visual and semantic, where VGG-16 exhibited a dominance of visual and mixed dimensions relative to humans that showed a clear dominance of semantic dimensions. Images in a and b reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

Despite the apparent similarities, there were, however, striking differences found between humans and the DNN. First, overall, DNN dimensions were less interpretable than human dimensions, as confirmed by the evaluation of all dimensions by two independent raters (Supplementary Section C). This indicates a global difference in how the DNN assigns images as being conceptually similar to each other. Second, although human dimensions were clearly dominated by semantic properties, many DNN dimensions were more visual perceptual in nature or reflected a mixture of visual and semantic information. We quantified this observation by asking the same two independent experts to rate human and DNN dimensions according to whether they were primarily visual perceptual, semantic, reflected a mixture of both or were unclear (Fig. 2b). To confirm that the results were not an arbitrary byproduct of the chosen DNN architecture, we provided the raters with four additional DNNs for which we had computed additional representational embeddings. The results revealed a clear dominance of semantic dimensions in humans, with only a small number of mixed dimensions. By contrast, for DNNs, we found a consistently larger proportion of dimensions that were dominated by visual information or that reflected a mixture of both visual and semantic information (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 1b for all DNNs). This visual bias is also present across intermediate representations of VGG-16 and even stronger in early to late convolutional layers (Supplementary Fig. 2). This demonstrates a clear difference in the relative weight that humans and DNNs assign to visual and semantic information, respectively. We independently validated these findings using semantic text embedding and observed a similar pattern of visual bias (Supplementary Section E indicates that the results were not solely a product of human rater bias).

Despite the overall differences in human and DNN representational dimensions, the DNN also contained many dimensions that appeared to be interpretable and comparable to those found in humans. Next, we aimed at testing to what degree these interpretable dimensions truly reflected specific visual or semantic properties, or whether they only superficially appeared to show this correspondence. To this end, we experimentally and causally manipulated images and observed the impact on dimension scores. Beyond general interpretability, these analyses further establish which visual properties in each image drive individual dimensions and, thus, determine image representations.

Image manipulation requires a direct mapping from input images to the embedding dimensions. However, the embedding dimensions were derived using a sampling-based optimization based on odd-one-out choices inferred from penultimate DNN features. Consequently, this approach does not directly map these features to the learned embedding. To establish this mapping, we applied ℓ2-regularized linear regression to link the DNN's penultimate layer activations to the learned embedding. This mapping then enables the prediction of embedding dimensions from the penultimate feature activations in response to novel or manipulated images (Fig. 1d). Penultimate layer activations were indeed highly predictive of each embedding dimension, with all dimensions exceeding an R2 of 75%, and the majority exceeding 85%. Thus, this allowed us to accurately predict the dimension values for novel images.

Having established an end-to-end mapping between the input image and individual object dimensions, we next used three approaches to both probe the consistency of the interpretation and identify dimension-specific image properties. First, to identify image regions relevant for each individual dimension, we used Grad-CAM55, an established technique for providing visual explanations. Grad-CAM generates heat maps that highlight the image regions that are the most influential for model predictions. Unlike the typical use of Grad-CAM, which focuses on generating visual explanations for model classifications (for example, dog versus cat), we used Grad-CAM to reveal which image regions drive the dimensions in the DNN embedding. The results of this analysis are illustrated with example images in Fig. 3. Object dimensions were indeed driven by different image regions that contain relevant information, in line with the dimension's interpretation derived from human ratings and suggesting that the representations captured by the DNN's penultimate layer allow us to distinguish between different parts of the image that carry different functional importance.

a, General methodology of the approach. We used Grad-CAM55 to visualize the importance of distinct image parts based on the gradients of the penultimate DNN features that we initially used to sample triplet choices. The gradients were obtained in our fully differentiable interpretability model with respect to a dimension w in our embedding. b, We visualize the heat maps for three different images and dimensions. Each column shows the relevance of parts of an image for that dimension. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images available in the public domain76.

As the second image explanation approach, to highlight which image properties drive a dimension, we used a generative image model to create novel images optimized for maximizing the values of a given dimension31,56,57. Unlike conventional activation maximization targeting a single DNN unit or a cluster of units, our approach aimed to selectively amplify activation in dimensions of the DNN embedding across the entire DNN layer, using a pretrained generative adversarial neural network (StyleGAN-XL58). To achieve this, we applied our linear end-to-end mapping to predict the embedding dimensions from the penultimate activations in response to the images generated by StyleGAN-XL. The results of this procedure are shown in Fig. 4b. The approach successfully generated images with high numerical values in the dimensions of our DNN embedding. Indeed, the properties highlighted by these generated images appear to align with human-assigned labels for each specific dimension, again suggesting that the DNN embedding contained conceptually meaningful and coherent object properties similar to those found in humans.

a, Using StyleGAN-XL58, we optimized a latent code to maximize the predicted response in a specific embedding dimension. b, Visualizations for different dimensions in our embedding. We show the top ten images that score the highest in the dimension and the corresponding top ten generated images. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images available in the public domain76. Images in a and b reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

As the third image explanation approach, given that different visual properties naturally co-occur across images, and to unravel their respective contribution, we causally manipulated individual image properties and observed the effect on the predicted DNN dimensions. We exemplify this approach with manipulations in colour, object shape and background (Supplementary Section F), largely confirming our predictions, showing specific activation decreases or increases in dimensions that appeared to be representing these properties.

The previous results have confirmed the overall consistency and interpretation of the DNN's visual and semantic dimensions based on common interpretability techniques. However, a direct comparison with human image representations is crucial for identifying which representational dimensions align well and which do not. Traditional RSA provides a global metric of representational alignment, revealing a moderate correlation (Pearson's r = 0.55) between the representational similarity matrices (RSMs) of humans and the DNN (Fig. 5a). Although this indicates some degree of alignment in the object image representations, it does not clarify the factors driving this alignment. To address this challenge, we directly compared pairs of dimensions from both embeddings, pinpointing which dimensions contributed the most to the overall alignment and which dimensions were less well aligned.

a, RSMs reconstructed from human and VGG-16 embedding. Each row represents an object, with rows sorted into 27 superordinate categories (for example, animal, food and furniture) from ref. 40 to better highlight similarities and differences in representation. b, Pairwise correlations between human and VGG-16 embedding dimensions. c, Cumulative RSA analysis that shows the amount of variance explained in the human RSM as a function of the number of DNN dimensions. The black line shows the number of dimensions required to explain 95% of the variance. d–f, Intersection (red and blue regions) and differences (orange and green regions) between three highly correlating human and DNN dimensions. The pink circles denote the intersection of the red and blue regions, that is, where the same image scores highly in both dimensions. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images from the public domain76. For three images without a public domain version, visually similar replacements were used. Images in d–f reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

For each human dimension, we identified the most strongly correlated DNN dimension, once without replacement (unique) and once with replacement, and sorted the dimensions based on their fit (Fig. 5b). This revealed a close alignment, with Pearson's reaching up to r = 0.80 for a select few dimensions, which gradually declined across other representational dimensions. To determine whether the global representational similarity was driven by just a few well-aligned dimensions or required a broader spectrum of dimensions, we assessed the number of dimensions needed to explain human similarity judgements. The analysis revealed that 40 dimensions were required to capture 95% of the variance in representational similarity with the human RSM (Fig. 5c). Although this number is much smaller than the original 4,096-dimensional VGG-16 layer, these results demonstrate that the global representational similarity is not solely driven by a small number of well-aligned dimensions.

Given the imperfect alignment of DNN and human dimensions, we explored the similarities and differences in the stimuli represented by these dimensions. For each dimension, we identified which images were the most representative of both humans and the DNN. Crucially, to highlight the discrepancies between the two domains, we then identified which images exhibited strong dimension values for humans but weak values for the DNN, and vice versa (Fig. 5d–f). Although the results indicated similar visual and semantic representations in the most representative images, they also exposed clear divergences in dimension meanings. For instance, in an animal-related dimension, humans consistently represented animals even for images in which the DNN exhibited very low dimension values. Conversely, the DNN dimension strongly represented objects that were not animals, such as natural objects, cages or mesh (Fig. 5d). Similarly, a string-related dimension maintained a string-like representation in humans but included other objects in the DNN that were not string like, potentially reflecting properties related to thin, curvy objects or specific image properties (Fig. 5f).

Since internal representations do not necessarily translate into behaviour, we next addressed whether this misalignment would translate to downstream behavioural choices. To this end, we used a jackknife resampling procedure to determine the relevance of individual dimensions for odd-one-out choices. For each triplet, we iteratively pruned dimensions in both human and DNN embeddings and observed changes in the predicted probabilities of selecting the odd one out, yielding an importance score for each dimension for the odd-one-out choice (Fig. 6a). The results of this analysis showed that although humans and DNNs often aligned in their representations and choices, a sizable fraction of choices exhibited the same behaviour despite strong differences in representations (Fig. 6b). For behavioural choices, the semantic bias in humans was enhanced, as evidenced by an even stronger importance of semantic relative to visual or mixed dimensions in humans compared with DNNs. Individual triplet choices were affected not only by semantic dimensions but also by visual dimensions (Fig. 6c–f). Together, these results demonstrate that the differences in how humans and DNNs represent object images not only translate into behavioural choices but are also further amplified in their categorization behaviour.

a, Overview of the approach. For one triplet, we computed the original predicted softmax probability based on the entire representational embedding for each object image in the triplet. We then iteratively pruned individual dimensions from the representational embedding and stored the resulting change in the predicted softmax probability—relative to that of the full embedding—as a relevance score for that dimension. b, We calculated the relevance scores for a random sample of 10 million triplets and identified the most relevant dimension for each triplet. We then labelled the 10 million most relevant dimensions according to human-labelled visual properties as semantic, mixed visual–semantic, visual or unclear. Semantic dimensions are the most relevant for human behavioural choices, whereas for VGG-16, visual and mixed visual–semantic properties are more relevant. c–f, We rank the sorted changes in softmax probability to find triplets in which human and the DNN maximally diverge. Each panel shows a triplet with the behavioural choice made by humans and the DNN. We visualized the most relevant dimension for that triplet alongside the distribution of relevance scores. Each dimension is assigned its human-annotated label. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images from the public domain76. Images in a and c–f reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

A key challenge in understanding the similarities and differences in humans and AI lies in establishing ways to make these two domains directly comparable. Overcoming this challenge would allow us to identify strategies to make AI more human like17 and for using AI as an effective model of human perception and cognition. In this work, we propose a framework to identify interpretable factors that determine the similarities and differences between human and AI representations. In this framework, these factors can be identified by using the same experiment to probe behaviour in humans and AI systems and applying the same computational strategy to natural and artificial responses to infer their respective interpretable embeddings. We applied this approach to human similarity judgements and representations of DNNs trained on natural images with varying objectives, with a primary focus on an image classification model. This allowed for a direct, meaningful comparison of the representations underlying human similarity judgements with the representations of the image classification model.

Our results revealed that the DNN contained representations that appeared to be similar to those found in humans, ranging from visual (for example, ‘white', ‘circular/round' and ‘transparent') to semantic properties (for example, ‘food related' and ‘fire related'). However, a direct comparison with humans showed largely different strategies for arriving at these representations. Although human representations were dominated by semantic dimensions, the DNN exhibited a pronounced bias towards visual or mixed visual–semantic dimensions. In addition, a direct comparison of seemingly aligned dimensions revealed that DNNs only approximated the semantic representations found in humans. These different strategies were also reflected in their behaviour, where similar behavioural outcomes were based on different embedding dimensions. Thus, despite seemingly well-aligned human and DNN representations at a global level, deriving dimensions underlying the representational similarities provided a more complete and more fine-grained picture of this alignment, revealing the nature of the representational strategies that humans and DNNs use12,14,59.

Although approaches like RSA21,60 are particularly useful for comparing one or multiple representational spaces, they typically provide only a summary statistic of the degree of alignment and require explicit hypotheses and model comparisons to determine what it is about the representational space that drives human alignment. By contrast, other approaches have focused specifically on the interpretability of DNN representations31,32,34,35,61,62,63, but either provide very specific local measures about DNN units or have limited direct comparability with human representations, as the same interpretability methods can typically not be applied to understand human mental representations. Our framework combines the strengths of the comparability gained from RSA and existing interpretability methods to understand image representations in DNNs. We applied common interpretability methods to show that our approach allows for detailed experimental testing and causal probing of DNN representations and behaviour across diverse images. Yet, only the direct comparison with human representations revealed the diverging representational strategies of humans and DNNs and, thus, the limitations of the visualization techniques we used64.

Our results are consistent with previous work indicating that DNNs make use of strategies that deviate from those used in humans65,66. Beyond previously discovered biases, here we found a visual bias in DNNs that diverges from a semantic bias in humans for similarity judgements. In particular, even the highest layers in DNNs retained strong visual biases for solving the tasks they had been trained on, including image classification or linking images with text, both of which can be described as semantic tasks with different degrees of richness. This visual strategy may, of course, reflect how our visual system solves core object recognition67. Indeed, it is an open question to what extent human core object recognition relies on a similar visual bias68 and whether this bias is also found in the anterior ventral–temporal cortex69, which is known to be involved in high-level object processing70 However, even if humans used a primarily visual strategy for solving core object recognition, our findings would demonstrate a significant limitation of DNNs in capturing human mental representations as measured with similarity judgements, despite similar representational geometries71.

Interestingly, CLIP, a more predictive model of human cortical visual processing26,29, retained a visual bias despite training on semantic image descriptions, showing that the classification objective alone is not sufficient for explaining visual bias in DNNs. At the same time, the visual bias in CLIP was smaller (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that better models of high-level visual processing may also be models with a larger semantic bias and pointing towards potential strategies for improving their alignment with humans, which may involve multimodal pretraining or larger, more diverse datasets29. Future work would benefit from a systematic comparison of different DNNs to identify what factors determine visual bias and their alignment with human brain and behavioural data.

Although these results indicate that studying core dimensions of DNN representations can improve our understanding of the factors required to identify better models of human mental representations, it has also been demonstrated recently that aligning DNNs with human representations can improve DNN robustness and performance at out-of-distribution tasks28,72. This work highlights that identifying visual bias may be useful not only for understanding representational and behavioural differences between humans and DNNs but also for guiding future work determining the gaps in human–AI alignment and identifying adjustments in architecture and training needed to reduce this bias59. Further work is needed to clarify the role of task instructions in human–AI alignment across diverse tasks and instructions73.

The framework introduced in this work can be expanded in several ways. Future work could use this approach to explore what factors make DNNs similar or different from one another. A comprehensive analysis of various DNN architectures, objectives or datasets25,26,28 could uncover the factors underlying representational alignment, and extension to other stimuli, tasks and domains, including brain recordings. Together, this framework promises a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between human and AI representations, providing the potential to identify better candidate models of human cognition and behaviour and more human-aligned artificial cognitive systems.

In the triplet odd-one-out task, participants are presented with three objects and must choose the one that is least similar to the others, that is, the odd one out. We define a dataset \({\mathcal{D}}:={\left\{\left(\{{i}_{s},{j}_{s},{k}_{s}\},\{{a}_{s},{b}_{s}\}\right)\right\}}_{s = 1}^{n}\), where n is the total number of triplets and {is, js, ks} is a set of three unique objects, with {as, bs} being the pair among them determined as the most similar. We used a dataset of human responses36 to learn an embedding of human object concepts. In addition, we simulated the triplet choices from a DNN. For the DNN, we simulated these choices by computing the dot product of the penultimate layer activation \({{\bf{z}}}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}_{+}\) after applying the rectified linear unit function, where \({S}_{ij}={{\bf{z}}}_{i}^{\top }{{\bf{z}}}_{j}\). The most similar pair {as, bs} was then identified by the largest dot product:

Using this approach, we sampled the triplet odd-one-out choices for a total of 20 million triplets for the DNN.

Let \({W}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{m\times p}\) denote a randomly initialized embedding matrix, where p = 150 is the initial embedding dimensionality. To learn interpretable concept embeddings, we used variational interpretable concept embeddings (VICE), an approximate Bayesian inference approach37. VICE performs mean-field variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution \(p({W}| {\mathcal{D}})\) with a variational distribution, qθ(W), where \({q}_{\theta }\in {\mathcal{Q}}\).

VICE imposes sparsity on the embeddings using a spike-and-slab Gaussian mixture before updating the variational parameters θ. This prior encourages shrinkage towards zero, with the spike approximating a Dirac delta function at zero (responsible for sparsity) and the slab modelled as a wide Gaussian distribution (determining non-zero values). Therefore, it is a sparsity-inducing prior and can be interpreted as a Bayesian version of the elastic net74. The optimization objective minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the posterior and approximate distributions:

where the left term represents the complexity loss and the right term is the data log-likelihood.

Since the variational parameters are composed of two matrices, one for the mean and one for the variance, that is, θ = {μ, σ}, we can use the mean representation μi as the final embedding for an object i. Imposing sparsity and positivity constraints improves the interpretability of our embeddings, ensuring that each dimension meaningfully represents distinct object properties. Although sparsity is guaranteed via the spike-and-slab prior, we enforced non-negativity by applying a rectified linear unit function to our final embedding matrix, thereby guaranteeing that \({W}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}_{+}^{m\times p}\). Note that this is done both during optimization and at inference time. We used the same procedure as in ref. 37 for determining the optimal number of dimensions. Specifically, we initialized our model with p = 150 dimensions and reduced the dimensionality iteratively by pruning dimensions based on their probability of exceeding a threshold set for sparsity:

where wij is the weight associated with object i and dimension j. Training stopped either when the number of dimensions remained unchanged for 500 epochs or when the embedding was optimized for a maximum of 1,000 epochs.

We assessed reproducibility across 32 model runs with different seeds using a split-half reliability test. We chose the split-half reliability test for its effectiveness in evaluating the consistency of our model's performance across different subsets of data, ensuring robustness. We partitioned the objects into two disjoint sets using odd and even masks. For each model run and every dimension in an embedding, we identified the dimension that is the most highly correlated among all the other models by using an odd mask. Using the even mask, we correlated this highest match with the corresponding dimension. This process generated a sampling distribution of Pearson's r coefficients for all the model seeds. We subsequently Fisher z transformed the Pearson's r sampling distribution. The average z-transformed reliability score for each model run was obtained by taking the mean of these z scores. Inverting this average provides an average Pearson's r reliability score (Supplementary Section G). For our final model and all subsequent analyses, we selected the embedding with the highest average reproducibility across all dimensions.

We assigned labels to the human embedding by pairing each dimension with its highest correlating counterpart from ref. 36. These dimensions were derived from the same behavioural data, but using a non-Bayesian variant of our method. We then used the human-generated labels that were previously collected for these dimensions, without allowing for repeats.

For the DNN, we labelled dimensions using human judgements. This allowed us to capture a broad and nuanced understanding of each dimension's characteristics. To collect human judgements, we asked 12 laboratory participants (6 male, 6 female; mean age, 29.08 years; s.d., 3.09 years; range, 25–35 years) to label each DNN dimension. Participants were presented with a 5 × 6 grid of images, with each row representing a decreasing percentile of importance for that specific dimension. The top row contained the most important images, and the following rows included images within the 8th, 16th, 24th and 32nd percentiles. Participants were asked to provide up to five labels that they thought best described each dimension. Word clouds showing the provided object labels were weighted by the frequencies of occurrence, and the top six labels were visualized. Due to computer crashes during data acquisition, three participants had incomplete data (32%, 80% and 93%).

Study participation was voluntary, and participants were not remunerated for their participation. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University Medical Center Leipzig (157/20-ek).

Two independent experts rated the dimensions according to two questions. The first question asked whether the dimensions were primarily visual perceptual, semantic conceptual, a mix of both or whether their nature was unclear. For the second question, they rated the dimensions according to whether they reflected a single concept, several concepts or were not interpretable. Overall, both raters agreed agreed 81.86% of the time for question 1 and 90.00% of the time for question 2. Response ambiguity was resolved by a third rater (Supplementary Sections A–C). All raters were part of the laboratory but were blind to whether the dimensions were model or human generated.

We additionally learned embeddings from early (convolutional block 1), middle (convolutional block 3) and late (convolution block 5) convolutional layers of VGG-16. For this, we applied global average pooling to the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and then sampled triplets from the averaged one-dimensional representations.

To visualize the learned object dimensions, we used an activation maximization technique with a pretrained StyleGAN-XL generator \({\mathcal{G}}\) (ref. 58). Our approach combines sampling with gradient-based optimization to generate images that maximize specific dimension values in our embedding space.

We started by sampling a set of N = 100,000 concatenated noise vectors \({{\bf{v}}}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{d}\), where d is the dimensionality of the StyleGAN-XL latent space. For each noise vector, we generated an image \({{\bf{x}}}_{i}={\mathcal{G}}({{\bf{v}}}_{i})\) and predicted its embedding \({\hat{{\bf{y}}}}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{p}\) using our pipeline, where p is the number of dimensions in our embedding space.

For a given dimension j, we selected the top k images that yielded the highest values for \({\hat{y}}_{ij}\), the jth component of \(\hat{{{\bf{y}}}_{i}}\). These images served as starting points for our optimization process.

To refine these initial images, we performed gradient-based optimization in the latent space of StyleGAN-XL. Our objective function \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{AM}}}\) balances two goals: increasing the absolute value of the embedding for dimension j and concentrating probability mass towards dimension j. Formally, we define \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{AM}}}\) as

where \({{\bf{z}}}_{i}=f({\mathcal{G}}({{\bf{v}}}_{i}))\) denotes the penultimate features extracted from the generated image using the pretrained VGG-16 classifier f. The term on the left, referred to as the dimension size reward, contributes to increasing the absolute value \(\hat{y}_{ij}\) for the object dimension j. The term on the right, referred to as the dimension specificity reward, concentrates probability mass towards a dimension without necessarily increasing its absolute value. The balance between these two objectives is controlled by the scalars α and β. The objective \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{AM}}}\) was minimized using vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Importantly, only the latent code vector vi was updated, and keeping the parameters of \({\mathcal{G}}\), the VGG-16 classifier f and the embedding model fixed.

This optimization process was performed for each of the top k images selected in the initial sampling phase. The resulting optimized images provide visual representations that maximally activate specific dimensions in our learned embedding space, offering insights into the semantic content captured by each dimension.

To highlight the image regions driving individual DNN dimensions, we used Grad-CAM. For each image, we performed a forward pass to obtain an image embedding and computed gradients using a backward pass. We next aggregated the gradients across all the feature maps in that layer to compute an average gradient, yielding a two-dimensional dimension importance map.

We used RSA to compare the structure of our learned embeddings with human judgements and DNN features. This analysis was conducted in three stages: human RSA, DNN RSA, and a comparative analysis between human and DNN representations.

We reconstructed a similarity matrix from our learned embedding. Given a set of objects \({\mathcal{O}}={o}_{1},\ldots ,{o}_{m}\), we computed the similarity Sij between each pair of objects (oi, oj) using the softmax function:

where yi is the embedding of object oi, and the softmax function returns the probability of oi being more similar to ok than oj. To evaluate the explained variance, we used a subset of 48 objects for which a fully sampled similarity matrix and associated noise ceilings were available from previous work36. We then computed the Pearson correlation between our predicted RSM and the ground-truth RSM for these 48 objects.

We followed a similar procedure, reconstructing the RSM from our learned embedding of the DNN features. We then correlated this reconstructed RSM with the ground-truth RSM derived from the original DNN features used to sample our behavioural judgements.

To compare human and DNN representations, we conducted two analyses. First, we performed a pairwise comparison by matching each human dimension with its most correlated DNN dimension. This was done both with and without replacement, allowing us to assess the degree of alignment between human and DNN representational spaces. Second, we performed a cumulative RSA to determine the number of DNN dimensions needed to accurately reflect the patterns in the human similarity matrix. We took the same ranking of DNN dimensions used for the pairwise RSA, starting with the highest correlating dimension. We then progressively added one DNN dimension at a time to a growing subset. After each addition, we reconstructed the RSM from this subset and correlated both the human RSM and the cumulative DNN RSM. This step-by-step process allowed us to observe how the inclusion of each additional DNN dimension contributed to explaining the variance in the human RSM.

Metrics details

The balance between neural excitation (E) and inhibition (I) shapes cognition, development and brain-based disorders. Electroencephalography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy allow non-invasive quantification of the E/I ratio but yield discrepancies that challenge their use in this context. Addressing these differences is essential for advancing biomarkers and brain-based therapies.

Metrics details

High-density silicon probes have transformed neuroscience by enabling large-scale neural recordings at single-cell resolution. However, existing technologies have provided limited functionality in nonhuman primates (NHPs) such as macaques. In the present report, we describe the design, fabrication and performance of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP, a high-channel electrode array designed to enable large-scale acute recording throughout large animal brains. The probe features 4,416 recording sites distributed along a 45-mm shank. Experimenters can programmably select 384 recording channels, enabling simultaneous multi-area recording from thousands of neurons with single or multiple probes. This technology substantially increases scalability and recording access relative to existing technologies and enables new classes of experiments that involve electrophysiological mapping of brain areas at single-neuron and single-spike resolution, measurement of spike–spike correlations between cells and simultaneous brain-wide recordings at scale.

High-channel count electrophysiological recording devices such as Neuropixels probes1,2 are transforming neuroscience with rodent models by enabling recording from large populations of neurons anywhere in the rodent brain3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The capabilities provided by this approach have led to a myriad new discoveries4,7,9. The Neuropixels 1.0 probe has also been used to record neurons in both human10,11 and nonhuman primates (NHPs) such as macaques12,13,14,15, but its 10-mm length restricts access to superficial targets and the thin shank (24 µm) renders them difficult to insert through primate dura mater. Consequently, a large community of NHP researchers articulated the need for a probe that allows large-scale access to neurons throughout the primate brain.

Current linear array technologies, such as V- or S-probes (Plexon, Inc.), provide access to the whole brain, but are limited to 64 channels and have relatively large diameters (for example, 380 µm) that increase as recording channels are added. Surface arrays such as the Utah array16 or floating microwire arrays17 allow for recording from up to 256 channels simultaneously, but are limited to recording at pre-specified depths in superficial cortex, require opening the dura for placement and cannot be moved after implantation. Alternative approaches using individually driven single electrodes have achieved recordings in deep brain regions from dozens or hundreds of neurons by a few dedicated labs18,19,20, although these approaches do not allow for dense sampling within a specific target region. Alternatively, two-photon (2P) imaging enables recording at single-cell resolution, but with limited temporal resolution and limited access to many brain areas.

We developed the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP, a high-density integrated silicon electrode array, optimized for recording in NHPs and designed to enable flexible, configurable recording from large neuronal populations throughout the brain with single-neuron and single-spike resolution. Although the probe's design and electronic specifications are based on the Neuropixels 1.0 probe (http://Neuropixels.org), fabricating these probes with the desired combination of mechanical and electrical properties using a standard CMOS photolithography process required substantial engineering advances. Each probe is larger than a photolithographic reticle, requiring ‘stitching' of electrical traces across the boundaries between multiple reticles to achieve the required probe geometry21 and the introduction of stress compensation layers to prevent intrinsic material stresses from causing the shank to bend. Relative to Neuropixels 1.0, the two variants of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP feature a longer, wider and thicker shank (45 mm long, 125 µm wide and 90 µm thick; Fig. 1a). For each probe variant, the full length of the shank is populated with recording sites with a density of two sites every 20 µm (Fig. 1b). A switch under every site allows flexible selection of the 384 simultaneous recording channels across these 4,416 sites (11 banks of 384 channels, respectively, plus one half-sized bank at the shank–base junction; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1).

Here, we described this new probe and the engineering challenges surmounted by fabrication and illustrate the ability to address a range of new experimental use cases for recording in large animal models. We focused on recording large neuronal populations, recording both in deep structures and from multiple regions simultaneously. We illustrated these use cases with four example experiments from different labs, each pursuing research questions spanning sensory, motor and cognitive domains using macaques. The scale and access provided by Neuropixels 1.0 NHP enabled a wide range of new experimental paradigms, while streamlining neural data collection at a fraction of the cost of existing alternatives.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe uses the same signal-conditioning circuits as the Neuropixels 1.0 probe1, integrating 384 low-noise readout channels with programmable gain and 10-bit resolution on a 130-nm Silicon-on-Insulator CMOS platform. Within the probe shank, an array of shift-register elements and a switch matrix enable programmable selection of recording sites. The probe is fabricated as a 54-mm-long monolithic piece of silicon that integrates both the shank and the base electronics, exceeding the size of the optical reticle used to define on-chip features. We addressed this limitation by developing a method called stitching21, which precisely aligns features from different exposures between adjacent reticles.

The typical maximum size of a 130-nm CMOS chip is limited by the maximum reticle size (that is, 22 mm × 24 mm in this case) that can be exposed in a single lithography step. To build larger chips, the CMOS chip is divided into sub-blocks smaller than the reticle field, which are later used to re-compose (that is, stitch together) the complete chip by performing multiple reticle exposures per layer. The stitched boundary regions of the small design blocks are overlapped (that is, double exposed) to ensure uninterrupted metal traces from one reticle to the next, which is accounted for in the design. As multiple levels of metal wires are needed to realize and interconnect the large number of recording sites at high density, the conducting wires in the shank must be aligned between adjacent reticles for four of the six stacked aluminum metal layers. To enable stitching and to simplify photo-mask design and reuse, the probe is designed with three elements as shown in Fig. 1d: a 5-mm tip (Fig. 1e), two 20-mm middle shank segments (stitch segments 2 and 3 in Fig. 1d) and the 10-mm base segment. Four reticles are thus required to define the features on each probe. The probe base is 6 mm wide, allowing four probes to be written across these four reticles.

Four design strategies were developed to mitigate the expected degradation of signal with increased shank length: (1) the 384 metal wires connecting recording sites to the readout circuits in the base were widened relative to Neuropixels 1.0 to keep their resistance and thermal noise contribution low; (2) the spacing between the metal wires was increased to limit the signal coupling and crosstalk along the shank; (3) the power-supply wires connected to shank circuits were made wider to minimize voltage attenuation and fluctuations along the shank; and (4) the size of the decoupling capacitors was increased. The additional width and spacing of the metal lines also mitigated the impact of anticipated reticle misalignments, magnification and rotational errors in the overlap regions during stitching. Collectively, these approaches successfully enabled recording from the full 45 mm without signal degradation as a function of position (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Figure 1e shows details of the shank recording site placement and the dense CMOS layout in the shank and Fig. 1f shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the aluminium metal wires running along one of the 0.24-µm stitching regions in the shank. As a result of the double exposure of the masking photoresist at the stitching region, the wires became 24–54% narrower in this region, but remained continuous circuits without interruption.

One of the major design changes to this device, compared with the rodent probe1, was to strengthen and thicken the probe shank, which was necessary both to support the longer 45-mm shank length and to allow the probe to penetrate primate dura. To achieve this, we increased the thickness of the shank from 24 µm to 90 µm. In addition, as the increased thickness altered the bending profile of the shank, we added stress compensation layers, which help to reduce intrinsic stresses within the material in the shank and enabled us to keep bending within the same range as the rodent probes, despite the 450% increase in length.

For the data reported in the present study, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe version with a 125 µm wide, 45 mm long shank, 4,416 selectable recording sites (pixels) and a 48 mm2 base. To facilitate insertion of the shank into the brain and to minimize dimpling and tissue damage1, the 20° top-plane, chisel-tapered shanks were mechanically ground to a 25° bevel angle on the side plane using a modified pipette microgrinder (Narishige, cat. no. EG-402). This procedure resulted in a tip sharpened along both axes (Fig. 1g). Additional discussion of insertion mechanics, methods and hardware is provided in a wiki (https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki).

The programmable sites of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP provide a number of advantages over existing recording technologies appropriate for primates. First, the high-channel count represents a transformative capability for large animal research. Large-scale recordings permitted rapid surveys of brain regions, enabled analyses that infer the neural state on single trials, made it practical to identify ensembles of neurons with statistically significantly correlated spike trains and reduced the number of animals and time required to perform experiments. Second, the high density of recording sites enabled high-quality, automated spike sorting22 when recording from one or both columns within a 3.84-mm bank of recording sites (Fig. 1c). The high density of sites also enabled continuous tracking of neurons in the event of drifting motion between the probe and tissue10,11, which is imperative for automated spike sorting of most real-world data22.

Third, users could choose to record with full density from one column in each of two banks, for 7.68 mm total length of high-quality, single-unit recordings, or specify alternative layouts (Extended Data Fig. 1). Programmable site selection allowed experimenters to decouple the process of optimizing a recording location from probe positioning. This capability allowed experimenters to survey neural activity along the entire probe length to map the relative positions of electrophysiological features. In addition, the programmability allowed experimenters to leave the probe in place before an experiment to improve stability during the recording.

We illustrated these collective advantages using example recordings in different macaque brain studies, including: (1) retinotopic organization of extrastriate visual cortex; (2) neural dynamics throughout the motor system; (3) face recognition in face patches of the inferotemporal (IT) cortex; and (4) neural signals underlying decision-making in the posterior parietal cortex.

More than half of the macaque neocortex is visual in function23 and a multitude of visual areas containing neurons with distinct feature-selective properties (for example, motion, color) lie beyond the primary visual cortex (V1). However, many of these visual areas are located deep within the convolutions of the occipital, temporal and parietal lobes (Fig. 2a). This, combined with the limitations of prior recording technologies, led to most electrophysiological studies focusing on only a subset of visual areas. Fewer than half of the identified visual areas have been well studied (for example, areas V4, MT (middle temporal)), whereas most (for example, DP (dorsal prelunate), V3A, FST (fundus of the superior temporal sulcus), PO (parieto-occipital)) have been only sparsely investigated. Given the clear similarities between the macaque and human visual systems24,25, systematic investigation across the macaque visual cortex is needed. This is practical only with technologies that enable large-scale surveys via simultaneous population recordings from both superficial and deep structures. Our initial tests with the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe demonstrate that it is well suited for that purpose.

Ntotal, total number of neurons; Nvisual, number of visually responsive neurons.

During individual experimental sessions, the activity of thousands of single neurons across multiple visual cortical areas could be recorded using a single NHP probe. Figure 2b,c shows the spike waveforms and rasters from one recording of 446 neurons simultaneously recorded from one bank of recording sites spanning 6–10 mm below the cortical surface. Of these neurons, 202 neurons exhibited well-defined receptive fields (RFs). As anticipated, the location of the neurons' RFs varied as a function of the position along the probe. RFs shifted in an orderly manner for stretches of approximately 1 mm and then shifted abruptly, reflecting probable transitions between different retinotopic areas (for example, refs. 26,27,28; Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Across the full depth, RFs tiled much of the contralateral hemifield and included some of the ipsilateral visual space (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3b). When recording from up to 23 successive sessions in the same location with each probe, the number of neurons recorded varied but showed no clear decline with repeated penetrations (Fig. 2f).

In other sessions, we recorded from up to five probe banks spanning 0–19 mm beneath the pial surface (Fig. 2g) across separate blocks of trials. Using this approach, it was possible to sample from different locations without moving the probe. In one example session, 3,029 single neurons were recorded, of which 2,729 neurons were visually responsive (Fig. 2h). As with the single-bank recordings (Fig. 2d,e), neuronal RFs shifted gradually for contiguous stretches, punctuated by abrupt changes. In the example shown (Fig. 2i), RFs at more superficial sites (0–3 mm) were located at more eccentric locations of the visual field and then abruptly shifted toward the center and closer to the lower vertical meridian (LVM; ~3 mm). At the same location, neurons became more selective to the direction of motion (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), suggesting a transition from area V4 to areas MT or MST. After that, RFs were located more centrally at the lower contralateral visual field and were observed across several millimeters. At deeper sites (~6–7 mm), smaller RFs clustered near the horizontal meridian (HM) for more than 1 mm, then quickly shifted toward the upper vertical meridian (UVM; ~8 mm). Finally, at the deepest sites (>10 mm), RFs generally became larger and much less well defined. These representations were stable throughout the duration of a session (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These data illustrate how the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP's dense sampling and single-unit resolution facilitate large-scale and unbiased mapping of the response properties of neurons across multiple visual areas.

Next, we demonstrated the utility of this technology for studying multiple brain areas involved in movement control. Primary motor cortex (M1) is situated at the rostral bank of the central sulcus and extends along the precentral gyrus. Sulcal M1 contains the densest projections of descending corticomotoneuronal cells and corticospinal neurons, which collectively are understood to convey the dominant efferent signals from the brain to the periphery in primates29,30. Constraints of existing technology have led to two broad limitations in studies of the motor system.

First, motor electrophysiologists have been forced to choose between simultaneous recording from populations of superficial neurons in gyral motor cortex (PMd and rostral M1) using Utah arrays31 and, alternatively, recording fewer neurons in sulcal M1 using single-wire electrodes or passive arrays of 16–32 contacts (for example, Plexon S-probes or Microprobes Floating Microwire Arrays17). Recording from large populations of neurons in sulcal M1 has not been feasible.

Second, the motor cortex is only one part of an extensive network of cortical and subcortical structures involved in generating movement29,32. Many investigations of the motor system focus on M1 and comparatively fewer experiments have investigated neural responses from the numerous additional structures involved in planning and controlling movements, the result in part of the challenge of obtaining large-scale datasets in subcortical structures in primates. Areas such as the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the basal ganglia (BG) are understood to be important for planning and controlling movements, but investigation of the functional roles and interactions between these regions is hampered by the challenge of simultaneously recording from multiple areas.

We developed a system capable of simultaneous recordings from multiple Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probes in superficial and deep structures of rhesus macaques. We tested this approach using a task in which a monkey generated isometric forces to track the height of a scrolling path of dots (Fig. 3a; task described in ref. 33). We recorded from the primary motor and premotor cortex (M1 and PMd; Fig. 3b) while the monkey tracked a variety of force profiles (one profile per condition). Each condition was repeated across multiple trials (Fig. 3c). Single neurons exhibited a diversity of temporal patterns throughout the motor behavior (Fig. 3d–f). When ordered using Rastermap34, neurons illustrated a diversity of phase relationships with respect to the behavior (Fig. 3f). Predictions of endpoint force from neural activity (via linear regression) improved steadily as more neurons were included in the analysis and the performance did not saturate even when including all recorded neurons (360) for an example session (Fig. 3g). Thus, despite the apparent simplicity of a one-dimensional force-tracking task, neural responses are sufficiently diverse that it is necessary to sample from many hundreds of neurons to capture a complete portrait of population-level activity.

Each line represents the estimate for a subset of channels.

The relative motion of the probe within the brain tissue is a major concern for the stability of neural recordings. Motor tasks represent a challenging set of conditions because movement of the body can place stresses on the implant and move the probe within the brain. With careful preparation, on most sessions we did not observe rapid probe motion due to pulse, respiration or mechanical forces from the motor task. Typically, we observed stable waveforms (Fig. 3h) and ~2–15 µm of slow drift over the course of a recording session (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Figs. 4a and 5). In some isolated cases, when the primate generated a large unexpected movement, we did observe a fast translation of the probe (for example, Extended Data Fig. 4b). However, in practice, we found that low-drift recordings could be obtained across a variety of experimental preparations in disparate brain regions (Fig. 4a–d and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5).

Programmable site selection in the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP enables simultaneous recording from superficial and deep structures using a single probe. To illustrate this capability, we recorded from superficial motor cortex and internal globus pallidus (GPi) in the BG using 192 channels in each target location (Fig. 5a,b). Alternatively, the small form factor of the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probes and headstages allows for dense packing of multiple probes by inserting probes along nonparallel trajectories to record from a large number of neurons in a single area. Figure 5c,d illustrates recordings from three probes in gyral PMd, yielding 673 neurons. This approach was tested on two sessions, in which we recorded from 6 and 7 probes, yielding 1,012 and 783 neurons, respectively. These yields were lower than average as a result of imperfect recording conditions unrelated to the insertion hardware. Sampling with multiple probes is also well suited for simultaneous recording from different brain areas. Figure 5e illustrates a system designed to record from M1, the GPi of the BG and the SMA, using multiple probes inserted into a single recording chamber, with representative neural responses illustrated in Fig. 5f.

Next, we demonstrated the use of the probes in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex, a brain region in the temporal lobe that is challenging to access because of its depth. The IT cortex is a critical brain region supporting high-level object recognition and has been shown to harbor several discrete networks35, each specialized for a specific class of objects. The network that was discovered first and has been most well studied in nonhuman primates is the face-patch system. This system consists of six discrete patches in each hemisphere36, which are anatomically and functionally connected. Each patch contains a large concentration of cells that respond more strongly to images of faces than to images of other objects. Studying the face-patch system has yielded many insights that have transferred to other networks in the IT cortex, including increasing view invariance going from posterior to anterior patches and a simple, linear encoding scheme35. As such, this system represents an approachable model for studying high-level object recognition37. The code for facial identity in these patches is understood well enough that images of presented faces can be accurately reconstructed from neural activity of just a few hundred neurons38.

A major remaining puzzle is how different nodes of the face-patch hierarchy interact to generate object percepts. To answer this question, it is imperative to record from large populations of neurons in multiple face patches simultaneously to observe the varying dynamics of face-patch interactions on a single-trial basis. This is essential because the same image can often invoke different object percepts on different trials39. In the present study, we recorded with one probe in each of two face patches, middle lateral (ML) and anterior fundus (AF), simultaneously (Fig. 6a). The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probes recorded responses of 1,127 units (622 single units, 505 multi-units) across both face patches during a single session (Fig. 6a, right). A continuous segment of approximately 220 channels (2.2 mm) in ML and 190 channels (1.9 mm) in AF contained face-selective units, indicating that these extents of the probes were in the IT cortex. In ML 261 units and in AF 297 units were face selective (two-sided, two-sample Student's t-test, threshold P < 0.05).

Coronal slices from MRI show inserted tungsten electrodes used to verify targeting accuracy for subsequent recordings using Neuropixels 1.0 NHP (top, face-patch ML; bottom, face-patch AF). Yellow overlays illustrate functional MRI contrast in response to faces versus objects. b, Response rasters for a single stimulus presentation of simultaneously recorded neurons in ML and AF to a monkey face, presented at t = 0. Each line in the raster corresponds to a spike from a single neuron or multi-unit cluster, including both well-isolated single units and multi-unit clusters. c, Neuropixels 1.0 NHP enabling recordings from many face cells simultaneously. These plots show the average responses (baseline subtracted and normalized) of visually responsive cells (rows) to 96 stimuli (columns) from 6 categories, including faces and other objects. Bottom, exemplar stimuli from each category. The plots included 438 cells or multi-unit clusters in ML (left) and 689 in AF (right), out of which a large proportion responded selectively to faces. Units were sorted by channel, revealing that face cells are spatially clustered across the probe. d, Coronal slice of MRI of Neuropixels probe targeting the deepest IT face-patch AM. The thick shadow is a cannula that was inserted through the dura into the brain. The thin shadow corresponds to the Neuropixels trajectory. e, Same as c, for face-patch AM, recorded in a different session.

Changing the visual stimulus to a monkey face yielded a clear visual response across both face-patch populations. We measured responses of visually responsive cells to 96 different stimuli containing faces and nonface objects (Fig. 6b,c). A majority of cells in the two patches showed clear face selectivity. Using single-wire tungsten electrodes, this dataset would have taken about 2 years to collect, but is now possible in a single 2-h experimental session38. In addition, to the gain in efficiency created by this technology, simultaneous recordings of multiple cells and multiple areas allowed for investigation of how populations encode object identity in cases of uncertain or ambiguous stimuli, where the interpretation of the stimulus may vary from trial to trial but is nevertheless highly coherent on each trial. The anatomical depth of face patches puts them far out of reach for shorter high-density probes. For example, face-patch AM (anteromedial) sits about 42 mm from the craniotomy (Fig. 6d) along a conventional insertion trajectory, but face patches in this region are still accessible using the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe and exhibit face-selective responses within the boundaries of AM (Fig. 6e).

For many cognitive functions, the processes that give rise to behavior vary across repetitions of a task. As such, technologies that enable the analysis of neural activity at single-trial resolution will be especially critical for research on cognition. Achieving this resolution is challenging because it requires recordings from many neurons that share similar functional properties.

This challenge is exemplified in perceptual decision-making, in which decisions are thought to arise through the accumulation of noisy evidence to a stopping criterion, such that their evolution is unique on each trial in a dynamic motion discrimination task (Fig. 7a; for task see ref. 40). This process is widely observed and known as drift diffusion41,42. Neural correlates of drift diffusion have been inferred from activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) averaged over many decisions. LIP neurons display spatial RFs and represent the accumulated evidence for directing the gaze toward the RF. Analysis of LIP activity during single decisions has proven particularly difficult because RFs have little to no anatomical organization (Fig. 7c, top), preventing simultaneous recordings from many neurons with the same receptive field.

a, Task. The monkey must decide the net direction of dynamic RDM and indicate its decision by making a saccadic eye movement, whenever ready, from the central fixation point (red) to a left-choice or right-choice target (black). The choice and response times are explained by the accumulation of noisy evidence to criterion level54. b, Simultaneous recordings in LIP and SC. Populations of neurons were recorded in LIP with a Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe and in SC (deeper layers) with a multi-channel V-probe (Plexon). c, RFs are identified, post-hoc, from control blocks in which the monkey performed an oculomotor delayed response task55. A small fraction of the LIP neurons (top) has RFs that overlap the left-choice target (outlined in black). The SC (bottom) has a topographic map, so many neurons have overlapping RFs. The large sample size in LIP facilitates identification of neurons that respond to the same choice target in LIP and SC. d, Single-trial activity in LIP (top, n = 17) and SC (bottom, n = 15). Each trace depicts the smoothed firing rate average (Gaussian kernel, σ = 25 ms) of the 17 neurons that overlap the left-choice target (Tin) on a single trial, aligned to the onset of the motion stimulus. Rates are offset by the mean firing rate of 0.18–0.2 s after motion onset to force traces to begin at 0. The line color indicates the decision for the left-choice target or the right-choice target (Tout) on that trial. A few representative traces are highlighted for clarity. e, The same trials as in d aligned to saccade initiation, without baseline offset. Single-trial firing rates approximate drift diffusion in LIP—the accumulation of noisy evidence—whereas single-trial firing rates in SC exhibit a large saccadic burst at the time of the saccade, preceded by occasional nonsaccadic bursts.

Neuropixels recording in the LIP overcomes this challenge. These recordings yield 50–250 simultaneously recorded neurons, of which 10–35 share an RF that overlaps one of the contralateral choice targets used by the monkey to report its decision. The average activity of these target-in-RF (Tin) neurons during a single decision tracks the monkey's accumulated evidence as it contemplates its options. The signal explains much of the variability in the monkey's choices and reaction times43 and conforms to drift-diffusion dynamics (Fig. 7d,e, top).

Neuropixels technology also enables multi-area recordings from ensembles of neurons that share common features (Fig. 7b). For example, neurons in the deeper layers of the superior colliculus (SC) receive input from LIP and, like LIP neurons, also have spatial RFs and decision-related activity (Fig. 7c, bottom). An ideal experiment to understand how the two areas interact is to record simultaneously from populations of neurons in LIP and SC that share the same RF. This experiment is almost impossible with previous recording technology because of the lack of anatomical organization in the LIP.

This second challenge is also overcome by Neuropixels recording in the LIP, allowing for post-hoc identification of neurons in the LIP and SC with overlapping RFs (Fig. 7c). In the experiment depicted in Fig. 5, the response fields of 17 of the 203 LIP neurons overlapped the left-choice target as well as 15 simultaneously recorded neurons in the SC. Unlike LIP, single-trial analysis of the SC population revealed dynamics that are not consistent with drift diffusion (Fig. 7d,e, bottom). Instead, the SC exhibits bursting dynamics, which were found to be related to the implementation of a threshold computation44. The distinct dynamics in the LIP and SC during decision-making were observable only through single-trial analyses, the resolution of which is greatly improved with the high yield of the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP recording.

Understanding how the anatomical structure of specific neural circuits implements neural computations remains an important but elusive goal of systems neuroscience. One step toward connecting disparate levels of experimental inquiry is mapping correlative measures of relative spike timing between pairs of neurons, which is indicative of either synaptic connection between two neurons or shared input drive6,13,45. This is often impractical or extremely challenging when recording from only a small number of neurons, because the likelihood of recording from a pair of neurons with a statistically significant peak in the spike cross-correlogram (CCG) can be quite low. The probability of recording from such pairs of neurons depends on a number of factors, including the details of anatomy in a specific species and brain region. Broadly speaking, however, the probability of successfully recording a pair of neurons with a significant CCG peak increases with the square of the total number of neurons recorded.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe typically yields 200–450 (and sometimes more) neurons when recording with 384 channels in cortical tissue. Applying the same methodology established in ref. 6 to 13 sessions from rhesus PMd and M1 yielded 111 ± 89 putative connected pairs per session and a connection probability of 0.73 ± 0.61%. Figure 8a shows three example jitter-corrected CCG plots between pairs of neurons with significant peaks in the CCG. In many examples the CCG peak lagged between one neuron relative to the other, consistent with a 1- to 2-ms synaptic delay. For other neuron pairs, the CCG peak is synchronous between the two neurons, suggesting that they may receive common input (Fig. 8a, top). Extended Data Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of spike–timing delays for 479 neurons from an example recording session. Nearby neurons are more likely to exhibit significant CCG peaks than neurons located further apart. Using this approach, we can map the full set of putative connections for a given recording across the cortical lamina (Fig. 8b).

Group means were compared using bootstrapping between nonsignificant pairs and significant, synchronous pairs (P < 10−4), between nonsignificant pairs and significant, asynchronous pairs (P < 10−4) and between synchronous and asynchronous pairs (P < 10−4). d, Relationship between signal correlation and peak value of CCG. e,f, Example putative connected cell pair identified using two probes in area AF (e) and ML (f) with putative feedforward connection. g,h, Example putative connected cell pair identified using two probes in area ML (g) and AF (h) with putative feedback connection. i, The population of functionally connected cells between AL and MF regions dominated by cells that respond to faces.

In addition to the cortical distance, we further assessed the dependence of CCG peaks on the tuning similarity between neuronal pairs for the data recorded in the visual cortex. For example, neuron populations with diverse RFs obtained from multiple visual areas (shown in Fig. 2) allow us to quantitatively determine the association between CCG peaks and RF overlap. Using signal correlation (rsig) as a measure of such tuning similarity in visual fields46, we showed that functionally connected neuron pairs exhibit higher rsig compared with nonsignificant pairs (Fig. 8c). Specifically, synchronous pairs (putatively receiving common inputs) tend to share highly overlapping RFs (rsig mean = 0.60, P < 10−4 compared with nonsignificant pairs), whereas asynchronous pairs are more likely to share moderately overlapping RFs (rsig mean = 0.43, P < 10−4 compared with nonsignificant pairs and P < 10−4 compared with synchronous pairs). Moreover, the amplitude of the significant CCG peaks is positively correlated with rsig (Fig. 8d), which is consistent with previous studies47,48.

This same methodology can be applied to assess CCG peaks between multiple simultaneously recorded regions recorded using separate probes to assess feedforward and feedback signaling between two regions. Figure 8e shows the jitter-corrected CCG for a pair of neurons where one neuron is located in face-patch ML and the other in face-patch AF in the IT cortex. Figure 8f shows a single-trial spike raster of the downstream neuron in area AF, triggered on spikes of the neuron in ML, illustrating a possible feedforward signaling, whereas Fig. 8h illustrates a putative feedback connection with opposite timing response from the cell pair shown in Fig. 8g. Remarkably, pairs of face cells were >10× as likely to have significant peaks in CCG (2.3%, 125 of 5,368 face cell pairs) as pairs where one or both cells were not face cells (0.15%, 18 of 11,912 other pairs) between the ML and AF (Fig. 8i).

We have presented a new recording technology and suite of techniques to enable electrophysiological recordings using high-density integrated silicon probes in rhesus and other nonhuman primates. This technology enables large-scale recordings from populations of hundreds of neurons from deep structures in brain areas that are inaccessible using alternative technologies. The key methodological advance in the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe is the longer recording shank, which required the development of techniques to adapt photolithographic silicon-manufacturing methods to allow for stitching across multiple reticles. Creating a long and thin probe shank also required developing approaches for reducing the bending that resulted from internal stresses within the shank.

This technology combines the advantages of multiple approaches—recording with single-neuron spatial resolution and single-spike temporal resolution—whereas the long shank length provides recording access to most of the macaque brain. Programmable site selection enabled recording from multiple brain structures using a single probe, as well as surveying multiple recording sites along the shank without moving the probe. The combination of the compact form factor, commercially available and turn-key recording hardware and modest cost per channel relative to technologies like the Utah array enabled straightforward scaling in the size of simultaneously recorded neural populations. These capabilities could be essential for achieving accurate estimates of neural dynamics on single trials or for estimating the value of small-variance neural signals embedded in the neural population response.

The high spatial resolution offered a number of advantages over sparser sampling, including high-quality single-unit isolation, ability to perform automated drift correction22,49 (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5) and localization of the position and depth of the recording sites within a brain structure (for example, inferring probe depth with respect to cortical lamina), using current source density or other features of the recording. The high density also offered additional potential advances such as identifying putative neuron subclasses using extracellular waveforms5,10,50.

Scaling up recordings using the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was straightforward by recording from multiple probes simultaneously. In the present study, we demonstrated recording from up to seven probes and scaling this approach further is realistic. In practice, if many probes were used within a single brain area, the recording yield could be lower than a simple linear scaling, because it can be challenging to optimize the probe placement and insertion geometry for each probe independently. In addition, it was comparatively more complex to prevent any single probe from encountering resistance when transiting the dura. Care should be taken when inserting many probes within a small region, particularly in superficial structures, and the subsequent recordings could exhibit lower neuron yield than anticipated, based on estimates from single-probe recording sessions. Even given this potential for reduced yield, this is still an excellent approach for recording very large populations of neurons.

Deep brain regions have historically received less attention as a result of the relative challenge of recording large numbers of neurons in these areas. The ability to conveniently record from many neurons is transformative, by enabling experiments that would be triaged otherwise, such as high-risk, high-reward projects, or simply additional control experiments. In addition to convenience, however, simultaneous large-scale population recordings from multiple structures make it possible to address questions that would not be possible otherwise, such as identifying communication between areas, for example, via communication subspaces51,52, or accurately estimating neural state on single trials53.

The recordings presented in this report have exhibited lower probe drift (often <10 µm) than recent Neuropixels recordings in humans, which can exhibit hundreds of micrometers of drift10,11. These demonstrations were performed in an operating room during neurosurgeries, which involved creating large craniotomies (sometimes ~30–50 mm in diameter) and reflecting the dura to expose the brain. Without the dura or the skull to mechanically stabilize the brain, changes in pressure from cardiac and pulmonary rhythms cause the brain to pulse, often by hundreds of micrometers. This rapid cyclical drift introduces a challenge for drift correction and spike-sorting algorithms, often reducing the neuron yield relative to a stable preparation.

This challenge is largely absent in many rhesus macaque recordings, which are most often performed with the dura intact, and often using a smaller craniotomy (often as small as 3.5 mm, although this size is not essential for enabling stable recordings). For superficial recordings, such as those in the motor cortex, we placed a blunt guide tube on the surface of the dura with gentle compression (~0.5 mm), which eliminated most residual pulsation. Furthermore, animal experiments have the luxury of additional setup time relative to human recordings in the operating room, which must take place within a 15- to 20-min window. In the present study, we began each experiment by waiting for up to an hour as the probe settled in the brain, which reduced the impact of slow drift from the tissue relaxing back after probe insertion. The commercially released version of Neuropixels 1.0 features two linear columns of recording sites, which is expected to further simplify algorithmic drift correction relative to the probe variant demonstrated here, which featured two zig-zag columns of recording sites.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe is now commercially available and integrates seamlessly with the existing set of community-supported hardware and software tools for Neuropixels probes. The Neuropixels recording system is straightforward to set up and integrate with other experimental hardware, such as behavior or stimulus control computers. Combining the low total system cost (roughly US$7,000–15,000) and large-scale recordings enables a dramatic reduction in the recording cost per neuron acquired relative to existing technologies.

Although highly capable, these probes are limited in several ways. First, this technology has not been optimized for simultaneous, dense sampling across a wide swath of cortex. For applications requiring horizontal sampling, planar recording technologies like the Utah arrays or 2P imaging may be more appropriate. Second, in contrast with many passive electrodes, it is not currently possible to use the Neuropixels probe to deliver intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), although future versions of the probe may add this functionality. The Neuropixels technology is, however, capable of recording while stimulating through external electrodes, as recently demonstrated by O'Shea et al.15. Third, the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP design is not explicitly optimized for chronic implantation. Although it is probably possible to leave the probe in place over multiple days or sessions, this possible capability remains untested and requires new implant designs. The probe base contains active electronics and is not designed for implantation under dura. As such, a chronic implant design may require mounting the probe in a manner that allows it to mechanically ‘float' with the brain, to prevent relative motion between the probe and the tissue as the brain moves. As such, this probe is most appropriate for acute recordings, although it could conceivably be implanted for subchronic (multiple-week) recordings with appropriate insertion methods and hardware. Last, although it is theoretically possible to insert the entire 45-mm-long shank into the brain, inserting a probe this deep introduces additional practical challenges to overcome—primarily a requirement for precise alignment of the probe's insertion axis with the insertion location.

Taken together, these methodological advances enable new classes of neuroscientific experiments in large animal models and provide a viable scaling path toward recording throughout the whole brain.

All surgical and animal care procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of each institution involved in the study, including Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe consists of an integrated base and ‘shank' fabricated as a monolithic piece of silicon using a 130-nm CMOS lithography process. The 6 mm × 9-mm base is mounted to a 7.2 × 23-mm2 printed circuit board (PCB), which is attached to a 7.2 × 40-mm2-long flexible PCB. This flexible PCB plugs into a ZIF connector on a headstage (15 × 16 mm2, 900 mg), which is connected to a PXIe controller mounted in an PXIe chassis using a 5-m twisted-wire cable. The base electronics, headstage, cable, PXIe system and software are identical to the Neuropixels 1.0 probe. Data collection was performed using SpikeGLX software (https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/) and the system is fully compatible with OpenEphys software.

The commercial release of these probes features recording sites distributed in two aligned vertical columns, in contrast to the ‘zig-zag' columns described in the present report, to optimize data collection for automated drift correction and enhance automated spike sorting. A third variant, identical to Neuropixels 1.0 in length, but with a thicker shank (122 µm versus 25 µm), is also now commercially available on special request.

Recording sites are 12 µm × 12 µm, made of titanium nitride and have an impedance of ±150 kΩ at 1 kHz. The tips of the probes were mechanically beveled to a 25° angle using the Narishige EG-402 micropipette beveler. During recordings, electrical measurements were referenced to: (1) the large reference electrode on the tip of the probe; (2) an external electrical reference wire placed within the recording chamber; or (3) a stainless steel guide-tube cannula. Electrical signals are digitized and recorded separately for the action potential band (10 bits, 30 kHz, 5.7 µV mean input-referred noise) and local field potential (LFP) band (10 bits, 2.5 kHz).

Recording sites are programmatically selectable with some constraints on site selection (see Extended Data Fig. 1 for a description of site-selection rules and common configurations). Spike sorting was performed using Kilosort 2.5 and Kilosort 3.0, and results were curated using Phy. Analysis was performed using customized scripts written in Matlab and Python, leveraging the open-source software package neuropixels-utils (https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils).

Several distinct methods were used to mount and insert probes, guided by the unique constraints of inserting probes to different depths and depending on the recording chambers and mechanical access available for different primates used in these studies, as well as the existing hardware used by each of four distinct research groups. For single-probe insertions, probes were mounted using customized adapters to a commercially available probe drive (for example, Narishige, Corp.) and inserted through a blunt guide tube for superficial recordings and a sharp penetrating guide tube for deeper recordings. When using a nonpenetrating guide tube, the dura was typically penetrated with a tungsten electrode before using a Neuropixels probe to create a small perforation in the dura to ease insertion. When inserting probes to deep targets (>20 mm), the alignment between the drive axis and the probe shank is essential for enabling safe insertion, because misalignment can cause the probe to break. For this application, we developed several approaches to maintain precise alignment of the probe and drive axis. First, we employed a linear rail bearing (IKO International) and customized three-dimensional (3D) printed fixture to maintain precise alignment of the insertion trajectory. This approach is discussed in detail in the accompanying Neuropixels 1.0 NHP wiki (https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki).

For the experiments shown in Fig. 4, we developed a dovetail rail system that maintains precise alignment between a penetrating guide tube and the Neuropixels probe. The choice of appropriate insertion method depends on the mechanical constraints introduced by the recording chamber design, the depth of recording targets, number of simultaneous probes required and choice of penetrating or nonpenetrating guide tube. The interaction of these constraints and a more thorough discussion of insertion approaches are provided on the Neuropixels users wiki (https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki). Open-source designs for mechanical mounting components for Neuropixels 1.0 NHP to drives from Narishige, NAN and other systems are available in a public repository: https://github.com/etrautmann/Neuropixels-NHP-hardware.

To minimize the impact of slow tissue drift during recordings, the Neuropixels probes were often inserted 150–300 µm past the desired target depth, then withdrawn by that amount and allowed to ‘settle' for 30–60 min before beginning an experiment. In addition, for superficial recordings in motor cortex, the probe was inserted through a blunt guide tube that was placed in contact with the dural surface and lowered by a small amount (~500 µm), gently compressing the dura to reduce the tissue motion resulting from pulse and respiratory rhythms.

In vitro noise measurements are performed in the standard, self-referenced configuration as described in the Neuropixels manual, with the reference and ground connected together and to a platinum wire electrode in a saline bath. The noise on each channel is measured by averaging Fourier power spectra from 5× 3-s-long sections of data and estimating the root mean square (r.m.s.) from the integral over 300–1,0000 Hz:

where P is the sum over the frequency range in the power spectrum, fs the sampling frequency and NFFT the number of points in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculation. Gain measurements were performed by connecting the probe ground and reference to the Faraday cage ground and a 1-mV, 3-kHz sine wave was applied to the saline bath through a Pt wire electrode. The amplitude of the sine wave on each channel was measured by averaging over a 15-Hz window about the 3-kHz peak in the Fourier power spectrum. Extended Data Fig. 2d shows the mean amplitude over channels versus bank; error bars = 1 s.d.

Two male adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, 11 and 16 kg), monkey T and monkey H, served as experimental subjects. Each animal was surgically implanted with a titanium head post and a cylindrical titanium recording chamber (30-mm diameter). In each animal, the placement of the recording chamber was centered at ~17 mm from the midline and ~7 mm behind ear-bar-zero, and a craniotomy was performed, allowing access to multiple visual areas in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). All surgeries were conducted using aseptic techniques under general anesthesia and analgesics were provided during post-surgical recovery.

We measured visual RFs by randomly presenting a single-probe stimulus out of either a 7 (H) × 11 (V) stimulus grid extending 18 (H) × 30 (V) degrees of visual angles (d.v.a.) (monkey T) or a 14 (H) × 17 (V) stimulus grid extending 26 (H) × 32 (V) d.v.a. (monkey H). The stimulus consisted of a drifting Gabor gratings (2° in diameter, 0.5 cycle per ° in spatial frequency, 4 ° s−1 in speed, 100% Michelson contrast) and was presented for a duration of 0.1 s. Monkeys were rewarded with a drop of juice if they maintained fixating at the fixation spot throughout the trial. Neuropixels data were collected using SpikeGLX. Spike sorting was performed using either Kilosort 2.0 (single-bank recording, monkey T) or Kilosort 3.0 (multi-bank recording, monkey H) and manually curated with Phy. For a given stimulus location, we obtained the neuronal activity by counting all the spikes during the stimulus presentation period, accounted for by a time delay of 50 ms. Neuronal RFs were defined as the stimulus locations that elicited >90% of the peak visual responses.

Details of the pacman behavioral task and experimental hardware presented in Fig. 3 are described in ref. 33. Three monkeys (M. mulatta) served as experimental subjects. In each, a head post and recording chamber were implanted over premotor and primary motor cortex using aseptic surgical procedures and general anesthesia. Placement of the chambers was guided using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The recordings in monkey C were performed using a standard 19-mm plastic recording chamber (Christ, Inc.), whereas monkeys I and J were implanted with customized, low-profile, footed titanium chambers (Rogue Research).

We conducted 13 sessions in monkey C and 10 sessions in monkey I, targeting sulcal and gyral M1 and PMd. On a subset of 15 sessions in monkey C, we also targeted GPi in the basal ganglia. In monkey J, we reported data from one session while simultaneously recording in GPi, SMA and M1.

For monkey C, the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was held using a standard 0.25-inch dovetail mount rod with a customized adapter to mount it to a hydraulic drive (Narishige, Inc.). A 21G blunt guide tube, 25 mm in length, was held using a customized fixture and placed over the desired recording location. The dura was then penetrated with a tungsten electrode (FHC, size E), which was bent at 27 mm to prevent the tip from inserting further than 2 mm past the end of the guide tube. This electrode was inserted manually via forceps, once or several times, as necessary, which also provided feedback on the depth and difficulty in penetrating the dura. The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was then aligned using the Narishige tower XY stage, lowered into the guide tube and carefully monitored to ensure that the tip of the probe was aligned with the dural penetration. This procedure sometimes took several attempts to find the correct insertion point, but was generally successful in less than a few minutes.

For monkeys I and J, the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was held using a customized fixture mounted to a linear rail bearing (IKO, Inc.). This apparatus was designed to enable close packing of many probes and to solve the challenge of precisely targeting structures deep in the brain without trial and error. The linear rail is mounted in a customized, 3D printed base, which mounts directly to the recording chamber. The geometry of the 3D printed base component determines the insertion trajectories and prevents mechanical interference between the probes and the chamber. This base also provides support for either sharp or blunt guide tubes, as required. In general, blunt guide tubes were preferred, but if necessary sharp guide tubes were sometimes used when the dura had become thicker and difficult to penetrate. The linear bearing was connected to a commercial drive system (NAN, Inc.) via a ~50-mm-long, 508-mm stainless steel wire, which provided rigid connection between the Nan drive probe mount and the Neuropixels probe mounted on the rail bearing, while allowing a small amount of misalignment between the drive axis and the insertion axis. This apparatus greatly simplifies the procedure of using many probes in a small space, while not relying on commercial drives to provide the mechanical rigidity required to safely insert a delicate probe. Additional details on the customized hardware are provided in the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP user wiki: https://github.com/etrautmann/Neuropixels-NHP-hardware.

Spike sorting was performed using Kilosort 2.5 and manually curated using Phy. Principal component analysis trajectories were calculated after smoothing spikes with a 25-ms Gaussian kernel and averaging across successful trials. Rastermap was run with default parameters after normalizing trial-averaged neural activity. An offline force model prediction performance was computed using a 50-ms time lag between arm force and neural activity. Neurons were randomly subselected and 80% of trials from six target conditions were used to train a linear regression model in Python, using scikit-learn, whereas the remaining 20% of trials were used to calculate model performance. Ten iterations were performed for each level of neurons retained. Probe drift calculations were performed using KS 2.5.

Details of the collection and analysis of the data presented in Fig. 7 are described in ref. 44. Two monkeys (M. mulatta, 8–11 kg) served as experimental subjects. In each, a head post and two recording chambers were implanted using aseptic surgical procedures and general anesthesia. Placement of the LIP chamber was guided by structural MRI. The SC chamber was placed on the midline and angled back 38° from vertical in the anterior–posterior axis. The decision task is a dynamic, random dot motion (RDM) discrimination task. A schematic of the task is displayed in Fig. 7a and its description can be found in the corresponding figure legend. A second (control) task—an oculomotor delayed response task—was used to measure the response fields of neurons in LIP and SC, described in the legend for Fig. 7c.

We conducted eight recording sessions in which activity in the LIP and SC was recorded simultaneously. In the LIP we used a single Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe, yielding 54–203 single units per session. In the SC, we used 16-, 24- and 32-channel V-probes (Plexon) with 50- to 100-µm electrode spacing, yielding 13–36 single units per session. In each session, we first lowered the SC probe and approximated the RFs of SC neurons using a few dozen trials of a delayed saccade task. As our penetrations were approximately normal to the retinotopic map in the SC, the RFs of the SC neurons were highly similar within a session. We proceeded only if the center of the RFs was at least 7° eccentric to ensure minimal overlap with the motion stimulus.

If the RF locations in the SC were suitable, we then lowered the Neuropixels probe into the LIP through a dura-penetrating, stainless steel guide tube (23G) at 5 µm s−1 using a MEM microdrive (Thomas Recording) that was attached to a chamber-mounted, three-axis micromanipulator. Custom-designed adapters were used for mounting the Neuropixels probe on to the drive (wiki: https://github.com/etrautmann/Neuropixels-NHP-hardware). Once the target depth was reached (~10 mm below the dura), we allowed 15–30 min of settling time to facilitate recording stability. To precisely measure RF locations in both areas, the monkeys performed 100–500 trials of the delayed saccade task and LIP neurons with RFs that overlapped those of the SC neurons were identified post-hoc. Finally, the monkeys performed a reaction-time RDM discrimination task until satiated (typically 1,500–3,000 trials).

Neurons in both areas were sorted using Kilosort 2.0 and manually curated in Phy. We restricted our analysis of the LIP data to neurons with RFs that overlapped those of the simultaneously recorded SC neurons (164 of 1,084 total LIP neurons). Spike trains were discretized into 1-ms bins and convolved with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 25 ms) to produce the single-trial activity traces depicted in Fig. 7d,e.

Two monkeys (M. mulatta) served as experimental subjects. Each animal was surgically implanted with an MRI-compatible Ultem head post and a large rectangular recording chamber (61 at 46-mm diameter, 65 at 50-mm diameter and 58 at 61-mm diameter, respectively), covering most of the animal's acrylic implant. Monkeys were trained to passively fixate on a spot for juice reward while visual stimuli of 5° size, such as images of faces or objects, were presented on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen (Acer). We targeted face patches ML and AF (monkey 1) and face-patch AM (monkey 2) in the IT cortex for electrophysiological recordings. Face patches were identified using functional (f)MRI. Monkeys were scanned in a 3T scanner (Siemens), as described previously56. MION contrast agent was injected to increase the signal:noise ratio. During fMRI, monkeys passively viewed blocks of faces and blocks of other objects to identify face-selective patches in the brain. During electrophysiology, monkeys viewed two stimulus sets: one consisting of the same stimuli shown during fMRI, consisting of faces and nonface objects, with 150 ms of ON time and 150 ms of OFF time (Fig. 4c,e), and a stimulus set consisting of a monkey face alternating with a lemon every second, without any blank period (Fig. 4b).

Before targeting fMRI-identified face patches with Neuropixels probes, we performed scout recordings with tungsten electrodes with 1-MΩ impedance (FHC) using grids designed with the software Planner57. While inserting tungsten electrodes, we performed structural MRI to confirm correct targeting (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we performed a total of 72 Neuropixels insertions. To perform very deep recordings (for example, 42 mm from the craniotomy; Fig. 4d), we lowered a cannula holder to touch or gently push the dura. The cannula holder contained a short cannula to penetrate the dura. A probe holder, which held the probe, was slid through the cannula holder via matching dovetails. This dovetail mechanism was designed to ensure that the direction of probe movement matched the direction of the cannula, because even small differences in angles would risk breakage of the probe when inserted deeply into the cannula. The probe holder was advanced using an oil hydraulic micromanipulator (Narishige), but, importantly, the precise direction of probe movement was constrained by the dovetail between the probe holder and cannula holder rather than the micromanipulator.

Neuropixels data were recorded using SpikeGLX and OpenEphys and spikes were sorted using Kilosort 3.0. To compute responses for Fig. 4c,e, average spike rates from 50 ms to 250 ms after trial onset were computed and baselines, averaged from 0 ms to 50 ms after trial onset, were subtracted.

Functional interactions between pairs of neurons were measured with an established crosscorrelation method. CCGs were calculated using spike trains from pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, during either the whole stimulus presentation period or the intertrial intervals. The CCG is defined as:

where M is the number of trials, N the number of time bins within a trial, \({x}_{1}^{i}\) and \({x}_{2}^{i}\) the spike trains of neurons 1 and 2 from trial i, t is time, τ the time lag relative to the reference spikes and \({\lambda }_{1}\) and \({\lambda }_{2}\) the mean firing rate of the two neurons, respectively. \(\theta (\tau )\) is a triangular function calculated as \(\theta (\tau )=N-\left|\tau \right|\) which corrects for the overlapping time bins at different time lags. A jitter-corrected method was used to remove correlations caused by stimulus locking or slow fluctuations:

where CCGoriginal and CCGjittered are CCGs calculated using the above equation, with the original dataset and the dataset with spike timing randomly perturbed (jittered) within the jitter window, respectively. The correction term (CCGjittered) captured slow correlation longer than the jitter window (caused by common stimulation or slow fluctuation in the population response), so, once it's subtracted, only the fine temporal correlation is preserved. A 25-ms jitter window was chosen based on previous studies6. Only well-isolated single units with a firing rate of at least 1 Hz were included for CCG.

As with previous studies6,13, in the present study a CCG is classified as significant if the peak of jitter-corrected CCG occurred within 10 ms of zero time lag and if this peak is >7 s.d. values above the mean of the noise distribution (CCG flank).

Neuron centroid positions were estimated by computing the 2-d average of the channel locations of channels on which the spike appears (defined by the Kilosort spatial template for that unit), weighted by the amplitude of the spike on each channel. This calculation is performed using the neuropixel-utils library available online (https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils).

The main purpose of the present report is to demonstrate the technical viability of a new recording technology. For many of the analyses presented here, standard statistical tests were used. The spike–timing correlation analyses used standard approaches that were used in refs. 6,13. For all experiments, animals were trained on the task before any recording. Eight adult male M. mulatta animals were used in the results presented here, with data presented for two animals for each of the four example use cases (multiple visual areas, M1, LIP and IT cortex). No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size for each experiment.

The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment, but the analysis was largely automated, reducing the influence of subjective judgments. In most cases, blinding was not relevant to the technical proofs of concept that we present in this report. Spike sorting was conducted primarily using automated spike-sorting algorithms (Kilosort 2.5 and 3.0), followed by some minimal manual curation and inspection of cluster isolation quality. This manual step was performed by different individuals in different labs, but none of the results presented here are highly sensitive to the individual choices made during spike sorting.

For most experiments, datasets from specific sessions were excluded from further analysis if large-scale probe movement precluded automated spike sorting with Kilosort, but this happened only occasionally and was not a frequent occurrence. The stability recording results presented in Figs. 3–5 are intentionally not statistical arguments, because the stability of any given recording is much more highly determined by the details of the experimental prep and the condition of the implant and tissue. The fraction of datasets with poor recording quality or excessive drift is probably not generalizable to other preparations. Instead, our purpose was to illustrate that highly stable recordings are achievable in multiple brain areas with relative ease. Similarly, we make no statistical claims about the expected yield of neurons recorded on a probe in a given session; instead we present several observed values from these datasets. We feel that this is important because accurate neuron counts remain subjective if manual curation is performed.

Tours of electric vehicle factories have quickly become the hottest ticket in Beijing, with tens of thousands of people signing up each month for the chance to win a free visit. Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi, which has reinvented itself as an EV maker in recent years, started offering the one-hour tours in January to visitors interested in seeing its factory up close and getting a race car experience in a Xiaomi EV.

As Chinese EV brands expand from competing on low prices to promoting premium features and sleek designs, they are increasingly putting their factories in the spotlight. At least two Chinese EV brands, Xiaomi and Nio, offer regular tours for the general public this year, and three more automakers have announced plans to follow suit.

“More and more Chinese EVs are using factory tours as an important channel of communication between the brand and the outside world. It offers a chance to not only see the production line up close, but also experience the human side of the brand,"" says Freya Zhang, a research analyst at the investment consulting firm Tech Buzz China, who has been organizing tours for foreign investors to visit Chinese electric vehicle startups for two years.

People who have visited the Xiaomi factory say they were struck by the amount of automation on display. The company says that the overall automation rate at the factory has reached 91 percent, with some production lines like casting fully automated.

“The factory is huge with only a handful of workers. As I stood there watching, it was all robotic arms doing the work. The robots were all running pre-set programs—picking up parts from one place and delivering them to another, all in a very orderly manner,” says Yuanyuan, a Beijing resident who took her 13-year-old daughter on the Xiaomi tour last month. Yuanyuan says she had been applying to get tickets since January, but since the limited spots are awarded on a lottery basis, she was only finally able to secure them in May.

The EV factory tour trend is not entirely new: Chinese companies have long opened their manufacturing plants to potential investors, entrepreneurs, and groups of young students, but they haven't become a universal tourist attraction until now. Like Coca Cola, Ben & Jerry's, and other household names in the West, some Chinese EV brands have become so popular that the idea of getting a behind-the-scenes look has become exciting to a wide range of Chinese consumers. Many of the tourists aren't even potential carbuyers but are just there to marvel at the industrial robots as a weekend activity.

Zhao Mingfei, a Beijing resident, says he first learned about Xiaomi's tours by watching livestream broadcasts by the company's founder, Lei Jun, whose charismatic personality and annual motivational speeches have turned him into a celebrity in China. Zhao says he has long admired the CEO and owns a number of Xiaomi consumer gadgets. He tried to sign up for a tour in January immediately after registration opened, but didn't get a spot. In February, however, he was one of 60 lucky people selected from more than 7,000 applicants, according to a screenshot he shared with WIRED of the reservation system.

Xiaomi released its first EV model, the SU7, in early 2024. By the end of the year, foreign diplomats, investors, and guests from other Chinese companies had already started arriving at the company's factory in Beijing to participate in one-off tours, but the company didn't create a standardized experience for the public until the start of 2025. At first, Xiaomi offered just three tours with 20 participants each per month.

But the excursion proved incredibly popular, and Xiaomi quickly began scheduling significantly more slots. In July, the company said it will offer one tour every weekday and six tours most weekends, accommodating more than 1,100 visitors in total. When July registration opened, however, over 27,000 applications flooded in overnight, according to the Xiaomi app—so the chances of snagging a ticket remain slim.

Those lucky enough to secure a spot can expect to first be taken to an exhibit hall to learn about notable innovations in Xiaomi's electric cars. The visitors then hop on a shuttle and go into three working production lines out of six total to observe the workers and robots in action.

Afterwards, they can test ride a model Xiaomi SU7 on a racecourse, where a trained racecar driver demonstrates how the car can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds. “It felt awesome—takes off really fast, with an instant kick,” Zhao tells WIRED. Recently, Xiaomi also started selling affordable meals at the factory and souvenirs to complete the experience.

Another visitor notes that the shuttle will temporarily stop if it gets in the way of a robot, which is programmed to do its job on a strictly timed schedule and is thus less flexible than a human worker. Yuanyuan recalls that after the tour ended, her daughter remarked: “I need to study harder, otherwise I won't be able to find a job in the future. It'll be robots doing all the work.”

Xiaomi's factory is a prime example of how Chinese companies are quickly evolving from labor-intensive manufacturing to highly automated manufacturing, thanks to new advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. In recent years, the Chinese government has been heavily promoting the idea of “lights-out factories” that require no human labor, meaning the machines can toil away in the darkness without anyone needing to turn the lights on. Companies that have managed to achieve this high level of automation, from Foxconn to home appliance giants, have turned their factories into marketing opportunities, inviting humans to marvel at the technology rather than do work.

Nio, another leading EV maker in China, has been publicly showcasing one of its highly automated factories since late 2023. In 2024, over 130,000 people visited the factory, where certain production lines like the body shop have achieved 100 percent automation, according to a statement sent by the company. Zhang says when her latest tour group visited Nio's factory in the city of Hefei last month, the participants were able to view three out of the four production lines. (The car painting process, however, was excluded from public visits.)

“What's immediately noticeable is that there are very few workers on the production lines. On some lines, there are actually more industrial robots than people,” says Zhang. “But we have yet to see any Chinese factories employ humanoid robots.”

At Nio, the guided tours also serve as a customer loyalty perk in addition to a marketing tool. Unlike Xiaomi, which requires people to apply for a ticket but offers the experience free of charge, Nio's tours require prospective visitors to register through an app and pay 1,000 “Nio points,” equivalent to about $14. Users can pay for the points or acquire them for free by using the Nio app regularly, which means that people who regularly interact with the brand potentially get a free tour.

Nio and Xiaomi are part of a new class of Chinese automakers who are adopting tactics from tech startups in order to better reach and engage younger customers directly, says Zhang. In addition to opening up their factories, they are finding small ways to establish their brand identity.

At BYD's headquarters, for example, visitors are given coffees with latte art depicting the names of BYD's different car models. BYD, Nio and Xiaomi have even organized tours for elementary school students to visit. “That's surely a way to cultivate potential consumers from a young age,” Zhang says.

A visit to one of Unifi's last remaining US polyester plants, in Yadkinville, North Carolina, can make you feel like an optimist.

After driving through a sweet little neighborhood of small homes, you crest the hill and see the Unifi facility on your right: giant silver-gray buildings perched on a tidy, gently rolling lawn that looks like an advertisement for organic milk. A small solar farm sits off to the side, and 18-wheelers branded in grass-green and sky-blue livery pull in and out of the property, dropping off clean PET plastic flake and picking up shipments of polyester fiber.

This is the flagship factory where one of the world's most popular so-called sustainable fibers is manufactured: polyester made from recycled plastic bottles. In the last 18 years, more than 42 billion bottles have flowed globally through the owned and partner facilities of Unifi and been turned into a branded polyester fabric Unifi calls Repreve.

Unifi pioneered this eco-friendly fabric, but today it is far from the only recycled polyester maker. According to Textile Exchange, an industry group that has been pushing the fashion industry to commit to recycled polyester, the apparel industry used 32 million metric tons of polyester fiber in 2019, and approximately 14 percent of this was recycled. That's the equivalent of almost 16 billion bottles a year.

Unifi is unique in one sense, though. Traditionally, polyester manufacturers are hidden in the back of fashion's supply chain. They sell to fabric mills, which sell to garment factories, which sell to brands, which sell to you. But Unifi is special; not only does it have a strong relationship with brands, the brands brag to shoppers about using Repreve in their garments.

Follow the green and blue ceiling decor as it swishes through the all-white, modern lobby of Unifi, past the recycling and compost receptacles, and into a large meeting room, and you'll see some of the wares created with Repreve: Ugg fuzzy slippers, Rothy's ballet flats, Nike sneakers, Levi's stretch jeans, a Patagonia fleece, a Quicksilver fuzzy camouflage hoodie, a North Face jacket, and an Asics sports bra.

Plastic bottles destined for recycling.

Repreve's promise to brands and shoppers is that turning bottles into fiber reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60 percent when compared to virgin polyester fiber, and water consumption by up to two-thirds. Unifi and its brand partners (like the ones I saw in the showroom, and more) also claim to keep old water bottles from going to landfills, incinerators, or the ocean.

It's because of this promise that this Unifi factory survived the Great Offshoring of textile manufacturing, and the onslaught of cheap Chinese polyester.

Not everyone agrees recycled polyester is part of a better future. Nike is one of Unifi's biggest customers and has bragged that the sportswear brand alone diverts more than one billion plastic bottles a year from landfills and waterways. In May of 2023, a Missouri consumer filed a greenwashing lawsuit against Nike, alleging in part that the recycled polyester in Nike's shoes and shirts isn't actually sustainable. The lawsuit was dismissed, along with a similar complaint against H&M, but it expressed a bubbling resentment against corporations that use recycled polyester to green up their image without addressing the many other forms of environmental and human damage of plastic fashion.

Bottle-to-polyester recycling, once thought to be a key tool in combating our global plastic pollution problem, has been under fire for a few years. “We've been led to believe that recycled and sustainable are synonymous, when they are anything but,” Maxine Bédat, executive director of the New Standard Institute, a nonprofit pushing for a sustainable fashion industry, told The Guardian in 2021. (When I asked her if she stands by that statement today, she said yes.)

I'm here in Yadkinville because I wanted to see this operation for myself and decide: Is recycled polyester actually sustainable? Or, as many now claim, is it greenwashing, a get-out-of-jail-free card for brands who want to look like they're saving the planet while going on with their toxic, fossil-fueled business as usual?

Over the past two years, that question has morphed into an even more fraught one: Does this factory provide the kind of good, safe factory jobs that Americans say they yearn for, and that Trump's proposed tariffs purport to bring back to our shores?

Unifi CEO Eddie Ingle may look like one of the North Carolina good ol' textile boys—gray hair parted to the side, a neat button down and slacks—but he has a clipped Irish accent, visits the farmers market on Saturdays, and drives a Tesla. He started out as an entry-level mechanical engineer in Ireland, moved to North Carolina in 1987 to join Unifi, and ended up staying for 40 years, with just two years away, before returning in 2020 to take the helm as CEO.

His paternal pride in his workforce can seem vintage.

“The Unifi people, they are just good North Carolinians,” he tells me over a lunch of fried chicken and mashed potatoes in an old farmhouse that Unifi owns, and which serves as a sort of bed and breakfast for visiting fashion professionals. “They're conscientious, they're hard-working. A lot of our managers have been here 25, 30 years.“ (A third of the company's workforce has been there that long, in fact.) “It's clean, it's safe, and there's a lot of room for advancement. We have good wages, we offer nice benefits.”

“Certainly the labor force has changed a lot over the last 40 years since I've been here,” he adds.

North and South Carolina together used to be a leading global textile hub. The White Oak mill of Cone Mills was once the largest denim mill in the world, and it operated for over 100 years in Greensboro, less than an hour from Unifi's headquarters.

The floor of a Unifi factory, where plastic bottles are processed to create synthetic yarn fiber.

Like many textile plants across the Southeast, Cone‘s White Oak mill is closed now, one of the many casualties of the great textile offshoring of the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are still a few textile and dye manufacturers around the Carolinas, but the bustling fabric industry in the Greensboro area has given way to pharmaceutical plants, dog food factories, and Amazon warehouses delivering Chinese-made goods.

According to a (yes, self-mythologizing but extremely detailed) history book that Unifi gave me, through the late '90s, Unifi was known as a fiercely competitive innovator that went from win to win, absorbing smaller polyester companies and going public. It was the place to work, a relief from the heat of North Carolina's tobacco and cotton farms.

A lot of Unifi's growth, according to its history book, came from its salesmen convincing brands to try synthetics for an increasing array of products, from drapes to automotive carpeting and military tents. You could make the argument that Unifi is partly responsible for the plasticization of fabrics. Today, polyester makes up more than half of all fashion textiles produced worldwide.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, China was a huge market for Unifi. Unifi says that it and one of its biggest competitors, Macfield (with which it would later merge) were together shipping a million pounds of polyester a week to China. But, the company says, by 1985 China had greatly expanded its own synthetic manufacturing capacity, and slapped tariffs on American polyester. The tide began to shift to the other shore.

The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994, and when China joined the WTO in 2001, a flood of cheap fabrics crashed into the United States. ""Between 1997 and 2009, more than 650 textile plant facilities closed in the United States,"" notes the Textile Heritage Museum in Burlington, North Carolina. Unifi's history book says of the 115 American polyester manufacturing companies in the 1970s, only 12 remain in business as of 2022, when the book was published.

The Chinese government was financially supporting the growth of its textile industry; it became impossible for American polyester producers to compete. “They were selling below raw material costs,” former president Tom Caudle told the company's biographer. “For the next five to seven years we couldn't shut plants down fast enough and consolidate fast enough to keep up.”

Unifi survived, though it shrank and laid off hundreds of employees, closed several plants, and stopped trying to compete with China's cheap polyester. Instead, it sources PET resin, then melt-extrudes it and does what is called texturing, covering, and twisting to turn it into high-end, functional fabrics that have built-in features like water repellency or fire retardancy. Still, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan have a way of copying our innovations, and then doing them with as much skill, for cheaper.

About 70 percent of that polyester is now made in China.

It was around 2000 that Unifi discovered the fabric that would save its business. It was trying to recycle some bad runs of polyester that would have normally gone in the trash. Even after mixing in virgin PET flake, the experimental product from Unifi and other mills was at first low quality and manila-folder yellow, only suitable to be dyed and put into a fuzzy fleece, and that is where it went. (Both PolarTec and Patagonia had launched their recycled polyester fleece in 1993, though it's unclear if they launched it together in a partnership.)

Repreve yarn.

After years of work to create a process that would purify the waste flake so it could be made into a high-quality, white polyester thread, Unifi debuted Repreve at the Outdoor Retailer show in 2004. After a few years, it took off.

Fashion brands did not need much convincing to switch to Unifi's new fabric. It had the sheen of sustainability without the unreliability of cotton (a seasonal crop with human rights issues) or the stigma of wool (which draws the ire of animal rights activists). It also came with a ready-made marketing story, literally—Repreve products are sold with a green hang tag in the shape of a water bottle that will sometimes even say how many used bottles went into that particular product.

Ingle says the fashion brands Unifi works with “don't have to compromise anything” when they choose Repreve for their garments. “They might have paid a little bit more, but the quality of the product is in many ways better.”

While rumors of fake recycled polyester dog the industry overall, Repreve is also infused with a proprietary chemical tracer, so the material can be tested to ensure it was actually made in a Unifi facility of old bottles.

Since Repreve was launched, it has grown to make up 30 percent of Unifi's revenue. Sold at a premium price, it's been a bright spot for Unifi even when overall demand for fashion and fashion materials has fallen into a global post-pandemic slump. In February 2024, Unifi told investors it would cut costs and focus on Repreve to shore up its finances.

“I'm fairly convinced we wouldn't be where we are today without it,” Ingle says of Repreve. Usually, the textile business is seen as dirty and outdated. But the Repreve factory in North Carolina buzzes with new machinery and young engineers. “You can attract people when you're in the sustainability business,” he says.

Seen up close, Repreve seems like a win for the environment and a win for American jobs. “Brands like Adidas, Nike, Patagonia, The North Face, they've got all these big commitments around sustainability. If they didn't have a regional secure supply of recycled yarn, there would be a lot of businesses that would just be moved to Asia,” Ingle says.

But once you step outside the factory, the picture gets muddy.

When Coca-Cola first introduced its PET plastic bottle in 1978, Unifi's founder Allen Mebane worried the beverage industry would take up all the supply of PET resin. Instead, 20 years later, the opposite has happened, with polyester plants buying up the supply of used water bottles. Forty to 60 truckloads of plastic waste get dropped off at Unifi's bottle processing plant per week, bought from material recovery facilities as far away as Michigan and Maine.

In 2023, the CBC did a high-profile investigative piece into fashion's greenwashing, and focused most of its critique on recycled polyester. “If you're using plastic bottles, you're actually taking bottles out of a potentially closed-loop recycling system, and then giving them a one-way ticket to a landfill disposal,” George Harding-Rolls, a sustainable fashion advocate, told the CBC.

But most bottles aren't being recycled anyway. The collection rates for PET plastic started rising around the time Unifi debuted Repreve, hitting 30 percent in 2012 and hovering around there for a decade. Meanwhile, demand for recycled PET from both the fashion and packaged food industry, who have both committed to sourcing recycled material, has soared. It's expected to outpace supply by 2030.

“You know who's complaining about it? The bottle companies,” Ingle says. “Because they believe the textile industry is taking their bottles.”

“Is that true?” I ask.

“Well, yeah,” he laughs. “The market for recycled bottles is very transparent. The price of recycled bottles changes twice or sometimes three times a week. So if you want to buy a bottle and turn that bottle back into a bottle, have at it. Nobody is stopping the bottle industry from doing that.”

Well, there is one thing. Unifi's willingness to pay more for old bottles, because it's turning them into a premium product that brands and consumers will pay more for, may be driving the market rate of old water bottles up. But nobody wants to pay more for a soda in a bottle made with recycled plastic.

A Unifi manufacturing plant.

When I tour the bottle processing plant, large bales of crushed plastic packaging, each averaging roughly 1,000 pounds, are lined up, ready to be run through the sorting, cleaning, and flaking process. There's a clear difference in quality between the clean and uniform bales from states like Michigan, Maine, Vermont, and New York that mandate deposits of a few cents on bottles to incentivize collection, and the chaotic and dirty bales from states that treat recycling as a purely volunteer activity.

North Carolina made it illegal to throw out plastic water bottles in 2009, but despite pleas to supply local industry with material so it can create jobs, a 2021 report put the state's PET recycling rate at a measly 8 percent. Ingle thinks if North Carolina passed a bottle bill that levied a 5- or 10-cent deposit on each bottle, Unifi could get everything it needs from within its borders. “Unifi is involved at the state level in various efforts to increase the recycling rates of PET post-consumer bottles,” he later wrote by email.

So what we seem to have is not a demand problem, but a supply problem born of bad government policy.

Kirstie Pecci, executive director of Just Zero, a nonprofit that works across the country on waste issues, sees all bottle recycling—no matter what they are made into—as more insidious. “You're giving cover to a bad practice, which is putting beverages or food in plastic. We should not be drinking or eating out of plastic in any way, shape, or form.”

And what about claims that turning bottles into polyester locks PET into a landfill-bound product? Sure, some polyester clothing is for all intents and purposes a single-use product. (Hello, ugly $7 polyester dress bought off of Instagram.) But not the PETA-approved recycled polyester fill inside my well-loved puffy hiking jacket, the knit uppers of my Nike running shoes, or the recycled polyester yoga leggings that I can't bring myself to get rid of because they still look perfect after seven solid years of use.

Polyester, for all its faults, does perform. It's lightweight, durable, impervious to water, and increases the durability of any garment it is in. Is it overused? Yes, of course. Polyester baby onesies are an abomination. But I can't imagine doing serious outdoor activities like camping, jogging, or snowboarding without synthetics of some sort.

As I've reported, the fashion industry has been looking for a way to recycle polyester garments into polyester fabric, instead of relying on bottles to make more raw fabric. Unifi has been recycling preconsumer waste polyester fabric into polyester fabric for over a decade, for The North Face. It has a textile take-back program in the US, and last year expanded its textile-to-textile recycling to its plants in China. But this is almost completely repurposed factory waste.

The barriers to recycling post-consumer polyester into polyester are almost completely out of Unifi's control. Post-consumer polyester fashion is almost always mixed with other materials and hung with zippers and trims. And according to Meredith Boyd, Unifi's chief product officer, it is often dyed, printed, and finished with substances that would become so toxic if they were run through the high-temperature recycling process that doing so would be an OSHA violation.

Last year, H&M announced that it is committing to buy $600 million of recycled polyester over seven years from Syre, a Swedish startup that chemically recycles polyester by breaking it down into monomers and then remanufacturing it. Syre says it will open its first pilot plant by the end of this year, and build more plants with the aim of producing 3 million metric tons of circular polyester in a decade, including a gigascale plant in Vietnam in 2027.

When I ask, Ingle says he is excited for the new chemical recycling technologies coming up, because Unifi can buy that recycled raw material and spin it into fiber. “It took 50 years to build out the virgin infrastructure. It won't take 50 years to build out the chemical recycling infrastructure, but it's going to happen and we're going to be right there,” he says.

The plastic flake that is eventually processed into Repreve recycled polyester.

There are legitimate questions about whether the Unifi plant can be considered a clean and green workplace.

In the bottle processing plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, drifts of plastic particles, like snow banks, are piled in every nook of the machinery that chops the bottles into flake. When I ask our tour guide, a floor manager, if he worries about breathing it in, he says he doesn't. ""We do a good job of cleaning it up,"" he says, adding that the bags of dust that are vacuumed up are sold off, and the wastewater is filtered.

But I'm concerned. A 2023 study of a UK plastics recycling plant found that even after the installation of state-of-the-art filters, around 6 percent of the plastic being processed was released into the wastewater as micro and nanoplastic, while the air around the facility was full of microplastics small enough to be hazardous to human health.

Scientists are still puzzling out what microplastics do to our health, but one study found that people with IBS tended to have more microplastics, including PET and polyamide (of which nylon is one type), in their gut. While PET seems to be one of the most benign out of all the plastics, at least two studies have found BPA, a hormone-disrupting chemical, in polyester baby clothing, and a number of brands agreed to a settlement with California lawmakers in 2023 over the presence of BPA in polyester athletic shirts.

In addition, water utility managers in Reidsville have alleged that Unifi and other polyester manufacturers could be potentially be sources of 1,4-dioxane, a probable human carcinogen, in the Cape Fear watershed, which provides drinking water for over 1 million people as it flows from central to southeast North Carolina. Technically, that's not illegal (especially since Unifi, along with other industrial sources and several towns, successfully lobbied against a North Carolina rule limiting 1,4-dioxane in wastewater). Because 1,4-dioxane is a byproduct of manufacturing PET resin, the EPA declared in late 2024 that almost any exposure to 1,4-dioxane constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health of polyester workers and surrounding communities. There are (very costly) ways to treat wastewater for 1,4-dioxane, so how ensuing regulations would affect Unifi remains to be seen, especially since the EPA doesn't currently seem keen to do any regulating of toxic chemical exposure.

Ingle and Boyd both declined to speak in detail about these issues. In person, they cited the advice of Unifi's counsel (BPA), said Unifi follows all regulations (1,4-dioxane), or pled ignorance (microplastics). Follow-up questions to Boyd went unanswered. Ingle responded to follow-up questions via email by writing, “We maintain active participation in The Microfibre Consortium, in order to support academic and industry research into the source and impact of fiber fragmentation from textiles into the natural environment.” And “We are compliant with all local, state, and federal regulations for all of our sites.”

To advocates, each micro-scandal is proof that there is no environmentally friendly polyester. “We can't do this sustainably in a nontoxic way, it's literally impossible,” Pecci says.

But I left the Repreve plant wondering if we're letting perfect be the enemy of good American jobs. Polyester will continue to be in demand, and it will either be made here in a compliant factory using recycled sources, or abroad in a sketchy factory using fresh petrochemicals. Pecci says she doesn't want to “call out that company or those people, because they might be the nicest people in the world doing the best they can with what they have.” She described for me a utopia in which nontoxic and natural clothing is all made here and then composted and recycled here. Sounds gorgeous, and impossible.

In February of this year, Unifi announced it was closing its Madison, North Carolina, polyester processing plant. It would ship some of its machinery to its Latin American plants, and offer the Madison employees new job opportunities at the Yadkinsville and Reidsville plants, which remain in service.

For now, anyway.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Taiwan Is Rushing to Make Its Own Drones Before It's Too Late","https://www.wired.com/story/taiwans-rush-to-make-its-own-drones-before-its-too-late/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

In the span of just a few years, drones have become instrumental in warfare. Conflicts in Ukraine, Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh, Sudan, and elsewhere have shown how autonomous vehicles have become a quintessential part of modern combat.

It's a fact that Taiwan knows all too well. The island nation, fearing imminent invasion from China, has both the need, know-how, and industry necessary to build a robust and advanced drone program.

Yet Taiwan, which has set an ambitious target of producing 180,000 drones per year by 2028, is struggling to create this industry from scratch. Last year, it produced fewer than 10,000.

“Taiwan definitely has the ability to make the best drones in the world,” says Cathy Fang, a policy analyst at the Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology (DSET).

So why doesn't it?

Fang and her colleagues published a lengthy report on June 16 that reveals just how sluggish Taiwan's drone industry has been. According to their research, the country has produced between 8,000 and 10,000 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the past year, with “structural challenges” standing in the way of the current rate and the ambitious goal. Their study found that Taiwan's drone production has been stymied by “high manufacturing costs, low domestic procurement, and minimal foreign government orders.”

Fang and other DSET researchers briefed WIRED on the details of their report in their Taipei offices in May.

Taiwan has lived under the threat of Chinese invasion for decades, but recent years have turned it into a more immediate possibility. Beijing has made clear that it intends to complete its aggressive modernization of the People's Liberation Army by 2027; Taiwanese officials say invasion could come that early but almost certainly before Premier Xi Jinping's current term in office ends in 2029.

While there are competing views about what form, exactly, Chinese military aggression could take, military analysts in Taiwan fear it could be a full combined arms onslaught: From air and sea at first, followed by a full land invasion.

That means Taiwan has an imperative to come up with innovative solutions to defend itself, and fast. As one American commander remarked in 2023, Taiwan's self-defense will mean turning the Taiwan Strait into a “hellscape”—bombarding incoming Chinese ships and planes with swarms of uncrewed aerial and naval vehicles. This strategy doesn't need to destroy the considerable Chinese navy and air force outright, but it does need to frustrate Beijing's advances long enough for Taiwan's allies to rally to its defense.

Taipei is already doing some of this right. In 2022, the government launched the Drone National Team, a program meant to match government and industry to scale up the nascent field. In particular, the team was dispatched to learn lessons from Ukraine, whose defensive strategy has relied heavily on small, tactical, cheap UAVs capable of carrying out multiple missions and integrating closely with ground units. Today, the country boasts a massive domestic drone industry, with Kyiv planning to buy 4.5 million small drones this year, on top of its long-range uncrewed missile program, its autonomous land vehicles, and its uncrewed naval drones.

But Ukraine also shows the disadvantage at which Taiwan finds itself. In a secret workshop in Kyiv, a Ukrainian drone maker told WIRED that he had no choice but to source his antennas and chips from China. Taiwanese chips were too expensive.

“We are not able to compete with DJI,” Fang says, referring to the massive Chinese drone manufacturer.

Other countries that have scaled up their drone programs recently have accepted Chinese technology in their supply chain—either as an asset or a necessary evil. But Taiwan, for obvious reasons, is leery of including any Chinese tech.

That makes drone manufacturing hard. China maintains a massive advantage in producing certain critical pieces of these UAVs—including the gimbals, optical sensors, and antennas. To buy that equipment, Taiwan needs to find allied suppliers, often at considerable cost.

Taiwan has even had difficulty leveraging its advantages. The country has an advanced battery industry, for example—but it's heavily reliant on Chinese critical minerals. The island nation also boasts the world's most impressive semiconductor industry: It produces 60 percent of the world's semiconductors and 90 percent of the advanced semiconductors. But, Fang says, Taiwan does not produce any chips specifically for use on drones.

“Taiwanese drone makers are buying chips from Qualcomm and Nvidia, but those chips are not specifically for drones,” she says. “Those are communication chips, sensor chips, those are for more general use.” And even those general chips are significantly more expensive than their Chinese competitors, sometimes by a factor of 10.

“We definitely have the ability to make them,” Fang adds. “But the reason why these companies are not involved in this market is because the scale is just too small.”

It's a catch-22: Taiwanese companies can't increase production and reduce costs until they get more orders, but they can't get more orders because their costs are too high.

“We need more government procurement from Taiwan itself,” Fang says. Thus far, the nation's defense ministry has ordered fewer than 4,000 drones, although it plans to purchase tens of thousands more in the years to come. It owes to the fact, analysts say, that financing the kind of defense spending that Taiwan needs remains politically difficult. Earlier this year, opposition lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan passed a budget that slashed planned defense spending.

If Taiwan's industry has any hope of growing by the scale the country needs, Fang says there's a clear answer: America.

DSET has a number of recommendations, both for Taiwan and America, on how to establish this ambitious new industry. For starters, they argue, America needs to start actually supporting Taiwan's local industry.

To date, no Taiwanese drone manufacturer has secured access to the Department of Defense's “blue list”—its roster of trusted drone suppliers. Earning a spot on that list could mean millions or billions of dollars in orders from the Pentagon.

There has been some trade in the other direction. The US has supplied Taiwan with about 1,000 drones, mostly the smaller AeroVironment Switchblade loitering munition as well as a small number of the MQ-9 Reaper long-range drones.

The US has also been shipping some novel technology to Taiwan, including access to its Replicator Initiative: an autonomous drone swarm capability designed to find and destroy targets at sea.

But, DSET argues, some of these capabilities have been more a product of what the US thinks Taiwan needs. Washington could be more effective if it developed partnerships with Taiwanese industry, DSET contends, and make longer-term decisions about what Taipei needs for its self-defense. Finally, DSET writes, Washington should drop its tariffs—on Taiwanese UAVs, at the very least.

Taiwan itself has even more work to do. DSET recommends establishing a more detailed roadmap for what capabilities it wants and needs and how it intends to get there. While plenty of focus will be on the small, first-person-view drones—the kind increasingly ubiquitous in conflicts worldwide—Taiwan will need to expand into other kinds of technology.

While Taipei has identified a wide range of capabilities it hopes to acquire, DSET found it has been mostly procuring smaller surveillance drones.

Both Russia and Iran have recently shown how long-range uncrewed vehicles can be made at scale and significantly cheaper than traditional missiles. Perhaps more importantly, the DSET report argues, Taiwan needs to be able to plug into American needs and procurement programs—and America prioritizes longer-range systems.

The preponderance of these drones has also heightened the need for defenses, particularly around electronic warfare. Taipei is investing in anti-drone systems, Fang says, but it remains an “emerging concept.” (A defense analyst told WIRED that Taiwan is simply “not prepared to fight in a complex electromagnetic environment.”)

One of the weak points in China's invasion will be its landing crafts. Beijing has been feverishly building a fleet of barges that would be able to transport troops and tanks across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has been developing domestically made submarines with the hope of sinking those barges before they arrive—that capability would be augmented significantly by autonomous or uncrewed submersibles.

Ukraine has pioneered its own models of semiautonomous uncrewed naval vehicles, which have successfully sunk Russian warships and damaged the Kerch Bridge in Crimea.

As Western nations get ambitious about how to mass-produce cost-effective and high-impact defense strategies, many are looking toward uncrewed vehicles as a silver bullet. But, as Taiwan shows, this is all easier said than done.

If Taiwan gets this wrong, DSET argues, “Taiwan risks falling into a gray zone of limited interoperability and unscalable production.” Meanwhile, “the US risks failing to develop trusted regional manufacturing capacity at the speed required to compete with China's drone diplomacy and defense exports.”

It may seem like an insurmountable challenge, especially for a nation facing an existential threat from a much bigger neighbor. But, as Fang points out, Ukraine was in the same situation. “Ukraine? They didn't even imagine that kind of capacity three years ago,” she says. But a “sense of survival” kicked in, and Kyiv stood up the world's most impressive indigenous drone manufacturing industry.

Taipei “is, right now, in low mode,” Fang says. “Because we are still not at war. But I don't want to underestimate our capacity, even though we are in a peacetime.”

Zubaida starts her day at eight in the morning, sorting discarded plastics, glass, and chemicals with her bare hands, to collect items she can sell. With waste-segregation centers in this part of East Delhi currently shut down, she and other waste-pickers from the Seemapuri slum work outside by a dusty road through the hottest hours of the day, under the blazing sun. There is no fan or shade. With Delhi's heat wave season here, they are constantly exposed to intense high temperatures.

On June 11, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for Delhi, warning of a high risk of heat illness and heat stroke. Temperatures that week pushed beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) across northern India, with the real-feel temperature, which factors in how humidity augments the effects of heat, spiking at an alarming 54 degrees Celsius. Prolonged exposure to such high heat can raise a person's body temperature to dangerous levels. It's potentially fatal.

In the face of this inferno, the IMD advised people to avoid going outdoors during the daytime, and markets and streets were deserted during the day. But even when extreme heat strikes, Delhi's large, informal workforce continues to work. Street vendors, rickshaw pullers, and waste pickers have reported dizziness, infections, breathing difficulties, and persistent fatigue during recent heat waves. “We cannot stop,” says Zubaida. “We earn each day to eat each day. If we miss a day, we miss a meal.”

At present, heat action plans (HAP) are India's primary approach for managing heat waves and keeping essential services running. Developed annually by state, district, and city governments—the Delhi government released its citywide HAP for 2025 in April—these plans are designed to help cities prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme heat. And they're not working.

This has driven nonprofits and research organizations to show how HAPs can be improved—with one key idea being to use geographic information systems (GIS) that combine satellite imagery with local data to provide cities with a granular, building-by-building views of their heat. Action plans, often plagued by generalization, can then be tailored to better protect those at the highest risk.

Places like Ahmedabad and Tamil Nadu have seen falls in heat-related illnesses and deaths since introducing their plans (Ahmedabad's was the first to be implemented in India, back in 2013). But with most HAPs there are still major gaps when it comes to their implementation, coordination, and funding. A 2023 study found that 95 percent of HAPs do not have detailed mapping of heat-prone areas or vulnerable populations. Without this kind of granular data, it becomes difficult to allocate resources where they are needed most.

What is still missing is a hyperlocal targeted response to risk, says Radhika Khosla, associate professor at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. She explains that heat risk is really the intersection of three things: the hazard—where temperature and humidity are highest within different city regions; exposure—which communities are most exposed to heat; and their vulnerability—factors like socioeconomic status, health conditions, levels of outdoor work, access to electricity, and the conditions of the built environment. Right now, most plans aren't collecting and analyzing this sort of data, Khosla says. “Often where the actions are taken may not be where the most vulnerable are.”

Heat doesn't just differ between cities; it varies significantly within them. The urban heat island effect—the phenomenon of cities being hotter than surrounding rural areas—is often discussed at the city scale, but what isn't understood well enough is how differently it is felt at ground level. A slum settlement with a tin roof can be about 6 degrees Celsius hotter than a nearby independent house with a garden, even though they are both on the same street. The way heat is absorbed, trapped, and felt can shift block by block, depending on land use, construction materials, density, and the presence or absence of green cover, says architect and climate researcher Ujjvala Krishna. Because heat is granular, city-level HAPs are too broad to provide solutions that are specific to the most vulnerable.

To understand just how local heat stress can be, Krishna and her team at the nonprofit Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) conducted a study in a ward in north Bengaluru of just two square kilometers. That ward has a mix of land use and building types—high-rise apartments, low-income informal settlements, large independent houses, old industrial zones, and commercial areas. “Because the built environment and green cover were so heterogeneous, we saw land-surface temperature differences of up to 9 degrees Celsius within the same ward,” Krishna says.

Krishna and her team at ATREE first plotted the different land uses within the Marappanapalya ward in north Bengaluru.

They then used satellite imagery to map surface heat across the ward, and investigated how this correlated with land use.

“And that is exactly how most cities are built,” Krishna says. Urban land use is shifting rapidly, and large plots are being converted to high-rise towers, which increases density, reduces airflow, and traps heat for more people in a smaller area.

Delhi's 2025 heat action plan made some progress towards addressing the data gap. It included high-resolution, ward-level land surface temperature maps that identified the city's most heat-vulnerable areas—neighborhoods that are also lacking basic infrastructure to cope with extreme temperatures. However, the quality and application of that data remain limited. “It's a step forward, but GIS and remote-sensing analysis still need to be more advanced to influence decision-making,” says Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, senior program manager of geoanalytics at WRI India, an independent research organization that works with India's local and national governments.

Palanichamy points out that many land-surface temperature maps currently used are based on satellite datasets originally designed for agricultural monitoring, which might not be calibrated for complex multi-use urban landscapes. They may be incapable of the specificity needed to support targeted interventions in a city like Delhi.

To try to better capture that variability, SEEDS, a Delhi-based disaster-preparedness nonprofit, along with Chintan, a nonprofit working on waste management and livelihoods, have used GIS mapping of indoor heat risks across homes in low-income settlements in Delhi, located near landfills and industrial zones, and inhabited by waste pickers.

A Delhi heat map created by SEEDS and Chintan using maximum land surface temperatures for the month of May, 2013–2021. The team then used this map to identify high heat density areas to target with hyperlocal interventions.

They used an artificial intelligence model called Sunny Lives—built by SEEDS and Microsoft—to assess indoor heat risk across different types of buildings. “Our model looks at how heat is experienced inside individual homes,” says Anshu Sharma, cofounder of SEEDS. “If the outside temperature is 40 degrees Celsius, a house with a tin roof can reach 45 degrees Celsius indoors. And that's where the most vulnerable people—infants, elderly, and the unwell—are stuck during the hottest times of the day.”

SEEDS and Chintan also calculate the wet-bulb temperature, a measure that combines heat and humidity to indicate the effectiveness of evaporative cooling—or in human terms, sweating. The higher the humidity, the higher the wet-bulb temperature, and the less effective sweating is at keeping someone cool—meaning they are more likely to experience heat stress.

The team tracked conditions in homes topped with tin roofs, tiles, plastic sheeting, and concrete to figure out which are at the highest risk of extreme indoor heat. “That trained the model to recognize patterns, which we then combined with satellite imagery to identify roof types and building materials at scale. We can now assess indoor heat exposure for individual buildings even without installing sensors for similar geographic locations.”

A Sunny Lives assessment of a dense Delhi neighborhood. In this example, the AI has highlighted all houses in the neighborhood at low-risk from heat.

Sharma believes this kind of micro-level resolution should guide the next generation of heat action plans in India. “We now have the tech to zoom in down to individual buildings and clusters, and it's available and affordable. The same temperature doesn't impact everyone the same way, and our planning has to reflect that,” he says.

“What we need are ward-level plans, because that's the smallest administrative unit where the nuances of heat can actually be addressed,” Krishna says. At that level, resources can be better allocated, responsibilities assigned to local bodies, and interventions coordinated with residents' welfare associations, slum group associations, hospitals, and schools. She also suggests building a heat vulnerability index to take stock of everyone in the area based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status and identify the most vulnerable groups.

“The more granular your data, the more targeted your response can be,” Krishna adds. Instead of generic advisories like “drink more water,” localized data could drive specific actions: change market or factory hours, deploy cost-effective heat shelters, or set up oral rehydration solution stations in high-footfall areas. “If you know who's most vulnerable, you can act faster,” she adds.

But as Delhi goes through another searing summer, against a backdrop of rising heat-related deaths and increasing climate stress, many of the relief measures already promised by the government—such as placing 3,000 water coolers in public places, altering timings of construction work, and building daytime shelters for outdoor workers and homeless people—are yet to be carried out.

This year, the heat feels even more unbearable for Zubaida. “My blood pressure drops, I get splitting headaches,” she says. Frequent and prolonged power cuts in her neighborhood also mean there's little respite at home. “We need proper shelter and some shade to work under.”

Part of the problem is that heat action plans aren't legally binding, says Tamanna Dalal, a senior research associate at the New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, an environmental research organization. “Heat waves aren't recognized as state-specific disasters in most parts of India,” she explains. “Right now, only about eight states have formally declared heat waves as disasters. This means that local authorities aren't obligated to prioritize heat action unless they get direct rapid response guidelines during the heat wave from higher levels.”

The national government also doesn't recognize heat waves as “notified” disasters, meaning they can't trigger financial assistance under the country's disaster-management legislation.

As a result, whatever measures are taken tend to be short term and reactive. Temporary measures like school closures ordered by the education department or oral rehydration solution stockpiling orders by health departments are being repeated each year. But these measures don't do anything to build structural resilience for cities to adapt to worsening heat conditions.

It is ultimately about building more heat-resilient cities that can adapt and mitigate simultaneously, while integrating heat with other policy goals such. as energy, water, job creation, and air quality, explains Khosla.

Some of the funding pathways already exist. “We found that 18 centrally sponsored schemes have direct linkages to long-term solutions listed in HAPs, like piped water supply, rooftop solar, et cetera,” says Dalal. But many local officials don't know these resources are available. A recent amendment to India's national disaster mitigation fund now helps states finance heat-related actions but awareness remains very low. India is still in the early stages of heat planning in the country, and large-scale capacity building is urgently needed to help implementers see heat as a chronic threat in a warming world.

“We are soon reaching the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is going to be irreversible,” Dalal says, referring to the targeted limit for global warming set out in the Paris Agreement, which the world is almost certain to break. “This will impact every aspect of our daily lives. The next few years are critical in implementing some of the long-term solutions, because they take years to implement and even longer to have an impact.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Donald Trump and Sean Hannity Set Off a Wave of Disinformation After Iran Bombing","https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-sean-hannity-disinformation-iran-bombing/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:33:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump and his most vocal supporters have been using disinformation, fake videos, and mental gymnastics to try to spin the US military's bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites as a complete and total victory that signals the end of a war instead of the beginning.

On Saturday night, with the B-2 stealth bombers that dropped a dozen GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs on the Fordow underground nuclear facility just beginning their flights back to the US, Trump declared the mission a complete success.

But rather than relying on information from his own intelligence agencies, satellite imagery, or on-the-ground reporting, Trump instead posted on Truth Social a screenshot of an X post from an anonymous account that claims to conduct open source intelligence investigations.

“Fordow is gone,” the account, which lists the website of a Zionist clothing company in its biography, wrote, providing no further information. Trump followed this up by claiming in a press conference that Fordow had been “completely and totally obliterated.”

It immediately became clear that the triumphant declarations were likely premature, with Trump's own military officials pushing back against his assessment. “It would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there,” said General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Israeli military officials told The New York Times that while the facility had sustained significant damage, it had not been destroyed. Additionally, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that most of the highly enriched uranium at the Fordow facility had been moved before the bombing, while the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency told The New York Times that the highly enriched uranium previously stored at the Isfahan facility had been moved before it was targeted by US strikes.

Trump's early declarations of success on Truth Social set the tone, though—and appear to have inspired others. Fox News host Sean Hannity, among the loudest proponents for bombing Iran in recent weeks, posted the same phrase the account Trump screenshotted did—”Fordow is gone”—on his Instagram account, alongside a video of a massive explosion. (After WIRED published this story, Hannity appeared to have deleted the post.)

The video, however, does not show Fordow and is instead of a December 2024 Israeli strike on a missile base in Tartous, Syria. Hannity's post, which remains on the platform, had been viewed more than 5 million times as of Monday morning.

That same video and other obviously fake videos have been shared widely on platforms like X, Facebook, and TikTok, with accounts also claiming they show explosions at Fordow. In some cases, users on X asking Grok to verify the footage have been told by X's AI-powered chatbot that the footage is real—even though it is not.

Despite the pushback from his own military, Trump has continued to claim that the Fordow facility had been destroyed. “Obliteration is the accurate term,” Trump wrote on Sunday evening in a Truth Social post.

Trump's effort to frame the bombing as a decisive end to Iran's nuclear ambitions, while heavily disputed by arms control experts, was picked up by supporters who claimed the bombing raid had effectively ended any potential conflict.

“Nobody is celebrating war,” right-wing commentator Dave Rubin wrote on X on Sunday morning. “People are celebrating the end of war.” Pro-Trump commentator Ben Shapiro hailed Trump's actions as historic on his YouTube channel: “President Trump was never going to start world war three … he played this absolutely perfectly … President Trump was not dragged into a war, he managed this with absolutely stunning professionalism.”

However, just hours later, Trump raised the possibility of an extended military engagement in Iran when he suggested replacing the current leadership in a post on Truth Social.

“It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!,” Trump wrote. Trump's suggestion came after his own vice president, secretary of defense, and secretary of state had all declared that the bombing raid had nothing to do with regime change.

A MAGA cohort had warned for weeks that any attempt to replace the Iranian government would lead to a protracted war that would see US troops on the ground in the Middle East getting involved.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist who had repeatedly voiced his opposition to war with Iran, appeared to make a U-turn on Sunday evening in response to Trump's “regime change” post.

“A bottom-up revolution rises from the will of the people,” Kirk wrote on X. A top-down regime change is engineered by elites and the intel community. One is organic, the other is orchestrated, forced … President Trump is talking about an organic uprising.”

Kirk was mocked by other right-wing influencers for his U-turn. “Oh now it's TOP DOWN US led regime change that your [sic] against,” influential podcasters Keith and Kevin Hodge, wrote on X in response to Kirk. “Not just regular old regime change. We get a new and improved regime change sponsored by the intel community and defense contractors!”

While some of the loudest opponents to engaging in military activity in Iran—such as Tucker Carlson—have yet to comment on Trump's suggestion of regime change, many have criticized the weekend's incidents.

“American troops have been killed and forever torn apart physically and mentally for regime change, foreign wars, and for military industrial base profits,” US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote in a lengthy diatribe on X after the bombings. “I'm sick of it.”

Meanwhile, Alex Jones, the school-shooting conspiracist and Pizzagate conspiracy promoter who filed for bankruptcy in 2022, said Trump's regime change comments would drag US troops into the conflict.

“Now Trump joins in, essentially calling for regime change, that's called sleepwalking us into total war, not what we voted for,” Jones said on his Infowars show on Sunday night.

On Monday morning, Trump himself indicated that the fallout from the US bombing raid may continue for some time, writing a post apparently in response to speculation that Iran will close one of the world's busiest oil shipping channels, the Strait of Hormuz.

“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, before adding: “To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","International Nuclear Watchdog Issues Stark Warning in Wake of US Iran Strikes","https://www.wired.com/story/international-nuclear-watchdog-warning-iran-strikes/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:08:54 GMT","

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in an emergency meeting on Monday that the escalating conflict in Iran “risks collapsing the global nuclear nonproliferation regime” and that if diplomacy is not pursued, “violence and destruction could reach unimaginable levels.”

The IAEA, the United Nations' international nuclear watchdog, convened the emergency meeting following US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites this weekend. In remarks delivered to the organization's board of governors, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, called for a “return to the negotiating table” to allow inspectors for the agency to safely assess damage to the sites and check in on Iran's nuclear stockpile.

Iran has maintained to the IAEA that no additional radiation has been monitored at the sites throughout the duration of the attacks. IAEA inspectors have not been able to inspect the sites since the crisis began earlier this month.

“IAEA inspectors are in Iran, and they are ready,” Grossi said on Monday. He added that “no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow,” but he expected that the strikes did “very significant damage.”

Fordow, a centerpiece of Iran's nuclear program and a uranium enrichment facility, was one of three sites struck by US bombs this weekend. Fordow has nearly 3,000 centrifuges stored some 90 meters underground. It was unclear as of Monday morning just how much damage the strikes did to the Fordow site, although some of the damage was visible from satellites. Natanz, another enrichment facility, as well as an important nuclear research facility near the city of Isfahan, which operates three small research reactors, were also attacked. (Israeli forces had also previously targeted Isfahan.)

It is unclear just how much nuclear material has been destroyed thus far. Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists and a member of the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, tells WIRED that it's likely that Iran, acting on probable intel about the strikes, moved its enriched uranium to different sites a few weeks ago. A political executive at Iran's state TV network said Sunday that all three sites had been evacuated before the attacks began. Experts also told WIRED that satellite imagery of Fordow from last week showed a lot of activity at the site, including trucks driving in and out.

Grossi told the IAEA board Monday that Iranian roreign minister Abbas Araghchi had sent a letter to him on June 13 claiming that the country would “adopt special measures to protect nuclear equipment and materials.”

“In my response, that same day, I indicated that any transfer of nuclear material from a safeguarded facility to another location in Iran must be declared to the agency as required under Iran's safeguard agreement, and I expressed my readiness to work with Iran on this matter,” Grossi said.

Grossi told The New York Times that he believed that Iran had moved much of its stockpile of enriched nuclear fuel.

The idea of attacking facilities working to develop nuclear power might immediately bring to mind the worst images of disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima. But experts say that even if the strikes hit crucial materials, bombing uranium enrichment sites is not likely to yield a large-scale nuclear catastrophe. Despite concerns about widespread radiation, the IAEA maintains that it doesn't “expect that there will be any health consequences for people or the environment outside the targeted sites,” Grossi said in a previous update issued Sunday.

The biggest current environmental risk from these sites, the IAEA says, is local. Uranium enrichment facilities contain toxic gases and chemicals, similar to what would be stored at any large industrial chemical plant.

The material in enrichment facilities, Wolfsthal says, “is not yet to the point where it can reach a chain reaction where it can sustain a large-scale nuclear explosion.” (The IAEA estimates that Iran has a stockpile of enriched uranium up to 60 percent—not yet high enough to make a nuclear weapon, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The IAEA did report in January that it had found a small amount of substantially more enriched uranium at the Fordow site.) Wolfsthal compares the damage that strikes on sites like Natanz can cause as analogous to a car accident.

“There's gasoline in your car,” he says. “You have a collision with your car or an accident, you might have a fire, it might even explode. There's some toxic material that might get released. But it's going to be fairly limited damage.”

There's a chance, he adds, that the attacks on Isfahan could have damaged casks holding uranium hexafluoride gas, a radioactive chemical compound, which could spread around the area. But damage from such an explosion is likely to be limited in scope.

""It's just a big, heavy gas molecule, so it's not going to go very far,"" Emily Caffrey, the director for the Health Physics Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News.

There is one facility in Iran that could cause significant damage if it is hit. Iran's only commercial nuclear reactor is located near the city of Bushehr; the site contains thousands of kilograms of nuclear material undergoing chain reactions to produce fuel. (Research reactors, like the ones at Isfahan, use much less fuel than commercial reactors and operate at much lower temperatures, making them less dangerous in the event of an accident.) In comments delivered a day before the US strikes, Grossi said that a strike on the plant “could result in a very high release of radioactivity to the environment.” The Israeli government said last week that its own strikes had hit Bushehr, but Israeli officials later walked back these claims.

“In my technical assessment, attacking a nuclear reactor is really, really, really, really dumb,” Wolfsthal says.

There is also a larger, more long-term environmental threat at hand: the chance that Iran takes final steps following these attacks to actually build a nuclear weapon.

“It is not lost on anybody that Israel and the United States both have nuclear weapons and have attacked Iran, that does not,” Wolfsthal says. “Russia has nuclear weapons and Ukraine does not. North Korea, which has nuclear weapons, is sitting pretty. The message here is nuclear weapons bring you security and immunity and empower you to take action against your adversaries. That's a very dangerous message that we're sending to countries that were on the cusp of nuclear options and might decide now to pursue them.”

Grossi's remarks on Monday echoed this concern.

“One thing is certain, and this is the simple truth: We will not be safer if there are more nuclear weapons in more states around the world,” he said.

Google's adding a slew of AI features to its productivity-focused Chromebook Plus line of devices, including a screen selection tool for search and text capture, a tool that explains complex text, and NotebookLM.

The new screen selection tool works similarly to Google Lens and the “Circle to search” feature in Chrome on smartphones: long-press the launcher button or use the screenshot tool to select what is on your screen, and Google will instantly search for it. The tool also lets you select text and quickly add an event to the calendar.

Last year, Google added a new “Quick Insert” key to some Chromebook Plus models that let you trigger shortcuts. Users can now access Google's AI image generation features with this key, as well as AI-powered writing tools.

Meanwhile, the new “Simplify” feature lets you use AI to explain, simplify or summarize any text you have selected. 

Google's also giving all new Chromebook Plus users one year's subscription to the Google AI Pro plan, which includes access to the Gemini app; video editing tool Flow; image-to-video creation tool Whisk; Gemini in Gmail, docs and Chrome; and 2TB of storage. The AI Pro plan otherwise costs $240 per year.

Alongside these features, Google is launching two exclusive AI features for Lenovo's new Chromebook Plus 14: One uses AI to recommend tab and document organization, while the second lets users edit images using the Gallery app to remove backgrounds or make stickers. 

Lenovo's new Chromebook comes with an OLED touch screen, and runs on an ARM-based MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip. It comes in 12GB and 16GB RAM variants, costing $649 and $749, respectively.

Aflac, one of the largest insurance companies in the United States, says hackers stole an unknown quantity of its customers' personal information from its network during a cyberattack earlier this month. 

The insurance giant confirmed Friday in a legally required filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the company identified hackers in its system on June 12 and contained the incident. Aflac, which provides supplemental insurance to individuals whose expenses are not covered by their primary providers, said it was not yet known how many customers are affected by the data breach but that the personal data includes customers' claims, such as Social Security numbers and health information.

The breach also included data from Aflac's beneficiaries, employees, and agents, the company said.

Aflac said its systems were not affected by ransomware, but attributed the breach to an unspecified cybercrime group known to be targeting the U.S. insurance industry. According to its Friday press release, Aflac said the hackers used social engineering tactics to break into its network. 

An Aflac spokesperson, who did not provide their name, declined to answer TechCrunch's questions when reached by email on Monday.

Aflac, which has around 50 million customers per the company's website, is the latest U.S. insurance company to experience a cyberattack in recent weeks, amid warnings that hackers are targeting the wider insurance industry. 

John Hultquist, the chief analyst for Google's threat intelligence unit, said last week that the unit was “aware of multiple intrusions” in the U.S. that bear the hallmarks of activity linked to Scattered Spider, a loose-knit collective of hackers and tactics that rely on social engineering tactics and sometimes threats of violence to target company help desks and call centers in order to gain access to their networks.

The hackers are also reportedly behind the recent intrusions at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies, which disclosed cyberattacks this month, with disruption ongoing.

The hackers linked to Scattered Spider attacks are known to be financially motivated and have been previously linked to cyberattacks and intrusions at tech giants, casinos, and hotels, and recent data breaches across the U.K. and U.S. retail sector.

Two U.S. senators have requested that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate Spotify due to allegations that the company bundled its music streaming and audiobook services into a more expensive subscription without obtaining user consent, while also reducing royalty payments to creators in the process.

On Friday, June 20, U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn and Ben Ray Luján wrote a letter to the FTC, claiming that Spotify converted standard premium subscriptions into higher-cost bundled subscriptions without informing consumers. They also highlighted that existing U.S. regulations permit digital music providers to pay a reduced music royalty rate if the subscription is bundled with other legitimate offerings.

“Spotify's intent seems clear — to slash the statutory royalties it pays to songwriters and music publishers. Not only has this harmed our creative community, but this action has also harmed consumers,” the letter states.

Last year, the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) sued Spotify for allegedly undercompensating songwriters and publishers, but the lawsuit was dismissed in January.

In March 2024, Spotify restructured its Premium tiers to include 15 hours of audiobooks, raising the price to $12 for individuals and $20 for families. Users have to manually opt out of the plan. 

This change has reportedly caused publishers to lose $230 million in the first year, according to Danielle Aguirre, executive vice president of the National Music Publishers' Association.

In a statement shared with Variety, a Spotify spokesperson noted that users were notified a month in advance about the price increase and the platform offers “easy cancellations as well as multiple plans for users to consider.”

New York governor Kathy Hochul announced Monday that her state will host a large new nuclear power plant designed to generate at least 1 gigawatt of electricity.

“If you take nuclear off the table, you have to burn more fossil fuels,” Hochul said at a press conference. “That's not going to work for us here in New York.”

The governor is directing the New York Power Authority (NYPA), which owns and operates two dozen power plants — mostly dams and gas turbines — to develop the new facility. The plans are still in their infancy: NYPA, a state government entity, has yet to pick a location or a design.

Hochul said the state will work with private partners to develop the power plant  and will finance construction while buying the power it generates.

Among the sites under consideration are three nuclear plants currently operating in upstate New York, according to the Wall Street Journal. All of them are owned by Constellation Energy, which has been wooing tech companies to purchase output from its nuclear portfolio.

Microsoft and Meta both currently have deals with Constellation: Microsoft is reopening a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in a $1.8 billion project, while Meta is buying the clean energy attributes of the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois in a deal that is reportedly worth billions of dollars. Amazon recently signed a deal with Talen Energy to buy nearly 2 gigawatts of nuclear in Pennsylvania.

But the nuclear industry still faces some potential headwinds. No new nuclear power plant has broken ground in the U.S. in over 15 years.

The most recent large-scale nuclear power plants in the U.S. have blown through deadlines and exceeded budgets by billions. Small modular reactors, which many startups are pursuing, promise to address those concerns by leveraging mass manufacturing, but the commercial viability of the technology remains untested until a few are built.

Hochul said that the success of the project will depend on regulatory and permitting reform at the federal level. Previous large nuclear power plants took years to complete the process. “The barriers are in Washington,” she said.

Nuclear power has received renewed interest as tech companies and data center developers scour the grid for new sources of power. It has also become a rare point of agreement between Democrats and Republicans, suggesting that the nascent nuclear renaissance might refresh the nation's aging nuclear fleet.

“If we don't get on board, it'll pass us by,” Hochul said.

Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, or NYK Line, is acquiring Germany's salary payment platform for seafaring workers, Kadmos, as it seeks to further expand the reach of its fintech services in the maritime sector. 

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the acquisition deal, which is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.

MIT alumni Justus Schmueser and Sasha Makarovych founded Kadmos in 2021, aiming to provide businesses, including shipowners and ship management companies, with affordable and transparent options for transferring salaries internationally, specifically for seafaring workers.  

In 2019, NYK launched a financial services platform called MarCoPay in Manila, the Philippines, offering loans and insurance for Filipino seafaring workers and their families. Since then, it has collaborated with shipowners and ship management companies, and has even acquired an Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) license from the Philippine central bank.

NYK approached Kadmos for the acquisition in line with its plan to grow its digital payment business beyond the Philippines. It plans to incorporate the Kadmos platform into MarCoPay, providing payroll solutions to seafaring workers of all nationalities. 

“Our plan is to leverage Kadmos' global reach and coverage while using advantages that MarCoPay has in the Philippines,” Makarovych told TechCrunch. “Beyond that, we are planning to use the NYK brand and reputation to grow faster in shipping and sign customers quicker – they are a widely respected brand globally recognized by the whole industry.”

Kadmos also plans to expand its capabilities beyond payroll to offer cross-border B2B payments and corporate cards. The company intends to expand its remit to also service the cruise industry, and wants to offer additional financial services for shipping companies and seafarers through a partnership with NYK, Makarovych added.

Makarovych said Kadmos' team will stay with the company, with slight adjustments to the management structure.

There are several digital payment platforms available for maritime companies, such as MarTrust, ShipMoney and Brightwell. 

Makarovych, however, thinks Kadmos stands apart thanks to its end-to-end reach, listing as examples its features that let companies operate completely cashless on vessels, including virtual point-of-sale devices and peer-to-peer transfers.

“Our cards are non-personalized and have the widest acceptance, which allows companies to roll out Kadmos to their ships very quickly without complicated card logistics,” Makarovych said. “Kadmos pricing is built in an extremely flexible way, allowing companies to cover fees for their crew in a very personalized way while staying compliant with regulations by the Maritime Labor Convention — our competition simply charges a monthly SaaS fee.”

Kadmos most recently raised a $29.5 million Series A round in 2022. The round brought Kadmos' total capital raised to $38 million. It now has more than 40 enterprise customers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:ycombinator.com","Framework for Skill Learning","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44352574","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 05:39:48 GMT","

Structure:
Structure is mainly the context, background, and organization of knowledge. It helps point you to what you need to pay attention to. It also lists out the different sub-categories or sub-skills within the skill. 
Depending on the breadth of the skill you may have many sub-skills if you choose a broad skill like writing, or few if you choose a narrow/specific skill like social media writing for finance executives looking to build personal brand online.Technique:
Techniques are the meat where people often focus the most.
It is the what / who / when / how. 
Techniques are mostly rule based, and can be complex. 
However, diving straight into techniques when just starting out could be misleading as you haven't figured out all the components.Resource:
Resources play a much bigger role than most people think. 
Resources can be both public, and private.
Knowing where to find valuable resources when you need them is the biggest differentiator between an experienced and a rookie. 
For a programmer, this might be the Github. 
For a designer, this might be Canva. 
And the ultimate goal is to build a private resource pool that you own.The three parts reinforce on each other. For anybody looking to learn a new skill, this could be a useful framework to have before you dive - especially in the age of AI. You can prompt these to ChatGPT or Claude and let it teach and guide you each step, greatly reducing the time of learning.

First, what's the point of this post? You mention few extremely generic areas of learning without any actual meat to it. What is the framework that you suggest?Second, in my experience, learning depends heavily on both a learner and a skill being learned. Beyond some common sense observations (like learning by doing, having some plan, setting goals etc.) there is no point in generalizing and overthinking the learning process itself.Because what works ""on average"" with hi probability wouldn't work for you (unless the skill being learned and you are both perfectly average in all relevant parameters).

Whilst this may be good to avoid brain-rot, it eliminates much of their social needs in many cases.A balance is required, but that needs parents to actually pay attention and not just leave them to isolate themselves (with their phone) into their room.

There's a chasm between legalize and banning. Banning would prevent the compassionate use that has already been allowed. This banning is a knee-jerk reaction to those that have found the loop hole carved out in the compassionate use limits still allow for enough THC that recreational use can still be achieved. Rather than restricting the loop hole to still require prescription, they instead want to ban out right

There's some inertia. For a long time, being against cannabis legalization went hand in hand with being ""tough on crime"". A politician coming out in support of it ran a high chance of being called ""soft on crime"" by their opponents. There can also be a racial edge due to people who primarily see crime and cannabis as minority-driven problems.

This is a bit like saying: in order to prevent minors from getting their hands on Everlear or 151, we must ban all alcohol in all forms.> Though that 2019 law does not allow products to contain more than trace amounts of delta-9 THC, it did not establish that same threshold for other hemp derivatives. Critics say the hemp industry exploited that loophole to usher in more than 8,000 retailers selling THC-laced edibles, drinks, vapes and flower buds across Texas.And here lies the real problem I see, when state governments start banning recreational cannabis and instead have ""hemp loopholes"", you end up with a much sketchier product for consumers. In Colorado I can go to the dispensary and buy ""pure pot"" that is just flower that was grown, dried and packaged with no other modification. With these hemp derivatives like Delta 8/9/etc, they distill down the various parts into a chemical form and then spray that shit on hemp flower or add it to other products.Now the question I ask is: how was it distilled? what chemicals were used in the process? are those chemicals safe? and a million other related questions. With regular pot  there's none of that.And the last thing I'll say on this is it seems that pot has unfortunately gotten tangled up in the culture war here in the US. Lots of folks I see now that oppose cannabis legalization don't really have a specific reason to oppose it, they just do because ""pot"" is now a proxy for ""woke"" and ""liberal"" and they have to own the libs.

You absolutely should be asking those questions about “regular pot” as well. AIUI concentrates are among the bestselling and most profitable products in legal states, and they use uncertain chemicals of questionable provenance even if the delta-9 THC is 100% natty. But even if you're just buying flower you could reasonably be concerned about pesticides or mold [1].I think there are some quite good reasons to oppose cannabis legalization (for example, it's made the super-high-potency concentrates which are associated with bad outcomes much more widely available) and it's possible your own culture war or other biases are getting in your way here. But there are also lots of good arguments in favor of course.[1] https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/marijuana-mold-contami...

Who determines what is acceptable for that and who does the testing and how? Like, can they spray with neem oil to counter pests and it's still organic “pure pot” but you would be smoking traces of neem oil? I find the concept of “pure pot” somewhat dubious. Isn't hash more pure?


reply



What about fertilizers? Chemicals sprayed on the flower? Mold or other contaminants? Mystery THC derivatives are bad, but so is cheaply grown weed.Why aren't we worried about contaminants in liquor and beer? How can that be applied to THC products?

With a spectacular array of galaxies and nebulas, the ambitious telescope begins its 10-year survey of the cosmos.

The first spectacular images taken by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory have been released for the world to peruse: a panoply of iridescent galaxies and shimmering nebulas. “This is the dawn of the Rubin Observatory,” says Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist and astronomer at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland.

Much has been written about the observatory's grand promise: to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos by revealing a once-hidden population of far-flung galaxies, erupting stars, interstellar objects, and elusive planets. And thanks to its unparalleled technical prowess, few doubted its ability to make good on that. But over the past decade, during its lengthy construction period, “everything's been in the abstract,” says Schwamb.

Today, that promise has become a staggeringly beautiful reality. 

Rubin's view of the universe is unlike any that preceded it—an expansive vision of the night sky replete with detail, including hazy envelopes of matter coursing around galaxies and star-paved bridges arching between them. “These images are truly stunning,” says Pedro Bernardinelli, an astronomer at the University of Washington.

During its brief perusal of the night sky, Rubin even managed to spy more than 2,000 never-before-seen asteroids, demonstrating that it should be able to spotlight even the sneakiest denizens, and darkest corners, of our own solar system.

Today's reveal is a mere amuse-bouche compared with what's to come: Rubin, funded by the US National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, is set for at least 10 years of planned observations. But this moment, and these glorious inaugural images, are worth celebrating for what they represent: the culmination of over a decade of painstaking work. 

“This is a direct demonstration that Rubin is no longer in the future,” says Bernardinelli. “It's the present.”

The observatory is named after the late Vera Rubin, an astronomer who uncovered strong evidence for dark matter, a mysterious and as-yet-undetected something that's binding galaxies together more strongly than the gravity of ordinary, visible matter alone can explain. Trying to make sense of dark matter—and its equally mysterious, universe-stretching cousin, dubbed dark energy—is a monumental task, one that cannot be addressed by just one line of study or scrutiny of one type of cosmic object.

That's why Rubin was designed to document anything and everything that shifts or sparkles in the night sky. Sitting atop Chile's Cerro Pachón mountain range, it boasts a 7,000-pound, 3,200-megapixel digital camera that can take detailed snapshots of a large patch of the night sky; a house-size cradle of mirrors that can drink up extremely distant and faint starlight; and a maze of joints and pistons that allow it to swivel about with incredible speed and precision. A multinational computer network permits its sky surveys to be largely automated, its images speedily processed, any new objects easily detected, and the relevant groups of astronomers quickly alerted.

The telescope will catalogue billions of new objects and produce a new map of the entire night sky every three days with the largest digital camera ever made.

All that technical wizardry allows Rubin to take a picture of the entire visible night sky once every few days, filling in the shadowed gaps and unseen activity between galaxies. “The sky [isn't] static. There are asteroids zipping by, and supernovas exploding,” says Yusra AlSayyad, Rubin's overseer of image processing. By conducting a continuous survey over the next decade, the facility will create a three-dimensional movie of the universe's ever-changing chaos that could help address all sorts of astronomic queries. What were the very first galaxies like? How did the Milky Way form? Are there planets hidden in our own solar system's backyard?

Rubin's first glimpse of the firmament is predictably bursting with galaxies and stars. But the resolution, breadth, and depth of the images have taken astronomers aback. “I'm very impressed with these images. They're really incredible,” says Christopher Conselice, an extragalactic astronomer at the University of Manchester in England.

One shot, created from 678 individual exposures, showcases the Trifid and Lagoon nebulas—two oceans of luminescent gas and dust where stars are born. Others depict a tiny portion of Rubin's view of the Virgo Cluster, a zoo of galaxies. Hues of blue are coming from relatively nearby whirlpools of stars, while red tints emanate from remarkably distant and primeval galaxies. 

The rich detail in these images is already proving to be illuminating. “As galaxies merge and interact, the galaxies are pulling stars away from each other,” says Conselice. This behavior can be seen in plumes of diffuse light erupting from several galaxies, creating halos around them or illuminated bridges between them—records of these ancient galaxies' pasts.

Images like these are also likely to contain several supernovas, the explosive final moments of sizable stars. Not only do supernovas seed the cosmos with all the heavy elements that planets—and life—rely on, but they can also hint at how the universe has expanded over time. 

Anais Möller, an astrophysicist at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, is a supernova hunter. “I search for exploding stars in very far away galaxies,” she says. Older sky surveys have found plenty, but they can lack context: You can see the explosion, but not what galaxy it's from. Thanks to Rubin's resolution—amply demonstrated by the Virgo Cluster set of images—astronomers can now “find where those exploding stars live,” says Möller.

While taking these images of the distant universe, Rubin also discovered 2,104 asteroids flitting about in our own solar system—including seven whose orbits hew close to Earth's own. This number may sound impressive, but it's just par for the course for Rubin. In just a few months, it will find over a million new asteroids—doubling the current known tally. And over the course of its decadal survey, Rubin is projected to identify 89,000 near-Earth asteroids, 3.7 million asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter, and 32,000 icy objects beyond Neptune. 

Featuring the world's largest digital camera, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will capture these mysterious phenomena in more exquisite detail than ever before. 

Finding more than 2,000 previously hidden asteroids in just a few hours of observations, then, “wasn't even hard” for Rubin, says Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington. “The asteroids really popped out.”

Rubin's comprehensive inventorying of the solar system has two benefits. The first is scientific: All those lumps of rocks and ice are the remnants of the solar system's formative days, which means astronomers can use them to understand how everything around us was pieced together. 

The second benefit is security. Somewhere out there, there could be an asteroid on an Earthbound trajectory—one whose impact could devastate an entire city or even several countries. Engineers are working on defensive tech designed to either deflect or obliterate such asteroids, but if astronomers don't know where they are, those defenses are useless. In quickly finding so many asteroids, Rubin has clearly shown that it will bolster Earth's planetary defense capabilities like no other ground-based telescope.

Altogether, Rubin's debut has validated the hopes of countless astronomers: The observatory won't just be an incremental improvement on what's come before. “I think it's a generational leap,” says Möller. It is a ruthlessly efficient, discovery-making behemoth—and a firehose of astronomic delights is about to inundate the scientific community. “It's very scary,” says Möller. “But very exciting at the same time.”

It's going to be a very hectic decade. As Schwamb puts it, “The roller-coaster starts now.” 

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

Over the weekend, OpenAI removed all promo materials related to its $6.5 billion buddy-buddy partnership with Apple design legend Jony Ive and their still unannounced AI-centric device. This wasn't a falling out between the two titans in tech, but rather the result of something altogether stranger. The nixed webpages and videos are due to a trademark lawsuit filed by a separate startup, iyO, which is seemingly miffed about the companies names being a single letter apart.

On July 20, California federal Judge Trina L. Thompson granted a temporary restraining order against OpenAI that forced it to remove all mentions of Ive's design company, “io.” You can still find the bromance video of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive—who helped bring us products like the iMac and iPhone—on YouTube through unofficial uploads. A page on OpenAI's site that previously talked up its partnership with Ive now reads:

“This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name “io.” We don't agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.”

What's the distinction between iyO Inc. and io, other than the inclusion of everybody's favorite sometimes vowel? iyO also makes “hardware and software allowing users to do everything they currently do on a computer, phone, or tablet without using a physical interface.” Which is to say, it's an AI device company. Jony Ive and several other ex-Apple staff founded io in 2023. Since then, it poached some big-name Apple design stars, though the company hadn't released any real products in that time. Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, helped design a button for a separate fashion designer.

iyO has been around since 2021, though its latest product—an in-ear headset called the iyO One—is still up for preorder. It's a device that claims to replace apps by letting users talk in natural language to a chatbot that then computes for you. It requires an audiologist to make an impression of your ear and costs $1,000 for a version with Wi-Fi connectivity or even more for a version with LTE. The device maker claimed in its lawsuit it is manufacturing an initial batch of 20,000 units and is still looking to raise more funds. The AI device maker sued IO Products and OpenAI earlier this month and said it was seeking an immediate restraining order and injunction to stop Ive and OpenAI from using their two-letter brand name. iyO claimed it sought some investment from OpenAI and LoveFrom, though Altman told them in March that it was “working on something competitive so will respectfully pass.”

“Defendants [AKA OpenAI and Ive] have known about the existence of iyO, the iyO Marks, and the nature of iyO's technology since at least 2022,” the AI device maker claims in its lawsuit. “Indeed, the parties had a series of meetings with representatives of OpenAI's principal, Sam Altman, and designers from LoveFrom Inc., a design studio founded by Jony Ive, about the prospect of iyO and OpenAI working together.” For its part, OpenAI said in response to the lawsuit it had decided not to pursue any collab or funding with iyO. The makers of ChatGPT said it surveyed many existing commercial AI devices in the run-up to its May partnership announcement. Ive even went as far as to say the Rabbit R1 and Humane Ai Pin were “very poor products.”

The name “io” derives from a tech term referring to “input/output,” such as the “IO ports” like USB or HDMI you may find on a typical PC. In a statement published on the opening salvo for the lawsuit, iyO cofounder Justin Rugolo said OpenAI was trying to “trample” on the rights of his “small startup.” Rugolo also claimed he had messaged Altman saying that investors were concerned about confusion surrounding the company's names. Rugolo complained that OpenAI had previously sued a separate artificial intelligence company, Open Artificial Intelligence, over a similar trademark claim.

At the very least, this lawsuit offers a few more slim details about what Ive and Altman have in store. In its response to iyO's claims, OpenAI said, “io is at least a year away from offering any goods or services, and the first product it intends to offer is not an in-ear device like the one Plaintiff is offering.” OpenAI further suggested whatever spins out of io will be a “general consumer product for the mass market.”

It's unlikely that we'll see work stop on whatever Ive and co. are working on. There are more hearings surrounding this trademark case slated for the months ahead. The lawsuit offers yet another glimpse into the high-stakes world of AI wearable startups and just how hard it is to come up with a device that can match the versatility of an iPhone. We'll still have to wait at least a year to see if anybody can cook up something more usable than an earpiece that lets you talk to a chatbot.

When Hideo Kojima—the man fashioned into a video game auteur out of his work on Metal Gear Solid—launched his debut title under the newly formed Kojima Productions in 2019, Death Stranding arrived shrouded in mystery and hype. Every Death Stranding trailer was full of cryptic imagery and spectral apparitions, and its stacked cast featuring Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Mads Mikkelsen set expectations sky-high. It was also the first title to come from the creator following a messy and public exodus from Konami. Would Kojima once again rewrite the rules of game design?

Upon release, Death Stranding didn't disappoint so much as it defied prediction. At its core, it was an immersive, slow-burning post-apocalyptic courier simulator. Players took control of Sam Porter Bridges, a pulp comics-esque naming convention of a protagonist suffering from aphenphosmphobia, an extreme fear of being touched, tasked with completing a herculean cross country trek across haunted landscapes by plagued eldritch horrors with the help of a baby in a container on his chest—avoiding environmental hazards and balancing parcels on every available piece of real estate on his body to “reconnect America.” Reductively, Death Stranding is regarded in gaming circles as a “triple-A” indie game, with a weird (but not overly confusingly dense) world-building serving as the connective tissue propelling every careful footstep on Sam's odyssey. What Death Stranding lacks in conventional thrills, it made up for with sheer conceptual weight.

And yes—it eerily echoed real life in ways no one expected. The game's premise, centered on isolation, bunkered survivors, and the life-or-death role of delivery drivers, landed eerily close to home mere months before the world locked down due to a global pandemic. It was dubbed “the game that predicted 2020,” not a first for Kojima, and not unfairly.

Being a “big idea game” comes with its own set of challenges. Its narrative often gets buried beneath a slow drip of actual story progression, unraveling across long stretches of gameplay that make the usual open-world promise of “you see that mountain, you can go there” feel strangely perfunctory. Former Kotaku writer Tim Rogers once likened it to eating your vegetables before dessert, but I'd argue it's closer to gaming's purest example of the carrot-on-a-stick design—except here, the carrot is a 10-minute cutscene stylized as gaming's navel-gazing at wanting to be cinema, and the stick is a seven-hour hike.

Kojima's eccentric roster of superpowered, trauma-scarred outcasts occasionally interrupts the lonely, meditative rhythm of traversal with dense lore drops laced in pun-heavy dialogue. At times, it's profound; at others, it teeters dangerously close to groan-worthy. Much of Death Stranding‘s script leans into Kojima's newfound signature use of homonyms and wordplay—an approach that often thrives in Japanese, a language rich in double meanings and visual punning through kanji. There, it probably lands with layered nuance; in English, it falls somewhere between a dad joke and a freshman poetry slam stanza.

Still, despite its long stretches of powerwalking monotony, the challengingly Metal Gear-esque moments of tactical espionage, Monster Energy product placement, and the memes about Norman Reedus and his funky fetus that spawned endless parody, there's a rich, strange beauty to the first Death Stranding. It's a game worth experiencing once, and then revisiting vicariously through those who have dissected its mythos in in-depth essays and lore videos. Its legacy is secured not just as a bold experiment but as a haunting artifact of the pre-pandemic world—one that resonates differently, and maybe more profoundly, in hindsight.

Personally, while I appreciated the high-concept ambition of Death Stranding, I struggled with it and ultimately lost interest. It felt more like a conceptual art piece than a fully realized game. An intellectual exercise whose ideas overshadowed the experience and gratification of playing it. As someone who values creative works that marry emotional gravity with speculative cultural context, I often found Death Stranding‘s narrative throughlines reaching further than they could fully grasp. The worldbuilding fascinated me far more than the story it was built to support.

Now, six years later, with Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, set to release later this week, I spent 65 hours to hit the credits (with hours left of pending deliveries still in transit, and roads unbuilt) of the highly anticipated sequel and feel nearly the opposite. Where the first Death Stranding felt like a conceptual mood board come to life, this sequel is more narratively grounded. It's like a musician remixing their greatest hits with a tighter production—fewer self-indulgent lyrical bars, more emotional clarity. Granted, it's still a story that's got its foibles. But this time it lands more often than it drifts into the faux profundity of its predecessor.

Set 11 months after the events of the original game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach picks up with Sam and his bridge baby, Lou, living off the grid. Fragile (Seydoux) arrives on his doorstep with a job that pulls the freelance courier back into the field. This time, the mission is to integrate Mexico into the United Cities of America's ever-expanding chiral network. Essentially, Sam is tasked with lacing up his boots and trekking across the continent, linking his USB dog tag key fob to bunker mailboxes and connecting settlements to their supernatural strand-based Wi-Fi.

The game is self-aware enough to admit its familiar call to action—more trekking, more connecting—but framed with a wink. Rebuilding the world, one footstep at a time, shouldn't be too difficult since you've done it before and came out straight… until it is. Just as Sam nears the end of what seems like a modest fetch-quest, the story swerves dramatically, widening its scope to extend the network to Australia as well. From here, the narrative spirals into something far more ambitious, involving the return of Sam's rival Higgs (Troy Baker) and his newfound mech-ghost army, as well as a new antagonist not-so-subtly modeled after Metal Gear Solid‘s Snake, Neil (Luca Marinelli).

Joining Sam on this escalating journey are fresh faces like Tarman (modeled after Mad Max director George Miller), Rainy (played by Deadpool Yukio actor Shioli Kutsuna), Dollman (modeled after director Faith Akin and played by Jonathan Roumie), and a mysterious girl named Tomorrow (Elle Fanning), alongside returning allies liked Deadman (modeled after director Guillermo del Toro and played by Jesse Corti) and Heartman (modeled after Nicolas Winding Refn and played by Darren Jacobs).

In Death Stranding 2, managing Sam still feels like you've adopted a rugged, soft-spoken post-apocalyptic Tamagotchi. You're constantly tending to his hygiene with showers and potty breaks to get the blood, dirt, and gunk of the day off his person, recalibrating his loadout in a Tetris-like inventory grid that can quickly collapse like Jenga if a BT±the inky monstrosities that stalk the lands, injecting bursts of pulse-spiking horror into On The Beach‘s walking sim vibes on a dime—knocks him and his tower of cargo off balance.

Between encounters, Sam needs snack breaks—munching stamina-restoring larvae, taking swigs from his canteen, or tapping into blood bags that serve as makeshift health kits during especially sticky scuffles. It's a loop that's both ritualistic and irksome, but weirdly intimate. Once I settled back into its rhythm, carefully balancing weight by holding down triggers, preplanning my cargo, and eyeing every lost parcel, and negotiating whether I should add it to Sam's burden as humanity's pack mule because it's destination is “on the way,” I started to embrace the strange zen of it all.

Unlike my first go-around with its predecessor, there's something endearingly relatable about overloading Sam with gear, teetering under the weight of ambition and generosity like a dad determined to carry all the grocery bags in one go, rather than humoring a second trip. It also didn't hurt that completing deliveries rewarded me with tools to make traversal less tedious by providing me material to construct roads to make traversal less of a pain in the ass, and tracks to add to a playlist so I can whistle as I work (so long as I was in areas I've given chiral network coverage to). This became even more manageable when vehicles and ziplines came into play, turning multi-trip dread into a cross-country trip with a rig built for warfare, or trucker hauls to build more pavement between settlements like I was Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Dollman serves as Sam's ever-present companion throughout On the Beach, functioning like a clip-on belt charm meets hiking buddy. He fills the silence of On the Beach‘s often monotonous walking with commentary, assists with surveillance when attempts at stealth run sideways, and even offers tips when you get sidetracked hyperfixating on building roads, by reminding you of your main objective. He's basically to Sam what Mimir was to Kratos in God of War, but filtered through Kojima's eccentric lens. Whether it's reconnaissance for combat or providing emotional ballast during the journey, Dollman's low-frame-rate presence is as functional as it is oddly comforting.

While most of Sam's allies don't accompany you physically, they remain present in quieter, digital ways—checking in through social media-like SMS updates and snapshots of their day-to-day while you're en route to the next locale. These messages arrive as you slog through treacherous terrain, building roads, bridges, and generators across a landscape slowly being shaped by your own hands, like creating natural trails on a nature path, and by the footprints and constructive efforts of other players in the game's online asynchronous network. You can like their structures, read stray bits of encouraging signs, and even borrow their vehicles, creating a soft echo of camaraderie amid the isolation.

It transforms what could have been a dreadful, monotonous string of fetch quests into something quietly meaningful. My deliveries and infrastructure work stopped feeling like solo busy work and instead became part of a larger, shared mission—a collective effort tethered to the game's thematic core. What's more, unlike the first game's narrative, which leans more into abstract meditations on connection, Death Stranding 2 is anchored in a leaner, plot-driven momentum, planting seeds of hope as you journey with Sam to his more personal story of overcoming loss and navigating a future for himself. I was reminded, in both subtle story beats and asynchronous multiplayer gestures, that I wasn't hauling this burden alone. Whether it was an anchor left on the side of a mountain that someone else left behind, or a message warning me of hazards on my route, there's a persistent sense that others, virtual or otherwise, had my back when a climb began to feel insurmountable.

But among this broader feeling of connection it's Seydoux's Fragile who's the real anchor to On the Beach this time around. She captains Drawbridge, a submersible airship that doubles as the mission's hub and lifeline for Sam's motley crew, making her role feel far more central and emotionally resonant than before. And while Sam's band of allies mostly keep their presence to cutscenes, they're no longer just digital marionettes of Kojima's excessive lore dumps. They feel more like an evolving found family—integrated into the narrative and Sam's mission, not just orbiting around it. There's a greater sense that they're in the trenches with him, not standing on the sidelines posing dramatically for motion capture posterity.

If all of the above has sounded overwhelming… it is. Kojima Productions has kept it in mind, with both a recap video that summarizes the broad strokes of its first game to get new and old players up to speed, and the inclusion of an interactive real time glossary that pings on the top right corner of the screen with the introduction of new proper nouns and terms, making it easy for players to keep Death Stranding‘s ever-expanding lexicon and story developments straight by referring back to Corpus, its heavily annotated virtual database tome.

Away from its dense worldbuilding however, from the first frame of Death Stranding 2 Kojima is fully in his cinematic bag. The opening scene of the game is so photorealistic that I had to blink twice trying to decipher when it transitioned from drone footage to an in-engine render of a mountainside, which immediately asked me to walk from the top of a mountain to Sam's hidden abode.

Death Stranding 2‘s tone is rich and indulgent, often bordering on decadent. There's a self-aware messiness to how it picks up the narrative shards of its first game. Some characters, like Mama (Margaret Qualley) and Die-Hard Man (Tommie Earl Jenkins), are benched, while others, like Fragile, are further expanded upon. Most prominently, On the Beach‘s plot reimagines its linear progression in favor of crafting a new odyssey that is less “pandemic prophetic” and more centered on connections reinforced by the process of grieving, and rebuilding after suffering a tragic loss. While the game is literally about bringing humanity whole again by your lonesome, this time around its about uniting the entire globe as Sam terraforms Australia and Mexico, building bridges to reconnect the straggling, hikikomori vestiges of humanity.

Gameplay-wise, On The Beach continues to oscillate between a meditative hiking simulator and a sprawling cinematic spectacle full of hype moments and aura—the latter dangling like a shiny reward at the far end of a grueling pilgrimage. I routinely tiptoed through ruins, mercenary outposts, and ghost-drenched wastelands, cradling Lou with each stumble or misstep as my carefully stacked tower of weaponry threatened to topple over. Its geometric minefield of picturesque terrain is still as oppressive as it could be in the first, if not more so, as I found myself dangling off cliffsides, braving torrential rivers, and inching up icy escarpments, one calculated movement at a time (albeit often followed by an improvised one). On The Beach is sequel-scaled, yes—but purposeful, not padded.

What lands differently this time is Sam himself. He no longer marches forward as the gruff, unflinchingly obedient, and politically agnostic mailman resigned to his fate that he once was. Instead, he surprised me by questioning the very foundation of his mission. Not in intentionally sly (but groanworthy) meta jabs of the first game, where he compares himself to Mario looking for his “Princess Beach,” but with sincere moral unease. Reconnecting the world doesn't sound as noble when it starts to look like he's just doing the legwork for post-apocalyptic imperialism for America, which he surprisingly calls into question in the game's early stages.

The seeds of conflict in On the Beach plant between reconnection and overreach, healing and haunting, and they give it a more chaotic, more human pulse. It's messier, less abstract, and far more emotionally legible than its predecessor. Moment-to-moment, the traversal remains the core attraction of On the Beach. You're not just moving, you're mapping, adapting, and experimenting. Think The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom‘s improvisation meets Phantom Pain‘s stealth improvisations when things break bad, and you're suddenly cornered without the proper tools to get from point A to point B. The gunplay combat is still there. Crank the difficulty up a notch to the highest difficulty, and the enemy AI gets surprisingly savvy and savage, allowing for Dishonored-style stealth and tense firefights that feel genuinely earned when you defeat waves of enemies.

But that's never really where the heart of On the Beach lies. Where the first game made you slog for hours before it let its story moments rear their head, On the Beach hits its pace faster. While picking up the pieces of global tragedies, such as the pandemic, is still in the DNA of On the Beach‘s pathos, gone is the heavy reliance on it as an allegory. In its place is something more introspective, present-minded, universal, and grounded than it is speculative. Less “look how prophetic and smart we were” and more, “how do we pick up the pieces and properly reconnect?”

Once you get used to the terrain puzzles of each of On the Beach‘s landmarks—when your instincts kick in and the map becomes muscle memory—those fetch quests start feeling therapeutic in a way. The traversal, not the combat, becomes the game's engine. Sure, the Silent Hill-coded BT encounters and MGS-inspired skirmishes inject tension and excitement, but it's the quiet rhythm between them that defines the journey.

Sam now feels more like a protagonist in his own story. No longer a cipher for Kojima's pun-laden essays on connection, he finally clicks into place as he navigates the next steps in his journey alongside the mission he's been saddled with. The real drama, while compelling, isn't the firefights with Higgs or sussing out Neil's deal; it's whether Sam has the confidence to trust his legs, his gear, and the chart he's set for his journey.

In the lead-up to On the Beach‘s release, Kojima confessed that early playtest feedback made him uneasy, not because it was negative, but because it was too positive. He purportedly worried the game might come across too mainstream, so made adjustments, presumably with the intent to make Death Stranding‘s friction more impactful, and occasionally more hostile, to its players. Around the 70 percent mark of the game, I felt the weight of that philosophy first hand, when the somewhat easy sailing of On the Beach‘s gameplay up to that point turned downright oppressive. There was a moment where I hated the game for a solid five-hour stretch, due to how granularly tedious, and outlandish, the delivery demands became.

I still don't entirely love On the Beach having navigated that momentary frustration, either. However, I do appreciate how it made me value the things I didn't like about the first, namely the sense of place earned in Death Stranding‘s world by navigating it on your own two feet. I would never have imagined the game would have me go from abandoning a tower of weaponry on my backpack, to carrying an emu across a haunted mountain range, gazing from its crest to catch the sunrise, and hearing a rooster crow as if I had reached a sacred checkpoint. It's absurd. It's poignant. It's Kojima. New tracks to add to your playlist cue when near your destination, like divine applause. I started treating Sam like a Tamagotchi—testing his limits, suffering with him, learning to pivot when everything collapses. Your hubris becomes your strategy. Your journey becomes a ritual that I couldn't help but love, albeit in a masochistic sense, as a player.

On the Beach‘s narrative speaks louder and clearer than its predecessor. Its story, while still strange, is more coherent—its symbolism less cluttered by its vocabulary. At times, it plays like a proof-of-concept for Kojima's inevitable foray into filmmaking. But there's beauty in its broken pacing. After surviving that five-hour gauntlet of pure punishment, the final act delivers in spades. Yes, the game is maddeningly back-loaded—but it's worth it.

What's most surprising is how Kojima's signature penchant for weirdness, once a shield for abstraction, now feels like scaffolding for something more emotionally grounded. It's tighter, and stronger for it, and even willing to poke fun at itself to show it's learned from experience, to the point there were times I felt like I was sincerely laughing with Kojima, not at his trademark absurdity.

On the Beach still demands a ton of patience. It still punishes, but it also rewards, with a narrative that feels sculpted rather than splattered. Where its predecessor felt like a rambling, late-night text, On the Beach is what happens when those thoughts are carved into marble for all to see. The glossary breaks, the combat struggles, the endless geometric trek, and, most of all, the exceptional acting on display from its stellar cast—they all contribute to a finale that lands with surprising elegance.

If On the Beach proved anything, it's that Kojima—eccentric, indulgent, brilliant—still knows how to make the absurd feel resonant. This sequel isn't just an echo of the first. It's the payoff. It's the strange, painstaking journey I hoped for the first time around—and somehow, against all odds, it sticks the landing in spite of it all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The ‘Most Advanced' Chromebook Has an AI Chip That's Just Pure Overkill for ChromeOS","https://gizmodo.com/the-most-advanced-chromebook-wants-to-know-how-much-you-care-about-on-device-ai-2000618432","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 13:00:29 GMT","

What do you need your Chromebook to do for you? If you're like most people who buy the cheaper ChromeOS-based laptops, you want it to access a browser and—if you're feeling particularly spicy—maybe a few select Android apps. The most important elements for these lightweight clamshells are normally whether it can load webpages fast, has a long-enough battery, and if it has a quality display for your average Netflix and chill session. With its latest update, Google and Lenovo are asking consumers if they are willing to drop more money on a Chromebook that's more powerful to potentially run a few AI apps on-device.

The $650 Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 doesn't have your average low-end chip made for lightweight PCs. The laptop sports 16GB of RAM alongside MediaTek's Kompanio Ultra chip. It's an 8-core processor designed specifically for Chromebooks. On paper, the Chromebook Plus 14 has some impressive specs, including an 11-core, ray tracing-capable GPU for those few games or 3D apps on Chromebook that support enhanced, realistic lighting effects. It should also supply enough juice to support up to two 4K external displays, plus it has Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.

The Chromebook Plus 14 seems designed to compare with today's AI PCs, specifically thanks to its NPU, or neural processing unit. It's a portion of the chip designed to process AI-related tasks. MediaTek said the NPU hits 50 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. That number offers a rough estimate of how well it can handle simple AI tasks. Most “AI PC” chips from companies like Intel and AMD can support 45 TOPS. As for what AI features are available at launch, that's a little more disappointing. Lenovo's laptop will get exclusive capabilities that automatically group your browser tabs, whether they're your Google Docs or internet searches. If you're the type to have too many tabs open simultaneously, it could prove an easy way to get them all contained.

Otherwise, the only other exclusive software feature is AI image editing in the Gallery app. It'll let you use Magic Eraser to remove objects in an image's background without needing an internet connection. The system is lacking any on-device Gemini chatbot. While Google didn't confirm what was coming next for Chromebooks, it implied we could eventually see some Gemini Nano language model integration on Chromebook Plus. Is that something we're really looking for? Considering how limp Microsoft's Copilot has been on PC, it's not the kind of feature we're truly jonesing for.

All Chromebook Plus models will get a few more features to add on to last year's updates. The recently introduced “Quick Access” key, which on some models replaced Caps Lock, can now generate AI images. Users can also access a “Help me read” function to break down a web page or document into more condensed bullet points with AI-generated text. Chromebooks, including non-Plus models, will be able to perform Google Lens image searches by either hitting the on-screen launcher button or using the screenshot tool. Google has been on an AI kick these past few years, and it's still promoting that you'll get a full year of Google One premium subscription with a handy 2TB of cloud storage.

These features aren't anything we haven't seen before on Google's phones or other devices. Chromebooks generally don't need anything truly special, since most people who buy one just need it for the sake of accessing browser- or cloud-based apps. Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook Plus from last year was already too expensive at $700 despite its light frame and pretty AMOLED display. Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 sports an OLED screen and what the company claims is some of the longest battery life of any Chromebook—17 hours, though that's in video streaming tests. It's also the only Chromebook that supports Dolby Atmos audio through its quad speaker system. The Chromebook 14 Plus is the most PC-like of any Chromebook ever made, but without broader app support, it can never match the versatility of other laptops running Windows 11 or Linux. If you're entrenched in the Google ecosystem and don't mind cloud-based work, most modern Chromebooks of even moderate quality will serve you well. Lenovo's latest seems to sit somewhere between great and overkill, but we'll need to do our own tests to see whether you should want a multimedia Chromebook, especially if you don't care a lick for Google's AI features.

Something is off.

Elon Musk, the billionaire “technoking,” professional loudmouth, and geopolitical hobbyist, has gone silent. More than 48 hours after the United States bombed three Iranian nuclear sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — triggering fears of a wider war, the man who has a take on everything suddenly has none.

This isn't normal. It's rare.

The context is explosive. As the world awaits Iran's response, President Donald Trump warned of more strikes and openly mused about regime change. “If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???” he posted on Truth Social on June 22.

The world is teetering. The U.S. is on the brink of a new Middle East war. And Musk, a man who practically lives on X, the platform he owns, is posting about robotaxis in Austin, Texas, and congratulating Tesla engineers, but has not said a single word about the escalating Iran situation.

No reposts. No memes. Nothing.

No one expects Musk to stay quiet. His brand is global omnipresence. He has tweeted about immigration in Europe, publicly challenged the German government over environmental policy, called Brazil's elected leaders an “oppressive regime,” and even tried to rebrand Europe's far-right surge as MEGA — Make Europe Great Again.

Make Europe Great Again!

MEGA, MEGA, MEGA 

 pic.twitter.com/Mk5NJXxxeC

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 14, 2025



When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Musk initially provided Starlink satellite support. Then he flipped, accusing Ukraine of seeking a “forever war.” His opinion whiplash is so routine that Musk watchers have learned to expect it. Which is why his current silence, amid a possible U.S.-Iran war, feels almost strategic.

They want the forever war. 

How many more parents with no sons?

How many more children with no fathers?

By their logic, it never ends. https://t.co/LplYYnfLnd

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2025



He has been active on X since the strikes. He just hasn't mentioned them. Instead, he focused on launching Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, a major moment for the EV company. But this is Elon Musk, the man who brags about multitasking across Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company while tweeting memes about obscure historical battles at 3 a.m. Time has never stopped him before. His default setting is to interfere. His planetary ambitions, he seems to believe, require him to have an opinion on everything.

So why the silence now?

The answer likely lies in a humiliating public feud from just a few weeks ago. On June 5, Musk's alliance with Trump spectacularly imploded in a war of words and personal insults. Musk accused Trump of having ties to Jeffrey Epstein, a claim that quickly went viral before he deleted it. The fallout was so damaging that Musk did something he almost never does: he bent the knee. After a brutal backlash from the MAGA base and a $150 billion drop in Tesla's market value, the tech mogul issued a public apology. “I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week,” he wrote. “They went too far.”

I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 11, 2025



That episode appears to have left a deep mark. As he once posted in January, “I get things done and, while I have lost a few battles here and there, I have never lost a war.” His feud with Trump looks like the war he finally lost.

I get things done and, while I have lost a few battles here and there, I have never lost a war

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 9, 2025



His silence on Iran seems to confirm it. Now Musk may be calculating: Is it worth stepping into another fight? Especially one that pits his apparent non-interventionist instincts — he's long bashed forever wars — against Trump's war-footing bravado?

Judging by Musk's past statements, he likely sides with the populist-nationalist wing of the GOP that wants the U.S. to avoid new foreign entanglements. His jabs at Ukraine's leadership suggest he has little appetite for extended conflict. But publicly aligning with that camp, against Trump, could trigger another costly clash. He may not want to risk it. Not again. Not right now.

Musk's silence might not last. But for now, it's loud. And revealing. The man who tries to colonize Mars, reinvent AI, tunnel under cities, and disrupt every industry from defense to energy to biotech is, for once, strategically mute.

The stakes are high. If the U.S. escalates in Iran, Musk will eventually speak. But for now, it looks like the richest man on Earth is playing it safe. Not for lack of opinions, but perhaps for fear of another expensive battle.

As summer arrives, having a portable power station by your side is a lifesaver for camping excursions, van trips and outdoor parties with friends. Among the reputable brands playing in this niche, Bluetti joins the ranks of EcoFlow and Anker and provides solid and robust options for those who require power in the field.

Today, Amazon is discounting the fantastic Bluetti AC70 1000W portable power station at an all-time lowest price: Originally priced at $599, this giant is available for a paltry $328 (45% off).

See at Amazon

With a generous capacity of 768Wh and an inverter rated at 1000W (with a surge capacity of up to 2000W), this Bluetti AC70 power station is built to handle a wide range of devices from smartphones and laptops to mini-fridges and small appliances. Its powerful strike configuration includes two 1000W AC outlets, two 100W USB-C charging port, two USB-A ports, and a 12V car output, which gives you seven outputs total to charge all your needs. This power and connectivity combination gives you the capability of being able to charge multiple devices at the same time.

With an AC wall outlet, you can recharge the unit 0 to 80% in a span of 45 minutes and the complete level in 1.5 hours: no cumbersome adapters, no more than one cord. If you're off the grid, Bluetti AC70 has a solar charging capacity of up to 500W (sold separately) and allows you to charge it in 1.9 to 2.4 hours of full sun. It also charges via car port to make it even more handy so it's an all-rounder no matter what.

What's more, it uses a LiFePO4 battery which is longer-lasting, offers greater discharge efficiency and is safer than normal lithium-ion batteries. The chemistry of the battery is also famous for its reliability when exposed to poor conditions and provides consistent performance throughout its cycle of charging. The AC70 weighs 22.5 pounds which is light enough to make it travel well but heavy enough to provide serious power capabilities.

At just $328, it's hard to find a more complete package in the portable power market.

The performance increase looks poor compared to the increased power consumption, though.

An Asus ROG Astral LC RTX 5090 has been shunt modded, resulting in its performance eclipsing the $10,000 RTX Pro 6000. This kind of PCB surgery mod is notorious for resulting in damaged graphics cards, so please monkey-see monkey-do with extreme caution. However, the video of this particular feat was put together by overclocking legend Der8auer, so everything went extremely smoothly and to plan. Below, we will ponder over the process, the results, and consider whether the work and risks are worth it.

As briefly mentioned above, shunt modding can be dangerous to the life of your GPU. If mistakes are made, your $$$ GPU could degrade slowly, or become toast extremely quickly. As well as any concerns about the actual mod to the PCB, remember that any strain on the 16-pin power connector could become even more perilously high at 800W.

Der8auer told viewers that he waited until he could get a capable AiO card for this shunt mod experiment, as it should be better at handling the greater power. And indeed, the Asus ROG Astral LC RTX 5090 runs quieter than the ‘vanilla' Astral, according to the overclocker. All else being equal, the Astral cards offer a welcome degree of parameter adjustment and monitoring options via Asus GPU Tweak III – this will be useful later.

First things first, Der8auer set a baseline for out-of-the-box Astral LC RTX 5090 performance. During this initial assessment, he observed that it was hitting the standard 600W power target constantly when under load, but seemed “pretty quiet” and capable of handling more juice. It was concluded by the OC expert that the 600W limit was definitely reducing OC potential.

Now the decision had been made and baselines recorded – it was time to crack open the LC and mod the PCB. We won't get into the details of how to shunt mod, but you can see an overview of the procedure in the video embedded above. But in brief, the mod is rather straightforward. It simply requires changes to be made to the resistors coming from the power connector to ‘fool' the controlling circuitry into thinking less power is coming in to the PCB than there actually is... With the resistor replacements Der8auer chose, the mod would allow “us in theory to get about 30% higher power draw without the card noticing.” Thus, a separate piece of hardware, called WireView, would be used to see the actual power draw. In the case of the Astral cards, you also have pin sensing on the 16-pin power input, so that is another view of the incoming power that is available, and should remain useful.

The mod went well, and WireView reported about 660 to 700W being used under modest benchmark loads. That contrasts with the GPU-Z readout of around 500W. It was also observed that there was 15 to 20% more headroom left until the new power limit would be hit.

During fresh benchmarks, the CPU only occasionally ran into the new power limit; most of the time, it seems to be at around 750W during the tests. Then it was decided to delve into manual overclocking, with acceptable temperatures and noise levels continuing.

To conclude, the shunt-modded RTX 5090 beats the $10,000 RTX Pro 6000, but only just. You can also see an alarmingly higher power consumption vs both the unmodded RTX 5090 and the professional graphics card with its 96GB VRAM. Der8auer was pleased and called the result “quite nice.” However, we think it is worth underlining our earlier comments about the dangers of doing a shunt mod on expensive graphics cards.

Amazon Prime Day is not yet upon us, but that hasn't stopped deals from already popping up ahead of time. If you're looking for a superfast Windows boot drive or games drive with ample storage, this SSD deal could be the one for you. The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB may no longer be the fastest kid on the block, but if you don't have a motherboard or system that supports PCIe 5.0, then this is still one of the fastest SSDs you can get your hands on.

You can find today's SSD deal at Amazon, where Samsung's 2TB 990 Pro SSD is on sale for just $149. Although a markdown in price of $20 from the original $169 list price, the $149 deal price isn't the lowest price this SSD has ever been. Looking at my price histories, I can see that at one point it was as low as $119 for the 2TB model. With current tariff uncertainty and general price increases for memory and controllers, it's still good to see SSDs of this quality not climbing too high in price.

We reviewed the Samsung 990 Pro SSD and highlighted it as one of the best SSDs available. It's efficient, runs cool, and has top-notch performance to back up our high praise. Originally, one of our biggest concerns with Samsung's 990 Pro was the high MSRP price, but that negative aspect disappears with these price discounts. After testing, we awarded the Samsung 990 Pro an Editor's Choice award and placed it atop the list of the best SSDs.

Samsung 990 Pro 2TB SSD: now $149 at Amazon (was $169)The Samsung 990 Pro is one of the fastest and most popular PCIe Gen 4 SSDs available for both PCs and PlayStation 5 gaming. Using a 2280 form factor and M.2 connection. The 990 Pro can hit read/write speeds as high as 7,450/6,900 MB/s.

The Samsung 990 Pro drive is supported by a limited five-year manufacturer's warranty that voids should the drive reach 1,200 TBW. The 990 Pro uses Samsung's Pascal SSD controller and 176-layer V-NAND TLC memory. If you're looking for a fast drive for either your PC or a PlayStation 5 console, then you can't go far wrong with the Samsung 990 Pro.

For more SSD offerings, you can visit Amazon and Newegg for the latest superfast storage deals.

Users warn against installing the IT5701/5702 update

A firmware update for Gigabyte's RGB lighting controller is reportedly causing issues for users, as pointed out by various social media posts online. In a recent case, Charlie (@ghost_motley) on X highlighted a concern with a firmware package for the RGB controller listed on the Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard support page, which added support for Windows Dynamic Lighting.

The firmware update in question is the Gigabyte IT5701/ 5702 RGB lighting controller firmware upgrade package with version 1.0.0.9 dated 24 November, 2024. After installing the update and rebooting, the user noticed that not only was Windows Dynamic Lighting unavailable, but the motherboard's onboard RGB lighting was completely non-functional. Their PC would shut down normally; however, the CPU fan continued to spin. Re-running the tool made no difference, and the update managed to brick the Q-Flash Plus feature (Gigabyte's BIOS update utility) from working on the particular motherboard.



As pointed out, performing a quick search for terms like “bricked Gigabyte LED update” or “IT5701/IT5702 Gigabyte” reveals multiple forum threads detailing similar problems. The issue is clearly widespread and is not just limited to the above-mentioned motherboard but across Gigabyte's 600 and 700 series motherboards with RGB lighting.

A similar case, posted by u/PuzzleheadedClue7694 on Reddit, involves a Gigabyte B650 GAMING X AX (rev. 1.3) motherboard. The user claims to have followed the procedure of updating the firmware, only to notice that the progress was stuck and the PC had to be restarted after five minutes. This ended in the RGB lighting being stuck on a rainbow pattern, and using Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software did not help either. The user went on to use SignalRGB, a popular unified RGB control software, which could not recognize the RGB headers on the motherboard.

Another user on Reddit ended up with a bricked Gigabyte B650E Aorus Elite AX V2 motherboard after attempting the same IT5701/5702 RGB controller firmware update. According to u/vReadyyy, they ran the flash.bat file with administrator privileges, but during the update process, the PC stopped responding. Eventually, the user was forced to shut the system down. Upon reboot, the system failed to POST with the CPU debug LED indicator turned on. Despite recovery attempts including CMOS reset and Q-Flash BIOS recovery, the board remained unresponsive.

We have reached out to Gigabyte for a statement regarding the issue; however, the company wasn't immediately available for comment. For now, users of Gigabyte 600 and 700 series motherboards are advised to avoid flashing the IT5701/5702 RGB controller firmware update. In addition to that, updating the firmware using the Gigabyte Control Center (GCC) utility for Windows can also potentially create problems; thus, we do not recommend taking that path.

A possible solution for those who were unable to successfully apply the update is this guide, which explains the issue and offers a step-by-step process on how to safely update the RGB controller firmware and possibly fix the issue. However, if this process still does not solve the problem, you may have a hardware-level issue and need to visit the Gigabyte service center.

A new report claims that Chinese AI juggernaut DeepSeek is helping China's military and intelligence operations, and may have even used shell companies to help procure Nvidia chips that are otherwise covered by export restrictions that prevent their sale to China, according to Reuters.

A senior State Department official told Reuters,"" We understand that DeepSeek has willingly provided and will likely continue to provide support to China's military and intelligence operations, adding the effort goes ""above and beyond"" open-source access to DeepSeek's AI models.

More interestingly, the official said DeepSeek was using workarounds to get access to advanced Nvidia chips, evading export controls. It is claimed DeepSeek has access to ""large volumes"" of Nvidia's H100 chip, which has been covered by Washington export restrictions since 2022.

It is alleged by the official in the interview that DeepSeek tried to use Southeast Asia shell companies to get around the restrictions, but wouldn't be drawn on whether it was successful in its endeavours. The same official also claimed DeepSeek was trying to access data centers in Southeast Asia to remotely access U.S. chips.

The news is a continuing sign that Chinese companies are trying their level best to skirt U.S. export restrictions to get their hands on Nvidia's coveted hardware. It follows reports of Chinese companies flying hard drives to Malaysia in suitcases to try and train AI models using Nvidia hardware in rented servers, a phenomenon Malaysia is now investigating.

However, Reuters reports that three sources familiar with the matter told the outlet that DeepSeek does indeed have H100 chips, which it procured after the U.S. banned their sale to China. Notably, it is claimed that the number is much smaller than the 50,000 chips alleged by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang in January.

Perhaps understandably, Reuters was not able to verify the number of H100 chips DeepSeek may or may not have, but Nvidia denies the claim. ""Our review indicates that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100,"" Nvidia told Reuters.

Intel has published a paper about its 18A (1.8nm-class) fabrication process at the VLSI 2025 symposium, consolidating all its information about the manufacturing technology into a single document. The new 18A production node is expected to deliver significant improvements in power, performance, and area over its predecessor, increasing density by 30% while enhancing performance by 25% or reducing power consumption by 36%.But, perhaps more importantly, 18A will be Intel's first process technology in years that will compete head-to-head with TSMC's leading-edge technology when both enter mass production in the second half of this year.

Intel's 18A process node is designed for a wide range of range of products across both client and datacenter applications, and the first Intel's product to use it will be the Panther Lake CPU, which is due to be formally announced later this year. To address different applications, Intel 18A has two libraries: high-performance (HP) with 180nm cell height (180CH) and high-density (HD) with 160nm cell height (160CH) for lower-power applications.

Intel says that compared to Intel 3, its 18A fabrication technology boosts performance by 25%. It manages to achieve this without increasing voltage or circuit complexity when running a typical Arm core sub-block, implemented using a 180CH HD library at 1.1. When operating at the same clocks and 1.1V voltage, it also cuts power usage by 36% compared to the same design on Intel 3. At a reduced voltage of 0.75V, 18A offers an 18% speed increase and uses 38% less energy. Furthermore, designs fabricated on 18A occupy roughly 28% less area than those built with Intel 3.



There is a major catch about comparison of voltages between Intel 3 and 18A. The former supports <0.6V, 0.75V, 1.1V, and 1.3V, which makes it particularly suitable for data center devices. This type of workload needs to burst to high clocks, across dozens of cores when demanding peak performance. Then, it'll need to throttle down to a low-power state to save power. To contrast, 18A seems to support 0.4V, 0.75V, and 1.1V, which very good for client PCs and data center CPUs, but may not be ideal for processors that need maximum clock speeds. However, other advantages of Intel's 18A will likely offset the lack of 1.3V support for the vast majority of applications (more on this later).

As for SRAM, Intel's 18A process includes a high-density SRAM bit cell measuring 0.021 µm², translating to an SRAM density of roughly 31.8 Mb/mm². This is a major improvement over the 0.024 µm² bit cell used in Intel 4. This puts Intel 18A on par with TSMC's N5 and N3E nodes in terms of SRAM density. However, TSMC's upcoming N2 process goes further, reducing the bit cell to approximately 0.0175 µm² and achieving a higher density of around 38 Mb/mm².

Intel's 18A relies on the company's 2nd generation RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, and a PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN). We investigate exactly how Intel managed to implement GAA transistors and BSPSN below.

In GAA transistors, the gate completely wraps around the channel, offering superior electrostatic control compared to FinFETs, which only wrap around on three sides. Such an architecture enables engineers to finely tune device characteristics for either high performance or low power consumption by adjusting the total effective channel width (Weff). This is typically achieved by varying the width and number of stacked nanosheets. More sheets, alongside wider sheets, can increase drive current and performance at the cost of power, while fewer or narrower sheets reduce both performance and power consumption.

Intel's 18A RibbonFET transistors feature four nanoribbons and support eight distinct logic threshold voltages (VTs) — four for NMOS, and four for PMOS — spanning a 180mV range. This level of VT granularity is achieved through dipole-based work-function tuning, a method that allows precise control of transistor behavior without altering its physical dimensions. This approach is especially important, given the tight spatial constraints in GAA transistor structures, such as RibbonFETs, where traditional methods, like doping adjustments, are limited.

An Intel graph from the paper shows that despite this wide VT range, the transistors exhibit strong electrical characteristics, including steep subthreshold slopes and well-behaved drive currents across both Id–Vg and Id–Vd curves. These results confirm that Intel has successfully maintained device performance and control across the entire VT spectrum, which enables flexible circuit design choices that balance frequency, power, and leakage within the same process.

Intel's PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN) relocates power delivery from the top metal layers to the rear side of the chip, creating a physical separation between power and signal wiring. This technique addresses issues like rising resistance in the vertical connections of in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) layers, which in turn enhances transistor efficiency and reduces power usage. Additionally, it prevents signal degradation caused by power interference and allows for tighter packing of logic elements, increasing overall circuit density.



Intel's PowerVia delivers power to transistor contacts, which is a slightly less sophisticated approach compared to TSMC's Super Power Rail (coming in 2H 2026 along with A16), which connects directly to each transistor's source and drain. In addition to BSPDN, Intel also implemented its new high-density metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor to enhance power supply stability.

Intel has now disclosed the key benefits of its backside power routing. First up, PowerVia increases transistor density by 8% to 10%, which is quite a sizeable part of 18A's overall 1.3X transistor density increase over Intel 3. Secondly, the front-side metal layers in its 18A process achieve approximately 12% better resistance-capacitance (RC) performance and show a 24% to 49% decrease in via resistance compared to Intel 3, thanks to improved metallization techniques and the use of ultra-low-k dielectrics. Thirdly, 18A's PowerVia reduces voltage droop compared to Intel 3 (the worst-case scenario for Intel 3) by up to 10 times. Lastly, BSPDN simplifies chip design as it simplifies the routing of signal and power wires.

Since PowerVia is the industry's first backside power delivery network (BSPDN) used in mass production, Intel also presented reliability test results. These demonstrate its long-term durability and chip-package interaction (CPI) performance.



According to JEDEC-standard TQV tests, PowerVia passed multiple stress conditions with zero failures, including highly accelerated stress testing at 110°C and 85% humidity for 275 hours, extended high-temperature bake tests up to 1000 hours at 165°C, and 750 cycles of temperature swings from –55°C to 125°C. These results confirm that PowerVia can withstand harsh operating environments, without compromising structural or electrical integrity.

In addition to CPI reliability, Intel evaluated the impact of PowerVia on SRAM aging and performance stability. Under conditions equivalent to 1000 hours of high-temperature operation, SRAM arrays maintained stable minimum operating voltage (Vmin) with margin, showing no signs of degradation. This suggests that PowerVia does not negatively affect sensitive on-chip memory and is robust enough to support both digital logic and embedded SRAM under extended stress. Together, these findings are meant to affirm PowerVia's readiness for deployment in high-performance, long-lifecycle computing platforms.

In addition to improving performance, reducing power consumption, and enabling higher transistor density, Intel's 18A simplifies production flows and simplifies chip design.



By moving power delivery to the backside, Intel eliminates the need for a front-side power grid, which, combined with direct EUV patterning, lowers the total number of masks and simplifies the front-end metal process. By using low-n absorber reticles with tailored dimensional adjustments, Intel also enabled single-pass EUV patterning for the M0–M2 metal layers. This simplification of the lower metal layers reduces process complexity and helps offset the cost of adding extra backside metal layers, which are based on mature, low-cost fabrication techniques. As a result, the overall design process becomes easier and cheaper.

In addition, the backside metal layers of 18A's PowerVia are designed for low resistance and high thermal conductivity, which helps manage the increased power density from the GAA transistors. Also, carrier wafer bonding is optimized for heat removal through the backside, addressing the thermal challenges introduced by high-performance transistors. Finally, PowerVia is compatible with advanced packaging methods like Foveros and EMIB, though we already know this from the fact that Panther Lake uses 18A tiles as well as Foveros 3D.

Intel's comprehensive technical overview of its 18A process node has highlighted the architecture, performance, and manufacturability improvements that position it as a competitor to TSMC's upcoming N2. The 18A process introduces Intel's second-generation RibbonFET (GAA) transistors and the industry's first mass-production-ready backside power delivery network, PowerVia.

Together, these innovations enable up to 25% higher performance or 36% lower power consumption compared to Intel 3, while also increasing transistor density by about 30%.

Intel's PowerVia contributes an 8–10% density gain, 12% RC improvement in metal layers, and up to 10 times lower voltage droop.

The new node has also passed stringent JEDEC reliability tests, including 1000-hour high-temperature aging and extensive thermal cycling to verify that it can be used for designs meant to work for a long time. Additionally, Intel further streamlined front-end patterning using single-pass EUV at M0–M2, thereby reducing mask counts and simplifying the design.

However, whether or not 18A can help Intel restore some of the lustre to its brand remains to be seen, as the company continues to wade its way through rocky waters.

DISCLOSURES |  June 23, 2025  

A new variant of COVID-19 is on the rise globally, but the overall risk to the public remains low, according to a report from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Although the variant, NB.1.8.1, is increasing in proportion to other circulating variants, routine clinical surveillance data have not yielded any signs of increased severity associated with NB.1.8.1 compared to previously circulating variants, the WHO noted in the report.

In a logistic regression model comparing NB.1.8.1 to LP.8.1.1, NB.1.8.1 had an estimated higher relative growth advantage than co-circulating variants, according to the WHO. However, no evidence has appeared of increased COVID-19-related hospital admissions, deaths per hospitalizations, or all-cause mortality associated with the variant, the WHO report stated.

The symptoms of the NB.1.8.1 variant appear to be similar to prior variants of the virus, with such presenting symptoms as fever, headache, cough, runny nose, fatigue, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, said Shirin Mazumder, MD, an infectious diseases specialist in Memphis, Tennessee, in an interview.

“Sore throat is a common symptom of COVID-19 that occurs in upward of 70% of patients,” said Mazumder. Although some reports describe the sore throat associated with NB.1.8.1 as “razor blade” in terms of severity, whether this symptom is distinctive of the new variant remains unclear, she noted.

As for any added severity, the NB.1.8.1 variant does not appear to cause more severe disease, Mazumder told Medscape Medical News. “Although most people will recover after a COVID-19 infection, some will require hospital admission, and some will go on to develop long COVID, which we have seen with other variants,” she said. However, overall hospitalizations resulting from COVID-19 in the US are currently stable, she added.

The WHO's Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition regularly assesses how well the available COVID-19 vaccines are performing against any variants. Currently, the group advises that monovalent JN.1 or KP.2 are appropriate COVID-19 vaccine antigens, with monovalent LP.8.1 as an alternative vaccine antigen.

To date, no studies have reported any impact of NB.1.8.1 on clinical outcomes, and no available evidence suggests resistance to nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid), according to the WHO. However, the effectiveness of the current COVID vaccine against this variant remains unclear at present, Mazumder told Medscape Medical News.

“There are some reports that the NB.1.8.1 variant exhibits signs of immune escape, which may lower the immunity provided by vaccines and prior infection,” she noted. Yet, the variant is descended from the omicron lineage for which the current vaccine is effective, and ideally it will retain some prevention activity against NB.1.8.1 as well, she said.

Mazumder had no financial conflicts to disclose.

In patients discharged after hospitalization for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, cigarette smoking is associated with a significantly increased risk for readmission for recurrent bleeding within 30 days.

“Educating patients on the impact of smoking on their gastrointestinal health, along with providing resources for cessation, may help reduce readmission rates, improve overall health outcomes, and decrease healthcare costs associated with recurrent bleeding episodes,” the authors wrote.

This study, led by Dheeraj Alexander, MD, McLaren Health Care, Flint, Michigan, was published online in Digestive Diseases and Sciences.

Administrative databases may have inaccuracies owing to missing or incorrect codes. Key clinical details (eg, medication use, laboratory values, and outpatient healthcare utilization) were not available. The database only tracked in-state readmissions, potentially underestimating the true readmission rate.

Whether to measure Lp(a), a lipoprotein associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and how to use that information in risk assessment is a hot topic in cardiovascular medicine.

The American Heart Association recently introduced the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular EVENT (PREVENT) equations — an update to the pooled cohort equations. Neither risk calculator includes values for Lp(a).

A recent study looked at whether adding Lp(a) to the PREVENT equations would improve risk prediction. It found that including the lipid parameter yielded a modest improvement at a population level but appeared to be more useful for personalized risk assessment, particularly among lower-risk individuals.

“Our results validate the PREVENT equations on a population level and show that they perform well, both in people with and without high levels of Lp(a),” lead author of the study, Harpreet Bhatia, MD, University of California San Diego, told Medscape Medical News.

“While I think our results would not support adding Lp(a) to the PREVENT equations, they confirm that on an individual-patient basis Lp(a) can add information,” he commented.

Bhatia explained that the PREVENT risk equations are going to be the future paradigm of risk stratification in the primary prevention setting in the US, eventually replacing the pooled cohort equations which have been used for many years.

The reason that Lp(a) wasn't included in either risk score, he suspects is because the datasets on which the risk equations are based would not have these values available.

The PREVENT equations removed the consideration of race or ethnicity, as there is now acknowledgement that race is more of a social construct, but it is known that Lp(a) levels vary by ancestry, he said.

Bhatia believes that Lp(a) should be routinely tested at least once in all adults; “For those of us who practice preventive cardiology and lipidology, it can alter our clinical management.”

Current American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology cholesterol guidelines from 2018 do not recommend universal testing of Lp(a) but include it as a risk enhancing factor; updated guidelines are expected within the next year. Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and Canada and the US National Lipid Association do recommend measuring Lp(a).

For the current study, Bhatia and colleagues examined data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a US study of 6670 people started in the year 2000, and the UK Biobank, a study of over 500,000 individuals from the UK started around 2006. Participants had no known cardiovascular disease at baseline and most had an Lp(a) measurement.

Bhatia noted that his study used risk thresholds established for the pooled cohort equations, but it has not yet been decided what the cut points will be for the PREVENT equations. Low risk was defined as < 5%; borderline as 5%-7.5%; intermediate as 7.5%-20%, and high as ≥ 20% predicted 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease.

“Essentially, what we saw was that the PREVENT equations generally do a good job of putting people into those 10-year risk categories across the board,” Bhatia said.

However, they also found that within each category and across the board, if Lp(a) was high, then the cardiovascular risk was increased compared to individuals with a lower Lp(a) and sometimes quite significantly increased.

The researchers also tried to establish whether Lp(a) could improve risk prediction on top of the PREVENT equations, using the Net Reclassification Index (NRI) which looks at the percentage of people who would be reclassified based on the new model (the proportion who move up minus the proportion who move down). They found that Lp(a) levels led to a modest improvement in risk prediction according to the NRI.

In terms of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including elevated Lp(a) on top of the PREVENT equations appropriately reclassified about 6% of people. With regard to coronary artery disease, which Lp(a) is most strongly associated with, the NRI was about 8%.

Another measure of how well a new model predicts risk — the C index — found that the addition of Lp(a) did not significantly modify results.

“Our results suggest there does seem to be some improvement in risk prediction with Lp(a) for some individuals, particularly those at lower cardiovascular risk,” Bhattia said, an observation he described as “intriguing”.

He does not believe that new equations are needed that incorporate Lp(a).

He pointed out that statin therapy for prevention is more strongly recommended in intermediate/higher risk patients, with a weaker recommendation for those at lower risk when there's the presence of an additional risk enhancing factor.

“It may be that someone at low risk in the equations with an elevated Lp(a) may be eligible for starting statins.”

Bhatia already considers Lp(a) levels in this way in his clinic. He said that Lp(a) testing is simple and widely available, and the majority of people will only need to be tested once in their lifetime.

He explained that most people who have low or high levels would stay in those categories long term, while people who have intermediate or borderline levels (30-50 mg/dL or 75-125 nmol/L) may need repeat testing if something changes that can affect Lp(a) levels longer term such as going through menopause, or the development of kidney or thyroid disease.

In an editorial accompanying the publication, Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, MD, Framingham Center for Population and Prevention Science, Boston University, Framingham, Massachusetts, and Amit Khera, MD, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, said the results are a useful validation of the PREVENT risk equations in contemporary broad populations and large real-world clinical samples.

In terms of whether Lp(a) should be incorporated directly as a variable in the PREVENT equations, the editorialists have a similar view to Bhatia. “That appears unnecessary,” they wrote.

But, like Bhatia, they believe that Lp(a) should be measured once in everyone to help understand and individualize risk.

“Lp(a) is indeed a risk-enhancing, likely causal, factor for ASCVD. Its absence does not exonerate traditional risk factors, but its presence can amplify and personalize that risk, and help guide clinicians and patients regarding use and intensity of preventive therapies,” they concluded.

Also commenting on this latest study, was Nathan Wong, PhD, from the University of California Irvine School of Medicine.

He told Medscape Medical News that the analysis shows that the PREVENT risk score predicts ASCVD outcomes similarly in those with and without elevated Lp(a) levels. The stronger prediction of Lp(a) in lower risk people “argues for the need to promote increased screening in the broader population, including those at lower risk” he said noting that most recommendations in the past have focused on people at higher risk such as those with a personal history of ASCVD.

Wong agreed with Bhatia that the value of Lp(a) is more at the individual level than at the population wide level. But he does believe a risk score incorporating Lp(a) could be helpful for personalizing treatment strategies in certain individual patients, particularly for those with elevated Lp(a) levels who may not already be identified as high risk.

Indeed, Wong and colleagues recently published such a score and showed that incorporating Lp(a) into ASCVD risk prediction models developed using a real-world clinic population moderately improves performance over 10 years, with good generalizability when applied to other US population cohorts.

In that paper, a 25 mg/dL increment in Lp(a) was associated with a 23% increased risk for incident ASCVD. Levels ≥ 75 mg/dL conferred a near two-fold greater risk for ASCVD, including a 2.5-fold greater risk for stroke compared with Lp(a) levels < 25 mg/dL.

They also demonstrated that adding Lp(a) to the pooled cohort equations ASCVD risk calculator correctly reclassified 45% of borderline-intermediate risk patients who experienced incident ASCVD as high-risk. However, about 24% who did not experience events were incorrectly reclassified high-risk (for an NRI of 21%). He cited a use case of a Black man aged 65 years with an Lp(a) of 80 mg/dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 18% without considering Lp(a) who would be up-stratified to 24% after factoring in Lp(a).

“Based on current guidelines, this person would now be clearly recommended for a statin to lower his ASCVD risk which may not have been as certain based on the risk not incorporating Lp(a),” he said.

Recent studies have also shown identification of elevated Lp(a) levels can result in greater use of lipid-lowering therapy, he added.

Wong also agreed with Bhatia on the distinction between risk prediction in populations vs individuals.

“We don't practice medicine on populations. We practice it on individuals and for certain individuals a risk score that incorporates Lp(a) can reclassify their risk category significantly dependent on how high their Lp(a) is,” he stated.

Bhatia reported receiving consulting fees from Abbott, Arrowhead, Kaneka, and Novartis outside the submitted work. Wong reported receiving research support through his institution from Amgen, Novartis, and Regeneron, is on an advisory board for Amgen, and is a consultant and speaker for Novartis and a consultant for Ionis. Lloyd-Jones and Khera reported no disclosures.

A 59-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of left scrotal enlargement. Physical examination revealed no elevation in the bilateral renal or suprapubic regions. The bladder was located below the pubic bone and was non-tender without pressure. The left scrotum was enlarged with a palpable mass measuring 25 × 15 cm in size. The mass was characterised by a tough, smooth surface with a clear boundary.

MRI suggested a germ cell tumour; however, definitive diagnosis required surgical intervention.

This case, reported by urologist Lianglong Zhang and colleagues from Hami Central Hospital Affiliated to Xinjiang Medical University in Hami, China, documents a rare instance of angiomyofibroblastoma (AMF), a tumour typically observed in the vulva of women. Its occurrence in the inguinal region or scrotum in men is extremely uncommon.

The patient, a herdsman from a remote mountain village with limited education and minimal attention to his health, presented with a 2-year history of left-sided scrotal swelling. He had no history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or other diseases. His BMI was 25. His other medications, family, social, drug, allergy, and travel history were unremarkable.

On admission, vital signs — including blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation on room air, heart rate, and respiratory rate — were within normal limits. Physical examination revealed no elevation in the kidney area or suprapubic region. The kidneys were not palpable, and there was no costal ridge, costal lumbar, upper ureteral, quarterly costal, or middle ureteral tenderness. The left scrotum was enlarged with a palpable mass measuring 25 × 15 cm and characterised by a tough, smooth surface and clear boundary. The left testicle was not palpable, and the transillumination test result was negative.

No other abnormalities were found on inspection, auscultation, palpation, or percussion.

The ancillary examination results were as follows: Human chorionic gonadotropin, 0.72 mIU/mL; alpha-fetoprotein, 4.37 ng/mL; and Mycobacterium tuberculosis nucleic acid test, negative.

Enhanced CT of the urinary tract indicated a left testicular space-occupying lesion that was potentially a germ cell tumour, but other possibilities could not be excluded. Both kidneys were normal in size and morphology. No abnormal enhancement of the bilateral renal parenchyma was seen in the enhancement CT scan. The size and shape of the adrenal glands were normal.

The left inguinal canal is thickened, with a diameter of about 24 mm, and contains a low-density fat shadow. The volume of the left testicle increased significantly, measuring approximately 123 × 168 mm, with speckled calcifications and low-density fat shadows.

Moreover, there was no apparent abnormality in the urinary tract; however, the left inguinal canal was dilated. An MRI of the left scrotum included an abnormal signal in the scrotum size of 12.6 cm × 9.4 cm, potentially indicating a space-occupying lesion from a germ cell tumour, but other possibilities could not be excluded. The focal area showed necrosis. The left scrotal lesion was surgically resected. Histopathologic examination of the left scrotal mass revealed tumour boundaries were clear, and the mass was mainly composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in bundles. The cell morphology was mild, with no heterogeneity or clear nuclear atypia. Scattered thin-walled blood vessels with small-to-moderately large lumens and fat components were observed in the tumour. The focal area showed necrosis. On the basis of morphology and immunohistochemical phenotypes, the patient was considered to have a male genital tract AMF tumour.

The immunohistochemistry results were as follows: CD31 (foci+), S-100 (-), SALL-4 (-), desmin (+), caldesmon (-), CD117 (mast cell +), CD34 (+), catenin-β (nuclear +), HMB45 (-), melan-A (-), P16 (partially +), smooth muscle actin (-), myogenin (-), OCT3/4 (-), SALL4 (-), pancytokeratin (-), oestrogen receptor (-), epithelial membrane antigen (small foci +), MyoD1 (-), Ki-67 (2% +), and progesterone receptor (-).

These findings supported the diagnosis of AMF.

He has reported no discomfort, and superficial ultrasound and physical examinations have shown no abnormalities during the follow-up period.

“Scrotal AMF is a rare tumour that has an oval shape in the scrotum the size of a chicken egg. Patients often feel the mass but are asymptomatic. Imaging, pathologic findings, and tumour biomarkers can help diagnose and treat the patient. Surgery is the optimal option for patients, and no recurrences have been reported in patients with scrotal AMF. However, due to the low incidence of AMF, few in-depth studies have been conducted. Research on scrotal AMF is still in the early stage, and further exploration of the aetiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies is needed,” the authors concluded.

In a 12-month longitudinal analysis of long-term care facility residents across European countries, 57% experienced at least one healthcare-associated infection (HAI), with respiratory tract and urinary tract infections being the most common and leading to significant hospitalisations and deaths.

""Nevertheless, these data shed important light on a highly relevant topic within a health-care setting that is often neglected,"" the authors of a commentary wrote.

""There is a need for ongoing surveillance of infections, work to validate surveillance definitions, and more epidemiological data (eg, pathogen-specific burden, contribution of outbreak vs sporadic infections, and added burden of antimicrobial resistance),"" they added.

This study was led by Enrico Ricchizzi, PhD, Settore Innovazione nei Servizi Sanitari e Sociali, Regione Emilia-Romagna, Bologna, Italy. It was published online on June 16, 2025, in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

This study was limited by variability in implementation of the survey across participating facilities and the biased selection of long-term care facilities. The diverse types of facilities included introduced heterogeneity. Moreover, this study did not assess the effect of infection prevention measures or available local resources at each facility.

This study was supported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The authors declared having no competing interests.

DISCLOSURES |  June 23, 2025  

Migraine is associated with several complications and comorbidities that can significantly impact quality of life. Understanding risk profiles and monitoring for complications is paramount in managing patients living with migraine.

What do you know about the complications and comorbidities of migraine? Check your knowledge with this quiz.

Ischemic stroke is a complication among patients with migraine, especially among those who experience aura. Although the prevalence of stroke in migraine is relatively low, a recent review found that migraine with aura is consistently associated with higher risk for various cardiovascular complications than migraine without aura, with the evidence being the strongest for ischemic stroke. Lifestyle factors such as smoking and oral contraceptive use have also been found to increase the risk for stroke in patients with migraine.

Unilateral frontotemporal pain can be a typical symptom of migraine that is not as strongly associated with ischemic stroke, especially if it is not accompanied by aura; nausea and/or vomiting and mood changes are not strongly associated with ischemic stroke in patients with migraine as well. 

Learn more about migraine symptoms.

Depression and migraine are found to have a bidirectional association, as well as shared genetic factors. Further, depression can be linked to any severity of migraine; patients who are treated for migraine can still experience depression as well. The dysregulation of the hypothalamic and thalamic pathways has been implicated as a possible cause in both diseases. 

Learn more about depression in migraine.

Migrainous infarction is a rare complication that is defined as ischemic infarction in relevant areas occurring in a patient experiencing migraine with aura for over 60 minutes, which can be accounted for by no other International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) diagnosis. Data indicate that migrainous infarction is implicated in up to 1.5% of all ischemic stroke cases and typically occurs in younger (29-39 years) patients. However, when compared with ""strokes from traditional risk factors,"" researchers claim the prognosis for migrainous infarction is generally favorable.

Learn more about infarction in migraine.

Epilepsy is common in hemiplegic migraine, with one review citing occurrence in approximately 40% of patients with this migraine subtype. It also has a strong genetic component that it shares with epilepsy; several mutations, such as in the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, SCN1A, and PRRT2 genes, are seen in both diseases. As such, there is overlap in symptom presentation and even triggering mechanisms for both migraine and epilepsy, and the electrical signature of both diseases in the brain is similar.

Migraine without aura and retinal migraine can cause seizures in some patients, but they are not strongly associated with epilepsy. Migraine with aura is also a known seizure trigger, although not exclusively for epilepsy.

Learn more about migraine symptoms and presentation.

Sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea are also associated with migraine, and sleep deprivation is known to be a migraine trigger as well. Data indicate that sleep complaints are more prevalent in patients with chronic migraine, which is consistent with a recent survey finding that headache frequency, but not severity, was associated with insomnia. As headache frequency increases and migraine proceeds to chronification, clinicians should be aware of the potential for further sleep-related quality of life deficits.

A Medscape UK survey of more than 900 doctors in the United Kingdom has revealed significant levels of burnout and poor mental health despite many being content with life outside work.

The Medscape UK Wellness and Life Outside of Work Report 2025 found that 67% of doctors were very or somewhat happy with their work-life balance. However, 20% said they were very or somewhat unhappy. While 56% felt happy with their professional life, 28% were very or somewhat unhappy. 

More than 1 in 10 respondents (13%) rated their current mental health as poor or very poor. Susannah Basile, interim CEO of Doctors in Distress, called this “deeply concerning” but not unexpected. “With a doctor in the UK dying by suicide every 3 weeks, the stigma around seeking help must be challenged,” she told Medscape News UK. 

The charity is committed to creating “safe, supportive spaces where healthcare workers can process the emotional toll of their work before it reaches crisis point”, Basile said. Doctors in need of a supportive community are invited to join the Doctors in Distress support group, which runs on three days per week and is free of charge and confidential. 

Dr David Nicholl, committee member for the Doctors' Association UK, described the survey as “a valuable contribution to understanding the pressures and solutions to the well-being of doctors”. He noted concern over the 1 in 10 doctors who reported significant mental health issues.

Burnout affected more than one quarter of respondents (27%), with 5% saying they felt depressed and a further 14% reporting both depression and burnout. 

With one third of respondents working part-time, it would be important to understand whether there are differences between those working part-time and those working full-time, Nicholl suggested.

Work was cited as the sole or primary cause of burnout by more than 3 in 4 respondents, while only 10% blamed personal life factors. However, two thirds (67%) felt poor mental health strained their personal relationships. Almost half (48%) would accept a pay cut in exchange for a better work-life balance.

Dr Ananta Dave, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said NHS staff face ever-increasing workloads, time constraints, and administrative burdens. “These challenges have only intensified in recent years, in many cases requiring staff to seek support for their own mental health,” she told Medscape News UK.

Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), acknowledged that the survey showed most doctors are happy professionally but called the proportion who are unhappy “disheartening.”

“Far too many GPs are reporting stress and burnout as the numbers of patients who need our care continue to increase, while workforce numbers fail to keep up,” she told Medscape News UK.

Hawthorne noted that the General Medical Council has reported that GPs are the doctors least likely to be satisfied with their job and most likely to struggle with their workload. To prevent burnout, “it's important that all medical professionals can still have an appropriate work/life balance during periods of intense pressure.” 

Recent RCGP polling found that over 40% of GPs doubt they will still be working in general practice in 5 years, with many citing stress and burnout as reasons why they would quit. 

Hawthorne urged the government to devote more funding, alongside investment in recruitment and retention initiatives, to address the crisis. She sees the upcoming review of the NHS long-term workforce plan as an opportunity to “turn things around.”

Dave said that poor staff well-being is “a major and persistent issue” that undermines NHS capacity. She emphasised that anxiety, stress, depression, and other psychiatric conditions accounted for 26.4% of all NHS England workforce sickness absences in 2024.

In a prospective study of over 300 patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was associated with meaningful changes in clinical diagnosis and/or management in 63% of patients and a similar increase in diagnostic certainty.

“Integration of CMR into diagnostic imaging pathways may be reasonable to augment clinical diagnosis and management; however, further cost-effectiveness analyses are now warranted,” the study authors wrote.

This study was led by Adil Rajwani, PhD, of the Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia. It was published online on June 13, 2025, in Heart.

The study was limited by the impracticality of conducting a bias-free randomized trial of CMR vs no CMR. It was also limited by the assessment of CMR's impact only immediately after imaging, potentially missing later clinical insights. Medication protocols were not standardized, and the limited use of additional diagnostics such as optical coherence tomography may have influenced the findings.

This study was funded by a grant from the Royal Perth Hospital Medical Research Foundation in Australia. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

MINNEAPOLIS — Irregular night shift work is well known for its potential to cause sleep problems, but a new study suggested it can also be associated with an increased risk of developing migraines.

Overall, the systematic review and meta-analysis showed that individuals engaged in irregular shift work had a 61% higher likelihood of developing a migraine compared with fixed-shift workers.

Previous research has shown disruptions in circadian rhythm can increase the risk for migraines. Shift work in general has been linked to a lower quality and quantity of sleep, but individuals can take steps to mitigate the adverse impact night shift work has on sleep.

However, the nature of irregular night shift work can exacerbate circadian disruption.

While menstrual migraines have a hormonal trigger and chronic migraine is based on frequency, migraines associated with irregular shift work are due to rotating shifts, quick returns to work of less than 11 hours, and amplified triggers such as bright lights and dietary irregularities, Yohannes Woldeamanuel, MD, first author and assistant professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, told Medscape Medical News.

This type of migraine among individuals engaged in irregular shift work should be its own diagnostic entity separate from other migraine subtypes, the researchers explained.

“Shift work migraine disorder is distinguished by its etiology: Chronic circadian disruption from irregular night shift work,” Woldeamanuel said. “Mechanistically, it most likely involves hypothalamic dysregulation and circadian gene alterations, proposing a distinct phenotype requiring specific diagnostic criteria and management.”

The findings were presented here at the American Headache Society (AHS) Annual Meeting 2025.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Woldeamanuel and colleagues identified 51,642 participants across 17 cross-sectional and three cohort studies who engaged in irregular or rotational shift work — defined as having irregular night hours that changed every few days — who were compared with individuals who had nonrotational or fixed night shift work. Overall, 75% of the participants in the study were women.

The results showed participants who engaged in irregular shift work had significantly higher odds of developing migraine (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.32-1.96; P < .05). 

In three studies with data from 28,764 participants, the researchers found women were significantly more likely to develop migraine compared with men (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.85-3.33; P < .05).

The finding that women who engage in irregular shift work are at greater risk for migraine than men warrants further study, the investigators noted.

“Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to establish causality, neuroimaging to explore hypothalamic and other brain area changes, and trials evaluating mitigation strategies,” Woldeamanuel said. He noted he is conducting a clinical trial of diagnostic criteria and evaluating circadian interventions in shift workers who have chronic migraine.

“These findings support tailored management for shift workers to prevent migraine exacerbation,” said Woldeamanuel. “Screening shift workers for migraine, especially those with rotating schedules, is critical.”

Shift workers can lower circadian system disruption by limiting the number of consecutive night shifts to three or fewer, shortening the duration of the shifts, allowing for 48 hours or more of recovery time, reducing the number of “quick return” shifts with less than 11 hours of turnaround time, and using a shift rotation that moves the shift from morning to evening to night.

The use of circadian resetting tools such as blue blockers and timed light exposure can also help reduce the risk for migraine, the researchers said.

Researchers proposed shift work migraine disorder be considered as a distinct subgroup of other migraine types.

Under the proposed criteria, shift work migraine disorder would meet the criteria for migraine with or without aura and be present in a patient with a history of irregular shift work for at least 3 months.

The migraine should start or be worsened as a result of shift work within 24 hours of a shift change, and the patient should have evidence of circadian disruption, such as sleep-wake irregularities or excessive daytime sleepiness. Shift work migraine disorder would also be a diagnosis of exclusion, considered when it is not explained by a different medical condition or headache disorder.

“These criteria ensure the disorder is distinct from other migraine subtypes (eg, chronic migraine, menstrual migraine) by tying it to a specific environmental trigger (shift work) and circadian pathophysiology,” the researchers wrote in their study.

Commenting on the research for Medscape Medical News, Noah Rosen, MD, neurologist at Northwell Health in New York City, said he isn't convinced shift work migraine disorder should have its own distinct diagnosis. He noted that headaches associated with air travel are very similar but are not in a different diagnostic category.

“This is an interesting area, but with no great data to separate it from migraine with a sleep issue as trigger. It does not suggest a novel pain pathway or differentiation from migraine with other known sleep triggers,” Rosen told Medscape Medical News.

Rather than real-world descriptions, what is needed is the collection of more data with a more structured testing of the hypothesis, Rosen said. Evaluations with multi-sleep latency studies, modified sleep schedules, and preclinical studies would help researchers understand more about migraines associated with irregular shift work.

“While some of the preliminary work is interesting and suggestive of an underrecognized and undertreated situational trigger, there is little to suggest that it would merit a separate diagnosis,” he said.

This study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health. The authors reported no relevant financial relationships. Rosen has been a consultant for Allergan/AbbVie, Eli Lilly, Lundbeck, and Pfizer; served on the speaker's bureau for Allergen/AbbVie; been an editor for Springer; and been a speaker for the American Headache Society.

COMMENTARY

Christopher Labos, MD, CM, MSc

DISCLOSURES |  June 23, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

If you aren't a 19th century British sailor, then you need to watch this video because — spoiler alert — vitamin C won't keep you from getting sick. I'm Dr Christopher Labos for Medscape, and this is On Second Thought.

If you were blockading the continent during the Napoleonic Wars, then squirting some lemon juice into your beer probably made the difference between your teeth falling out and your teeth not falling out. There were a lot of ways to die if you were a British sailor during the Napoleonic Wars and, amazingly, French guns were not in the top three!

The discovery of how to prevent scurvy with vitamin C is a great medical detective story, and I highly recommend Stephen Bown's book, Scurvy: How a Surgeon, a Mariner, and a Gentleman Solved the Greatest Medical Mystery of the Age of Sail. But if your idea of sailing is taking the IKEA ferry — by the way, it's free and gives you a great view of the Statue of Liberty — then scurvy is probably not your biggest problem.

You probably take vitamin C because someone told you it prevents the common cold, and that person was probably Linus Pauling. Now, Linus Pauling was a very smart guy. He won two unrelated Nobel Prizes and, as far as I know, I haven't won any. So, when he wrote a book called Vitamin C and the Common Cold, people listened. And for some reason they don't seem to listen to me… Please follow me on X or Bluesky; social media is how I measure my self-worth.

In the book, he told people to take 3000 mg of vitamin C every day to live longer and healthier. He predicted vitamin C would eliminate the common cold and extend the human lifespan. In interviews, he claimed that people who took optimum amounts of vitamins and supplements would live 25-35 years longer and would be free of diseases.

Now, clearly the work of Nobel laureates needs to be taken seriously. But there is a condition called ""Nobel disease"" where, basically, you win a Nobel Prize and you think you're an expert in everything, and then subsequently go a little bit crazy and believe all kinds of nutty stuff. For example, Charles Richet won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Medicine and he believed in ghosts and telepathy; Pierre Curie attended seances; and a surprisingly large number of Nobel laureates became eugenicists. And then there was Kary Mullis, inventor of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Well, if you didn't know about that one, Google ""Kary Mullis and fluorescent talking raccoon."" You heard me: fluorescent talking raccoon. I'll wait here.

Now, Linus Pauling was not any of these things, although he did say people with sickle cell trait should get a tattoo on their forehead so nobody accidentally had babies with them. And he also said some stuff about aborting babies with sickle cell disease. So… eugenics light, maybe? But to be fair, a lot of people in the 1930s held similar views, and it's unclear how much the general public in the US really knew about what was going on in Germany.

But...

This was in 1968?! Jesus! Okay, never mind about that. 

So anyway, being a Nobel laureate doesn't make everything you say inherently right. Let's do some math. Does vitamin C prevent the common cold? Because we aren't doing the cancer stuff; I get too much hate mail as it is. Okay, fine: Vitamin C doesn't treat cancer. There! I said it! Alright? Everybody happy? I said it! 

But let's do the cold and flu stuff because there's an important lesson here. Does vitamin C prevent the common cold? To answer this question, I'm going to be using the data from the 2013 Cochrane review titled ""Vitamin C for Preventing and Treating the Common Cold."" It summarized 29 trials, including 11,306 participants, and is one of the most misquoted Cochrane reviews I have ever seen. 

Let's start with treatment. Does taking vitamin C when you get sick make you better? No. There were 10 studies that looked at this question, and these were people taking vitamin C when their symptoms started. It made no difference in symptom duration or severity. If you start taking vitamin C at the onset of symptoms, it does nothing. So, if you're somebody who starts popping vitamin C tablets when you get sick, this Cochrane review does not support that practice. The commercials and celebrity endorsements are lying to you.

The only reason the marketing geniuses behind vitamin C can say anything positive is because there's another way to take vitamin C — and no, I don't mean as a suppository. You can take it as a regular supplement every day of your life, which is great for capitalism but inconvenient for you as a healthcare user. So then the question becomes, if you take vitamin C every day of your life as a regular supplementation strategy, will that prevent you from getting sick? Also no. The incidence of common colds is not reduced in the general population with regular vitamin C supplementation. It says that very clearly in the review.

The only benefit observed in the 2013 review was vitamin C's effect on symptom duration. If you take vitamin C every day of your life, when you get sick — and you will still get sick the same number of times —your symptoms will go away faster. How much faster, you ask? I'm glad you did. According to this analysis, it reduces cold symptom duration by 7.7% on average. And what does that mean? Well, let's assume your cold lasts for 5 days. That is 120 hours for those of us living on planet Earth. If we take the vitamin C meta-analysis at face value, your cold will go away 9 hours faster. You're spending $30 a month (or $360 a year) for 9 hours of symptom relief. I'm not sure that's cost-effective. 

So, if that's the case, why do people claim that vitamin C can prevent the common cold? Well, welcome to the wonderful world of subgroup analysis — it's kind of nuts here! If you limit the Cochrane review to the five studies that tested vitamin C in periods of short-term physical stress or cold temperatures, that's where you see a benefit. Let's break that down. 

Three studies tested the effect of vitamin C among ultramarathon runners in South Africa, so that was the short-term physical stress part — because running a marathon is bad enough, but running an ultramarathon is incrementally worse. The cold temperatures (which made up the bulk of this subgroup) were examined in two studies. The first study observed Canadian soldiers on military maneuvers, because, as you know, Canada's a freezing wasteland and I ride my moose to work every day at my igloo medical clinic. The other study (which is where the bulk of the cold temperature patients came from) involved skiers. You might think, Okay, these were Olympic skiers enduring high-stress and cold-weather environments. But surprisingly, no. It was a study of children attending a ski school in Switzerland, which actually sounds like a pretty good vacation and I assume cocoa was involved. 

What's often left out of this discussion is the fact that other, longer-duration studies, like one in US Marines and another one in kids attending swim schools, didn't show a benefit. So, you really have to pick and choose to see a signal here. In the general population, there's no benefit — only in this very eclectic and specific subgroup of patients. 

If you know something about statistics, you know how dangerous subgroup analysis can be. Cut up the data into ever thinner salami slices and you can find some wild and ludicrous results. Remember the ISIS-2 trial? It showed that aspirin efficacy post-myocardial infarction varied by astrological sign. That's the quintessential example of how multiple-hypothesis testing can generate spurious results. 

Random chance is a major factor in life. Random chance is why you can use real data to show that the divorce rate in the UK correlates with the number of movies that Disney has released in any given year. Go data dredging and you can find any association if you torture the data enough. 

Overall, vitamin C does nothing for the common cold. Even at the most forgiving, it shortens symptoms by a few hours, which I think is just spurious given the incredible heterogeneity in the published research. But if you ignore all that, you only see a clinically meaningful difference if you're a South African ultramarathoner, a Canadian soldier, or a child attending a ski school in Switzerland. And you're probably none of those things — just like you're not a 19th century British sailor.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Giving birth to a child after 40 is becoming more and more common – but it can entail an increased risk to the child. A new study based on data from over 300,000 births in Sweden shows that children of older mothers are more often born prematurely or with complications, especially when the mother is 45 years of age or older.

In large parts of the world, women are having children later and later in life. In Sweden, 4.8% of mothers were 40 years of age or older in 2022. Previous research has shown that older mothers differ from younger mothers in several respects such as having a higher BMI, a higher proportion having utilised assisted reproductive technology, an increased risk of certain diseases during pregnancy, and a higher proportion of births via Caesarean section. With this in mind, the researchers in the current study wanted to investigate how the mother's age affected the health of her newborn baby.

In the study, which is published in Acta Pedriatica, the researchers looked at data from Sweden's National Medical Birth Register, which is maintained by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and includes all pregnancies from week 22 that lead to childbirth. A total of 312,221 children born to women over 34 years of age in the period 2010–2022 were included in the study, excluding twin births. The babies were divided into three groups according to their mother's age: 35–39 years, 40–44 years, and 45 years and older. The researchers were particularly interested in how the health of the child at birth was affected when their mother was older than 39 years. The children born to mothers aged 35–39 thus served as a reference group.

First of all, we could see that for babies born in Sweden, serious complications are rare, regardless of the mother's age. But we also found that children of older mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight relative to length of pregnancy, and low blood sugar compared to babies born to mothers aged 35–39 years. The study showed that the highest risks of all were to babies born to mothers 45 years and older.""

Sofia Voss, study's lead author

Stillbirth is uncommon in Sweden, but occurred in 0.83% of pregnancies in women who were 45 years or older. This can be compared to a rate of 0.42% in women aged 35–39 years.

Concerning premature birth, 4.8% of these cases occurred in the group of mothers aged 35–39. Among women aged 40 to 44, the corresponding figure rose to 6.1%, and among women aged 45 or older, 8.4% of their babies were born prematurely.

Previous studies have mainly compared babies born to young mothers with those born to older mothers. In the present study, the researchers were interested in getting a more detailed picture of the distribution of risk among the older mothers.

""By comparing different ranges of advanced age when giving birth, the study can also contribute to better, and better targeted, information for women planning future pregnancies. As the share of older mothers rises, our study can help to target screening and interventions to where they will have the most benefit. But it's also important to inform the public so that they can make informed choices,"" says Sofia Voss.

The study was carried out in a collaboration between researchers from Uppsala University and Linköping University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Zebrafish study reveals hidden dangers in recycled plastic","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250623/Zebrafish-study-reveals-hidden-dangers-in-recycled-plastic.aspx","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 05:03:00 GMT","

A single pellet of recycled plastic can contain over 80 different chemicals. A new study with researchers from University of Gothenburg and Leipzig shows that recycled polyethylene plastic can leach chemicals into water causing impacts in the hormone systems and lipid metabolism of zebrafish larvae.

The plastic pollution crisis has reached global levels, threatening both planetary and human health, and recycling is proposed as one of the solutions to the plastics pollution crisis. However, as plastics contain thousands of chemical additives and other substances that can be toxic, and these are almost never declared, hazardous chemicals can indiscriminately end up in recycled products.

In a new study, researchers bought plastic pellets recycled from polyethylene plastic from different parts of the world and let the pellets soak in water for 48 hours. After which zebrafish larvae were exposed to the water for five days. The experimental results show increases in gene expression relating to lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and endocrine regulation in the larvae.

These short leaching times and exposure times are yet another indicator of the risks that chemicals in plastics pose to living organisms. The impacts that we measured show that these exposures have the potential to change the physiology and health of the fish.""

Azora König Kardgar, lead author and researcher in ecotoxicology, University of Gothenburg

Previous research has shown similar effects to humans, including threats to reproductive health and obesity, from exposure to toxic chemicals in plastics. Some chemicals used as additives in plastics and substances that contaminate plastics are known to disturb hormones, with potential impacts on fertility, child development, links to certain cancers, and metabolic disorders including obesity and diabetes.

""This is the main obstacle with the idea of recycling plastic. We never have full knowledge of what chemicals will end up in an item made of recycled plastic. And there is also a significant risk of chemical mixing events occuring, which render the recycled plastic toxic,"" says Bethanie Carney Almroth, professor at the University of Gothenburg and principal investigator on the project.

Apart from the study on the impact that recycled plastics have on zebra fish larvae, the researcher also conducted a chemical analysis of the chemicals leaching from the plastic pellets to the water. And they found a lot of different chemical compounds, but the mixture altered between different samples of pellets.

""We identified common plastics chemicals, including UV-stabilizers and plasticizers, as well as chemicals that are not used as plastics additives, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and biocides. These may have contaminated the plastics during their first use phase, prior to becoming waste and being recycled. This is further evidence of the complicated issue of plastics waste flows, and of toxic chemicals contaminating recycled plastics,"" says Eric Carmona, researcher at Department of Exposure Science, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig.

Representatives from the nations of the world are preparing to head to Geneva, Switzerland, in August, for what is planned to be the final negotiating meeting for a Global Plastics Treaty at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee under the United Nations Environmental Program. The authors of the work stress that negotiators and decision-makers must include provisions to ban or reduce hazardous chemicals in plastics, and to increase transparency and reporting along plastics value chains. Plastics cannot be recycled in a safe and sustainable manner if hazardous chemicals are not addressed.

""This work clearly demonstrates the need to address toxic chemicals in plastics materials and products, across their life cycle"", says Professor Bethanie Carney Almroth. ""We cannot safely produce and use recycled plastics if we cannot trace chemicals throughout production, use and waste phases.""

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide. However, the mechanisms controlling the early stages of prostate cancer formation are poorly understood.

In a study published in the prestigious journal Nature Cancer, researchers led by Professor Cédric Blanpain, MD/PhD, WELBIO researcher, director of the Stem Cells and Cancer Laboratory, and professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, discovered that inflammation induced by cancer-associated mutations leads to the reprogramming of mutated cells into cell states essential for tumor initiation.

Chen Jiang and colleagues studied the molecular mechanisms regulating the early stages of prostate cancer initiation. They discovered that cellular reprogramming events leading to cancer formation occur differently in different regions of the prostate. The ULB researchers discovered that cellular reprogramming mediated by inflammatory activation was associated with the most severe cases of prostate cancer in human.

It is exciting to see that the cellular reprogramming identified in the mouse model correlates with more aggressive prostate cancers in men, suggesting that the reprogramming markers we identified could serve as a predictive biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer.""

Dr. Chen Jiang, first author of the article

Using molecular profiling during prostate tumor initiation, the researchers identified that inflammatory activation is a key regulator of cellular reprogramming and tumor initiation. Pharmacologically blocking inflammation prevents cellular reprogramming and prostate tumor initiation. ""By identifying the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular reprogramming required for prostate tumor formation, our results pave the way for new therapeutic approaches targeting inflammation-induced reprogramming, which could prevent the formation of prostate cancers and potentially other cancers,"" comments Professor Cédric Blanpain, the director of this study.

This work is a collaborative effort between the team of Pr Blanpain (ULB) and Pr Sifrim (KUL).

This work was made possible thanks to the support of the FNRS, TELEVIE, the WEL Research Institute, the Fondation Contre le Cancer, the Julie and Françoise Drion Foundation, the André Vésale Association, the ULB Foundation, the Yvonne Boël Foundation, and the European Research Council (ERC).

Researchers have discovered that the most aggressive melanomas, the deadliest form of skin cancer, overactivate two key processes in mitochondria, the components of cells that provide energy. Blocking these pathways with currently available drugs effectively killed melanoma cells. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

By mapping the proteins expressed in 151 tumor and normal skin samples, investigators found that the most aggressive melanomas hyper-activate the machinery that builds mitochondrial proteins and the mitochondrial system that turns nutrients into energy.

Remarkably, blocking these pathways effectively halted or killed melanoma cells cultured in lab dishes. Two types of drugs accomplished this: antibiotics-originally designed to block bacterial protein synthesis machinery, which closely resembles the machinery found in mitochondria-and specialized energy-production inhibitors. Importantly, non-cancerous skin cells remained mostly unaffected, highlighting the safety and specificity of these treatment approaches.

This discovery identifies melanoma's excessive reliance on mitochondrial energy as its Achilles' heel, revealing a therapeutic vulnerability that we can exploit with existing drugs. By pairing mitochondrial blockers with today's standards of care, we may cut off a major escape route that cancers use to resist therapy and come back.""

Jeovanis Gil, PhD, senior author of Lund University, Sweden

Dr. Gil added that the mitochondrial-protein signature his team discovered can be measured in routine biopsy material and could serve as a biomarker to identify patients most likely to benefit from mitochondrial-targeted add-on therapies. By enabling clinicians to match treatments to each patient's tumor biology, these findings mark a step forward for precision medicine in melanoma. Moreover, because mitochondrial rewiring fuels resistance across many cancers, success in melanoma could open the door to similar personalized combination strategies in other hard-to-treat cancers.

Why do men see more dramatic results from the keto diet? Explore the latest science on how hormones and metabolism shape weight loss success for men and women.

Study: Sex differences in ketogenic diet: are men more likely than women to lose weight? Image Credit: Tatiana Bralnina / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers reviewed sex differences in the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) for weight loss, revealing that men show significantly greater weight loss than women under identical KD protocols. For example, in a 45-day clinical trial, men lost an average of 11.63% of body weight compared to 8.95% in women.

Women's muscles work differently. Females naturally have more slow-twitch muscle fibers built for endurance activities, which may make traditional exercise more effective for their weight loss than strict ketosis.

Obesity is a significant public health concern worldwide and is also closely related to cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and cancers. In 2020, 2.6 billion people aged over five were overweight or obese, and this figure is estimated to exceed four billion by 2035. Dietary interventions for obesity have become a focal point in recent years, with various weight loss strategies being promoted.

The traditional low-fat diet is widely used, but it may promote excessive carbohydrate intake, which could exacerbate weight concerns and lipid abnormalities. In contrast, KD is an ultra-low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and high-fat dietary approach. KD induces a state of ketosis, in which the body uses ketone bodies as its primary energy source instead of glucose.

As such, KD has gained popularity as an effective weight loss strategy. Despite the significant weight loss associated with KD, notable sex differences persist. The present study reviewed the literature on the mechanisms of KD in obesity treatment and the sex differences resulting from interactions between hormones and innate factors.

Gut genes react differently. When researchers altered intestinal genes in mice, females produced significantly more fat-burning enzymes (HMGCS2) – suggesting women's digestive systems might respond uniquely to diet changes.

Only minimal ketones are produced under standard dietary conditions. However, KD tricks the body into mimicking a fasting state, and carbohydrate scarcity leads to the accumulation of acetyl-CoA. This triggers the liver into an overdrive, producing excess ketones, such as acetoacetate, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate, byproducts of fat metabolism.

Further, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the brain's energy sources to ketones and glucose. During fasting, ketones account for 25% to 75% of the brain's energy demands. Thus, KD can maintain regular brain energy supply and peripheral blood glucose levels, promote fat breakdown, and reduce lipogenesis. KD promotes weight loss through various mechanisms.

KD suppresses appetite by elevating peptide neurotransmitters (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and decreasing appetite-regulating hormones (e.g., ghrelin and cholecystokinin), reducing food intake. Furthermore, KD promotes the breakdown of visceral fat, depleting liver glycogen storage and reducing visceral fat accumulation. KD also alters the gut microbiota function, which exhibits sex-specific variations such as a higher abundance of fat-metabolizing bacteria like Bacteroidetes in males, reducing short-chain fatty acid production, which impacts the gut-brain axis signaling.

The overview of the KD's mechanism. Under normal metabolic conditions, glucose serves as the primary energy substrate and is metabolized into pyruvate. This pyruvate is then converted to acetyl CoA, generating oxaloacetate, which enters the TCA cycle to produce ATP. However, under ketogenic dietary states, the synthesis of oxaloacetate is restricted, impeding the normal progression of the TCA cycle. Consequently, a substantial consumption of fat occurs, with processes such as fatty acid activation and β-oxidation generating acetyl-CoA, which promotes the production of ketone bodies. Subsequently, this ketogenesis process yields energy and inhibits appetite, while also shifting the brain to a “fat-fueled” energy mode.

Inflammation plays a hidden role. Studies found women's bodies naturally produce more inflammation-linked fat molecules during rest, potentially making fat breakdown harder when shifting to ketosis.

While studies have not systematically examined the genetic underpinnings of KD-induced sex disparities, literature suggests that these differences may be intricately linked to neurotransmitter levels, genetic factors, intermediate phenotypes, and individual sensitivity to environmental stimuli. Specifically, KD reduces the levels of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which affect feeding behaviors.

Catecholamines also inhibit appetite and decrease food intake, helping control calorie intake. Males accumulate fat centrally (visceral fat), which is more readily metabolized under KD conditions, while females store fat subcutaneously. This sex-specific disparity in fat distribution could be linked to the effects of norepinephrine on regional adipose tissue, which is influenced by differing densities and affinities of adrenergic receptors, accounting for variations in KD's weight loss effects between females and males. Further, the differential response to KD between sexes may be attributed to estrogen, which can increase the sensitivity of α-adrenergic receptors that inhibit fat breakdown.

A study showed that male murine models on KD achieved weight loss and glycemic control, whereas their female counterparts had a slight weight gain, delayed onset of insulin resistance, and compromised glucose tolerance. However, eliminating endogenous estrogen production improved glycemic control and decreased adiposity, comparable to males. Furthermore, testosterone plays a crucial role in the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

Evidence suggests that testosterone enhances norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in isolated adipocytes from male rats by increasing the number of β-adrenergic receptors that promote fat breakdown. Visceral fat converts testosterone into estrogen in males. As such, an increase in body fat percentage tends to increase estrogen levels in males, while testosterone levels decrease. A recent clinical study reported that overweight males benefit from KD through increased testicular hormone profiles, elevated testosterone/SHBG levels, and reduced obesity markers.

The diet's medical origins. Before becoming a weight-loss trend, this approach successfully treated epilepsy in the 1920s but was abandoned when seizure medications emerged decades later.

For premenopausal women, the menstrual cycle introduces another layer of complexity. The review highlights that during the luteal phase, elevated progesterone levels can impair insulin sensitivity and increase carbohydrate cravings, making it more difficult to achieve and maintain the state of ketosis necessary for the diet to be effective.

Furthermore, sex disparities exist in immediate energy sources in resting and postprandial states. Females tend to incorporate postprandial free fatty acids (FFAs) into triglycerides, storing fat and using carbohydrates as an energy source. In contrast, males generate energy through FFA oxidation, storing carbohydrates as glycogen. As such, females following KD tend to store fat and face difficulties in fat consumption and mobilization.

KD is also reported to be effective for muscle growth. A randomized controlled trial found that individuals following KD for six weeks gained more muscle than those on a regular diet. Notably, another study found that KD may adversely affect muscle fatigue in young, healthy females, potentially influencing their perception of fatigue. This suggests that the adverse effects of KD on muscle endurance in females may influence the efficacy of weight loss. Finally, differences in brain regulation, such as the reduced potency of the energy-regulating neuropeptide POMC in female mice, also suggest a neurobiological basis for the differing outcomes.

Taken together, obesity manifests differently in females and males, and sex differences influence the effectiveness of KD in obesity treatment. Current evidence suggests that KD is most effective in males, followed by postmenopausal females, with its efficacy limited in premenopausal females. These differences could be attributed to genetics, sex hormones, the menstrual cycle, neurotransmitters, neural regulation in energy-expending brain regions, gut microbiota, and immunity. Overall, the study offered insights for improving weight loss strategies and facilitating personalized preventive and therapeutic measures. The authors note that more research in ethnically diverse populations is needed to validate these findings.

Kim Beckham, an insurance agent in Victoria, Texas, had seen friends suffer so badly from shingles that she wanted to receive the first approved shingles vaccine as soon as it became available, even if she had to pay for it out-of-pocket.

Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. So, in 2016, she celebrated her 60th birthday at her local CVS.

""I was there when they opened,"" Beckham recalled. After getting her Zostavax shot, she said, ""I felt really relieved."" She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as a pneumonia shot, an RSV vaccine to guard against respiratory syncytial virus, annual flu shots and all recommended covid-19 vaccinations.

Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated.

Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, California, has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. ""I'm sort of hectoring,"" she acknowledged.

Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella as a child, in case her immunity to measles had waned.

For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody foresaw.

The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt.

On June 9, Kennedy fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later replaced them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. But so far, Kennedy has not tried to curb access to the shots for older Americans.

The evidence that vaccines are beneficial remains overwhelming.

The phrase ""Vaccines are not just for kids anymore"" has become a favorite for William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

""The population over 65, which often suffers the worst impact of respiratory viruses and others, now has the benefit of vaccines that can prevent much of that serious illness,"" he said.

Take influenza, which annually sends from 140,000 to 710,000 people to hospitals, most of them seniors, and is fatal to 10% of hospitalized older adults. 

For about 15 years, the CDC has approved several enhanced flu vaccines for people 65 and older. More effective than the standard formulation, they either contain higher levels of the antigen that builds protection against the virus or incorporate an adjuvant that creates a stronger immune response. Or they're recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels.

In a meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, ""all the enhanced vaccine products were superior to the standard dose for preventing hospitalizations,"" said Rebecca Morgan, a health research methodologist at Case Western Reserve University and an author of the study.

Compared with the standard flu shot, the enhanced vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu in older adults, by at least 11% and up to 18%. The CDC advises adults 65 and older to receive the enhanced vaccines, as many already do.

More good news: Vaccines to prevent respiratory syncytial virus in people 60 and older are performing admirably.

RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. ""Season in and season out,"" Schaffner said, ""it produces outbreaks of serious respiratory illness that rivals influenza.""

Because the FDA first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided ""the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context,"" said Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open.

In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider.

The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older.

Immunocompromised patients, despite having a somewhat lower level of protection from the vaccine, will also benefit from it, Terebuh said. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. That, she said, ""shouldn't dissuade people.""

The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they're at higher risk of severe illness (from, say, heart disease).

As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine whether the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination.

People 65 and up express the greatest confidence in vaccine safety of any adult group, a KFF survey found in April. More than 80% said they were ""very ""or ""somewhat confident"" about MMR, shingles, pneumonia, and flu shots.

Although the covid vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety.

Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines.

Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. ""People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated,"" said Pascal Geldsetzer, an epidemiologist at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study.

""It's hard to know whether this is cause and effect,"" he said, ""or whether they're less likely to develop dementia anyway.""

So the Stanford team took advantage of a ""natural experiment"" when the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was introduced in Wales. Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren't eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible.

In the sample of nearly 300,000 adults whose birthdays fell close to either side of that date, almost half of the eligible group received the vaccine, but virtually nobody in the older group did.

""Just as in a randomized trial, these comparison groups should be similar in every way,"" Geldsetzer explained. A substantial reduction in dementia diagnoses in the vaccine-eligible group, with a much stronger protective effect in women, therefore constitutes ""more powerful and convincing evidence,"" he said.

The team also found reduced rates of dementia after shingles vaccines were introduced in Australia and other countries. ""We keep seeing this in one dataset after another,"" Geldsetzer said.

In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect.

By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group.

How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. Perhaps the vaccine revs up the immune system in general or affects inflammation.

""I don't think anybody knows,"" said Paul Harrison, a psychiatrist at Oxford and a senior author of the study. But, he added, ""I'm now convinced there's something real here.""

Shingrix, now recommended for adults over 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. In 2021, however, only 41% of adults 60 and older had received one dose of either shingles vaccine.

A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial.

And ""if you needed another reason to get this vaccine,"" Schaffner said, ""here it is.""

Insulin resistance detected by routine triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index can flag people with early Alzheimer's who are four times more likely to present rapid cognitive decline, according to new research presented at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025.

Neurologists at the University of Brescia reviewed records for 315 non-diabetic patients with cognitive deficits, including 200 with biologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. All subjects underwent an assessment of insulin resistance using the TyG index and a clinical follow-up of 3 years. When patients were divided according to TyG index, those in the highest third of the Mild Cognitive Impairment AD subgroup deteriorated far more quickly than their lower-TyG peers, losing >2.5 points on the Mini Mental State Examination per year (hazard ratio 4.08, 95% CI 1.06–15.73). No such link appeared in the non-AD cohort.

Once mild cognitive impairment is diagnosed, families always ask how fast it will progress. Our data show that a simple metabolic marker available in every hospital laboratory can help identify more vulnerable subjects who may be suitable candidates for targeted therapy or specific intervention strategies.""

Dr. Bianca Gumina, lead investigator 

While insulin resistance has been linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, its role in how quickly the condition progresses has received less attention. This study aimed to fill that gap by focusing on its impact during the prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, when patients follow highly variable trajectories. The researchers used the TyG index, which offers a low-cost, routinely available surrogate for insulin resistance, to explore whether metabolic dysfunction could help predict the pace of cognitive decline after diagnosis.

In AD specifically, insulin resistance is believed to impair neuronal glucose uptake, promote amyloid accumulation, disrupt the blood–brain barrier, and fuel inflammation – pathways that are less relevant or differently regulated in other neurodegenerative diseases.

""We were surprised to see the effect only in the Alzheimer's spectrum and not in other neurodegenerative diseases"", Dr. Gumina noted. ""It suggests a disease-specific vulnerability to metabolic stress during the prodromal window, when interventions may still change the trajectory.""

The researchers at University of Brescia, led by Professor Padovani and Professor Pilotto, found that high TyG was also associated with blood–brain barrier disruption and cardiovascular risk factors, yet it showed no interaction with the APOE ε4 genotype, indicating that metabolic and genetic risks may act through distinct pathways.

Identifying high-TyG patients could refine enrolment for anti-amyloid or anti-tau trials and prompt earlier lifestyle or pharmacological measures to improve insulin sensitivity. The researchers are currently investigating whether TyG levels also track with neuroimaging biomarkers to aid earlier detection and stratification.

""If targeting metabolism can delay progression, we will have a readily modifiable target that works alongside emerging disease-modifying drugs"", concluded Dr. Gumina.

Twenty-four players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team training camp in Commerce City, Colorado that will run from June 23-July 2. From June 23-June 26, the camp will run concurrently with the U.S. Women's National Team so U.S. head coach Emma Hayes and her staff can observe trainings. The U-23s will also attend the USA vs. Ireland match on June 26 at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park. The U-23s will stay in Denver to train after the USWNT leaves for Cincinnati and then Washington, D.C. to finish its slate of matches.

The U.S. U-23s are coming off a pair of games in late May and early June in Germany where it split matches with its German counterparts as each team won one game by a 2-1 score. Nine players on the roster for Colorado were in Germany, but four additional players who were with the U-23s last month – goalkeeper Angelina Anderson, defenders Jordyn Bugg and Lilly Reale and midfielder Sam Meza -- will be with the senior USWNT in Colorado.

The U-23 programming in Colorado is another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team.

“Players from the Futures Camp in January and the two U-23 camps this year, in LA and Germany, are now getting senior team call-ups and that's what we want to see,” said Hayes. “It doesn't mean that some of these players won't be in with the 23s down the line, or that some U-23 players who haven't been called up yet to the full team won't get their chances, but this is the kind of symbiosis we want between programs. We want to do what's best for the players to give them National Team exposures so they are as prepared as possible for '27, '28 and even '31.”

Goalkeepers (3): Emmie Allen (Bay FC; High Point, N.C.), Mia Justus (Utah Royals FC; Lakewood, Ohio), Madison Prohaska (Seattle Reign FC; West Chester, Ohio)

Defenders (8): Lauren Flynn (Utah Royals FC; Arlington, Va.), Heather Gilchrist (Florida State; Boulder, Colo.), Emily Mason (Seattle Reign FC; Flemington, N.J.), Quincy McMahon (San Diego Wave; Highlands Ranch, Colo.), Makenna Morris (Washington Spirit; Germantown, Md.), Ayo Oke (CF Pachuca; Lawrenceville, Ga.), Jayden Perry (Portland Thorns FC; Trabuco Hills, Calif.), Evelyn Shores (North Carolina; Atlanta, Ga.)

Midfielders (7): Maggie Graham (Houston Dash; Atlanta, Ga.),Taylor Huff (Bay FC; Mansfield, Ohio), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Ally Lemos (Orlando Pride; Glendora, Calif.), Yuna McCormack (Florida State; Mill Valley, Calif.), Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC; Seattle, Wash.), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.)

Forwards (6): Emeri Adames (Seattle Reign FC; Red Oak, Texas), Madeline Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC; Edina, Minn.), Simone Jackson (Orlando Pride; Redondo Beach, Calif.), Giana Riley (Florida State; Manteca, Calif.), Jaedyn Shaw (North Carolina Courage; Frisco, Texas), Riley Tiernan (Angel City FC; Voorhees, N.J.)

The U.S. U-23 WNT roster features players that span five birth years from 2006 to 2002, which is the age cut-off for players to be a part of the U.S. U-23 WNT this year.

This U-23 camp will be led by Yolanda Thomas, who is an assistant coach with the 2024 NWSL Champion Orlando Pride.

ARLINGTON, Texas – Mauricio Pochettino smiled and shook his head in disbelief. He's been asked about Malik Tillman quite a few times during this Gold Cup, and he's running out of ways to say the same thing.

""It's difficult to define him because, what a player, no?"" Pochettino said. 

Tillman scored the opening goal for the U.S. men's national team in what was ultimately a 2-1 win over Haiti to close out the group stage on Sunday at AT&T Stadium. The Americans had already clinched a spot in the knockout round last week after beating both Trinidad and Tobago and then Saudi Arabia. But winning all three games gave the squad nine points and put them at the top of Group D. 

The U.S. will recover for a week before facing Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Sunday, June 29 in Minneapolis (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

Tillman, who has started in all three Gold Cup matches so far, scored his third goal of the tournament in the 10th minute when he headed home a right-footed cross from Brenden Aaronson.

""One of the scouting reports was that the back door is open,"" Aaronson said. ""We have quality with our wingers and are always dangerous with Jack [McGlynn], Diego [Luna] and then with me today, I just saw an overloaded back post and I just thought, ‘Yeah I'm going to hang it out back there.""

Tillman was the most entertaining part of the match and used his finesse to consistently put himself in threatening positions. He could have had more goals had those other chances not been called back in the second half. 

First, there was an unintentional handball in the 64th minute. 

Moments later, Tillman collected a pass over the back line from Tyler Adams, made a 360-degree turn, and finished only to have that goal ruled offside.

And then in the 74th minute, Tillman brought the ball down with exceptional control, but his shot went wide left. Even if it had gone in, there might have been an argument for offside.

One minute later, Patrick Agyemang scored the game-winner to give the USMNT its final 2-1 scoreline. It was his fifth goal in nine games.

""To be honest, I get frustrated,"" Tillman admittedly told reporters after the game. ""I don't know if you guys can see it, but I try to keep it more inside of me and not to show it. But yeah, I'm frustrated. Even now I'm still quite disappointed. I should have scored at least one more.""

It's taken some time for Tillman to find his confidence and just get into a groove on the international stage. While he scored 16 goals in 34 appearances for PSV Eindhoven last season, he had never found the back of the net for the USMNT before the Gold Cup. Now, the 23-year-old midfielder has scored three goals in three games.

""What a player that is showing this camp his talent and capacity,"" said Pochettino, who recently described Tillman as one of the most talented players in the country. ""The work ethic and the way he's really aggressive – he recovered a lot of balls. 

""He's always trying to help the team press, chasing back, playing in a different position. He can appear like a No. 10 in between the lines, he can be on the right or the left side, he can drop and play like a No. 8 or a No. 6. 

""What a talented player. I'm so pleased with him. So pleased. He's a lovely guy, and he's started to find himself. The team is much better when he's involved in the game.""

Now, however, the stakes get higher. While Saudi Arabia and Haiti were solid opponents for a young American squad that's only played together for a couple of weeks, Costa Rica will pose a stiffer test. As will any potential mix of Mexico, Panama or Canada – teams the U.S. will likely have to face in order to win the Gold Cup. 

In those matchups, Tillman's missed opportunities could cost the U.S. So too could the mistake goalkeeper Matt Freese made when he and Tim Ream's miscommunication led to Haiti equalizing in the 18th minute.

But the USMNT has done what it's needed to do so far by winning its group and advancing to the Gold Cup quarterfinals when it could have spiraled after those embarrassing pre-tournament losses.

""The steps that we've made I think are huge,"" Aaronson said. ""From two not great results with Turkiye and Switzerland, I mean, it's tough. You get down on yourself and stuff like that. 

""But what I see from this group is that bounce-back mentality. You come into the tournament and you could let it bother you, you could let negativity bother you. But I think that the biggest thing with this group is we tune everything out. We just keep going.""

The United States men's national team beat Haiti 2-1 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday to finish the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup group stage with three wins from three games. 

Malik Tillman opened the scoring for the Americans early in the first half on Sunday. An error by U.S. keeper Matt Freese gifted the Haitians the equalizer just nine minutes later, but Patrick Agyemang put the hosts back in front with a quarter-hour left to play.

""I think we showed a great fight today,"" Tillman told FOX Sports' Jenny Taft afterward. ""We're happy to finish the group with three wins."" 

The USMNT will play Costa Rica, which finished as the runner-up to Mexico in Group A, in next weekend's quarterfinal.

Here are three quick thoughts on Sunday's match.

With the USMNT already qualified for the quarterfinals, coach Mauricio Pochettino made four changes to the starting lineup that beat Trinidad and Tobago and Saudi Arabia in the first two group stage games.

The move didn't adversely impact the Americans' cohesion; they started on the front foot for the third straight game and went ahead on a well-worked attack finished by Tillman, who scored his third goal of the tournament off a pinpoint cross from Brenden Aaronson — one of the four new starters.

Freese's gaffe disrupted that momentum and gave the physical visitors a spark, though that faded quickly as the match settled into a slog. Still, the U.S. caught a second wind in the second half; Tillman had two goals disallowed before Agyemang finally potted the winner off a beautiful pass by John Tolkin, who made his first start in place of Max Arfsten.

Tillman continues to be the most productive and impressive American this summer, during which the German-born attacker is getting his first real run of playing time since joining the program three years ago.

All three of Tillman's international goals have come in this Gold Cup. Off the field, the 23-year-old has also endeared himself to Pochettino and his staff, and the PSV man has taken full advantage of the opportunity presented by the absence of longtime first-choice wingers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, plus (dare we mention) Gio Reyna.

The story of this summer has yet to be written for Tillman and his team, however. Now he has a chance to make an even bigger impression in the win-or-go-home contests to come. 

A tie would have been enough for the U.S. to top Group D, as the Saudis tied T&T on Saturday in a match played simultaneously. The Americans finished a perfect 3-0 in a Gold Cup group stage.

They avoided blood rival Mexico in next Sunday's quarterfinal, but the Ticos present the sternest challenge yet for Pochettino's squad. As promising as this Gold Cup has been for the U.S. so far, the real tests are still to come.

June 23 (UPI) -- Malik Tillman drew first blood before Patrick Agyemang played hero with a 75th minute game-winner to lead the United States Men's National Team past Haiti, securing a perfect 3-0 record in the Gold Cup group stage.
Brenden Aaronson and John Tolkin logged assists in the 2-1 victory Sunday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Americans outshot the Haitians 18-8, dominated possession 65% to 34.2% and held a 606-310 edge in passes.

""Overall it was a good performance,"" U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said. ""I think we were not a clinic with the chances that we had. I think we should have scored more.""
Pochettino, who is now 8-5 as coach of the Americans, said his players overcame doubt from an early error to secure the win and group-stage crown. That miscue came in the 19th minute, when a turnover from goalie Matt Freese led to an immediate equalizer.


""We scored and then had an accident that we conceded a goal,"" Pochettino said. ""I think that created a little bit of doubt in us. I think it was tough to deal with that. But I think overall the performance was good in the first half.
""The second half was a little bit better.""
The Americans' initial attack was denied during the game's first scoring sequence. Aaronson eventually regained control of the ball after his first shot was denied. The veteran winger then got the ball on his right foot and sliced a cross toward the far post. Tillman hovered into the area and finished the play with a header, which beat Haitian goalie Johny Placide. The 10th-minute score was the third of the tournament for the American center midfielder.
""Malik, it is difficult to define him,"" Pochettino said of Tillman. ""What a player that is showing all of his talent and capacity. .... What a talented player. So pleased with him.
""He is a lovely guy. He started to find himself. When he can show it, it is welcome. I think the team is much better when he is involved in the game.""
The elation from the Tillman score lasted less than nine minutes, with the Haitians capitalizing on the Americans' 19th-minute error for their equalizer.

Center back Tim Ream started that sequence when he passed back to Freese. The American goalie then mishit a short pass to his left, kicking the ball directly to Haitian winger Louicius Don Deedson. Louicius proceeded to finish with a left-footed shot just inside the far post.
The Americans manufactured several more chances, but went into the second half tied with their visitors. They appeared to earn another lead in the 64th minute, but that score was negated because Tillman hit the ball into the net with his arm.
Agyemang eventually netted the game-winner by beating Placide in the 75th minute. Tolkin sparked that score with a pass from behind midfield. Agyemang tracked down the long feed from the American left back, tapped the ball around Placide at the top of the box and used his left boot to calmly ground a shot into the right side of the net.
The American defense held up over the remainder of regulation to secure the group-stage title.
The U.S. men will take on Costa Rica in a Gold Cup quarterfinal at 7 p.m. EDT Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The winner will play in a semifinal at 6 p.m. July 2 in St. Louis. The Gold Cup final will be held at 6 p.m. July 6 in Houston.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew discuss the USMNT's 2-1 win over Haiti that granted it a place in the Gold Cup knockout stages. (1:32)

ARLINGTON, Texas -- United States manager Mauricio Pochettino said he was pleased to see his team deliver a ""professional performance"" in defeating Haiti 2-1 in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang scored at either side of halftime, allowing the U.S. men's national team to win its third straight match in the tournament and clinch the top spot in Group D. The U.S. will face either Costa Rica or Mexico in the quarterfinals.

The match marked another impressive performance for Tillman, who in addition to scoring this third goal of the tournament contributed on the defensive end with a team-high seven recoveries. That contribution without the ball was noticed by Pochettino.

""Malik, it's difficult to define him because what a player, no?"" he said. ""What a player that is showing this, all his talent and capacity. Because this type of player, the talent that he has shown with every single game and then with the capacity without ball, the work ethic in the way that he really is aggressive, he recovered a lot of balls. He's always trying to help the deep press, chasing back, playing in different positions.

""He can appear like a No. 10 in training, between the lines, using the half space, but can be in the right or left side, wide. Or he can drop and play like a No. 8, No. 6. I think, 'What a talented player.' So pleased with him.""

The U.S. broke on top in the 10th minute when Tillman headed home Brenden Aaronson's cross. But Haiti equalized in the 19th minute when U.S. keeper Matthew Freese sent Tim Ream's back pass straight to Louicius Don Deedson, whose curling effort beat him at his far post.

The USMNT was dominant in the second half, with Tillman going close a few times, including an effort in the 63rd minute that was waived off for handball. But Pochettino's side finally broke through with 15 minutes to go. John Tolkin, making his first start of the tournament, sent a lofted ball into space for Agyemang, who rounded Haiti goalkeeper Johny Placide and scored from a tight angle.

""I think overall it was a good performance. Maybe we were not as clinical with the chances that we had. I think we should score more,"" Pochettino said. ""But I think when we score and we lead the game and then an accident, I think that we concede the goal. I think that created a little bit doubt in us. Again, I think it was tough to deal with that, but I think overall the performance was good.""

Pochettino added that the second half was better than the first, and that Haiti posed ""a massive challenge for us because it is a very good team that played direct, and they have very good players, there with physicality, they are strong. And that was our challenge for us to learn and improve.""

Pochettino also continued to show faith in Freese despite the gaffe on the goal the U.S. conceded, adding that he didn't need to say anything to his keeper in a bid to bolster his confidence.

""The best way to trust in a player is not to [say anything]. Not to be careful with this or careful with that,"" Pochettino said. ""No. Move on. Remember, the most important action is the next one. If you think [about] the last one you are dead, you are going to do another mistake.""

Agyemang also drew praise from Pochettino. The Charlotte FC forward had several opportunities to score, including a breakaway that was saved by Placide in the 24th minute, but regrouped to get the game winner.

""Patrick is doing a fantastic job for the team,"" the U.S. coach said. ""All that he gave to the team today and the previous games also, he's a fantastic striker. Still room to improve, but we are so happy with him.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Man of the match Ilkay Gündogan scores twice in 6-0 win in Atlanta

Cherki opens account; Echeverri, Haaland and Bobb also find net

Manchester City will jet into the inland heat of Orlando's Camping World Stadium for an afternoon showdown with Juventus on Thursday that will decide who claims Group G and probably swerve Real Madrid in the last 16.

Seven-nil rather than 6-0 against Al Ain would have meant a draw would be enough for the scenario but Pep Guardiola's stuttering cadre fell a strike short. The manager, though, shrugged this off.

“With one more goal, we would have two options but we only have one now,” said Guardiola. “It would be better but [more] important is that we are in the next phase. If you want to go through you have to face top teams so it does not matter.”

At a Mercedes-Benz Stadium akin in scale, football-venue-wise, to the Death Star, Guardiola went one better than his pre-match declaration and fielded a completely fresh XI that cuffed aside Al Ain, the behemoths of the Emirati game.

City entered the break 3-0 to the good, making the second stanza a hunt for the four more unanswered goals that would pull them ahead of the Italian giants in the standings.

Inside a venue with the roof on and air-conditioned to a pleasing coolness, conditions were apt for what could be characterised a duck shoot: the record 14-times Pro League victors in the sights of a Guardiola unit that wrestled throughout to find a relentless rhythm.

When Oscar Bobb gave City a 5-0 lead – the substitute weaved over from the right and slid in – five minutes of regulation game time remained.

Next, Rayan Cherki, another replacement, fired past Khalid Eisa and when, moments later, an Erling Haaland toe poke set Phil Foden up at point-blank range City's seventh should have come.

But, to Guardiola's visible disgust, Foden hit the goalkeeper's feet, and by the final whistle City remained in second place.

Even those of an Al Ain persuasion rated their hopes of even a heartening performance in the low percentages yet City were disjointed before, then after, Ilkay Gündogan's ninth-minute breakthrough.

Here, Bernardo Silva swung in a corner from the right, the Emiratis could not clear, the ball bobbled to the German, and a half-swivel took him on to his left foot with which he dinked in a ball aimed for the lurking Haaland.

Except this beat Eisa and bounced sweetly – for City – in; Gündogan's cheeky grin suggested a fluke but neither he or any teammate cared.

All evening, City never threatened to be the mesmeric pass-and-move proposition of the vintage Guardiola years.

Matheus Nunes, patrolling the right, booted one cross straight out. Rayan Aït-Nouri, in a first start at left-back, burst into the area, slalomed past defenders, and flopped over.

But class usually tells. So when Facundo Zabala hauled down Nunes and was booked, Claudio Echeverri applied a dash. From a diagonal to the right of goal the Argentinian arrowed the ball straight home, leaving Eisa a statue. Why the keeper failed to move a foot or so to his left to beat out the free kick is a mystery Sherlock Holmes might struggle to solve.

Guardiola enthused about Echeverri's first start. “I want to tell you a secret: last season, when he arrived, after every training session he practised free-kicks alone,” he said. “Hard work pays off. When the other guys don't practice, they don't score goals.”

Despite their odd bits-and-pieces mode, City could have wandered off for their interval refreshments 6-0, not 3-0, up. Josko Gvardiol's header pinged off Eisa's right post and Haaland spurned two chances you would expect him to pot. One with his left foot from the left flirted with the goal and missed. One with his right from the right was a carbon copy – again rolling wide.

But the stanza did end with the striker on the scoresheet, via the spot, after the VAR ordered the referee, Mustapha Ghorbal, to the monitor. This came after Ramy Rabia flung Manuel Akanji to the turf.

Unlike the FA Cup final when Haaland refused the responsibility – Omar Marmoush took and missed against Crystal Palace – he did step up and registered, stroking the ball low into the right corner.

As City began their second half search for more goals, Echeverri's work was over due to a “twist” in his ankle that made him a “little bit sore” Guardiola said. Foden, the star act of the opening 2-0 win over Wydad, was his replacement.

City's shape was the 4-1-4-1 that has often been Guardiola's preferred configuration across his nine years in charge. With Foden now on, those wearing white had a man who orchestrates the attack and, when Rodri entered for the last half an hour, they had their chief conductor who runs the whole show.

The Spaniard was joined by Bobb as Guardiola reached for Al Ain's jugular, the forward replacing a defender, Abdukodir Khusanov.

The three-man rearguard soon watched as Foden slid over a ball Haaland galloped onto, twice letting go piledrivers stopped by Eisa.

Early on in the opening 45 minutes Nassim Chadli roved along the right, but from a tight angle failed to beat Stefan Ortega. Now, the same. This time a dance across City's area created a straighter route to goal yet, again, his radar was wild.

Part of Gündogan's stellar career is built on his eye for a finish and he soon showed Chadli how to do the business where it counts, as nifty Silva footwork preceded a pass that put City's midfielder in. From here, regulation Gündogan stuff: two strides were followed by a dink over Eisa that this time he certainly meant.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

That's all we've got time for today but thank you for your company!

Don't forget the Club World Cup continues this evening - at the slightly more sociable hour of 20:00 BST - when Atletico Madrid face Botafogo and Seattle Sounders play Paris Saint-Germain to determine which two teams will qualify for the round of 16.

But until then, have a catch-up on the overnight action and the rest of today's football news:



See you soon!

In all honesty I'm not going to even attempt the permutations for the rest of the groups after that ... that's a headache for tomorrow's team!

What I will tell you though is how the rest of the week shapes up:

Al Hilal v Pachuca - 02:00 BST (Group H)

Red Bull Salzburg v Real Madrid - 02:00 BST (Group H)



Knockout football begins on Saturday 28 June, with the final taking place on Sunday 13 July.

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

The Club World Cup continues tonight as we head into the final group games. 

In Group B, Atletico Madrid play Botofogo and Seattle Sounders face Paris Saint-Germain at 20:00 BST.

In what may come as a surprise, it is all still to play for in Group B because PSG lost to Botofogo who are currently top the group with two wins in two.

PSG are, though, still in a very strong position to qualify for the last 16 because they have a stronger goal difference than Atletico Madrid who sit third on an equal points tally of three.

Botafogo will also qualify if they avoid defeat against Atletico Madrid by a margin of three goals or more or if PSG fail to beat Seattle Sounders.

Furthermore, anything but defeat for Botafogo against the Spanish giants would result in them winning the group.

In terms of Atletico Madrid, if they lose they are knocked out of the competition. If they win or draw then they are relying on scoring a number of goals or PSG losing. 

 Are you still with me? I've lost my head working that out.

The CWC has been more competitive than I expected. With the exception of Auckland and Al Ain, every team has been able to hold their own. Every tournament has a few underdogs - Bayern won 9-2 in the Champions League this season.

Kieran, Manchester

Fifa insisted Fifpro and the World Leagues Association were consulted about changes to the overall 2025-30 international match calendar, including the 2025 Club World Cup, which was confirmed by the Fifa Council in December 2022.

""While we disagree with the tenor and content of your letter, we have nonetheless taken note of your concerns and are more than happy to invite you to discuss the matter further at a time convenient to you,"" Fifa added.

Fifpro, the worldwide representative organisation of footballers, were not impressed with the idea of the Club World Cup when it was announced last year.

""The decision to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives.

""The extreme mental and physical pressures at the pinnacle of the game is the principal concern of players with multiple club and national team competitions, leading to exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity.""

We have heard managers and players from Europe's top teams voicing their concerns and frustrations over the fixture schedule for what seems like years now.

And it is no surprise, as those that play for club and country have endured jam-packed season's with very little respite since the 2022 winter World Cup.

League campaign, cup competitions, international friendlies and qualifiers, Euro 2024 and the Nations League are just those that immediately spring to my mind.

So as the expectation on players' to perform consistently at a high level continues, so does the risk of burn-out, fatigue and injuries.

That is one of the issues for this Club World Cup. The European teams want to take it seriously because of the huge prize money at stake, but they are also having to rotate players after long domestic seasons.

It is different for the teams from the United States, South America and Oceania, who have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the competition. 

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

The teams playing in the Club World Cup don't even have to win or draw a game to be financially better off. 

As I just mentioned, there is a participation fee which basically means they get paid for just showing up. 

We know that the European teams are awarded the most, but the South American sides will receive just over £11m, while clubs from North America, Central America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean will each take home £7m.

And even Auckland City, from New Zealand in Oceania, will receive £2.6m for attending.

There has been a lot of talk about what impact this could have on the Premier League if Manchester City or Chelsea lift the trophy because inevitably the more you earn the more you can spend.

But what about the money going to teams from the 'smaller' nations/leagues where their money is likely to help them dominate when they return home?

How can other teams in their domestic leagues realistically compete to make up that £2.5m-£11m difference?

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

Is the Club World Cup an opportunity for the rich clubs to just get even richer? In short, yes. 

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 participating teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

But you don't even have to progress far into the competition to bag yourself some serious cash, as clubs will take home a set figure for each round:



Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria - and European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents.

The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

Not bad, ey?

Fifa president Gianni Infantino came to the defence of the Club World Cup this week while answering questions in Manhattan.

“So, maybe some criticise it a little bit, but it's something new. It's something special,” Infantino said. 

“It's a real World Cup with the best teams and the best players.”

“It was about time that somebody invented a World Cup for club teams. Since 100 years, we know which is the best country in the world, but, until today, we do not really know which is the best team in the world. So, we thought it might not be a bad idea to create a World Cup for teams to decide.”

Infantino also claimed that all players are in favour of the tournament, despite concerns about growing fixtures list and players welfare. 

“Harry Kane gave an interview saying, ‘It's a fantastic competition. It's beautiful',” Infantino said. 

“They [players] love it. Those who are not there, of course, they would love to be there.

""The Club World Cup, and with the World Cup next year, is to show to young Americans that, actually, if you are good and if you are talented, you don't need to go to another sport, because through soccer, there is a path for glory and a path for money, as well.""

So the Club World Cup is criticised for having too many weak teams involved and the Champions League is criticised for having too many teams from the strongest leagues.

The financial backing of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) at the revamped Club World Cup means a prize pot of $1bn (£750m) is up for grabs, while top European teams are in line to earn up to £97m if they win. However, this bumper payday has led to concerns such money could distort domestic leagues and skew competitive balance.

Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal, who are in Group H with Real Madrid and sit third, highlight another intriguing aspect of the tournament, as the Riyadh club are majority-owned by the country's sovereign wealth fund. 

In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson rejected the suggestion that investment into the Club World Cup was from one country, saying it now had nine tournament sponsors and that ""commercial momentum is strong"".

Fifa has also been criticised by campaigners after it appeared to drop anti-racism messaging at the Club World Cup, with some suggesting it may be connected to the policies of President Trump.

Fifa backed 'no discrimination' armbands at the Qatar 2022 World Cup and last month hailed a new disciplinary code ""to fight racism more efficiently and decisively"". But at the tournament in the US, the governing body instead is promoting a 'Football Unites the World' campaign.

On Sunday, Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso says defender Antonio Rudiger complained of a racist incident. 

Rudiger clashed with Pachuca captain Gustavo Cabral in stoppage time after claiming he had been fouled.

Rudiger spoke to referee Ramon Abatti Abel, who crossed his arms in front of his chest to signal that Fifa's anti-racism protocol had been activated.

Cabral denied he racially abused Rudiger, saying he had used an expletive and called him a ""coward"".

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.

Football and politics collided at this year's Club World Cup when Juventus spent last Wednesday in the Oval Office of the White House, meeting United States President Donald Trump to promote the tournament. 

However, most of the 15-minute encounter was taken up by questions about politics, rather than sport. Right-back Timothy Weah said the meeting was ""a bit weird"". 

Trump was presented with a Juventus shirt and one for next year's World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, watched on by Fifa President Gianni Infantino.

I don't particularly care about this tournament, but I do hope that the Premier League sees this eight second rule and implements it with immediate effect. I'd extend it to free kicks too. I'm sick of watching players take five minutes preparing to take one, only to blaze it into the wall or the fans. It should be overturned if they still haven't taken it after 30 seconds (barring injuries/subs etc).

Right then, I think it's time for another round-up of all the main Club World Cup talking points:

While many games have seen swathes of empty seats, there have been contests where atmospheres have been elevated by passionate supporters who have filled the stands in numbers.

We have witnessed some passionate groups of supporters at the Club World Cup - none more so than the Boca Juniors faithful. 

The supporters of the Argentine club have made their presence known in Miami by producing intense atmopshere as their club held Benfica to a 2-2 draw before running Bayern Munich close in a 2-1 defeat. 

There are four Brazilian clubs in the tournament - Botafogo, Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense. Backed by their passionate support, it is no surprise that all four of them sit at the top of their groups heading into the final round of group stage fixtures. 

Fans of clubs like Moroccan side Wydad, Tunisia's Esperance and Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds have also brought the vibes to the tournament.

The apparent lack of supporters has been a hot topic during the Club World Cup and although Fifa are keen to stress that cumulative attendances have surpassed the one million mark after two rounds of matches, there's also been more than 800,000 empty seats. 

The average attendance after 32 games stands at a fairly impressive 35,995. That figure looks even better when you consider that only 3,412 fans that watched Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 victory over Ulsan HD in Orlando last week. That remains the worst attended match so far. 

But ticket sales look less impressive when you factor in the vast size of most of the stadiums, which on average have been only 58% full. 

However, one plus for the competition and Fifa is that attendances have grown during the second round of group matches, up 12% from 52% to 64%.

Will that trend continue as the event progresses? 

The expanded Club World Cup is being considered as a dress rehearsal for the men's World Cup to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.

But the attendance figures from the early stages of the Club World Cup is not great reading for Fifa and the organisers of next summer's mega event. 

More than 400,000 seats were left empty during the opening round of the tournament with the stadiums only 56.8% full. 

Mamelodi Sundowns' 1-0 defeat of Ulsan HD has been the lowest attended game of the tournament with only 3,412 in the stands. 

However, European champions Paris St-Germain's 4-0 win against Atletico Madrid attracted 80,619 while 70,248 attended Real Madrid's 3-1 win against Pachuca in Charlotte. 

Doug Roberson of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said there were several factors for the uneven interest, but ""it's not because people here don't care about soccer"".

Chelsea beat LAFC in front of 22,137 fans in a 3pm kick-off, but when they previously played at the stadium in Atlanta two years ago, more than 70,000 fans watched them face Newcastle in a friendly which took place at 8.15pm.

Maybe therein lies the reason why the attendances have been blowing hot and cold during the Club World Cup.

The field at the Club World Cup will whittle down from 32 to 16 over the course of the next week as group stage finales take place across the U.S., paving the way for the knockout stages that begin on Saturday.

As expected, the round of 16 is expected to mostly feature teams from Europe and South America, though that does not mean the tournament has not been full of surprises. South American teams have combined for just one loss so far at the Club World Cup, while Flamengo is one of only a handful of teams to book their spot in the next round with a game to spare after wins against Esperance de Tunis and Chelsea.

Meanwhile, Inter Miami are in a strong position to be the only team not from those continents to crack the last 16 thanks to their surprise 2-1 win over Porto.  Most of the teams who are expected to reach the next round, though, have yet to actually clinch their spots, setting up for a dramatic final round of group stage fixtures.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are back in action Monday night with a chance to advance to the FIFA Club World Cup knockout stage.

Messi is expected to play as Inter Miami faces Brazilian club Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium, with one foot practically in the next round. Inter Miami can advance with a win, draw or a loss – but would need some help with the latter option.

Also playing at the same time in Group A: FC Porto (Portugal) vs. Al Ahly (Egypt) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ.

If Inter Miami concludes the group stage with a win or draw against Palmeiras, both clubs will advance to the Round of 16. Here's everything you need to know about tonight's match, including losing scenarios to advance.

Stay tuned here for live updates from USA TODAY Sports during both Group A matches.

Inter Miami and Palmeiras play at 9 p.m. ET (10 p.m. in Argentina and Brazil). The Porto-Al Ahly match also begins at the same time.

The Inter Miami-Palmeiras match is available on TBS and TruTV in English, and available to live stream on DAZN. The Porto-Al Ahly match is also available to live stream on DAZN.

Messi is expected to play. His status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

Along with Group A, Group B will also be decided Monday. Botafogo plays Atletico Madrid, while Paris Saint-Germain will face MLS side Seattle Sounders at 3 p.m. ET (12 p.m. PT). We'll have the results of those matches here, when they conclude.

Botafogo leads the group, while PSG and Atletico each have three points through two games. The Sounders will play their final match in the tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

International Football

The Athletic has live coverage of Seattle Sounders vs. PSG from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

This is a public service announcement.

You may think that this Club World Cup is an American affair. You probably looked at the list of host cities, saw FIFA president Gianni Infantino glad-handing with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, noted the distinctive bombast of those grating individual player walk-ons and heard the U.S. national anthem being played before each of the 32 matches so far.

All very American. Fair enough. Hence your confusion.

But sorry, no. Appearances have deceived you. This is actually a Brazilian tournament. The rest of the world just hasn't realised it yet.

First, there are the demographics. 508 players took to the field in the first round of group matches. Seventy of these — 14 per cent — were from Brazil. Argentina had 57 players on that list. Next came Spain with 26.

There are, granted, four Brazilian clubs competing in the U.S. this summer, and the host nation is the only other country with more than two. But the reach of the diaspora is remarkable. There are Brazilians in the ranks of Manchester City, Real Madrid and Los Angeles FC, but also at Esperance de Tunis and Urawa Red Diamonds, Pachuca and Al Hilal, Ulsan and Mamelodi Sundowns. Some countries sell oil, grain or circuit boards to the wider world; Brazil exports footballers.

This, though, is only a footnote to the bigger story. The four Brazilian teams have played eight matches between them so far. They have won six of these, drawn two and lost zero. Each tops their group after two rounds of games.

It's not because they've only had easy fixtures, either. Flamengo duffed up Chelsea. Fluminense went toe-to-toe with Borussia Dortmund. Botafogo defrocked Paris Saint-Germain, the new European champions and any rational person's idea of the best club side in the world right now. “No one has defended better against us this season,” an admiring Luis Enrique, PSG's head coach, said after that match.

The results have been greeted with a mixture of humour and excitement back in Brazil. “The Europeans are sending a petition to FIFA,” went one typically catty gag doing the rounds on Brazilian WhatsApp. “They want Vasco da Gama (the fourth of the big Rio de Janeiro sides) in the competition, so they have a chance of winning.”

Writing in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, former Brazil international Tostao — usually a fairly sober observer of the game — allowed himself to dream, just for a sentence: “Can you imagine the euphoria and pride if a Brazilian team ends up becoming champion?”.

Take a long view of football history and this may appear quite normal.

In the early 1960s, Pele's all-conquering Santos side enjoyed back-to-back victories in the Intercontinental Cup, a competition established at the start of that decade to pit the European champions against their South American counterparts. Flamengo thrashed Liverpool in the same competition in 1981; Gremio and Sao Paulo (twice) also tasted glory in it.

When FIFA first dreamt up expanding that fixture into a Club World Cup in 2000, Brazil's representatives continued to thrive. Corinthians won the inaugural edition in 2000, beating Vasco in an all-Brazilian final. The next two trophies went to Sao Paulo and Internacional.

The years since, though, have been cruel.

In 2010, Internacional were knocked out by Congolese side TP Mazembe. Santos were hammered by Barcelona a year later. Gremio, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Fluminense have all lost to European teams in the final. Before this current tournament began, no Brazilian club had beaten a European side in a competitive match since 2012, when Corinthians famously overturned Chelsea in the Club World Cup final.

You could write a book on the factors underpinning that drift.

The short version is that European football — the top leagues at least — left the Brazilian domestic game behind in a number of areas, from commercialisation and investment to infrastructure and tactical innovation. It is no coincidence that Brazil's most recent World Cup win came in 2002. Nor did the decline go unnoticed: lamentations about the growing quality gap have been a staple of the Brazilian media for decades.

Where, then, have the results of the past nine days come from?

In the first instance, a little context is probably due before we get too excited.

Dortmund and Porto — held to goalless draws by Fluminense and Palmeiras respectively — are not great teams. Fluminense also made extremely heavy work of beating South Korea's Ulsan in a match they were losing with 25 minutes of the 90 to go. Flamengo fans were thrilled with the win over Chelsea but dedicated watchers of the Premier League may not have viewed it as quite such a coup. Even Botafogo's result against PSG came with a minor caveat: Luis Enrique rested several key players that day.

None of which is to say it isn't an eye-catching pattern, or not worth zooming in on. Indeed, even those involved have been struck by the novelty of it all. “I'm surprised by these results,” Flamengo manager Filipe Luis said after the match against Chelsea, where he played for one season a decade ago. “I know the quality of European clubs, especially the elite.”

There are three circumstantial factors at play during this Club World Cup.

One is the climate: Brazilian clubs are more accustomed to playing under a roasting sun. “We're used to it,” Botafogo right-back Vitinho said last week. “I hope that it works in our favour.”

Another is that its teams are midway through their season, which runs from January until December. The national league only kicked off at the end of March. Compared to the European sides, many of whom look exhausted at the end of a long campaign at domestic and continental levels, there is a level of freshness there.

Motivation is also relevant. There has been scant evidence to suggest that the European sides are truly phoning it in, but are they committing to the tournament with every last drop of energy? That's up for debate. Rightly or wrongly, the Club World Cup is not currently seen as being on the same level as the Champions League or even competitions within their own country.

For the Brazilian clubs, like many others from outside Europe, this is a priority. Even if they are just half a percentage point more motivated, it can make a big difference.

“You can see the teams are playing every game like it's a final,” Filipe Luis said on Friday. “That makes a lot of difference.”

There are wider trends at work here, too.

Brazilian football has evolved a lot in the past 10 years, particularly behind the scenes.

A number of the country's big clubs — Flamengo and Palmeiras in particular — have gone to great lengths to become more professional and stable. Their training facilities are every bit as good as those found at the best European teams; their marketing departments have finally found a way to leverage the colossal fanbases that exist in a country the size of Brazil (ie, larger than the contiguous United States).

In 2021, Brazil's government passed a law that introduced a new ownership model for its football clubs, promising to make them more corporate, more sustainable and even — whisper it quietly — profitable. In has come foreign investment: John Textor, the co-owner of Crystal Palace, acquired Botafogo; Red Bull has put significant resources into Bragantino; the City Football Group added Bahia to its roster of clubs.

As recently as 15 years ago, most Brazilian clubs' squads were filled with players at the bookends of their careers: youngsters destined to move to European sides and veterans in the twilight years, in many cases having returned home from those same leagues. The very best young players do still leave but clubs can afford to sign and pay others who are in their prime. The midfielder Gerson, bought by Flamengo from France's Marseille for €15million (£12.8m/$17.2m at current rates) in December 2022 at age 25, is the most obvious example of this trend, but far from the only one.

Nor is it just a question of quality. “You look at the Palmeiras squad and they have two or even three high-level players in every position,” Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said on Sunday, before his MLS team's group game tonight (Monday) against the Sao Paulo side. “It's the same with Flamengo, Fluminense, Botafogo. They have invested a lot of money.”

Alongside the spending has come greater openness to new ideas. A wave of foreigners has freshened up the domestic managerial scene, challenged old notions. Four of the past six Brazilian championships have been won by teams with Portuguese coaches. Little wonder that public opinion over the possibility of a non-Brazilian manager of the national team softened considerably over that time frame, leading to the recent appointment of Italy's Carlo Ancelotti.

The result of all this? Brazil has begun to dominate the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League equivalent, like never before. The past six editions have been won by clubs from the Campeonato Brasileiro. Four of those finals were all-Brazilian affairs.

That might not be good for the overall health of the South American game overall. For Brazil, though, it's a signal that they are doing something right. So too is the growing ease with which they can scout and sign youngsters from other nations on their continent. “They clearly have an economic strength that the rest of the countries do not,” Mascherano, who is Argentinian, said.

The next step is unclear.

There are some who see huge potential, just waiting to be harnessed by good governance, and the right global TV deal. “Brazilian football looks like the next Premier League,” ran a headline in The Economist in December. Botafogo owner Textor has been bullish in his championing of the Brazilian game.

Hurdles remain, however.

The calendar remains bloated: the most successful teams play 70 or 80 matches a season, many of them in the outmoded, low-wattage state championships. This affects the quality of the football, as do poor pitches. Working conditions for coaches have improved but there is still a culture of short-termism and churn.

The Club World Cup, though, is providing hope that the chasm is bridgeable.

Not even the most one-eyed Botafogo fan thinks their team are better than PSG. But maybe they're not as far off as some would have assumed before this tournament began.

“I think there's an elite in football, formed of eight or 10 teams,” Flamengo coach Filipe Luis said last week. “They're far superior. Beyond that elite group, I think the Brazilian clubs are on the second rung.”

Renato Gaucho, his Fluminense counterpart, echoed that view.

“There's no way we can compete with the European teams financially,” he said on Saturday. “They can buy the best players and build incredibly strong teams. But football matches are decided on the pitch. The Brazilian people should be really proud of what our clubs are doing at this Club World Cup.”

Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and Fluminense are not as rich as European clubs but they have heart and heritage

“The graveyard of football is full of ‘favourites',” warned Botafogo manager Renato Paiva in what has proven to be this summer's coldest line in sweltering United States heat. Gritty draws achieved by Palmeiras against Porto and Fluminense against Borussia Dortmund at the Club World Cup were enough to start a conversation. But the underdog heroics of Brazil's other two clubs have shaken up how we see club football across the world.

For the first time since Corinthians shocked Chelsea in Yokohama in 2012, when some Brazilian fans sold their homes and vehicles to make the trip, the reigning Copa Libertadores champions have beaten the Champions League winners. Igor Jesus, who has been strongly linked to Nottingham Forest, scored the only goal of the game as Botafogo beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, a special setting for Brazilians given it is where they won the World Cup in 1994 and honoured the recently deceased Ayrton Senna.

Not to be outdone by their Rio rivals, Flamengo erased some of the hurt of losing to Liverpool in 2019 – when the Brazil forward Roberto Firmino scored the winner – by beating Chelsea 3-1 to guarantee a place in the knockouts. It was also the first time a Brazilian club has beaten a European side by two goals since Vasco da Gama embarrassed Manchester United in 2000.

“It was a remarkable victory, against a team that needs no introduction,” said Flamengo No 7 Luiz Araújo after the win against Chelsea. “It has a special flavour not only because of the size of the opponent, but also because of all our preparation and dedication up until now. We deserved the result and we want more.

Old heads will be quick to remind us that this is the usual order being restored. Throughout the 20th century, Brazilian sides regularly got the better of those from the Old Continent. Pelé scored five goals as Santos beat Benfica 8-4 over two legs in the 1962 Intercontinental Cup final; he scored four in the final the following year as Santos saw off the mighty Milan. In 1981, Flamengo thrashed Liverpool in the final; and in the 1990s São Paulo beat Barcelona's “Dream Team” in 1992 and then dispatched the great Milan team of the era the following year.

There were valid arguments for the Brasileirão being the strongest domestic league in the world. At the Club World Championship in 2000 – a similar tournament to the one in the United States this year – the best European sides visited Brazil and were soundly beaten. Manchester United, fresh off winning the treble, and Real Madrid did not qualify from their group. Two Brazilian clubs – Corinthians and Vasco da Gama – contested the final.

Despite the odd recent victory for Brazilian clubs – such as São Paulo beating Liverpool in 2005, Internacional overcoming Barcelona in 2006, and Corinthians winning against Chelsea in 2012 – the tide has turned against them in this century. A generation ago, when Brazilian clubs were under less pressure to sell their stars, players such as Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos did not move across the Atlantic until they were well into their 20s, keeping the league strong. Now, however, the clubs are financially mismanaged and have to sell their best talents for a relative pittance when they are teenagers. On top of that, TV rights money in Europe and the financial doping of state-run clubs provided further disparity.

At the Club World Cup, however, matters are being decided between the white lines and away from the boardroom. “Football is played on the pitch, 11 against 11,” says Araújo. “We have great teams in Brazil who are all capable of facing any team in the world. Flamengo always goes on the pitch to win, regardless of who is on the other side.”

The facts don't lie. The four Brazilian teams are unbeaten in the tournament and top of their groups, having scored 14 goals and conceding just four. “The victories show the strength of Brazilian football,” says Fluminense manager Renato Gaúcho, who dismisses the argument that European sides are tired after a long season. “If a Brazilian club loses, they say: ‘Ah, Brazilian football can't measure up to European football'. If they win, they say: ‘Ah, European football is coming back from holiday'. That doesn't exist in football!”

He points out that the teams usually meet at the end of the calendar year, when Brazilian clubs are coming off an even more exhausting season. “When European football catches Brazilian clubs having played between 70 and 80 games a year, nobody makes that excuse. Nobody says: ‘Ah, the Brazilian team is tired'. When the European team crushes them, then they say: ‘Ah, we really can't measure up to them.' Brazilian football has been having a great Mundial, overcoming powerful opponents and achieving results. This shows that money alone does not always win matches.

“Yes, there is no way to compete with the Europeans in terms of finances; they can sign great players and form very strong teams, but football is decided on the field. And, on the field, today, Brazilian football and the Brazilian people have to be very proud of what Brazilian clubs have been doing. When many people didn't believe this would happen, it is happening.”

Palmeiras boss Abel Ferreira has also balked at the idea that European clubs are tired, saying the number of games “excuse” is “a lie” – and something that Brazilian clubs have had to cope with in the past. “When we go to the Mundial, we're also at the end of the season. Porto has 50 games; Palmeiras has 36 already. And when we go to play in a Mundial, we'll have more than 70 games. These are excuses.”

To their credit, Luis Enrique and Enzo Maresca did not make excuses and were very gracious in defeat. But not everyone has been as generous. Marc Cucurella said Chelsea struggled in the heat and the Borussia Dortmund substitutes ridiculously sat inside the dressing room for the first half against Mamelodi Sundowns when the temperature was just 30.5C.

Mauro Cezar, a hugely popular pundit in Brazil, says the European teams showed “a certain arrogance” in not giving the tournament due respect. “European teams entered this tournament without taking it as seriously as those from other continents. Of course, the heat is a hindrance for them, as is the fact that it's the end of the season. But if they have more money, better players and better coaches, they should compensate for these negative points by playing the minimum to overcome opponents who did not cause much concern, at least until the competition began.

“These arguments are valid, but they do not justify Paris Saint-Germain being unable to score a goal against Botafogo and barely threatening; Monterey drawing with Inter; Borussia Dortmund almost losing to Fluminense and conceding three goals to a South African team; Porto being dominated by Palmeiras; and Flamengo crushing Chelsea for practically the entire time. Claiming that the competition is not important does not justify this sequence of results against teams with much lower investment. Not facing this reality is yet another sign of arrogance.”

Araújo, who saw the Chelsea players close up on the field, pushes back on the idea that they do not care about the tournament. “No one goes on the field to lose; everyone wants to win,” says the Flamengo forward. “The game against Chelsea was very competitive. Everyone defends their family, their shirt and the fans who are in the stands cheering them on.”

The Flamengo manager Filipe Luís, who spent most of his playing career in Europe at Atlético Madrid, Chelsea and Deportivo, believes that Brazilian clubs have rebalanced the scales at the tournament but cannot compete with the very best “eight or 10 clubs” from Europe. “Apart from this elite, Brazilians are at the same level as the second European tier because of how we compete, how we understand the game, how we adapt to the climatic and field conditions. This elite is superior to us, but on the field anyone can win.”

As Cezar points out, the “big difference between Europe and South America is money”, with Chelsea alone investing €1.5bn in their squad. “This amount is equivalent to the combined debts of several Brazilian clubs; the disproportion is enormous. Since the European leagues have more global visibility and money, they naturally attract the best coaches and players. Consequently, they are more tactically, technically and even physically developed in some cases. However, when a Brazilian club, like Flamengo, which defeated Chelsea with authority, organises itself financially, with good players within the South American reality, and has a coach with a modern mentality, although very young and without much experience, the result is what we saw in Philadelphia.”

We are only at the group stage of the Club World Cup but, whether it's merely a Fifa cash grab or a holiday camp for the European teams, the tournament has served an unexpected purpose for Brazil. It has allowed Brazilians to take pride in the idea that not everything is always better over the water.

A juvenile was arrested for assaulting an officer, and seven people were ejected after Wydad AC fans were seen setting off smoke bombs at Lincoln Financial Field during the FIFA Club World Cup on Sunday, Philadelphia police said.

Wydad, which is based in Morocco, was taking on Juventus in a group stage match when the smoke bombs went off in a section of the Linc. Wydad fans also set off the smoke bombs during last Wednesday's match against Manchester City in South Philly.

A representative from FIFA told CBS News Philadelphia that smoke bombs are not allowed at their events. Lincoln Financial Field also has a strict bag policy. Fans are permitted to bring the following kinds of bags into the stadium: clear bags within a certain measurement range, a one-gallon clear plastic freezer bag or a small clutch-style bag that is around the size of a hand.

Juventus defeated Wydad in Sunday's group stage match, 4-1.  

The FIFA Club World Cup, which is in the city a year before Philly hosts 2026 World Cup matches, will resume on Tuesday when Esperance de Tunis takes on Chelsea. 

Soccer fans from all over the world have invaded Philadelphia since the FIFA Club World Cup began last week.

FIFA Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of Seattle Sounders vs. PSG from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

FIFA gave its 32 competing teams a billion reasons to take a revamped Club World Cup seriously when announcing its monstrous prize pot back in March.

Each and every club had appetites sharpened by the announcement of a $1billion fund in March, with the lucky winner potentially walking away with up to $125million for less than a month's work.

The short-term gains have been there for all to see — $2m just for a group game win — yet it is the intangibles, a promise of commercial growth in a largely untapped market, that also ensures no participating club is dismissive of the opportunity presenting itself in the United States.

The empty seats at many stadiums, and patchy quality of the football, may have sparked some barbed comments in more established football territories, but to the clubs involved, this is a brand-building moment and a chance to either entrench positions in the market or to spark growth.

The European Club Association, which has 11 of its members playing in the U.S., are among those who champion the positives that jar with the ongoing workload concerns of players' unions.

“The ECA has been supportive of this tournament from the beginning,” said the organisation's chairman, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, also president of Paris Saint-Germain — one of the competing teams — on the eve of the tournament in Miami. “We believe that the FIFA Club World Cup will become a landmark competition and can deliver real benefits for all clubs.”

Or, in other words, the chance to swell their coffers.

Strip it all back and the Club World Cup in its latest iteration is another money-making exercise for its most high-profile participants. A pre-season tour gilded and rebadged; an introduction to new audiences with cheques banked along the way.

FIFA has issued soundbites from players and managers talking up the chance to create history by lifting silverware, but executives will inevitably be viewing it through a different prism for now. One where balance sheets build and their brand finds ballast.

“I know first-hand that the clubs competing in the Club World Cup are hugely supportive of it. They see it as a major opportunity,” Phil Carling, head of football at the marketing agency Octagon and formerly the Football Association's commercial director, tells The Athletic.

“It probably goes back for the last 10 years, but at the moment, the scramble to capture, retain and, ideally, monetise international fans is particularly fierce.

“Any platform, like the Club World Cup, that gives you exposure in the right prestigious environment — and even better if you win it — is your opportunity to capture those fans and use that as an equity to build wealth through your commercial programmes.

“Talent follows money, eyeballs follow talent, and money follows eyeballs. Put that together and it helps to understand the commercial model for elite sport.”

The revamped Club World Cup, spanning close to a month, is that new chance for clubs to sell themselves. It might lack the prestige and rewards of UEFA's Champions League, but FIFA's summertime competition has the potential to bring layered financial hits. Merchandise can be sold and social media followers gained on the back of exploits in the U.S.

“We can take a sniffy view of this because of long-held legacy attitudes about football and what is valuable in football,” explains Tim Crow, an experienced sports marketing advisor.

“But there's a new generation of fans to be won and that's really the key battleground. It's not about whether the traditional fan is won over, it's a question of whether new fans are won over.”

Commercial revenue is the income stream where clubs are most emphatically the masters of their own destiny, and in the modern era, it continues to take on huge significance.

Deloitte's annual Money League report, a ranking of the richest clubs in football, found that its top 20 generated £4.2bn of commercial income in 2023-24, which amounted to 44 per cent of the collective turnover. Of the top 10 clubs, only Arsenal had commercial revenues that were eclipsed by either broadcast or matchday income.

At football's capitalist edge, the scramble is on to secure international fans with money to spend. It is why Manchester United will head to New Jersey, Chicago and Atlanta next month after a post-season trip to the Far East. Arsenal have their own preparatory plans in Singapore and Hong Kong, while Liverpool and Barcelona are both travelling to Japan, among other countries.

The suspicion is that Ruben Amorim, Mikel Arteta, Arne Slot and Hansi Flick will all be glad of the rest currently being afforded to their players, but the commercial departments of those teams tasked with raising profiles and enhancing brands and with targets to meet, will quietly be lamenting not being part of the Club World Cup.

“All of the big Premier League clubs not part of this will be wishing they were,” says Carling, who previously headed up Arsenal's first commercial team in the 1990s. “There wouldn't be a board that got a call from FIFA to step in six months ago who would turn it down. They would've hired a rowing boat to get over the Atlantic.

“The prize money is one thing, but the prestige and where it positions you as a club, as an entity within world football, is very important. I doubt the players and coaching staff will be weeping that they're not involved, but being part of this is huge for the clubs that are going.”

PSG's Al-Khelaifi is not the only prominent figure pleased to be spending much of the footballing summer in the U.S.

Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano said his club was “very excited” to be one of the 32 involved. “I think it's something that was very much needed,” he told reporters this week following their opening game against Wydad AC in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

Real Madrid's Florentino Perez was even more ebullient. “It's a beautiful competition and I'm sure it will be a huge success,” he told DAZN. “We've come here with great enthusiasm.”

The comments have the feel of people at a party telling those stuck at home of the fun they are missing, but there is substance to the propaganda.

Every elite club remains locked in a battle to grow its brand and the bigger that gets, the more revenues can be generated. Real Madrid, Europe's most successful club, are widely considered to have built the strongest brand in football and in 2023-24, that was reflected in commercial revenues of £410m.

“There are three angles on how clubs can grow their brand (through the Club World Cup),” says Hugo Hensley, head of sports services at Brand Finance.

“One is global. You're going to have global exposure. But that really matters for the big brands that actually can monetise that rate, clubs like Real Madrid. They need to have that to maintain the prestige as being the best in the world.

“There's also local exposure. It's going to be brilliant for the Middle Eastern club who can say we're on this really prestigious stage and build engagement locally.

“And then there's exposure to the U.S. You get that very valuable market that all of these brands are hoping will be monetisable either now, or as a long-term brand growth prospect.”

The location of this Club World Cup, played out over 11 host cities in the U.S., has undeniably added appeal to its participants. There might be huge numbers of locals who care little for its presence this summer, but the biggest European clubs concluded long ago that it was the market with the greatest potential to tap.

There are, literally, millions without footballing club loyalties. FIFA ran a quiz on their website earlier this week underlining as much, inviting users to answer a series of questions that would help determine the club they should be backing at the tournament.

“If you asked most Premier League clubs to list the top three markets they'd like FIFA to take this to, the U.S. would certainly be in there,” says Crow.

“It's a giant economy. Forty cents in every dollar spent on sports marketing around the world emanates from the U.S. It makes a lot of sense to go there and try to tap into that engine. For big European clubs, they have been steadily working away at the American market for a long time.”

Carling is in agreement.

“It is a $20trillion market and the richest domestic market in the world,” he says. “Therefore, the consumers might be smaller in number, but their economic weight is much heavier than, say, India or China, where clubs used to feel they should be targeting.

“The pivot towards the U.S. is becoming very important in a lot of clubs' strategies. There are fans in the States who haven't made up their minds on who they should follow and here's an opportunity to capture those fans. And economically significant fans. You'll have those people then potentially going out to buy merchandise, follow the team in the future and subscribe to digital channels. More importantly, they'll be interested in brands that are associated with those clubs.”

The Club World Cup remains a tournament of unknowns as the group stages reach their deciding moments in the coming days. No one, not even FIFA president Gianni Infantino, can predict where his pet project will be 10 years from now and whether it has confounded the scepticism.

Will winning the final in New Jersey on July 13 really count for much beyond the windfall awaiting the victors? Only time will tell, but there is a reason that Manchester City, Real Madrid, PSG and more are all desperate to find out.

This Club World Cup, for all its detractors, is a big step towards more.

The 19-year-old scored his first goal for the club, bagging a world-class free kick as City beat Al Ain with ease

Sunday was an night to remember for Manchester City's Claudio Echeverri, as the 19-year-old Argentine starlet stole the show in his side's dominant 6-0 win over Al Ain at the Club World Cup.

Echeverri, formerly of River Plate, was handed his first City start by Pep Guardiola in Atlanta, and he responded in style, seizing the moment to help secure all three points and book their spot in the knockout rounds.

Veteran midfielder Ilkay Gundogan opened the scoring just eight minutes in, dinking a cheeky chip across the box and over the goalkeeper into the side of the net. Then the Echeverri show began. The teenager stepped up from a dead-ball attempt on the right side of the box in the 27th minute, delivering a scintillating shot with his right boot into the top-right corner.

Just before half-time, City added a third as Erling Haaland opened his tournament account from the penalty spot, but they were made to wait until 17 minutes from time for their fourth goal of the evening as Gundogan netted again. Substitutes Oscar Bobb and Rayan Cherki rounded out the game with strikes of their own to ensure City go into their final group match with Juventus level on goal difference as the two sides vie for top spot in Group G.

The Blues do not consider the England man untouchable, and he would tick a lot of boxes for the Gunners given their need for a versatile attacker

Heading into the summer transfer window, it felt like the world knew exactly what Arsenal had up their sleeve. Manager Mikel Arteta had alluded to a need and know-how to fix their problems from the 2024-25 season, before laying out how Kai Havertz, injured for the final third of the campaign, needed further support up front.

So how have the Gunners conducted their business so far? Well, they barely have at all. A deal for Martin Zubimendi is in its closing stages despite late interest from Real Madrid, though the north Londoners were confident this one was wrapped up all the way back in mid-January and yet it still isn't official. Kepa Arrizabalaga is set to come in from Chelsea as backup to David Raya, their eighth goalkeeper signing of the Arteta era. The search for a new No.9, though, is still rumbling on despite being in the market for that position for nearly two years.

Amidst all that, Arsenal are also supposedly on the lookout for another winger, but this could perhaps be an area to strengthen with a market opportunity given how expensive most top quality players in that position. Last week, it was reported they are one of several teams keeping tabs on Noni Madueke, who too could be sold by Chelsea. This is the opening the Gunners have been waiting for.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The winger's provocative post has confirmed supporters' belief that the Red Devils would be better off without him

You might have heard of the film 'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People'. Alejandro Garnacho has just written a sequel: 'How to Lose Fans and Alienate Prospective Clubs'.

The Manchester United winger is enjoying his summer break and looking for a new team after being told to find one by Ruben Amorim. But rather than keep a low profile, he deliberately courted controversy and baited Red Devils' fans with a provocative Instagram post on Sunday evening. Walking into a luxury villa in Ibiza, between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, Garnacho posed wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford's name on the back. Rashford gleefully responded to the post, calling Garnacho 'My brother'.

It was blatantly clear what message Garnacho was trying to send. He was putting himself on the side of Rashford and against both the United coach and the club, forming an alliance of outcasts who are heading for permanent exits from the place that formed them. He was painting himself and Rashford, who were both handed lucrative contracts by United in 2023, as the victims.

And so while Garnacho has served to rile up United fans and confirm the growing suspicion among them that the club will be better off without his petulant attitude, despite his enormous talent, he has also raised a red flag towards all the other clubs who might want to sign him this summer and grant him his exit from Old Trafford...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tennis

Alexander Bublik captured his first ATP Tour title of the 2025 campaign by downing Daniil Medvedev in straight sets, to claim the Halle Open for a second time in three years.

When Bublik beat Andrey Rublev in the final of the German ATP 500 event in 2023, it represented the biggest title win of the Kazakh's career. Now, his triumph signifies a continuation of some red-hot form as tennis transitions from clay to grass.

The 28-year-old defeated world No. 1 Jannik Sinner en route to this title, ending the the Italian's imperious streak of not suffering defeat to anybody other than Carlos Alcaraz since August 2024. He then dazzled with victories over Tomas Machac and Karen Khachanov, before dispatching Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (4) on Sunday. He had never beaten the Russian in six previous meetings.

Bublik prevailed in relatively straight-forward fashion, breaking former world No. 1 Medvedev just once in the match — doing so to love in the first set for a 5-3 advantage, before subsequently holding without reply to take a big advantage.

The pair traded holds throughout the second in a high-quality showing, both giving little away. Bublik, though, was forced to work in order to save a set point on serve. He and Medvedev could not be separated until the tiebreak.

The 2021 US Open champion forged 4-1 ahead thanks to a mini-break, but soon found himself on the receiving end of the type of effervescent, varied tennis Bublik has showcased in recent weeks. The world No. 45 went on to dominate from the back of the court, while showcasing deft touches to bring Medvedev forward at opportune moments. A remarkable return to six consecutive points in the tiebreak saw Bublik seal the match, dropping to the floor with his head in the hands.

""I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon""

This win means everything for Bublik 💛#TWO25 pic.twitter.com/9KXjawL8Xi

— Tennis TV (@TennisTV) June 22, 2025



His achievements of the past few weeks are barely believable after he lost motivation last year, dropping from No. 17 to No. 62, and admitted he was close to calling an end to his career.

“It's tough to speak, I had such tough months since last Wimbledon 'til this summer,” Bublik said on-court. “I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon because I was not enjoying it anymore, and I promised my coach I stay there, keep practicing and after Wimbledon will make a decision whether I need to take a couple months off before trying to come back. This is happening. I have no words.”

Ahead of his stunning French Open round-of-16 victory over Jack Draper, Bublik said he has always balanced tennis and his personal life in equal measure, a luxury sometimes not afforded to those operating at the very elite level.

But it now seems he has struck a winning balance. A Turin Challenger title, French Open quarterfinal and second Halle crown behind him, he now enters Wimbledon in perhaps the strongest form of his career. Crucially for the rest of the best in the world, he will now be seeded, meaning he can't roll up against a top player in the opening round and bamboozle them as he does done to so many in recent weeks.

And Medvedev, whose defeat ended his unbeaten record over the Halle champion, knows just what a threat he could pose at Wimbledon. “I hope you are in Carlos or Jannik's draw,” the Russian said.

Bublik will likely fancy his chances wherever he lands.

After kicking off the month with a memorable French Open triumph and plenty of celebrating in Ibiza, Carlos Alcaraz's dream start to the summer continued in West Kensington as the Spaniard made a typically seamless transition onto the grass with his second title at Queen's.

The world number two extended his winning streak to a career-best 18 matches, as he battled past Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7(5), 6-2 in a competitive, high-quality final.

Alcaraz was fairly comfortable throughout the tournament - barring a brief scare against compatriot Jaume Munar in the second round - and will be full of confidence heading to Wimbledon in pursuit of a historic three-peat.

Over at the WTA 500 in Berlin, it was a welcome return to form for Marketa Vondrousova, who defeated Xinyu Wang 7-6(10), 4-6, 6-2 in Sunday's final to secure her first title since winning Wimbledon in 2023.

The Czech made it through an incredibly difficult draw including Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka and Madison Keys, as well as Diana Shnaider and Ons Jabeur, before proving too strong for Wang in the decider.

It's the perfect preparation for Vondrousova as she heads to Wimbledon unseeded and dangerous, making her a nightmare first-round opponent for any of the top seeds.

Staying in Germany, Alexander Bublik was crowned champion in Halle for the second time in his career, ending a seven-match losing streak against Daniil Medvedev to prevail 6-3, 7-6 in the showpiece event. 

Having reached his maiden Grand Slam quarter-final in Paris just a few weeks ago, Bublik continued his remarkable recent upturn in form, seeing off the likes of Jannik Sinner, Tomas Machac and Karen Khachanov en route to capturing a fifth career title.

Speaking after his victory, a reflective Bublik admitted he was close to “calling it quits” after losing in the third round of Wimbledon last year. 

Finally, in Nottingham, McCartney Kessler claimed her third title in the space of 10 months after a hard-fought 6-4, 7-5 victory over Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska.

It was a first piece of silverware on the surface for the American, who has now moved up to a career-high ranking of world number 32 and secured her spot among the seeds at Wimbledon.

It was a desperately disappointing start to the grass-court season for Jasmine Paolini in Berlin as last year's Wimbledon runner-up was soundly beaten by Jabeur in her opening match.

While Jabeur has plenty of grass-court pedigree, having reached back-to-back Wimbledon finals in 2022 and 2023, she has since dropped out of the world's top 50 after a dismal 12 months on tour, so Paolini winning just four games in their Berlin clash came as a major surprise.

The Italian will be desperate for a more productive week in Bad Homburg ahead of travelling to SW19, where she has a significant chunk of ranking points to defend.

Over in Halle, Sinner looked to be feeling the after-effects of his devastating French Open final defeat as the world number one fell to a shock early exit, albeit to eventual champion Bublik.

Despite a relatively routine win over qualifier Yannick Hanfmann in the opening round, the Italian was deservedly beaten by the mercurial Russian-born Kazakhstani, marking the first time he had lost to anyone ranked outside the top 20 since the summer of 2023.

After a bruising couple of weeks, Sinner will be keen to rediscover his A-game quickly at the All England Club as he targets a maiden Wimbledon crown.

Team entries for the new-look US Open mixed doubles event were officially announced on Tuesday and they certainly didn't disappoint.

Some of the most eye-catching pairings included Alcaraz with Emma Raducanu, Sabalenka alongside Grigor Dimitrov and Jack Draper with Qinwen Zheng.

The unprecedented list of star entrants also had Sinner, Iga Swiatek, Novak Djokovic and Coco Gauff all involved.

The event - which is a revolutionary move by the United States Tennis Association in a bid to attract more of the top-ranked singles players - will take place as a standalone event before the start of the US Open on September 24th.

Lorenzo Sonego might have fallen short in his second-round clash against Alexander Zverev in Halle, but the Italian produced a remarkable passing shot that will live long in the memory.

Sabalenka showed incredible movement on the grass against Elena Rybakina to win an impressive point in the opening set of their match in Berlin.

It's one of the quieter weeks on the tennis calendar, with four tune-up tournaments taking place ahead of Wimbledon.

Nevertheless, there are still plenty of notable names in action at the WTA 500 event in Bad Homburg, as Swiatek, Jessica Pegula and Paolini all look to gain some valuable grass-court momentum.

Taylor Fritz and Daria Kasatkina are the top seeds in Eastbourne, while there's also an ATP 250 in Mallorca, which includes the likes of Ben Shelton and Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

A tennis match in Germany ended in ugly scenes when an argument erupted at the net following a fixture involving former world No.3 Maria Sakkari, who told her opponent: ""Nobody likes you"".

In an opening-round match at the Bad Homburg Open a week out from the start of Wimbledon, Sakkari overcame Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan 7-5, 7-6(6).

Sakkari, who hails from Greece, then accused Putintseva of not looking her in the eye as they shook hands, prompting her Kazakhstani opponent to sarcastically perform a bow.

""Respect me like a human being,"" Sakkari said.

Putintseva shot back as she walked to her chair.

""I was being like a human being,"" Putintseva said. ""Look at yourself.""

Some inaudible arguing followed with Sakkari lurking at Putintseva's chair, before Putintseva said: ""Just leave me alone"".

Sakkari uttered the words ""f---ing hell"" while walking away, before heading back toward Putintseva after hearing another comment.

Sakkari twice told Putintseva: ""Nobody likes you"".

""When you shake hands, look at the other person in the eye,"" Sakkari added.

The chair umpire eventually interjected, saying: ""Ladies, please"".

Simultaneously with the umpire's comment, Putintseva performed another sarcastic bow.

During last year's US Open, Putintseva attracted backlash for disrespect she showed a ball girl.

As the ball girl tried to pass balls to Putintseva, who's now 30, the Kazakhstani did nothing but glare at the girl with her arms by her side, refusing to catch the balls.

""Who does Putintseva think she is?"" German legend Boris Becker wrote at the time.

""Terrible behaviour towards the ball girl.""

Former Australian star Rennae Stubbs wrote: ""The disrespect and obnoxious behaviour here is unbelievable and typical from her"".

Putintseva apologised on social media, but also took aim at her critics.

""Its [sic] kind of scary the way [the] world can judge someone from just a 3 second video, that someone post from one side, without seeing the rest on what was really happening,"" Putintseva wrote.

""I was just playing tennis and lost a tough game, which was very close (in my opinion) to turn that match around. After the game (as you can see on a pic) i [sic] got very much disappointed and was almost crying, that i didnt [sic] do better.""

Wimbledon's women's and men's singles tournaments are set to begin next Monday.

Sakkari and Putintseva will both play singles tennis at the London major.

Vondrousova is another Wimbledon champion who enjoyed silverware success on the grass this weekend.

By taking up only a few weeks in the calendar, the grass court swing is always a case of rapid fire.

Over the past week a handful of elite talents have laid down their marker to succeed at SW19, with Wimbledon 2025 bursting into life on Monday 30th June.

Here are the key headlines from the turf…

Just 14 days after his modern-day classic Roland-Garros 2025 final triumph, Carlos Alcaraz has conquered another city, another historic tournament.

The infectious smile of the Spaniard dazzled the packed crowds of the Queen's Club as the five-time major winner lifted the prestigious HSBC Championships trophy on Sunday.

Alcaraz overcome the firepower of ever-improving Czech Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7(5), 6-2 to regain the title he won in 2023.

“This tournament is really special to me,” said Alcaraz, who has already claimed five titles this season. “I'm just happy to lift the trophy once again. I came without expectation, just to play good tennis and get used to the grass.”

Rewind to the Miami Masters in March and a despondent Alcaraz fell at the first hurdle to wily Belgian David Goffin. It proved to be a pivotal moment for the Spaniard.

“I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. Instead of practice after that, I took a break and I went to Cancun with my family,"" said Alcaraz.

“That was the key, just to have five days off, not grabbing a racket, not stepping on the court. Just go on vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what I should have done better.

“I just got the joy back, and I started to enjoy playing tennis again.”

That joy has yielded a 27-1 record since Miami, hoisting up silverware in Monte-Carlo, Rome, Roland-Garros and now Queen's Club.

In West London, he suffered a 6-4, 6-7(7), 7-5 scare facing his compatriot Jaume Munar in the Last 16, before Lehecka unleashed both barrels in the final. The hot shots kept coming, the smiles kept coming.

As a result, the two-time defending Wimbledon champion will arrive at The All England Club on a career-best 18-match winning streak.

“That Roland-Garros final, that Roland Garros title, I got an extra boost, let's say,” suggested Alcaraz. “I had my days to celebrate it, to enjoy, to turn off my mind a little bit from that. It was like a chapter closed, and let's say been in another chapter here at Queen's.

“The confidence is pretty high right now. Obviously, as many wins as you get, you're going to get more confident. The way that I'm moving, the way that I'm hitting the ball, I think it's really high right now.”

Former world No.6 Marketa Vondrousova won the Berlin Open on Sunday, which was the Czech's first title since a remarkable run at Wimbledon 2023.

Vondrousova, having been set back by shoulder surgery last year, arrived in Germany ranked at No.164, but then ripped through the high-calibre draw.

The 25-year-old toppled Australian Open champion Madison Keys, Diana Shnaider, Ons Jabeur and then dismissed world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-2, 6-4. Into the final and the Czech prevailed past Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu 7-6(10), 4-6, 6-2 to send out a signal of intent to her major rivals.

""We came here to try and win the first match, and now this is happening,” said the world No.73 during the trophy presentation. “So I'm very grateful to be standing here.”

Elsewhere in the WTA ranks, American McCartney Kessler claimed her maiden grass-court title with a 6-4, 7-5 scoreboard over Dayana Yastremska in Nottingham, UK.

Just like his fellow world No.1 Sabalenka, Jannik Sinner was undone by the eventual champion in Germany last week.

This time the location was Halle and this time the champion was the showstopping talent of Alexander Bublik.

The Kazakhstani, who previously lifted this trophy in 2023, reeled in Sinner 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the second round, prior to a pulsating 6-3, 7-6(4) victory over Daniil Medvedev in the final.

Bublik reached his first Grand Slam quarter-final at Roland-Garros earlier in June, capping a true turn around in fortunes.

“It's tough to speak. I had such tough months since last Wimbledon to probably this summer,” said Bublik, having fallen to world No.82 in March.

“I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon, because I was not enjoying it anymore.

""I promised my coach that I would stay there and keep practising, and after Wimbledon we will make a decision about whether I need to take a couple of months off before trying to come back. 

""Now this is happening. I don't know. Quarters at Roland-Garros, winner here. I have no words.”","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland Garros'}","tennis"

Raducanu confident in protection at events after stalker incident

Britain's Emma Raducanu has praised Wimbledon for doing ""an amazing job"" to prevent a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets for this month's championships.

As first reported by the BBC, the All England Club's security measures spotted the man had been red-flagged, and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot.

The man followed Raducanu to four successive tournaments in February and the 22-year-old was left in tears when she caught sight of him in the stands at the Dubai Tennis Championships. 

He was later given a restraining order by Dubai police, and his name circulated among the tennis authorities.

""Wimbledon and everyone did an amazing job. I got a notification, the police contacted me and told me everything was OK,"" Raducanu told BBC Sport in her first comments on the issue.

""I know that I am not the first athlete to go through this, and I probably won't be the last - not just as an athlete, but females in general.""

Tennis player Boulter reveals scale of online abuse

Gambling and social media abuse of women in sport - what is going on?

Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021.

She has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.

The Englishwoman has often had a greater security detail with her at tournaments since the upsetting incident in Dubai, and says she now feels ""comfortable and safe"" on tour.

""I've had great protection whenever I have been at these events recently,"" she continued.

""I have a lot more protection around me - especially the ones here in the UK, where it's busy and there's more spectators around.

""I feel a difference, and that reassures me and makes me feel more comfortable.""

Sally Bolton, chief executive of All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) told BBC Sport they spend a lot of time on ensuring security measures are tight at Wimbledon.

In addition to screening around the ballot, there are more checks and balances when it comes to those in the queue.

Raducanu also praised Katie Boulter for ""taking a stand"" after her compatriot spoke to BBC Sport about the scale of online abuse she receives.

Boulter and a number of female athletes across a range of sports have called for more action to be taken against those who abuse players.

""I'm glad Katie spoke out about it because it is something that we all go through,"" Raducanu added.

""I try and not to read the comments or look at the messages because it makes you upset.

""It doesn't matter how many positive comments you read, you are always going to remember the more negative ones - so I just try and stay away.""

Raducanu is competing at Eastbourne, one of the final grass-court events before Wimbledon begins on 30 June.

She will face American Ann Li on Tuesday.

There is no love lost between Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva. 

The tennis rivals got into a heated argument after facing off at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany on Sunday, with Sakkari saying to Putintseva: “Nobody likes you.”

The incident began when the pair shook hands following Sakkari's 7-5, 7-6 (6) win in the first round of the tournament, a grass court tune-up for Wimbledon.

There were clear tensions during the clash, and Sakkari was seemingly furious that Putintseva did not look her in the eye while shaking hands and said something to her opponent about it. 

That initiated a vigorous back-and-forth, with Putintseva offering Sakkari an incredibly sarcastic curtsy.

As both players went to shake hands with the umpire, Sakkari told Putintseva she should've made eye contact “like a human being,” to which a clearly frustrated Putintseva replied: “I was a human being – look at yourself.”

Sakkari walked over to Putintseva's bench and inaudible arguing ensued, with Sakkari eventually muttering “f–king hell” and then repeating “nobody likes you” after some more back and forth.

Finally, the umpire butted in, saying, “Ladies, please,” before Putintseva eventually left the court. 

It's unclear what prompted the no-look handshake from Putintseva, a 30-year-old from Kazakhstan, or if the whole situation was a major overreaction from Sakkari, a 29-year-old from Greece. 

“I don't think she's going to invite me for dinner for the rest of our lives, but I don't care,” Sakkari said afterwards to the on-court interviewer. “I have very good friends and I'll go to dinner with them. Let me leave it here, and just say that I have respect for her as a player, but that's it.”

Sakkari has been ranked as high as the world No. 3 by WTA, and she is currently ranked No. 85. Putintseva is ranked No. 34.

“By the way — not that I care — I shook her hand as most women do,” Putintseva posted over a photo of herself on an Instagram Story. “Clearly not according to the ‘hugging protocol' some men seem to follow.”

Sakkari will play Ekaterina Alexandrova in the next round as she gets ready for Wimbledon, which kicks off June 30.

A Wimbledon warm-up event turned ugly as former world No 3 Maria Sakkari told Yulia Putintseva that “nobody likes her” in a heated row.

Sakkari of Greece reached the second round after completing a 7-5, 7-6 victory at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany. As the players shook hands, Putintseva was quick to take her hand away, angering Sakkari.

Putintseva, a Russia-born player from Kazakhstan, then mocked Sakkari by pretending to curtsy, which the latter took exception to, saying: “Respect me like a human being.” Putintseva fired back as she walked back to her chair: “I was being like a human being. Get over yourself.”

Sakkari asked Putintseva to repeat what she said, and the two exchanged more words before Putintseva told Sakkari to “leave her alone”.

Sakkari appeared ready to walk away, saying “f------ hell” but after hearing another comment from Putintseva, she hit back again, repeatedly telling her: “Nobody likes you” and adding: “When you shake hands, look at the other person in the eye.”

The match umpire eventually stepped in, saying: “Ladies, please”. However, Putintseva performed another bow for Sakkari and walked off the court.

It represented the latest on-court flashpoint involving Putintseva after she was slammed last year for showing “disrespect” to a ball girl at the US Open.

With Putintseva a set and 4-2 down to Jasmine Paolini, the girl attempted to throw balls towards the Kazakhstani before she took serve. But the player did not attempt to catch or pick up the ball; instead glaring at the girl with her arms down by her side.

Three-time grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs wrote at the time: “The disrespect and obnoxious behaviour here is unbelievable and typical from her.”

Putintseva later apologised for her behaviour towards the ball girl and said she was “p----- off at myself for not winning the game.”

A Russian-born tennis player who switched allegiances to earn Kazakh funding has found herself in the centre of another controversy after finding herself on the receiving end of an x-rated rant on Sunday.

Yulia Putintseva caught the ire of opponent Maria Sakkari following their third round match at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany - a warm-up tournament that helps prepare stars for Wimbledon. 

Having shaken hands at the net after winning 7-5, 7-6, Sakkari vented her fury at Putintseca after the Kazakh refused to look her in the eye during their exchange. Sakkari was heard telling her opponent 'nobody likes you'. 

To some, they may never heard of Putintseva until recent days, but the 30-year-old, who is world No 34, has a lengthy rap sheet from her career - the worst of which came in New York last year when her savage behaviour towards a ball kid earned her worldwide condemnation. 

Born in Moscow, she moved to Paris in her teens to follow her tennis journey and now resides in Florida.

Although she was born in Russia, she switched to represent Kazakhstan in 2012 after reportedly receiving financial and technical support from the Kazakh Tennis Federation.

The 30-year-old, who is world No 34, is a controversial figure and has had many clashes

Despite her clear talent, which will see her in action at Wimbledon this year after qualifying for the tournament for the third time, Putintseva has never been far away from controversy. 

This was clear for all to see on Sunday when she clashed with Sakkari following their heated game.  

Although clearly simmering beneath their calm exteriors, both Sakkari and Putintseva initially observed the usual show of respect by clasping hands over the net. 

But, spectators were then shocked after a row began, seemingly over the brief and loose handshake.

Wildcard Sakkari appeared to be especially unhappy and was heard telling her opponent to act 'like a human being', to which Putintseva insisted she had. 

But the hot-headed Kazakhstani then upped the stakes as she appeared to tell Sakkari to 'go f***' herself and to leave her alone, gesturing for her to move away.

Much of the spat wasn't audible because of the music being pumped out around the court, but a riposte from Putintseva led Sakkari to follow her to her bench.

Sakkari appeared to have taken exception to Putintseva's handshake over the top of the net

Sakkari followed Putintseva to her bench and was overheard telling her: 'Nobody likes you'

Sakkari eventually walked away but returned again just seconds later, appearing to say, 'F****** hell, I'm what?' She then clearly told Putintseva: 'Nobody likes you!' 

The Greek instructed Putintseva to look into her opponent's eyes when shaking their hand after a match before the umpire stepped in, saying: 'Ladies, please.'

Putintseva delivered a sarcastic sweeping bow in Sakkari's direction, saying 'thank you very much', and the argument continued even as she made her way off the court.

On Monday, Putintseva then hit back at Sakkari and appeared to allege that she was a hypocrite.  

In a post on her Instagram story, the 30-year-old shared a mirror selfie alongside a message of defiance.

'By the way - not that I care - I shook her hand as most women do,' Putintseva said. 

'Clearly not according to the 'hugging protocol' some men seem to follow.'

That message also came after she had fired a dig at Sakkari as she shared a video from Instagram account 'The Tennis Pulse'.

Putintseva also shared a post which aimed a dig at Sakkari and called her opponent a clown

The post was a clip of Sakkari clashing with Putintseva at the net where the Greek star could be heard saying: 'When you shake hands look at the other person in the eye.'

The video then switched to a screengrab of Sakkari shaking hands at the net with Emma Raducanu and Martina Trevisan after separate defeats.

However, in both instances, Sakkari's head was turned away from her opponent and she wasn't 'looking at the other person in the eye'.

Alongside the video, Putintseva added: 'And the plot thickens...', accompanied by a clown emoji.  

Meanwhile, last year, Putintseva, 30, was involved in another ugly moment during her defeat by Jasmine Paolini at the US Open, leading to her being widely criticised by pundits.

Footage showed two balls being thrown towards Putintseva ahead of her next serve, but she ignored them and stared back at the ball girl without moving.

That left the youngster in an awkward position, before Putintseva caught the third ball and resumed the match when she was down 4-2 in the second set. 

Putintseva was loudly booed and twice apologised for her 'terrible behaviour', insisting she was 'p***ed' at herself rather than the ball girl.

Putintseva was involved in a spat during the US Open last year after ignoring a ball girl's attempts to throw the balls towards her, letting them hit her and bounce away

Putintseva did not acknowledge the ball girl as she eventually caught the third ball

'It's kind of scary the way the world can judge someone from just a three second video, that someone posts from one side, without seeing the rest on what was really happening,' she wrote on social media.

'I was just playing tennis and lost a tough game, which was very close (in my opinion) to turn that match around. 

'After the game (as you can see on a pic) I got very much disappointed and was almost crying, that I didn't do better. 

'At this time the girl was giving me the ball, which I didn't even notice or so, because I was deep in my thoughts… I was not trying to humiliate her (or anyone) by not taking this ball that she was giving to me.

'I didn't do anything disrespectful to anyone at this particular moment. I do apologise, if this girl thinks that it was something towards her. (And btw her name is Kate, very nice girl, which understood that it was nothing towards her).

'I can't say that I am perfect all my career. I am getting angry on court, p***ed, saying stupid stuff and curse like no tomorrow sometimes. Guilty for that. But I did never put myself ""on top"" of someone. That's just not me at all.'

The charge sheet doesn't stop there however, with Sakkari and the innocent ball girl among several figures in the tennis world that Putintseva has clashed with over the years. 

All the way back in 2017, she let loose at her own coach Roman Kisliansky after being thrashed 6-0 6-0 by Alize Cornet at the Connecticut Open.

The 30-year-old star has clashed with several figures in tennis, including Iga Swiatek

Putintseva has apologised for her behaviour on multiple occasions and reflected on her temper

During the match, Putintseva was heard saying: 'You never applauded me when I won the ball. You chew and watch the f***ing video. Are you moron? (sic)

'You sit there watching your video about the flat Earth. Take your f***ing grin away.'

When she was 4-0 down in the second set, she also unleashed another epic meltdown as she demolished her racquet.

However, she did later apologise for her actions.

'Yesterday was hell!,' she said. 'Unfortunately there are days in tennis when you can do nothing.

'I would like to apologise to my coach Roman Kisliansky for what I said! My emotions quite often blind me, but I am working on that and will try to make some conclusions from this game and this situation.'

Those apologies have become a common theme, but Putintseva has previously hinted how her abrasive and chaotic behaviour on the court is just how she is.

'I knew since I was a kid,' she told the WTA in 2022. 'My father would tell me, “Yulia, your temper on the court is too much sometimes”.

But she has hinted her abrasive and chaotic behaviour on the court is just how she is

'I was wild, too much fire.'

She added: 'I'm like a gangster on court, but like an angel off court. (I'm) really different in real life.'

However, in that same interview, she also claimed she was calming down and revealed what she wants to achieve in the game.

'Now I'm controlling myself more. In important moments I'm calming down. I understand what I have to do.

'I hope I can win a Grand Slam one day. That's my goal. That's what I believe I can do. I'm working for it every day. If I cannot, at least I want to give my best.'

Meanwhile, she has also attracted the ire of fans watching her games on multiple occasions, meaning those in attendance at Wimbledon should be eagle-eyed when she plays.

After losing to Elena Rybakina in the Madrid Open quarter-finals last year, Putintseva launched into a furious racket-smashing tirade, before she was booed off court.

Elsewhere, back in 2019, after a loss to Belinda Bencic at the Australian Open, the Kazakhstani star refused to shake the hand of the umpire.

She is known for smashing rackets, including on one occasion at the Madrid Open in 2024

Putintseva also stuck her middle finger up towards fans at the Australian Open as she departed

The crowd weren't too happy and didn't react well, which then led to Putintseva astonishingly sticking her middle finger up towards them as she left the court.

It seems Putintseva has an ongoing issue with umpires, including a year later when she declined to shake hands with one after multiple disagreements during a defeat to Romania's Ana Bogdan. 

Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek has also had problems with Putintseva, and previously hit out at her behaviour after a game at Indian Wells in 2024.

The 30-year-old had been told off by the umpire for moving from side to side when Swiatek was preparing to serve, before she sent down a couple of underarm serves.

'Maybe they teach that in Kazakhstan,' Swiatek had said. 'I can only be responsible for what's going on with me. 

'I want to keep my standards high no matter what's going on, and I think this match was a test for my mental training that I did.'

Another superstar Victoria Azarenka has also criticised Putintseva after a chaotic encounter at the 2022 Qatar Open. 

During the match, the Kazakhstani had been accused of faking injuries just as the Belarusian was going to serve, while she also smashed multiple rackets and shared a cold post-match handshake.

Victoria Azarenka once claimed that Putintseva 'needs a mental coach and a psychiatrist'

'Before my serve, she can do that (call a medical time-out),' Azarenka said. 'What's the problem? She has to wait for me to serve, she threw her racket like seven times.

'She needs a mental coach, she needs a psychiatrist. There was way too much stuff in this match. Unnecessary stuff as well.'

Finally, the handshake drama with Sakkari is seemingly another recurring theme for Putintseva, particularly in regards to Czech star Barbora Stycova.

Back in 2014, Strycova claimed she was not offered a proper handshake after a match and this history appeared to be lingering five years later in 2019.

After beating her opponent in straight sets, Putintseva irked Strycova with an exuberant celebration before she overcompensated for that allegedly previous weak handshake. 

'I like to squeeze hand normal, but she squeezed me, like, hardcore!,' Strycova said. 'These bones - oww! Oww!

'I was like, ""Why'd you do that?"" She said, ""You squeezed my hand."" I said, ""I squeezed your hand normal! Just let it be.""

'I didn't really care. It's nothing big. Just, why?'

Later that year, she also received a hostile reception from fans when she initially refused to shake hands with Anna-Lena Friedsam after a three-set win at the Nuremberg Open, only doing so when she was chased down by her German opponent.  

Given her troubled history, this is unlikely to be the last we hear of Putintseva and those who watch her at Wimbledon won't be too surprised to see her at the centre of any drama.

After an action-packed Queen's tournament, Carlos Alcaraz emerged victorious from the competition on Sunday with a 7-5, 6-7, 6-2 victory over Jiri Lehecka. The Spaniard was forced to dig deep to extend his winning run to 18 matches, and he now heads into Wimbledon in flying form.

Emma Raducanu was in attendance on Saturday to watch Alcaraz, with the pair set to join forces at the US Open for mixed doubles later this year. The Brit is set to return to the court herself when she takes on Ann Li at the Eastbourne Open tomorrow night.

Raducanu will be hoping that she can overcome some recent recurring back problems to ensure that she heads into Wimbledon in good form, with the Grand Slam set to get underway in just seven days.

Emma Raducanu insisted ‘I feel safe' despite being made aware that her stalker had attempted to buy Wimbledon tickets.

In February, Dubai police imposed a restraining order on a man after he left the tennis star in tears by following her to four consecutive events.

He also sent the 22-year-old a letter and asked her for a photograph in a Dubai coffee shop. Raducanu watched from behind the umpire's chair in tears as he was removed from the stands and detained by police.

His name was circulated around the tennis authorities and a re-sweep of the Wimbledon ballot system red-flagged that he had attempted to purchase tickets for this year's Championships. The application was removed. 

Speaking to the BBC, the 2021 US Open champion said: “When I heard that, my thoughts were that everyone at Wimbledon had done an amazing job. I got a notification and the police contacted me, they assured me everything was okay. I know that I'm not the first athlete to go through this and I probably won't be the last. Not just athlete, female in general. It's just something that maybe we all have to deal with at some point. I feel okay, I feel comfortable, I feel safe. I've had great protection whenever I've been at these events.

“At the tournaments, I have a lot more protection around me, especially the ones here in the UK, where there are most spectators around. I feel a difference and that reassures me, it makes me feel more comfortable.”

Emma Raducanu is overcoming her ‘biggest phobia' to push through her back injury.

The British No. 1 is using needles as she manages an ongoing issue.

Speaking ahead of Eastbourne, Raducanu said of her back: “It's okay. I'm still managing it, to be honest. I have good days and bad days with it. I trained, I trained a fair bit last week in London and it was good.

“I was getting a lot of treatment and then woke up pretty stiff at the weekend, took a day off and then trained yesterday and today, but it needs a lot of work and it is up and down. So I'm just trying to manage it as best as I can.

“Big time, I'm doing everything, needles, soft tissue, some muscle stimulation stuff, taping, everything. But it's just ongoing, but it's okay. It seems to be okay today.”

Ahead of the French Open, Raducanu said: “At the start of the year I was so scared of needles. It was my biggest phobia. That was the only way I was going to be able to play Australia.”



Daria Kasatkina says the decision to downgrade Eastbourne to a WTA250 event ‘sucks'.

The move to make Queen's a WTA500 event came at Eastbourne's expense.

“That sucks, honestly. I don't understand this decision.” reigning champion Kasatkina said.

“I think Eastbourne is one of the oldest tournaments we've got on tour. It's like the tournament with a big history. As I remember, it was always a 500, so it's a very nice tournament, and I just didn't see the reason to downgrade to 250, honestly.

“There's always quite a good field, all the players coming here. Plus it was super convenient to go from here to London after, everything was great, I don't know. And also I honestly don't understand why, like, by the rules, it just would be two 500s in the same week.

“Also, you know Bad Homburg, it's a very good tournament as well, so I think they deserve to be 500, but, you know, not for the price of another good tournament being downgraded.

""So I think this is one of the issues, because for example, on the ATP side, there's no problem to have two 500s in the same week. I honestly don't see why it's the problem.”

It's the final week before Wimbledon and players are making their last preparations. 

There have already been some big-name withdrawals, including would-be seeds Casper Ruud and Arthur Fils. 

Qualifying matches are now underway, and the first round will start on June 30...

Emma Raducanu has spoken about how she kept Carlos Alcaraz before accepting his invite to play mixed doubles together at the US Open.

Alcaraz has spoken openly about how he was made to wait by his now-doubles partner, and Raducanu has revealed that the reason for the delay was because she wanted to speak with her team first.

She explained: “Gotta keep him on their toes! I mean, of course, I had to ask, like, my team if they wanted me to play, but for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.”

Nick Kyrgios has now responded to learning Chris Eubanks won't be part of the BBC's punditry team at Wimbledon.

The Australian speculated recently that the world No. 108 had been picked over him to feature for the Beeb, but Eubanks has since confirmed that he hasn't even held talks with the BBC about being a part of their coverage.

Speaking out about the situation, Kyrgios has tweeted: “The media makes me laugh honestly. Low key have always enjoyed Eubanks as a commentator, always going to spin what I say and turn it into some sort of rivalry or friction. I think if we were on the same panel, would be beneficial to the sport. Tennis is weird.”



Andy Roddick has talked up Carlos Alcaraz's chances at Wimbledon.

Speaking on the Tennis Channel podcast, the former US Open champion was asked about what could prevent Alcaraz from clinching the title, to which he replied: “I wouldn't bet against it. I mean, listen, anything can happen.

“(Jannik) Sinner is going to re-enter the conversation. Let's not forget about him. He's still really good. He's number one in the world. He's been the best player in the world for the last however long, especially on a hard court. So let's not get carried away with these results.”

But Carlos was the favourite at Wimbledon before Queen's, and he's the favourite after Queen's as well. I don't think anyone would argue against that.”

Novak Djokovic can breathe a sigh of relief, as reporter Tony Jones will not be part of Australian network Channel Nine's coverage of Wimbledon.

The pair clashed earlier this year and the broadcasters were forced to issue a public apology after Jones called for Djokovic to be ‘kicked out', which was interpreted to be in reference to the 2022 Australian Open.

Jones has since apologised for his comments and insisted that he ‘overstepped the mark', and he is not set to be in attendance at SW19 when play gets underway from next week.

Yulia Putintseva has released a short statement on social media after her row with Maria Sakkari at the Bad Homburg Open. Tensions paired between the two after they shook hands after Sakkari secured a 7-5 7-6 win.

Putintseva fumed at her rival after play concluded, gesturing for her to leave the court and shouting ‘leave me alone'. Sakkari responded by placing her fingers on her lips before snapping back: “Nobody likes you!”

Putintseva has now takes to Instagram to address the incident, posting a selfie with the caption which read: “By the way – not that I care – I shook her hand as most women do. Clearly not according to the ‘hugging protocol' some men seem to follow.”

Carlos Alcaraz believes that a family getaway to Cancun was key in helping him back to form.

The Spaniard went on a trip with his loved ones following his Miami Open defeat to David Goffin in March, and he feels it was important to clear his head away from the court – despite the level of hate he received for going on holiday.

He said: “I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. Instead of practice after that, I took a break and I went to Cancun with my family. And I had too much hate then, because a lot of people, you know, start to say, like, ‘What's going on with this guy that he just lost in the first round, and he didn't practice, he didn't go to the court and keep practicing just to be better?'

""And I think that was the key, just to have five, six days off, not grabbing a racket, not stepping on the court. Just go to vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what should I have done better?""



Former Australian star Pat Cash believes that Carlos Alcaraz is the favourite to land the spoils at Wimbledon.

Following his victory at Queen's, the Spaniard now heads into the competition in flying form – having not tasted defeat since April.

As a result, Cash told BBC Radio 5 Live that he believes the world No. 2 is favourite to win the entire competition.

He said: “You can't really expect better form for him to come into Wimbledon, he's obviously the player to beat.

""I wouldn't back against him winning the title at Wimbledon ... Alcaraz, red-hot favourite for sure.""

Daniil Medvedev has revealed that he is hoping to avoid Alexander Bublik in the Wimbledon draw.

Following his defeat to the Kazakhstan star in the Halle Open final on Sunday night, Medvedev said: ""First of all Sasha, big congrats to you and your team.

“I hope you're in Carlos' draw at Wimbledon. Please Carlos or Jannik draw at Wimbledon.""

Chris Eubanks has insisted that he will not be a part of the BBC's Wimbledon coverage.

Nick Kyrgios hit out at the American star last week, insisting that he was who was replacing him for the coverage of the tournament – a decision which he labelled as ‘very strange'.

However, Eubanks has now spoken out, revealing that he has not even held talks with the BBC about being a pundit. He tweeted a confused gif before writing on X: “All jokes aside… I will not be working with BBC at Wimbledon this year.

“As far as I know, my team hasn't even spoken to anyone from BBC so I'm not sure where that came from. That said, I'm incredibly excited to be back competing at SW19.”

Thanks for following Express Sport's coverage of the day's tennis news. 

We'll be back with more tomorrow as we ramp up the build-up to Wimbledon.

Until then, take care!

Maria Sakkari told Yulia Putintseva 'nobody likes you' at the Bad Homburg Open. 

Both players were involved in a fiery spat at the net after Sakkari won their match in straight sets. 

Putintseva seemed unhappy with Sakkari's antics, while the Greek star blasted her opponent for not looking her in the eye as they shook hands. 

A largely inaudible row ended with Sakkari pointing around the stadium before yelling: ""Nobody likes you!""



Alexander Bublik will climb to No. 30 in the rankings after beating Daniil Medvedev to win the Halle title.

Bublik used the momentum of his victory over Jannik Sinner to defeat Medvedev in the final.

He said afterwards: “It's tough to speak. I had such tough months since last Wimbledon to probably this summer. I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon, because I was not enjoying it anymore.

""I promised my coach that I would stay there and keep practising, and after Wimbledon we will make a decision about whether I need to take a couple of months off before trying to come back. Now this is happening. I don't know. Quarters at the French, winner here. I have no words.”

Dan Evans has accused rivals of being too excuse-happy.

The British star, never one for mincing his words, has urged tennis stars to just shake their opponent's hand and accept they were better.

Evans said: “I'm fed up with sportspeople when they lose, there's an issue. Just f****** shake the guy's hand and say, ‘Well done'.

“This day and age, somebody's never better than us. It's always, you know, if we're tired or... Just be a sportsman, be a sportswoman, shake their hand, [say] 'fair play', and let's go. Don't need to know what's happened.”

Jacob Fearnley has defended Jack Draper over his outburst at Queen's.

During his defeat against Jiri Lehecka on Saturday, Draper slammed his racket into the advertising hoardings in a fit of rage.

But British rival Fearnley has now said: “Obviously the players are under a lot of pressure and I'm sure Jack is feeling some pressure, but I think that more has something to do with the fact that he was so close to winning.

“He was 5-5 in the third, and he obviously really wants to do well in front of the British fans and he got broken in a pretty crucial moment and Jiri was serving really good, so he probably thought that it was over.

“I mean, you see players doing it all the time and then I think it was more just the situation he was in, in the match. Not necessarily to do with all the pressure of playing at home. I don't think it was anything really to do with that. I hope the board's all right.”



Carlos Alcaraz is heading into Wimbledon in excellent form. 

And he will be one of the favourites to win at the All England Club. 

With Wimbledon qualifiers getting underway tomorrow, plans are in full flow ahead of the first round. 

Wimbledon starts for good on June 30. 

Jiri Lehecka is 25th in the live rankings after a successful week at Queen's. 

He said on court after losing against Carlos Alcaraz: ""It's tough for me to find some words now but I'm happy I had a chance to fight for the title today.

""Congratulations to Carlos and your team for doing a great job as always.

""Unfortunately it just wasn't enough from me today. Thanks for cheering for me the whole week and this [runner's-up prize] looks good too.""

Carlos Alcaraz tells the BBC on court: ""It's really special this trophy and this tournament. I'm happy to lift this trophy once again.

""Jiri, you had an incredible week and it's a nightmare to play against you. Great week, great job and keep it up for Wimbledon.

""It has been an incredible week. I came without expectations and just wanted to play good tennis and to get used to the grass. It's really special playing here every year and I can't wait to come back next year.""

Carlos Alcaraz is the Queen's champion after a much less gruelling third set. 

He broke twice against the excellent Jiri Lehecka and wins 7-5 6-7 6-2. 

We'll have all the best reaction up next...



It's a big early break for Alcaraz, with Lehecka's serve causing him problems throughout this match. 

Alcaraz now leads 3-1 and is serving to go 4-1 ahead. 

Some fantastic serving from Jiri Lehecka means it's all square in the Andy Murray Arena. 

He wins the tiebreaker 7-5 and it's a final-set shootout to decide the Queen's winner!

Alcaraz is serving with Lehecka leading the second set 6-5. 

The Spaniard needs to hold serve to prolong this epic final to a tiebreaker. 

Jiri Lehecka's serving is a major weapon - but Alcaraz's own serves have been excellent. 

Five aces so far. 

Both have exchanged games in the second set, with Alcaraz about to serve at 2-3. 

A tight first set goes the way of Carlos Alcaraz!

At 5-5, the Spaniard gets the vital break as Lehecka puts a forehand into the net on break point.

Alcaraz then serves it out and is half way to his second Queen's title.



Here's the reception afforded to both finalists as they walked out on the Andy Murray Court. Jiri Lehecka will serve first...

Will Lehecka or Alcaraz be crowned the King of Queen's? \ud83d\udc51WATCH LIVE \u2014> https://t.co/hOHmv2wMlX pic.twitter.com/7AOz2uKPDT

The fans expect a Carlos Alcaraz win over Jiri Lehecka and it seems the bookies are also backing him to regain the title he won in 2023.

According to Grosvenor Sport, he's 6/25 on to prevail. Lehecka, is out at 3/1.

We are now just an hour away from the final at Queen's, Carlos Alcaraz v Jiri Lehecka.

Tennis fans can watch live free-to-air coverage of the clash, staring at 2:05pm on BBC One.

Those without television access can still watch via the BBC Sport website and BBC iPlayer.



Carlos Alcaraz has raised eyebrows by stating he'd like to kill Novak Djokovic for beating him in the Olympic Games gold medal match last summer.

The 22-year-old this week sat down with comedian Josh Berry to talk tennis. He was put on the spot by his host when asked his choices in a game of ‘kiss, marry, kill', with the choices Djokovic, Rafa Nadal, or roger Federer.

A hesitant Alcaraz laughed before saying: ""I'd kill Novak. For winning that final of the Olympic Games. I could marry Rafa Nadal.""

China's Wang Xinyu is emerging as Wimbledon contender after making her first ever WTA Tour singles final at the Berlin Open.

She beat World No. 20 Liudmila Samsonova 6-4 6-1 on Saturday and will play 2023 champion at SW19 Marketa Vondrousova in today's final.

After a fourth straight win against a top-20 player, the 23-year-old said: ""This week has been a dream for me. I've been playing unbelievable tennis here.""



Toni Nadal, the father of Rafa, has backed the big serving Ben Shelton to shatter the prospect of a Carlo Alcaraz v Jannik Sinner final at Wimbledon.

“Normally, a Sinner-Alcaraz final would be expected, but we're talking about a particular Slam, there are always some surprises,” he told Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport.

“If you find a[Ben Shelton or another great hitter on the day, important heads can fall. Grass is a treacherous surface, where the match can quickly get out of hand.”

Alexander Bublik needs to end his winless record against Daniil Medvedev to capture the Halle Open today.

Bublik, who stunned Jannik Sinner in the second round in Germany, booked his place with a 4-6 7-5 (7-5) 6-4 win over Karen Khachanov.

Carlos Alcaraz has admitted he always tried to follow Emma Raducanu's matches after the British star watched him plat at Queen's yesterday.

Asked whether he would return the favour and attend one of her games, he replied: ""Well, it depends on the schedule, obviously. I have practices. I have matches.

""But I would love to if I have time. If I'm at the club or I don't have anything else to do, yeah, I would love to come and watch her. I'm watching her matches from the TV every time that I can. So watching her in real could be fun.""

Cassper Ruud has become the latest seed to withdraw from Wimbledon.

The world No. 16 star has been struggling with a knee injury since the French Open, and recently pulled out of a tournament in Mallorca.

""He's back on court, but it looks like playing best-of-five sets is a bit too soon,"" said his manager, Tina Falster.

World No.15 Arthur Fils, Sebastian Korda, Zhizhen Zhang and Nick Kyrgios are among the big names already out. 



Welcome back to our live tennis blog as the build-up to Wimbledon continues.

Before attention turns to SW19, all eyes will be on Carlos Alcaraz today as the top seed faces Jiri Lehecka in the final at Queen's.

Emma Raducanu has shed light on her friendship with Carlos Alcaraz after they signed up to play mixed doubles together at the US Open later this year. Ahead of their blockbuster link-up, the Brit even headed to Queen's over the weekend to watch the world No. 2 win his semi-final match.

Alcaraz had admitted Raducanu took a while to respond to his request to join forces on the doubles court. And the 22-year-old has now joked that she had to “keep him on his toes” before giving a response.

Last week, the five-time Major winner confirmed that he was the one who asked Raducanu to team up. “She took a while,” he jibed.

But Raducanu has explained that she needed to consult her team before making a final decision. “Gotta keep them on their toes!” she laughed.

“I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.”

The pair go way back, and Raducanu admitted Alcaraz played a role in her run to the US Open title in 2021, as she watched him make his way to the quarter-final and wanted to chase him. So it will be a full circle moment for them to team up in Flushing Meadows.

She continued: “I've known him for years and actually in Wimbledon 2021 it was like kind of the first time I started getting to know him, and I had a good run there and then also again in the US Open in 2021.

“And I remember he was always playing the day before me and I was playing like the second day of the round. And I would see him win and then I would have motivation to win and get myself into that position too.

“And I remember he beat Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round and it was like a big win, his breakout kind of win on a big stage and it was really cool to kind of, I guess, go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, but we were staying in touch for the whole time and yeah, it's nice.”

Raducanu gravitates towards those who have known her since before her US Open triumph, and it's no different with Alcaraz - even though he's gone on to become a multi-Grand Slam champion.

“We have a good relationship still. He's obviously overtaken me a lot, but it's nice that we have that from a while ago,” she said.

“I think for all of us, we really kind of value those connections that we had from when we were young because when you become a bit more known or a bit more successful, you just find yourself reverting back to people you knew from a young age because you're like, that's a real genuine connection, because it becomes very busy and you have a lot more friends but the ones that you've known for a long time mean a lot more to you.”

The British No. 1 can also relate to Alcaraz's need to disconnect from the sport. While the Spaniard is known for his yearly trips to Ibiza, Raducanu prefers more low-key activities like yoga and going on walks.

She explained: “I think in that sense, we are quite similar. We both play our best I think when we're in a good creative way, we're enjoying it. You see us smile on the court and have fun and really just lean into those positive emotions

“And I think whenever I have played with, you know, trying to channel any negativity or any of that kind of energy, I don't do so well, and other players might be different, but for me, I need to be in that kind of pretty positive and creative way.

“And I think that is in a way, when I see him play, he's always got a smile on his face and enjoying it and that's I feel like why he's able to do such crazy shots, turn points around that he's maybe not favoured to and pull out these ridiculous shots because it's like a coming from a place of curiosity. Like, what can I do with this? You know, like, can I turn this point around? It's amazing to have that on the men's side and take inspiration when I can.”

Raducanu herself enjoyed a day off on Saturday, heading to the Queen's Club to watch Alcaraz in action. But she doesn't think the world No. 2 will return the favour and travel to Eastbourne this week.

“I doubt it. I doubt it. But no, I saw some like really cool drop volleys and I was like, yes, let's save some of that! But he's got plenty to plenty of magic to bring to New York,” she laughed.

“But it was just, I was having the day off on Saturday and I was with my friends and we were like, let's go to Queen's and watch the tennis and then we went out and to the River Cafe in the evening, it was super nice evening, and then just came here on Sunday.”

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu will add some extra excitement to the 2025 US Open mixed doubles competition, according to former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez.

US Open organisers sent tennis fans into a frenzy when they announced that the two Grand Slam winners will team up in the new mixed doubles format in August.

The tournament will take place the week before the US Open singles event and eight teams have received direct entries based on their combined singles rankings while another eight have entered through wildcards.

Alcaraz and Raducanu were confirmed as one of the wildcard pairings while other star-studded line-ups will include Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, Casper Ruud and Iga Swiatek, Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva, and Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa.

Tennis great Novak Djokovic will also be action as he will team up with fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic.

The Alcaraz-Raducanu partnership certainly caught the tennis community by surprise with the Spaniard confirming he made a request to play with the 2021 US Open winner.

“I mean, the tournament told us about the tournament, the mixed tournament,” he revealed. “I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request.”

The five-time Grand Slam winner added: “I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.

“I know Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have really good relationship with her. So it's just gonna be interesting.

“You know, obviously both, you know, we are gonna enjoy, for sure. I will try, you know, to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.”

And former world No 2 winner Martinez has been asked for her take on the exciting pairing.

“It's certainly a very exciting couple. They admire each other a lot,” Martinez said speaking to BoyleSports, who offer the latest tennis betting.

“They're going to be fun to watch and to see the great energy that Carlos has to bring to the table.

“They get along great and they're going to be very exciting for sure.”

Carlos Alcaraz asked if he will attend Emma Raducanu matches after Brit's Queen's Club appearance

2025 US Open mixed doubles strongest teams: Sinner-Navarro, Alcaraz-Raducanu, Zheng-Draper?

The Spaniard, who lifted the Wimbledon women's singles trophy in 1994, also spoke about Alcaraz's rise as one of the best players in tennis.

The 22-year-old won his fifth major at the recent French Open when he beat Jannik Sinner in five sets in the final that lasted five hours and 29 minutes.

Alcaraz won the US Open in 2022, Wimbledon in 2023 and the French Open and Wimbledon last year.

“What's amazing is his aggressive defence. He gets there with enough speed to create an attacking position from being on the defence. Sinner can also do amazing things but it's different from other players,” Martinez, who is currently coaching young teen sensation Mirra Andreeva, said.

“If Alcaraz continues to be healthy and continues to progress this way, I see him winning one Grand Slam a year at least.

“He has a long way to go to reach the same Grand Slams as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic but hopefully he continues to improve. The way he is going, he can get there.”

Andy Roddick has slammed the likes of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, claiming they are taking spots on the US Open mixed doubles draw that should be kept for the specialists. Despite this strong viewpoint, the former tennis star admits that including big names will only ""grow the game of doubles"" and should be looked upon as a positive thing.

The mixed doubles format for the final major of the year has been changed, moving forward into qualifying week and therefore allowing some of the biggest names in tennis to get some work in at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center ahead of the singles events beginning. It's brought some criticism as the likes of Alcaraz, Raducanu, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro entered their names into the draw, meaning lower-ranked players who planned to play will be set to miss out.

Speaking on Served with Andy Roddick, the American tennis icon has expressed his mixed view on the recently-announced draw, stating that while famous faces will draw viewers to the game, it is also unfair to the tennis stars who specialise in doubles.

The 42-year-old said: ""Now, is it taking jobs away from doubles players who kind of run this side tour? Yeah, it is. But, if your net, most important thing is - which is the defence that I get when people are mad at me when I talk about doubles - is, ‘We have to grow the game of doubles,' there is not a better way to grow the game of doubles than to have the biggest stars on earth playing doubles, featured, ESPN prime time, in the lead-up to the US Open.""

Roddick added: ""This entry list, I thought it would be fine, I thought we'd have some cool names and some cool matchups, [but] this is a 12/10 with the people who are going to do this. Don't argue with me about what mixed doubles should be if you don't get excited about this.

""People were like we had to grow the game of doubles, so we can't take that away from the doubles that people don't watch regularly… that was confusing to me. Now, you get nine of the top 10 on each side, biggest stars on earth, and then some. This is going to bring more eyeballs to the game of doubles.""

Roddick's opinion highlights the mixed feelings around the doubles draw for the US Open this year, with many excited to tune into some of the star-studded partnerships we are greeted with. These include Alcaraz and Raducanu, Sinner and Navarro, Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka teaming up with Nick Kyrgios.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament will be a two-day event on August 19 and 20 during the qualifying week of the final major tournament of the season.

Emma Raducanu has spoken about her relationship with Carlos Alcaraz following the announcement of the pair's US Open partnership.

It was revealed by the US Open last week that Alcaraz and Raducanu had entered the tournament's revamped mixed doubles event as a wildcard pairing.

The new mixed doubles tournament at Flushing Meadows will take place the week before the singles events begin. It will feature eight teams based on the combined singles rankings of the two players and eight wildcard teams.

Alcaraz revealed he made the request to Raducanu and admitted the Brit took some time before accepting his invitation.

“She took a while,” the Spaniard said, laughing.

“No, not that much, not that much. But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't immediate, so…”

Asked about waiting to agree to play with Alcaraz, Raducanu joked: “Gotta keep 'em on their toes (laughing)!

“I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Tennis anchor Novak Djokovic demanded apology from is dropped for Wimbledon coverage","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-australia-channel-1223230","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 09:32:00 GMT","

Channel Nine tennis anchor Tony Jones has been dropped from their Wimbledon coverage following his controversial comments on Novak Djokovic in January.

The 63-year-old has been a key presenter at the Grand Slam tournament for the Australian network in the past. Instead, the channel will turn to its London-based reporters and fly other talents such as Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic in for commentary duties.

In January, Jones made remarks about Djokovic during the Australian Open that stirred controversy and led to the network offering a formal apology. While criticising the Serb, he said ""kick him out"" - an apparent reference to his deportation from Australia in January 2022 as a result of their Coronavirus regulations.

In comments that were slammed by the tennis world and even by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Jones said: ""Novak, he's overrated. Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out... Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me.""

After labelling the comments as ""disrespectful,"" the tennis legend declined a courtside interview with the broadcaster until Jones apologised for his words. While on-air on Channel Nine, Jones said: ""If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd, 'Kick him out.'

""Now, I can stand here and put whatever spin on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the COVID years when he was kicked out [over his vaccination status]. Now, that has angered Novak, which I completely understand now.

""So look, it has been an unfortunate situation. It's been one of personal angst for Novak. It's quite clearly personal angst for me as well. But I just think the priority here now is to focus on the tennis again.""

Channel Nine also relayed their contrition publicly, stating: ""Nine would like to apologise to Novak Djokovic for any offence caused from comments made during a recent live cross. No harm was intended towards Novak or his fans.""

Serbia's ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, decried the treatment of his compatriot, saying: ""Never has an Australian athlete been insulted and disrespected in such a way by the media or any public official in Serbia.""

Before the commencement of this year's Australian Open, Djokovic confessed he experiences ""trauma"" each time he encounters Australian immigration and passport control due to his deportation from the country three years earlier. He told the Herald Sun: ""The last couple of times I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration - I had a bit of trauma from three years ago.

""And some traces still stay there when I'm passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is ­approaching. The person checking my passport - 'Are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go?' I must admit I have that feeling.""

Wimbledon is set to kick off next Monday, June 30, with Djokovic setting his sights on matching Roger Federer's eight-title record at the grass court championships. He reached the final last year, but was beaten in straight sets by Carlos Alcaraz 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).

A triumph in London would see him equal Federer and also surpass Margaret Court's impressive tally of 24 Grand Slam titles, a number with which he is currently even.

      JAMES COONEY FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA



Veteran Channel Nine sports anchor Tony Jones will not be part of the network's Wimbledon coverage this year after being involved in a controversy with Novak Djokovic during the Australian Open.

Jones has been a longtime Wimbledon presenter for the broadcaster, but he will be watching the British grand slam from Melbourne this year.

Nine will be using its London bureau during the tournament and will be flying local experts Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic over for commentary.

Jones sparked controversy in January during a broadcast of the Australian Open when he made remarks about Djokovic and his Serbian fans, including the phrase 'kick him out,' which many interpreted as referencing Djokovic's 2021 deportation from Australia.

'Novak's overrated. Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out... Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me,' he said.

Djokovic called the comments disrespectful and later boycotted a courtside interview with the broadcaster until he received a public apology from Jones.

'If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd — 'kick him out',' Jones said on Nine.

'Now, I can stand here and put whatever spin on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the COVID years when he [Djokovic] was kicked out [over his vaccination status].

'Now, that has angered Novak, which I completely understand now. So look, it has been an unfortunate situation. It's been one of personal angst for Novak.

'It's quite clearly personal angst for me as well. But I just think the priority here now is to focus on the tennis again.'

Nine also issued an apology over the incident: 'Nine would like to apologise to Novak Djokovic for any offence caused from comments made during a recent live cross. No harm was intended towards Novak or his fans.'

Serbia's ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, also expressed his 'profound concern' to Channel Nine at the time.

In a statement, the ambassador said: 'The Embassy of the Republic of Serbia considers Mr Jones' comments [to be] totally inappropriate and disrespectful.

'Never has an Australian athlete been insulted and disrespected in such a way by the media or any public official in Serbia.'

The tournament is set to start later this week, with the Serb superstar looking to match Roger Federer's record of eight titles at the event.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

Joao Fonseca recorded his first tour-level grass-court win on Monday at the Lexus Eastbourne Open, where he moved past Zizou Bergs 6-7(8), 6-0, 6-3 to reach the second round.

Competing in windy conditions, the #NextGenATP Brazilian recovered from squandering three set points in the first set to triumph after two hours and 10 minutes. With his 13th tour-level win of the season, the 18-year-old became the youngest match winner at the ATP 250 since three-time champion Taylor Fritz in 2015.

“I am very happy to win my first match on grass, here in Eastbourne, in such a nice place and against a very good player,” Fonseca said. “After a tough tie-break, getting through mentally is very good. I am very happy for this one.”

Fonseca, who was competing in his third tour-level grass-court match, will meet top seed Fritz in the second round. The World No. 57 produced moments of magic against Bergs, highlighted by his stunning pickup to break for 4-2 in the third set. Fonseca will hope to bring that level against World No. 5 Fritz in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

British wild card Daniel Evans defeated Miomir Kecmanovic 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 and Italian Mattia Bellucci beat Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2. Evans next faces Tommy Paul and Bellucci meets Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard or Cameron Norrie.

F1.com's Lawrence Barretto chats to Nico Hulkenberg about his F1 return with Haas, bringing home the points for Sauber, and Audi's arrivial in 2026.

Nico Hulkenberg is living his best life right now.

Three years ago, a return to Formula 1 looked bleak. The German had been on the sidelines since being let go by Renault at the end of 2019. He'd scored points in two super-sub appearances for Racing Point in 2022 – but even then, a full-time return was unlikely. 

Then Haas came calling, the American squad were in need of experience, and Hulkenberg had his second act – and a chance to finally end his long wait for a maiden podium (he's currently 240 Grands Prix weekends and counting without a top-three finish).

The jury was out as to whether he'd still got it, but it soon became clear Hulkenberg's time out of the sport had done him the world of good. 

An enforced sabbatical had given him an appreciation of how much F1 meant to him and how much he needed it. It gave him a new perspective on racing, too. 

So, when he returned, Hulkenberg looked like he'd never been away. While the Haas wasn't good enough in race trim in 2023, the German could still show his quality in Qualifying. 

""When I came back in 2023 with Haas, it was like a new girlfriend,"" he says when we chat on the balcony of Sauber's hospitality at the Canadian Grand Prix, a race after his superb fifth-place finish at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Spain. 

""I had a fresh love. I still feel in love. I like coming to the racetracks, doing all the travels, putting in the hours to work with the team and the factory before and after the events. 

""There is nothing I'd rather be doing. I enjoy it and there's lots to look forward to with next year coming up.""

It's no wonder Hulkenberg says life is good. The 37-year-old, who turns 38 in August and is the third oldest driver on the grid, has hit the ground running with Sauber, who were (points-wise) F1's worst team last year.

He's made the most of an improved chassis and, more recently, an upgrade package that has hauled the team into being a regular points contender in a ruthlessly tight midfield. 

Hulkenberg has 20 points on the board after 10 races – that's more than Sauber have scored in the previous two years combined. 

Fifth in Spain was Hulkenberg's best result since the 2019 Italian Grand Prix in Monza – and came thanks to a sweet moment when he overtook Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari for the position on track (see the clip below).

Consistency has been Hulkenberg's trademark and he's shown that brilliantly this year, outperforming his highly-rated rookie team mate Gabriel Bortoleto.

""Obviously, [my experience has been] quite handy and helpful in many situations,"" he says. ""I have to be sharp, because Gabi is really bringing the heat to the table. 

""He's a youngster, he's a rookie, but he's very impressive. The speed, how clinically he drives, his approach, his attitude, how hard he works. 

""I know he hasn't had a result yet, but really that's just a matter of time, because he's got it all. He's very impressive and he's definitely pushing me.""

This is the calibre of driver Audi – who will make Sauber their works team from next season – had hoped they would be getting when signing him on a long-term deal from this year. 

They wanted someone fast who can deliver results consistently while driving the team forward and dovetailing with their young rookie whom they signed from McLaren's junior programme. 

Audi know they have a big job on their hands to hit the ground running when they debut next year, bringing with them their own power unit built to sweeping new regulations. 

Hulkenberg bet on Audi getting it right with their first foray in F1 – and while he is pleased with how the team is progressing in readiness of the German manufacturer's arrival, he is aware that Audi's anticipated performance is a ""big unknown"". 

The German one-time polesitter adds: ""It's such a reset and a white piece of paper that everyone starts from. It's impossible to predict anything.

""The big four teams have an advantage in terms of infrastructure and all these kinds of things. But it's a good opportunity, because it is a reset, it is a fresh start for everyone with these new regulations.

""It's extremely exciting and a good opportunity for everyone, including ourselves. We need to work hard, we need to work focused on it and hopefully we'll come out on the right side of it.""

Hulkenberg – whose F1 career spans back to 2010 – has never been in the right place at the right time and never got the chance to move to a big team when his form warranted it. 

After driving for Williams, Force India, Sauber, Renault, Racing Point, Aston Martin, Haas and now Sauber again, maybe – just maybe – this move will be the move for the German.

Then it's down to Hulkenberg to keep doing what he's doing, and perhaps he'll finally get that elusive podium he's been chasing for so long.

Industry leader AMC Theatres is reversing course and joining its rivals on July 1 in adding regular ads to its pre-movie lineup in a worrisome trend for studios.  


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	For decades, there has been no better way for Hollywood marketers to drum up interest in their films than to play trailers for thousands of fans settled in their seats at cinemas across the country waiting for the main attraction to begin. But this age-old tradition is being disrupted by an aggressive push to sprinkle in a sampling of commercials between trailers and the regular parade of supplemental spots promoting concessions and rules of the road (as in, no texting!).


	Consumers — thanks to reserved seating — are realizing there's no need to show up at the stated showtime if the actual movie may not begin until 20 minutes to 30 minutes later.

					Behind AMC Theatres' Decision to Slash Ticket Prices		
			









	The erosion has been years in the making. In September of 2019, not long before COVID-19 struck, Cinemark Theatres and Regal Cinemas — the country's two largest chains behind AMC Theatres — signed a landmark deal with ad company National CineMedia to show as much as five minutes of commercials after a movie's official start time, and then air a 30-second to 60-second “Platinum Spot” before the one or last two trailers. Retail partners have included the likes of Jeep, E.L.F. Cosmetics, Google and Cook, among a number of other top brands.


	At the time, NCM CEO Tom Lesinski said it was “the most significant strategic announcement since the company was founded in 2003.” Prior to that, NCM was relegated to playing commercials before the official showtime. He also suggested said market leader AMC active talks to join the initiative.


	It fast turned into a boxing match. AMC issued a terse denial hours later, saying it flatly rejected the idea because of concerns that U.S. moviegoers would “react quite negatively to the concept.” Continuing, AMC, the country's largest chain, said it had “no plan to introduce commercial advertising close to the start of a movie's commencement at its theatres in the United States, nor does AMC envision entering into such an arrangement with NCM anytime in the foreseeable future.”

	











	But times change and AMC, facing financial pressure, is reversing course. “Our competitors have fully participated for more than five years without any direct impact to their attendance,” AMC said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month. The chain added, “The new deal between AMC and NCM allows both companies to drive new revenues to offset the impact of being hit by the shutdown of cinemas due to the COVID pandemic, followed by an at times faltering Hollywood industry recovery since the reopening of theaters and advertising being affected by macro-economic headwinds.”


	The deal takes effect July 1, just in time for Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth and DC Studios/Warner Bros.' Superman. AMC is already known for its lengthy preshow time, which runs 25 to 30 minutes, so it will have to reconfigure its lineup — which includes the famous Nicole Kidman spot promoting the “magic” of moviegoing — to allow for the new ads without going over the half-hour mark. AMC declined to comment, but other sources say it will begin addressing the preshow on its ticketing platforms the week of June 23 and, fingers crossed, hope its audiences won't mind the change too much.


	According to EntTelligence, the firm founded by Steve Buck, only 60 percent of moviegoers this year were in their seats when trailers started playing. “Moviegoing behavior is shifting and continued experimentation with how to engage audiences is necessary,” he says.


	The decline in attendance at the start of trailer play in New York and Los Angeles — the country's two largest moviegoing markets — is particularly noticeable. And in recent screenings that have been observed by THR, attendees arrived after the stated showtime and as trailers were playing, a sign that consumers are recognizing what chains are doing. So far this year, only 42 percent of L.A. moviegoers were in their seats in time to see every trailer, compared to 55 percent last year. The New York stat is likewise 42 percent this year, compared to 47 percent last year.

	











	Or, as one ticket buyer noted over the June 20-22 weekend when 28 Years Later started playing at a prominent L.A. theater after a lengthy preshow, “finally.”

The legendary multihyphenate speaks with The Hollywood Reporter about her new album, 'The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two,' and why she prayed her voice would show up for it. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Barbra Streisand is having breakfast. 


	It's Wednesday afternoon, just after 1 p.m., and the legendary artist is sharing blueberries with her three beloved Coton de Tuléars. She's happy to multitask, however, as there's work to do in promoting The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, a new album of duets that drops Friday, June 27. The sequel to 2014's Grammy-nominated Partners finds Streisand sharing lyrics with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Sting, James Taylor, Hozier, Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and more.




	The roster reads like a who's who of the music business, a list that it seems only Streisand could land for one record. “Isn't it great? I'm very lucky,” Streisand tells The Hollywood Reporter over the phone from her home in Malibu. She's also counting her blessings that her voice rose to the challenge of recording 11 new songs, a feat accomplished after a grueling schedule of completing the narration for her New York Times best-selling memoir My Name Is Barbra.

	“My voice was very hoarse,” recalled the EGOT winner of the moment she entered the studio to record the first song. “I remember it was such a powerful moment. I prayed to God literally to have my voice there for me. I opened up my mouth to sing the song, and my voice was there, which was a shock to me. I can't explain that moment, really. I hope I can make you understand what that feels like. It was just an album that was meant to be.”


	Below is what an interview with Streisand is meant to be. It's full of asides, loving commentary to one of those dogs, Miss Violet, and even one “like butta” moment with Streisand spelling it out for specificity, “b-u-t-t-a.” Streisand also offers an update on her forthcoming documentary project with Frank Marshall and Alex Gibney and whether or not she'll perform live again.

	











How are you?


	I'm just splitting blueberries with my doggies, we're eating.


That sounds like a great afternoon.


	It's my morning.


Well, good morning to you. First of all, what an honor, I'm so grateful for the time.


	You're so sweet. Thank you.


With all the heaviness in the world, it was such a joy to put the new album on repeat yesterday and disappear into these duets and listen to your beautiful voice all day. How do you feel about putting out an album right now?


	I feel great about it. What are you thinking?


Just in terms of what's happening in the world. An album of love songs and duets is a nice respite from the news.


	Music does that. It brings out the warmth and the spirit and the love in the world rather than the hate. It's good timing.


Definitely good timing. It feels like you are the only living artist that could put out an album of duets and get this incredible mix of legends like Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and James Taylor with pop superstars like Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey.


	Isn't it great? I'm very lucky.


Can you talk about your creative process — how do you decide who to duet with and on which song?


	My producers, Peter Asher and Walter Afanasieff, and my longtime A&R man, Jay Landers, brought me a lot of choices. At the time, I had just finished reading my audio book [for the recording] for six weeks, five days a week, six hours a day. My voice was very hoarse, and I thought when I came to the studio to record my first song, I remember it was such a powerful moment. I prayed to God literally to have my voice there for me. I opened up my mouth to sing the song, and my voice was there, which was shock to me. I can't explain that moment, really. I hope I can make you understand what that feels like. It was just an album that was meant to be.

	











Wow. Your prayers were answered because your voice sounds so silky and stunning.


	Like butta. B-u-t-t-a.


Yes, exactly.


	It surprised me. I was never one to really warm up my voice. I just never had the energy or the theory about it. I was also too lazy and always busy. Prayer overtook that, I don't know. I can't even tell you what that felt like. I can't really explain it, but when I walked into the room with my producers and engineer, who's fantastic, it was like … they were applauding. I thought, “Oh, I must have done good here.” I did hear it in my earphones. I wondered, “Where did that come from?”


You've never done any warmups or even tricks of the trade to keep your voice in shape?


	No, I'm just too lazy. I can't explain that. I try to, and then after five minutes I'm bored and really I have to go back to the news or something that interests me. It's a gift that I'm very pleased to have.


You're obviously doing something right. This album is the second volume to Partners, which was released in 2014 and went on to earn a Grammy nomination for best traditional pop vocal album. It featured duets with only male singers. What sparked the invitation to duet with female singers on this one with Ariana, Mariah and Laufey?


	Why wouldn't I? I'm an advocate of women, and I really wanted to sing with some women on this album.


What were the conversations to get Mariah and Ariana together, and what was the recording process?


	You know what, I can't remember now. Did I do it alone? Some of the songs, I do my vocal first and then people work around me. In this case, the women wanted to do theirs, I think. Jesus, I forget things like that. Ariana is so young and powerful, she can do it fast. Mariah wanted to take her time and do it. Her process was trying it one day, and then trying it another, I think. But I was in the middle. I'm the oldest of these beautiful powerful voices.

	











	I met Mariah several times over the years, and I worked with Ariana before. She came in and joined me in Chicago the last time I sang live [at the United Center in August 2019]. We rehearsed the day before in my hotel room, and the next day we performed [the song “Enough Is Enough”]. Well, it was 70,000 people in the audience, just like the 70,000 when I sang in A Star Is Born at Sun Devil Stadium in Arizona. Can you imagine? I went onstage that first time and said, “I know this is a rock and roll concert, but I'm going to sing you a song that I just wrote for the movie called ‘Evergreen' and I hope you like it.” That was the first time I ever sang my own song.


Wow.


	It was exciting. That number, 70,000 — whoa.


Hearing you mention that performance, I can only imagine that when people read this or hear the song you recorded with Ariana and Mariah — or any of them for that matter — people will want to know if there's a chance you will perform any of the tracks live?


	I never say never. Who knows what's in store?


I read the great interview you did with David Remnick in The New Yorker so I know that you didn't forget the recording process with Bob Dylan. You said that Bob stood on his feet for three hours with you to record “The Very Thought of You.”


	That's right.


And that it was “three extraordinary hours.” Can you tell me more about your time with Dylan?


	We were all kind of scared a bit because I was told I can't bring anybody to the recording studio, not even my producers. So I was kind of scared, but thrilled to be meeting him in person for the first time. My husband wasn't allowed to come. He usually comes to my sessions. He likes to do that. Bob came with his wife. I actually gave him a copy of my book and inscribed it with something like, “You and I were 19 years old at the same time, strolling around Greenwich Village looking for work.” He was performing at the same time I was performing at the Bon Soir, my first real professional job as a singer. I wanted to be an actress, I just took those jobs and entered a talent contest before that so I could afford my apartment.

	











	It was just interesting that we have been around each other then and then years later, I think it was the ‘70s or was it the ‘80s? I forget. That's why it took me so long to write my book. I worked on it for over 10 years and had to have a researcher. “When did I do that? When did I do this? What year was that?” I have no idea. It's on the tip of my brain. [Streisand, speaking directly to her dog] What's the matter, honey? You want another blueberry, sweetheart? What was I saying?


You were talking about the book.


	Thank you. And by the way, tell the truth here. Everybody is saying the book was 992 pages but it's not, so correct it. I just looked it up the other day and it's 966 pages. I was wondering why they were saying 992? If you want to count the acknowledgements or the back of the book where they list everything? I don't know. What's that called?


The index?


	It's one of those words, but my editor was interesting. She said, “Don't put everybody's name in so they could just go to the back of the book to see if they're in it.” So whatever, the point is that it's 966 pages of story.


Well, people devoured all those pages. Hearing you talk about the book made me think of this other project you are working on about your life. I read last September that you're doing a documentary on your life with Frank Marshall and Alex Gibney. How's it coming along?


	I guess slowly because there's a lot of work to do, and they're both very busy men. I've only seen a little short reel that they showed me and my record company. But it's good. It was a good piece. I only had one interview with them, but they've been interviewing people in my life, so that's been good. I guess I haven't seen it. I only did one interview so far.

	











Back to the album. I love the video clip you posted of Paul McCartney for your duet “My Valentine.” Paul says there were “moments of terror” recording with you, I assume because of the nerves. How would you describe your time recording?


	Oh, easy. My dog is crying. Oh, no. What is it, honey? What is it? What is it? I know you want more to eat, but we finished all the blueberries. Look, there's nothing left. That's Violet. Miss Violet.


Hi, Violet.


	How would I describe it? Well, he hadn't sung his song in a long time. That was funny because he had to get used to it again. I mean, he wrote it a long time ago. For me, I just learned it. I saw it and sang it a few times. But it was so sweet to see him. He's written so many great songs and some popular, famous songs. He has a huge catalog. He's so sweet. He is a doll. Very, very sweet. I remember meeting him. Can you imagine? In England. I must've been there doing Funny Girl. Somehow he invited me to his house with his first wife, Linda. Just a lovely thing to do. See, I don't remember things. I never play my own records. I also sang one of his songs, “With a Little Help From My Friends” on one of my albums. I don't remember the name of the album but anyway, he wanted to meet me and he was very sweet to invite me over then.


You don't listen to the albums? How has your process changed now, when you put a new album like this one out in the world, do you engage with reviews, comments or any of the reception?












	Oh, I mean, I love good reviews. I love when people get the story right. Here comes my husband taking my empty cereal. Yeah, I'm going to finish my coffee, honey. What's the question, how do I engage with the reception?


Yes.


	Somebody from my record company or Jay Landers or Ken Sunshine, people who have been in my life many, many years will send me something. 


My last question: How is life in Malibu now after the fires?


	We had to leave our house. I needed to take a shower. We went a hotel. But the [fire] five years ago was the horror story. This was horrible, I mean, it shook me up between what's going on in the world now and in our country. It is very disturbing. It makes me want to get on a boat and sail away.

Meadows' 'Chork,' releasing in U.K. theaters in 2026, follows 15-year-old Kit and 11-year-old Ani as they leave their foster home and trek across the English coastline in hopes of a brighter future.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	After more than a decade-long hiatus from the big screen, Shane Meadows is making a return to cinema with a new film, Chork.


	Penned by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne and set along the east coast of England, Chork follows 15-year-old Kit and 11-year-old Ani as they leave their foster home and trek across the coastline in hopes of a brighter future. With the police in pursuit and a national search underway, Kit must use all her determination and wits to protect Ani and fulfil their mission.




	Cast by Meadows' frequent collaborator, Shaheen Baig (Adolescence, Hot Milk), the two have secured the film's lead cast with open casting calls taking place earlier in the year throughout the U.K.

	“To be returning to film after 17 years, writing alongside ‘megadude' Jack Thorne again, and working with so many gifted collaborators, has been an absolute privilege,” said Meadows. “Our story follows two beyond bright, funny as heck and mischievously ingenious young people on a ‘runaway' road trip the length of this glorious isle.”


	“Safe to say,”  he continued, “I'm beyond excited about what we've captured on their journey. I'm also hugely grateful to our partners at BBC Film, BFI, Screen Yorkshire, Hoopsa Films and Altitude for their undying trust and support throughout.”


	Meadows gained critical acclaim with features TwentyFourSeven, Dead Man's Shoes, A Room for Romeo Brass and Somers Town. His television credits include This Is England, which premiered in Toronto in 2006, The Virtues starring Stephen Graham and The Gallows Pole.

	











Chork is produced by Ben Pugh and Cathy King for 42, Lauren Dark and Amy Jackson for Unified, Meadows' Big Arty and Thorne's One Shoe Films, both of whom will also executive produce.


	The film is financed by BBC Film, BFI (awarding National Lottery funding), Screen Yorkshire (via the Yorkshire Content Fund) and Hoopsa Films.


	Executive producers are Eva Yates and Kristin Irving for BBC Film, Louise Ortega for the BFI, Caroline Cooper Charles for Screen Yorkshire, Sonny Gill and Tim Macready for Hoopsa Films, and Ali Jazayeri and Keith Kehoe for Three Picture Capital alongside Laura Jackson and Joshua Horsfield. The film was developed with BBC Film.


	Altitude will release Chork in U.K. and Irish cinemas in 2026 and will manage international sales.


	Yates, director of BBC Film, added: “The films of Shane Meadows are at the heart of contemporary British independent cinema and we are hugely excited to support his return, with a cast of exceptional new actors, his brilliant writing collaborator Jack Thorne, and an anarchic story of love, redemption and the untapped and profound potential of youth.”

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Global talent, entertainment, sports and advisory company United Talent Agency (UTA) has appointed partner Darnell Strom as its head of UTA's U.K. office in London. The executive has experience in politics, including past work with Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. At UTA, he has been a key player for its global strategy and has worked across business areas, representing such clients as Malala Yousafzai, Michaela Coel, Grace Wales Bonner, Jonathan Anderson, i-D Magazine, BBC/HBO hit Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, Jon Batiste, Karlie Kloss, Jose Andres, Whitney Wolfe Herd, and Alexis Ohanian.

	Moving from L.A. to London, “Strom will oversee UTA's extensive U.K. operation and continued expansion into key markets across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa,” the company said. The newly created role “underscores UTA's ambition to evolve London into a major international hub for the company,” following its decision to open a new London office in 2023 after the acquisition of talent and literary powerhouse Curtis Brown, the ROOF Football Agency, and consultancy firm MediaLink.




	“Strom brings both extensive experience of working at UTA, alongside deep cross-disciplinary knowledge and a global network of client relationships spanning entertainment, fashion/luxury, sports, and media,” the firm said. “His leadership will focus on strengthening integration and connectivity across UTA's European operations, unlocking new business opportunities, and driving growth throughout the region.”


	Said UTA CEO David Kramer: “This marks an exciting new chapter for UTA. Darnell has long been a connector across departments, industries, and geographies. His deep relationships and creative vision make him uniquely suited to lead this next phase of our international expansion.”

	











	Strom said London is “one of the most dynamic and creative markets in the world, and UTA has only scratched the surface of what's possible here.” He added: “I'm honored to lead our next phase of growth working with the incredible team we have in London, to build a stronger and more connected UTA across London, Europe and beyond.”


	Strom joined UTA in 2019 and previously served as head of culture & commerce. In his new role, he will work closely with UTA's London teams across the firm's music, creators, brand marketing, comedy, production arts, and advisory services units. This will include close collaboration with Curtis Brown Group and ROOF Football Agency.


	Strom began his career in politics, non-profit work, and social entrepreneurship. He served as director of the chair's office at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was then named the Florida Director of Operations for John Kerry's presidential campaign. In 2005, Strom served as deputy director of scheduling to former President Bill Clinton and was subsequently tasked with creating a program, the Clinton Foundation Millennium Network, which reflected Clinton's vision of engaging the next generation of leaders. Later, he served on President Barack Obama's White House Entertainment Council.

'A Court of Thorns and Roses' author Maas will, with IMG Licensing, extend her well-loved characters beyond the pages across apparel, beauty, lifestyle, food, games and immersive fan experiences.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Sarah J. Maas, best-selling author known for her blockbuster literary franchises including A Court of Thorns and Roses, has signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with IMG Licensing.


The Hollywood Reporter can reveal that, under the multiyear deal, IMG Licensing will develop and manage a robust licensing program spanning Maas's entire fictional universe with the aim of creating new touchpoints for her fervid fan base.




	With over 70 million English copies sold worldwide and translations in 38 languages, Maas is one of the most influential authors of her generation with a knack for the “romantasy” genre. Hit books of hers also include the Throne of Glass and Crescent City series.

	Through the new partnership, Maas and IMG Licensing will extend well-loved characters and stories beyond the pages and into apparel, beauty, lifestyle, home décor, wine and spirits, food and beverage, toys and games, collectibles, cosplay, and immersive fan experiences, THR understands.


	“Representing Sarah J. Maas and her extraordinary literary worlds is an incredible honor,” said Samantha Chang, vice president at IMG Licensing. “Together, Sarah and her fans have created a cultural phenomenon that has redefined fantasy fiction.”


	She continued: “We're excited to launch a dynamic and carefully curated licensing program that offers fans meaningful new ways to celebrate the characters and stories they love.”


	Hulu's TV adaptation of ACOTAR, with Ron Moore attached, was officially scrapped earlier this year, but not to fear — the rights have been returned to Maas and she'll be shopping them around to different studios.

Tickets for Dolly's Vegas concerts go on sale this Wednesday, June 25.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Dolly Parton is going to Las Vegas. On Monday (June 23) the country icon announced a limited engagement concert residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, set for six nights in December.


	Parton will perform on Dec. 4, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13. She'll be “weaving together seven decades of classic hits and fan favorites including ‘9 to 5,' ‘Jolene,' ‘I Will Always Love You' and ‘Coat of Many Colors,'” says a press release from her representatives.


	“To say I'm excited would be an understatement,” Parton herself said in a statement released Monday morning. “I haven't worked Vegas in years and I've always loved singing there. I'm looking so forward to the shows in The Colosseum at Caesars and I hope you are as well. See you there!”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Tickets for Dolly: Live in Las Vegas are scheduled to go on sale via Ticketmaster on Wednesday, June 25, at 10 a.m. PT.


	Ticket options will include a range of VIP packages, with extras like a personal photo opportunity with Parton, an onstage tour, access to the singer's Rhinestone Lounge, a deluxe gift set and more.

	











	All shows will begin at 8 p.m.


	The concert dates, marking Parton's first extended run in Las Vegas since a short engagement in the early '90s — at the then-new, but now-closed, Mirage Hotel, where she performed alongside Kenny Rogers — fall during the week of the National Finals Rodeo in Vegas.


	Parton's most recent full-length album, Rockstar, was released in 2023, earning the No. 1 spot on the Top Country Albums chart and reaching No. 3 on the all-genre Billboard 200. 


	In March 2025, she released a heartfelt song in tribute to her late husband, Carl Dean (“If You Hadn't Been There“).


	Since 2024, Parton has featured on a number of projects for fellow artists, from Beyoncé (“Tyrant” and the interlude “Dolly P“) and Post Malone (“Have a Heart“) to Sabrina Carpenter (a remix of “Please Please Please“) and Mötley Crüe (a reimagined “Home Sweet Home“).

	“Please give it up for my beautiful cast of Sunset Blvd,” Scherzinger told the crowd in a video shared by BCEFA on Instagram. “Happy Pride, baby!”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The cast recording, Sunset Blvd: The Album, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Cast Albums chart dated Nov. 9. The album was recorded live at the Savoy Theatre in London and released Oct. 25 via The Really Useful Group/The Other Songs.


	Scherzinger, who scored four top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 as a member of The Pussycat Dolls, won her first Tony Award for best actress in a musical for her performance in Sunset Blvd. The role previously earned Glenn Close a win in the same category for the original Broadway production in 1995. Scherzinger triumphed in a stacked category that included Audra McDonald, the most awarded performer in Tony history with six wins. McDonald was nominated for Gypsy but has now lost in her last three nominations, following Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (2020) and Ohio State Murders (2023).

	











	Broadway Bares is known for blending theatrical spectacle with star appearances, but booking a pop icon like Scherzinger to perform a major hit from the 2000s added an extra layer of excitement, signaling that Scherzinger, while fully immersed in musical theater, remains proud of her Pussycat Dolls legacy.


Sunset Blvd. is scheduled to run on Broadway through July 6, 2025.

The global girl group's new single brought in 43% of the vote.

	Ashley Iasimone



	“Gabriela,” the new single from KATSEYE, tops this week's new music poll.


	Music fans voted in a poll published Friday (June 20) on Billboard, choosing the global girl group's fresh track as their favorite new music release of the past week.


	Votes streamed in over the weekend, with music fans ultimately making “Gabriela” their top pick over new releases from Public Enemy, Cardi B, Benson Boone, Karol G, Lorde, Haim and more. The new KATSEYE track brought in 43% of the vote.


	KATSEYE dropped “Gabriela” as a pre-release from their upcoming Beautiful Chaos EP, due out on June 27 via HYBE x Geffen (pre-save here). The track has a Latin pop groove and incorporates both English- and Spanish-language lyrics — with a bridge sung entirely in Spanish. The single follows “Gnarly,” which earned the group's six members their career-first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 in May — and got a remix with Ice Spice earlier this month.

	











	Released on June 19, the deliberately melodramatic, telenovela-inspired “Gabriela” music video, featuring actress Jessica Alba and directed by Andrew Thomas Huang, has amassed 9.3 million views on YouTube as of press time on Sunday, June 22. 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Over the weekend, KATSEYE — Daniela, Lara, Manon, Megan, Sophia and Yoonchae — performed “Gnarly” at the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards. The performance ended with a requisite sliming.


	Among the new music trailing behind “Gabriela” on this week's poll are Public Enemy's “March Madness,” with 22% of the vote; Cardi B's “Outside,” with 16% of the vote; Benson Boone's “American Heart,” with 5% of the vote, and Karol G's Tropicoqueta, with 2% of the vote.


	See the final results of this week's poll below.

	In comments published by The Sun, Starmer said he does not believe Kneecap should perform at the iconic festival on June 28. “No, I don't, and I think we need to come down really clearly on this,” he said. “This is about the threats that shouldn't be made. I won't say too much because there's a court case on, but I don't think that's appropriate.”

	Last Wednesday (June 18), Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh — known as Mo Chara — appeared at Westminster Crown Court, accused of displaying a Hezbollah flag and chanting “Up Hamas, Up Hezbollah” during a 2024 London concert.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Kneecap have denied the allegations, calling the charges a “carnival of distraction” in a statement previously posted to social media. “We deny this ‘offense' and will vehemently defend ourselves,” the group said. They added, “British courts have long charged people from the North of Ireland with ‘terrorism' for crimes never committed. We will fight them. We will win.”

	











	Kneecap's growing notoriety has drawn attention beyond the courtroom. At Coachella earlier this year, the trio accused organizers of censoring their pro-Palestine messaging during the livestream. They were recently removed from Scotland's TRNSMT festival due to “police safety concerns,” but their Glastonbury performance remains on the lineup — and the BBC is still planning to air it live.


	Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch joined Starmer in criticizing the group, also taking aim at the BBC. “As a publicly funded platform, the BBC should not be rewarding extremism,” she wrote on social media.


	Kneecap, whose debut album Fine Art was released in 2024, have built a reputation for blending satire, politics and Irish identity into a brash hip-hop sound. The controversy around their appearance has turned what might have been a standard festival set into one of Glastonbury's most politically charged moments in years.

	The tour begins June 23 at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, where London Grammar will open. BANKS will join Del Rey for three dates — June 26 in Glasgow, June 28 in Liverpool, and June 30 in Dublin. Rae, who recently topped charts with her debut album Addison, will open both of Del Rey's highly anticipated Wembley Stadium shows on July 3 and 4.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The social media star-turned-pop artist Rae has rapidly gained traction since releasing Addison, with her Los Angeles hometown show attracting more than 100,000 fans in the ticketing queue for a venue that holds just 2,300 people.


	Del Rey announced the support lineup with a casual Instagram post reading, “Lettttts go!” — and followed up with a birthday post celebrating her own upcoming performances. “I'm so excited to see everybody starting tomorrow on tour and for all the folks joining us. Truly, thank you, thank you, love you,” she wrote.

	











	Originally teased as a tour in support of an album called Lasso, the project has since undergone several changes. In April, Del Rey revealed the album had been renamed The Right Person Will Stay and said it “will not come on time.” 


	Despite the delay, she has released two songs from the album and teased another during her performance at Stagecoach earlier this year.


	During her debut at the 2025 Stagecoach Country Music Festival in Indio, Calif., on April 25, the 39-year-old singer revealed in her new song “57.5” that she once locked lips with a major country star. “I kissed Morgan Wallen/ I guess kissing me kind of went to his head,” Del Rey sang. “If you want my secret to success/ I suggest don't go ATVing with him when you're out west.”

					By Justin Kroll 

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: After setting up her biopic project with Netflix and Chernin Entertainment, Ronda Rousey is now ready to tag in the person to take on directing duties for the film adaptation of her bestselling memoirs. Sources tell Deadline that Augustine Frizzell is set to direct the biopic based on Rousey's memoirs My Fight/Your Fight and Our Fight, which she co-wrote with her sister Maria Burns Ortiz. Chernin Entertainment is on board to produce.


	Deadline first reported the news of how this package came together, starting with Rousey working in WME's story group department to learn about screenwriting structure and technique. After going through dozens of scripts from others, she would ultimately pen the script by herself in just seven days, shocking her agents who couldn't believe she was a first-time writer. The script was soon taken to market, with Chernin moving fast to land a meeting and come on as producers.

	











	When it came to finding a director, everyone involved wanted a woman to help tell Rousey's story. After meeting several candidates, Frizzell came in and blew everyone away with her take for the film. A fan of Rousey long before she began directing TV episodes and feature films, sources say Frizzell had read both memoirs before she got the call to meet on it and knew right away this job needed to be hers. Not only is Frizzell a fan, but in her spare time she trains in Muay Thai and is well-versed in the world in which the former UFC champion came up.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix also had strong ties to the director, having most recently set her to direct four of the eight episodes of the upcoming Netflix series The Boroughs. With the Duffer Brothers producing, the series created by Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews is a high priority for the streamer.


	The Rousey project was originally set up at Paramount in 2015, when the studio acquired rights to the first memoir My Fight/Your Fight. Following a handful of regime changes at the studio, the rights would eventually lapse, with Netflix ultimately jumping on them after exec and longtime Rousey fan Michelle Evans championed the project.


	What's interesting here, given how much time has passed since the first memoir's release, is that Rousey has written a second memoir, Our Fight, which goes into even more detail about her life. Some of those new details include suffering her first loss to Holly Holm and contemplating suicide post-fight; her history with concussions that preceded her MMA career; and her tumultuous relationship with her longtime coach Edmond Tarverdyan.


	As for Frizzell, the rising star got her big break with her directorial feature debut Never Goin' Back, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and was released later that year by A24. The film was nominated for the John Cassavetes Award at the 2019 Independent Spirit Awards.  She would also direct the pilot for the hit HBO series Euphoria., and the StudioCanal/Netflix film The Last Letter From Your Lover.


	Frizzell is repped WME.

EXCLUSIVE: Julie Benz (Dexter), Busy Philipps (Mean Girls), Ron Perlman (Hellboy) and Jim Rash (The Way Way Back) are to star in horror-comedy Horrified.


	The film will see a down-on-her-luck scream queen (Benz) return to the horror convention circuit for fast cash, only to find the pig-masked killer from her old franchise weaponizing her cult legacy against her friends and fans, forcing her to confront past demons and fight for survival in a blood-soaked slasher showdown.


	The project, which is due to shoot this summer, marks the feature debut of writer-director Michael Zara, a writer on three seasons of TNT drama Major Crimes.

	Executive producers are Julie Benz, Busy Philipps, Ron Perlman, and Tom Biolchini. Co-producers are Carl Reid and Enrico Natale of Redbird Entertainment.

	Zara said: “The idea for Horrified came to me over twelve years ago while I was attending a Midwest horror convention, so finally seeing it become a reality with a killer (pun intended) cast and producing team is truly thrilling.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Gilded Age adjusts to a new order","https://www.avclub.com/the-gilded-age-season-3-premiere-recap","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The A.V. Club will return to recap this season's fourth episode on July 13.]    

The thing about the real Gilded Age is that it ended. The mansions of the Vanderbilts and the Astors were destroyed, and the Russells' would have been too. And while the Vanderbilts and the Astors were incredibly powerful people and their descendants are still quite wealthy, it is not their world anymore, nor was it for very long in the grand scheme of things. The longer The Gilded Age goes on, the closer the end gets. Just look at Agnes van Rhijn, the character who epitomized old money and ended season two living off the inheritance of her widowed sister, which was the exact opposite position she was in to start The Gilded Age. As easily as it is to make it in America, it's just as easy to lose it. 

Season three begins in the small desert mining town of Morenci, Arizona. While waiting for John Ranger, a middleman who will help him meet some miners, we learn that George Russell wants to build a direct train line from Chicago to Los Angeles, a high-reward but high-risk proposition, according to his secretary Richard Clay. The plan requires a ton of upfront investment, including the purchase of a mine to avoid routing the railroad through the mountains. George has learned a lesson, though perhaps a bad one, from his attempted union busting last season. He would like to talk to the mine owner individually to court them, but they know they're better off asking him to make them all rich as a group. They know they have leverage—if George can't purchase the mines, he would have to plan a costly reroute of the railroad—but before they can settle that, George must return to New York. There's fear of a run on the bank.  

It's unseasonably cold back in New York, where Ada is still dressed in mourning black after the death of Mr. Luke Forte. She is still actively grieving him and thinking about little else, going as far as to tell her sister Agnes that she misses him so much that she will sometimes go to sleep hoping to never wake up. Cynthia Nixon is great here, a welcome change from the kind of broad acting that defines her other show right now. One other thing Ada is thinking of, though, is the temperance movement. She says she's doing it to honor Luke's memory—as Agnes counters, clergy literally drink religiously—but it also functions as a way for her to exert control over the house. After Oscar drove Agnes' side of the family into destitution at the end of last season, Ada is now the lady of the house, and everyone is still getting used to it.  

No one else in the Forte/Brooks/van Rhijn house is much interested in the temperance meeting. The person speaking is rather hysterical, painting alcohol as a society-ruining, one-way ticket to eternal damnation. Marian can hardly help but roll her eyes, and Oscar looks like he'd rather be anywhere else. He asks for a decanter of wine brought to his room as soon as the meeting ends, where he's been spending most of his time drinking. He is very depressed, having lost his mother's money and being 0 for two on his attempts to procure a heterosexual engagement. He has no experience working from nothing, nor really working at all. Ada just wants him to figure something out. Their footman Jack Trotter is still toiling on his clock invention, and Marian has picked up a part-time job at the Female Normal and High School. Both have gotten close with Larry Russell across the street, and while the aunts aren't aware that he and Marian are thinking about a life together, Ada knows enough about Larry to think Oscar should befriend him. He's certainly helping Jack, who is now being served coffee at the Russell house like he's not a staff member, level up.  

Peggy is also in the house and, as usual, is dealing with her own, much more serious issue. After commuting from Brooklyn in the snow to take minutes for Ada's suffragette meeting, she has gotten quite sick, staying at the Forte house. They bring her food, and Marian does spend some time with her, filling her in on her burgeoning relationship with Larry. But after a couple of days, Agnes decides that she needs to see her doctor. Ada is skeptical, but Agnes sees a way to assert control over what used to be her house. It blows up in a way that's personally embarrassing, not to mention legitimately dangerous for Peggy when the doctor refuses to treat a Black patient. As silly and fun as The Gilded Age usually is, scenes like these remind us that this time period was silly and fun for few. Though Peggy is accepted and respected in this household, she is not universally welcomed in society, and the stakes for being in a place she is unwelcome are literally life and death.  

Across the street in the Russell house, Bertha is relishing her spot at the top of New York society after winning last season's opera war. Her servants are preparing for the arrival of John Singer Sargent, who recently received scandalous notoriety for painting Madame X. Much of New York may be too timid to have a man such as that depict their daughter, but Bertha recognizes it not only as an opportunity for tastemaking but for attention. She promised Gladys to the Duke Of Buckingham at the end of last season in exchange for his support of her opera, but it was a win-win for Bertha, who would relish nothing more than her family intersecting with the British crown forever. When we met her, she could barely get invited to a charity luncheon—now, she's planting blind items in the press about her daughter's rumored engagement to a duke. In the rules by which she lives, she is so close to winning it all. 

Gladys really would rather marry the nice young Billy, but both of them are naive about how difficult this would be. Gladys knows that advocating for Billy to her father could help, but George is in Arizona. And Billy's family is also naive about how Bertha sees herself. When Billy's mother excitedly tells Mamie Fish and Bertha that she looks forward to celebrating their children together, Bertha is surprised, which she really does not appreciate. Larry tries to advocate on his sister's behalf, which works so poorly that he recommends that Gladys and Billy elope. Gladys and Bertha have it out, and their philosophical differences are irreconcilable. To Bertha, the fact that a duke is willing to marry you is reason enough to marry a duke. Who cares if he's doing it for your money? The royal lineage is something that no market crash nor mining strike can take away. “Happiness as a byproduct of a well-ordered life may last,” she tells Larry. “As a goal, it is invariably doomed to failure.” Bertha is incredibly proud of how she's moved up the ladder of society, and this marriage would cement that. But Gladys wants to marry for love, and that is not something one changes their mind on. As the episode ends, Gladys sneaks out into the night.

Daryl Dixon gets around. Since closing The Book Of Carol, Dixon and his good-time buddy Carol have decided to take a Spanish holiday in the third season of this awkwardly titled Walking Dead spin-off, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride return as the gruesome twosome, Daryl and Carol, and this time they're spending the summer abroad, learning the correct way to pronounce Barcelona between headshots and dismemberments. Season three also welcomes Eduardo Noriega, Óscar Jaenada, Alexandra Masangkay, Candela Saitta, Hugo Arbués, Greta Fernández, Gonzalo Bouza, Hada Nieto, Yassmine Othman, Cuco Usín, and Stephen Merchant to the unending trudge of The Walking Dead.

Released during the season two finale of The Walking Dead: Dead City, the teaser for the new season gives us a taste of Daryl's Western phase.

﻿

Here's the synopsis:

Season three, which filmed in Spain, will follow Daryl (Reedus) and Carol (McBride) as they continue their journey to somehow return home and to the ones they love. As they struggle to find their way back, the path takes them farther astray, leading them through distant lands with ever-changing and unfamiliar conditions as they witness the various effects of the Walker apocalypse.

Hear the classical, finger-picked guitars, see the dusty streets, and wonder if in this reality Shakira is also wanted by the Spanish government for tax fraud when The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season three premieres on September 7.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Johnny Depp rejects ""eternal hatred"" while railing against ""motherfuckers"" talking behind his back","https://www.avclub.com/johnny-depp-interview-amber-heard-bitterness","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 14:44:00 GMT","

Despite the fact that it was a U.K. court that ruled Amber Heard's allegations against Johnny Depp were “substantially true,” it is also a U.K. outlet offering Depp the most in-depth interview he's given since those legal issues began. The Sunday Times‘ Jonathan Dean describes Depp as “excellent company” who speaks in an “eventually coherent ramble,” a conversation which touches on his U.S. trial, his childhood, his marriages, and the people who turned their backs on him amid his personal crisis. “Better go woke!” he hisses about his Hollywood acquaintances who committed to “playing it safe.”

Depp says the reason he wanted to go to trial (and was willing to “semi-eviscerate” himself) was because “Everyone was saying, ‘It'll go away!' But I can't trust that. What will go away? The fiction pawned around the [fucking] globe? No it won't. If I don't try to represent the truth it will be like I've actually committed the acts I am accused of. And my kids will have to live with it. Their kids. Kids that I've met in hospitals. So the night before the trial in Virginia I didn't feel nervous. If you don't have to memorise lines, if you're just speaking the truth? Roll the dice.”

Depp goes on to suggest his troubled relationship with Heard was a reflection of the troubled relationship between his own parents, which he implies was violent. However, he says “it would be dumb for me to carry any bitterness” towards his ex-wife: “Eternal hatred? You want to put curses on someone? No,” he says. (In 2013, Depp texted Paul Bettany saying he wanted to “burn Amber,” adding, “Let's drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she's dead.” He later said these were jokes inspired by Monty Python.) “I know who I am, what that was and, look, it was a learning experience,” Depp goes on to say, insisting he has “no regrets about anything.”

No bitterness, but Depp does still sound upset that his agent of 30 years testified in court that certain productions were reluctant to hire Johnny Depp because of his chronic lateness. Depp doesn't exactly refute his reputation for being “difficult” (his alleged tendency to hold up production on Pirates Of The Caribbean 5 was well-documented), but he does complain about his own stalwart loyalty not being reciprocated. “That's death by confetti, these fake [motherfuckers] who lie to you, celebrate you, say all sorts of horror behind your back, yet keep the money—that confetti machine going—because what do they want? Dough,” he says. 

“I'll tell you what hurts. There are people, and I'm thinking of three, who did me dirty. Those people were at my kids' parties. Throwing them in the air. And, look, I understand people who could not stand up [for me], because the most frightening thing to them was making the right choice. I was pre-MeToo. I was like a crash test dummy for MeToo. It was before Harvey Weinstein,” Depp continues. “And I sponged it, took it all in. And so I wanted from the hundreds of people I've met in that industry to see who was playing it safe.” Given the amount of people who have supported him—the likes of Al Pacino, Winona Ryder, Alice Cooper, Tim Burton, and more— it seems pretty safe to be on Depp's side, even in the wake of allegations that were proven “substantially true” in one court of law.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jennifer Aniston Reveals the Big Change She's Making in Her Life","https://entertainmentnow.com/friends-tv-show/jennifer-aniston-work-life-balance/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:56:44 GMT","

Jennifer Aniston may be one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood. With a career spanning nearly four decades, Aniston boasts a shelf full of awards and iconic roles like “Friends'” Rachel Green and “The Morning Show's” Alex Levy. But even with all that success, slowing down doesn't come easily.

The “Morning Show” star, 56, recently spoke to People about how she's trying to juggle her career with her personal life — and why finding that elusive balance matters now more than ever.

Finding balance hasn't always come easily for Aniston, who's the first to admit she's more comfortable on set than on vacation.

“I'm a bit of a workaholic, so I'm forcing myself to try to take some time to travel and not work,” she revealed.

A post shared by 𝘾𝙖𝙧𝙤𝙡 🇧🇷 (@jenanistonworld)

“It's so critical, I know, but I'm not good at it,” Aniston continued, while launching her new campaign with Smartwater.

After years of staying busy, Aniston knows the value of taking a step back. She admitted that nonstop work can catch up with you, which is why she's now making room for more life outside of the job.

“Our work is diminishing returns at the end of the day, if you're just working so much that you don't have any wonderful life experiences,” she shared.

“I'm trying to take it easy, because this was a really intensive few years of work,” she added.

Aniston also shared that she's still figuring out how to disconnect from work when she needs to. “I'm trying desperately to learn how to create those auto replies when emails and texts come in, where it's like, ‘I'm away forever. But call me in December, I'll be back,' ” she said with a laugh.

As for what her perfect day looks like? Describing her ideal day, Aniston said, “It looks like a blank schedule — there's not one thing on it. That's a perfect day, and then can I figure out what that day looks like as it goes.”

A post shared by Jennifer Aniston (@jenniferaniston)

Aniston also reflected on staying grounded amid life's challenges. “There's a lot that we need to not focus on, because it's so awful and ugly,” she said. “So we need to also remember to focus on the beauty and the positivity that's also existing in our world right now.”

With an Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG Award under her belt, Aniston's career has spanned nearly four decades — but there's still one dream she's hoping to check off her list. 

“I definitely want to do a Broadway play,” Aniston shared. “I absolutely have to do a play on Broadway. That's on my bucket list.”

Even with all she's accomplished, Aniston is still dreaming big — and when the time comes, fans will no doubt be cheering her on when she finally takes that Broadway stage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Courtney Thorne-Smith Starts a New Chapter After Divorce Filing","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/courtney-thorne-smith-divorce-roger-fishman/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 02:15:35 GMT","

Courtney Thorne-Smith, star of the iconic series “Melrose Place” has filed for divorce from Roger Fishman. The pair have been married for 18 years, and according to court documents, have been separated since 2021. 

Thorne-Smith, 57, cited “irreconcilable differences” in her divorce papers and also filed for joint custody of Jacob Emerson, she and Fishman's 17-year-old son. Thorne-Smith's filing also asked the court to exclude the option of spousal support for both Fishman and herself. 

The “Ally McBeal” actor tied the knot with Fishman, an agent, in January of 2007 on New Year's Day in a small ceremony at her home. It was Thorne-Smith's second marriage, as she had previously wed geneticist Andrew Conrad in 2000 and split from him in 2001.

While Courtney Thorne-Smith kept her personal life pretty private, she did publicly date her “Melrose Place” co-star Andrew Shue in the ‘90s. Shue played Billy Parker on the series and Thorne-Smith played his love interest Alison Parker. After the couple's romance ended in real-life, their characters stayed together.

Thorne-Smith invited Shue on her podcast “Still the Place” in 2024 and the former couple talked about their experiences working together after their breakup. According to Thorne-Smith, it was “shockingly not weird” but she did recall a rule she'd put in place after the split. 

“So we'd been broken up for two months and then we had to kiss. You remember me saying, ‘Okay, now we're professionals, no tongue?'” Thorne-Smith asked Shue. The pair also reminisced about becoming great friends after their split, and Shue remarked, “…we helped carry each other through a very intense time.”

A post shared by Daphne Zuniga (@daphnezuniga)

In 2024, Deadline announced that a “Melrose Place” reboot was in the works and original cast members Heather Locklear, Laura Leighton, and Daphne Zuniga were all on board to reprise their roles. 

While Thorne-Smith has not yet confirmed whether she'd return for the series, she hosts “Still the Place,” a “Melrose Place” rewatch podcast with Leighton and Zuniga, so chances are she might be open to revisiting her role as Alison Parker. 

On the podcast, Thorne-Smith and other “Melrose Place” alums have spoken about how some of the show's storylines haven't exactly aged well. “We're looking at ourselves and going, wait, we didn't realize it then, but now it seems so glaring…,” Thorne-Smith told People.

Nearly three years after beloved “American Idol” alum Willie Spence — runner-up to season 19 winner Chayce Beckham — tragically died in a car accident, his family and hometown have made sure his legacy will live on. 

On June 18, 2025, which would have been the late R&B singer's 26th birthday, the mayor of Riviera Beach, Florida, officially proclaimed the date to forevermore be Willie Spence Day at a special ceremony attended by Spence's parents, Sharon and Willie Spence Sr., according to CBS12 News. In tandem with the commemorative day, they announced the official launch of the Willie Spence Champions Foundation. 

A post shared by City of Riviera Beach Florida (@cityofrivierabeach)

On June 18, Spence's parents were on hand at a City Council meeting — dressed in special shirts commemorating their son — as Mayor Douglas Lawson signed the proclamation making June 18 Willie Spence Day. In addition, a special tree planting ceremony was held in Spence's honor at a local park. 

The following day, combined with events celebrating Juneteenth, his parents hosted and attended Juneteenth events in Riviera Beach that specifically celebrated freedom through creativity in their son's honor, WPBF reported, including youth performances and creative workshops. In 2026, they plan to add a 5k to the mix. 

Aftewards, his mom Sharon emotionally told the station, “It was a great day. It was a moving day. It was an inspiring day. Such a wonderful day.” 

“He used to say to me, ‘Mom, I want people to be able to hear my voice all over the world,” Sharon said, tearing up. “All over the world, he said. And I do believe they do hear his voice.”

During Spence's 2021 audition, he told judge Katy Perry his primary goal was, “I just want my voice to reach the world and just share my gift.”

A post shared by StarInTheMaking💥✨🎙🙏🏽 (@williespenceofficial)

Spence died on the afternoon of October 11, 2022, according to NBC News, in Marion County in East Tennessee. The Tennessee Highway Patrol stated that Spence's 2019 Jeep Cherokee “left the roadway” and collided with the back of a tractor trailer that was parked on the shoulder of the interstate. Both he and the driver of the truck were wearing their seatbelts, and the truck driver was not injured. 

A few hours before his tragic death, Spence posted an Instagram video of himself in a car while in Nashville, belting out the worship song “You Are My Hiding Place.” 

In the caption, Spence simply wrote, “Lord you are my hiding place” and added two emojis — a microphone and the eyes-welling-with-tears face.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Halle Bailey Attends Beyonce's Cowboy Carter Tour","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/halle-bailey-cowboy-carter-tour/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 04:09:50 GMT","

Halle Bailey recently attended Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour. 

The singer and actress posted photos of herself enjoying the show in Paris on her X account. 

According to USA Today, Beyoncé held the Paris leg of her Cowboy Carter tour for four days, launching on Juneteenth and ending on June 22. 

Bailey attended the June 21 show, posting a photo of herself in a cowboy hat and sneakers to X, captioned, “Last night in Paris.” 

Tina Knowles, Beyonce's mother, posted a video of herself dancing with Halle on Instagram, writing:

“Me and the beautiful @hallebailey last night in Paris! “Been down, been broke, broke down bounced Back” she survived all she been through, confident, damn you lethal! Life might throw you curves but you can bounce back with a vengeance!! 

Bailey's attendance at the tour is unsurprising considering the young singer and Beyoncé have had a close relationship for years. 

As previously reported by Billboard, Halle's sister, Chlöe, played the younger version of Beyoncé in the movie “The Fighting Temptations.” Twelve years later, the Grammy Award winner came across a video of Chlöe and Halle covering “Pretty Hurts” from her self-titled 2013 album.

Shortly thereafter, she signed the pair to her management company, Parkwood Entertainment. 

Since then, both sisters have had successful solo careers, and Beyoncé even presented them with the Rising Star Award at the 2020 Billboard Women in Music ceremony. 

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)

Halle Bailey is not the only celebrity to support Beyoncé during the Cowboy Carter tour.

On May 10, Megan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, posted photos to Instagram of herself and her husband, Prince Harry, at the Los Angeles leg of the tour. She captioned the post, “About last night… Thank you @beyonce and team for an amazing concert (and a very fun date night!) All love.”

“Mean Girls” actress and singer Renee Rapp attended the show in May as well, posting photos of herself in a VIP suite with the caption, “How can you dare out of your mouth say the diva choreography is not creative how can you dare say that.”

Gabrielle Union, Brie Larson, Ariana Madix and Gayle King have also been previously spotted attending Cowboy Carter shows.

And on June 19, Miley Cyrus joined the “Texas Hold'em” singer onstage in Paris to perform their song, “Most Wanted,” from the Cowboy Carter album.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Best Hallmark Blooper Ever? New Clip Has Fans in Stitches After Actor ‘Let One Rip'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/best-blooper-fart-video-hallmark-channel/","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 15:33:27 GMT","

With an archive of more than a thousand original movies produced over the last 15 years, Hallmark Channel and its stars have shared plenty of cute and funny bloopers with fans. But the outtake that Ashley Williams posted on June 22, 2025, in honor of Paul Campbell's birthday may very well take the cake as the best Hallmark blooper ever.

Williams waited over a year to share what happened as they filmed the final scene of “Falling Together” in the spring of 2024. During what was meant to be a sweet, romantic moment, Williams wrote in the caption, “a background actor… let one rip RIGHT by where Paul and I were about to kiss.” 

“It's the blooperiest of bloopers and it makes me cry laughing to this day,” she wrote, and then made matters even funnier with a smattering of puns, joking, “Paul, you are the wind beneath my wings. The air in my tires. You blow me away. Happy birthday, partner.”

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

Williams added narrative text over the video to ensure fans could tell exactly when the flatulence in question occurred. In a scene designed to look like one of the Alzheimer's Association's annual fundraising walks, Campbell could be heard delivering his line to Williams. 

Over the video, she pointed out in text, “Here's the fart. You really gotta listen…We both CLEARLY hear it. But the camera is still rolling so we can't react.”

Trying to stifle their laughter, Williams says through gritted teeth, “We have to kiss.” After smooching, she whispers and wheezily giggles, “Did you hear that?” and Campbell kisses her again just to disguise their laughter. 

As the camera pans out, she writes over the video, “We cut. I collapse on Paul.” 

Many fans said they were in tears over the blooper video, flooding Williams' post with comments, including one who wrote, “I'm crying from laughter watching this! 🤣” and another who called it “the best thing ever 😂”

One fan commented, “I laughed so hard and laughed even harder hearing you laugh 😂”

Someone else admitted, “you are a hoot Ashley Williams, you made me laugh so hard, I about peed myself 😂😂😂😂”

“I have no idea how you kept your composure so well,” someone else wrote. “I died laughing immediatly!!! 😂🤣”

A post shared by Erin Krakow (@erinkrakow)

Williams has every right to toot her own horn about the hilarious blooper from “Falling Together,” which premiered on Hallmark Channel in September. But believe it or not, it's not the only gas-induced outtake in the Hallmark archives. In 2023, a gassy horse named Noodles caused a bit of a stir during the filming of “When Calls The Heart” season 10. 

Plenty of other mishaps have been responsible for laugh-out-loud bloopers on the sets of Hallmark movies and series over the years, with stars getting tongue-tied or tripped up over what's happening on-set. 

One classic, seen above, is from the 2021 Tyler Hynes and Erin Krakow rom-com “It Was Always You,” in which he timed his invitation to dance just-right each time she took a swig of champagne, causing her to bust out laughing. 

In early June, Hallmark provided a montage of funny outtakes to “Entertainment Tonight” of Williams and Alison Sweeney filming their “To Barcelona” movies, including shots of Williams spilling Italian food on herself. 

In 2021, Williams (are you noticing a theme here?) was featured in another adorable blooper reel with her sister, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, to promote their “Sister Swap” movies.

Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona are continuing their respective indie reigns: After Arjona stole scenes in “Blink Twice” (and now appears in “Andor”), and just as Johnson is helping make box office history at A24 with “Materialists,” both actresses are adding in yet another critically acclaimed hit to their summer resume with “Splitsville.” 

The comedy was first announced in 2024 and recently premiered at Cannes 2025. Michael Angelo Covino directs and co-writes with his “The Climb” collaborator Kyle Marvin; the duo also star alongside Johnson and Arjona as their respective spouses in “Splitsville.” 

 










Yet it's the buzzy synopsis, and not just the casting, that will turn heads: Ashley (Arjona) wants a divorce from her husband Carey (Marvin), who seeks marital advice from his friends Julie (Johnson) and Paul (Covino). Yet after Carey discovers the secret to his friends' happy marriage is being open, Carey takes it a little too far, throwing all of their relationships into chaos.

Nicholas Braun, David Castaneda, and O-T Fagbenle also star. Johnson, Covino, and Marvin produce along with Emily Korteweg, Ryan Heller, Jeff Deutchman, Ro Donnelley, and Samantha Racanelli. 

The IndieWire review out of Cannes praised Marvin and Covino's script for being “consistently funny,” while cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra “stages the action with a propulsivity and creativity that makes the domestic problems feel cinematically alive.” 

The review further reads, “‘Splitsville' probably won't greatly advance the conversation around open relationships and their viability, but we're not sure that's the intention. Still, the filmmakers have created an utterly endearing tale of four people trying to negotiate their own desires in the silliest ways possible with unexpected chaos around every turn.” 

“Splitsville” was far from the only critically acclaimed film that Neon had at Cannes: Prior to the distributor garnering its sixth consecutive Palme d'Or with Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” Neon nabbed “The Secret Agent.” It also had “Alpha,” “Orwell: 2+2=5,” “Sentimental Value,” and “Splitsville” going into the festival. Neon will soon release “Fjord” and “Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo” too, both of which were at the Cannes market.

Neon is releasing “Splitsville” August 22 in theaters. Check out the trailer below.

Like anyone who's played their way through the last 30 years (or more) of Hideo Kojima's work, I've come to expect a certain degree of eccentricity from AAA gaming's most distinctive auteur. Be that as it may, Kojima's fetishistic cinephilia made “Death Stranding” — its cast partially composed of famous directors whose photorealistic likenesses are embodied by actors via performance capture — a uniquely strange experience for movie people like me. 

Heartman, a scientist who dies every 21 minutes (only to get shocked back to life by the battery pack on his chest shortly thereafter), is modeled after Nicolas Winding Refn. Deadman, a researcher whose body has been Frankensteined together from borrowed parts, is naturally made to resemble Guillermo del Toro. A character known as “The Film Director,” seen only in hologram, is a perfect scan of Jordan Vogt-Roberts, whose long-gestating “Metal Gear Solid” adaptation will probably never be seen at all. (Casting the “Death Stranding” movie that Michael Sarnoski is making for A24 will either be very easy, or very, very hard.)

It would be an understatement to say that Kojima has doubled down on that particular strangeness in his latest sequel. The “Naked Raiden” sequence from “Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty” might still be unbeatable for sheer conceptual surreality, but nothing in that game took me out quite like the early bit in “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” when the living puppet the protagonist now carries around on his waist — a perfect representation of “In the Fade” director Fatih Akin — helpfully suggests that you throw him up in the air so that he can relay the exact location of some nearby smugglers. What's next, a “Moby Dick”-inspired flashback that swaps out Captain Ahab for “Fury Road” mastermind George Miller? Of course it is. 

 










Moments like these happen every 20 minutes or so throughout this roughly 45-hour adventure (the cast of which swells to include an entire festival's worth of recognizable filmmakers, to say nothing of the beautiful performances by world-class actors like Norman Reedus, Luca Marinelli, and especially Léa Seydoux), and while the uncanniness of watching Refn get resurrected in the middle of a conversation never quite fades away, the distraction only makes it all the more impressive that Kojima is able to craft his characters into people all their own. 

And it's crucial that he can, because the power of “On the Beach” — which builds on the foundation of its predecessor to create one of the most evocative and involving console games I've ever played — depends on your affection for its motley crew of weirdos. And, for that matter, on their affection for each other. 

Where the first “Death Stranding,” a post-apocalyptic epic set in the aftermath of a cataclysmic event that saw the world of the dead bleed into the world of the living, was a story about the absence of human connection, this sequel is equally focused on the hardships of navigating it. And where the previous game's focus on isolation anticipated the COVID pandemic that arrived just a few months after its release (survivors have burrowed themselves inside underground bunkers, leaving the protagonist to fetch them packages as he moves west across the United Cities of America while bringing them all together on the same network), the Australia-set “On the Beach” points forward to a present in which the world is at risk of being undone by the same tools that promised to bring it together. 

 










As is his wont, Kojima asks a simple question in a compelling and hilariously strange fashion: “Should we have connected?” And while I can only pray that the second “Death Stranding” isn't quite as prescient as the first one, there's something all too close about its story of staring extinction in the face and searching for reasons to postpone it. Kojima's sequel may lack the “WTF is a ‘Strand' game?” novelty of the original, but it one-ups the “Death Stranding” experience on every conceivable level while delivering another uncannily timed quest about grieving the end of one world while standing at the precipice of a new one. 

If “On the Beach” does more to refine its franchise than it does to evolve it, that lack of surprise doesn't do anything to diminish the relevance of the Kōbō Abe quote that pops up along the way: “To live is to imagine ourselves in the future, and there we inevitably arrive. Yet our place in said future may not be the one we envision.” At heart, this is a fantasy about the hard work — and the teamwork — of rescuing Tomorrow from the clutches of today, and I can think of no higher praise for a batshit game I beat the same night that America fumbled its way towards World War III that its hyper-convoluted message of hope and togetherness made a lot of sense to me. 

 










If you haven't played the first “Death Stranding,” there's very little chance that it will make any sense to you, and the 17-slide recap that players can access from the main menu of “On the Beach” isn't going to make up the difference. But just to offer some context for the curious: You once play as Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus), the same immortal courier who linked America together with the help of an unborn fetus who allowed him to sense the presence of the dead (and that's arguably the most normal detail of the first game). After extending the Chiral Network across the UCA and facilitating the potential extinction of all humanity in the process, Sam illegally freed his baby friend from its artificial womb and snuck across the Mexican border in search of a place where he might raise the girl in peace. 

Alas, “On the Beach” is only a few hours old before something happens to little Lou. On the one hand, I'm obviously trying to be coy about the details of a story that's best experienced as you play through it. On the other hand, I say “something” because — until near the very end of the game — exactly what happens to Sam's one-year-old toddler is extremely unclear and seldom discussed. All I can tell you is that bad guys show up, our old pal Fragile (Seydoux) isn't able to fight them off, and Lou suddenly reverts back into the “Bridge Baby” that Sam equips on his latest mission. 

 










You see, a warp-like “Plate Gate” has opened between Mexico and Australia, and Sam has been hired by a private company — not the UCA government — to bring the Aussies onto the Chiral Network in the hope that doing so might open up more portals in the ocean of interdimensional tar that has formed between continents. And so, with the help of a rapidly expanding crew that soon grows to include Tarman, Deadman, Heartman, Dollman, Fragile, the President of the Automated Public Assistance Company, a robotic mannequin named Charlie, and a mysterious blonde girl called Tomorrow (Elle Fanning, who emerges from the tar in a chrysalis of silent trauma), Sam heads down under and begins working his way clockwise around the country. 

The circularity of the game's macro design allows for a more organic and palpably interconnected open world than the UCA offered in the original. Not only does that shape allow for a constant sense of accomplishment as you bring Australia back online (in addition to one of the most rewarding moments I've ever had playing a video game, when a climbing rope I'd casually planted at the end of the prologue helped save me from a climactic death slog more than 40 hours allow), but it also reinforces the circular nature of Kojima's storytelling, which this franchise brings to the fore with its focus on the cyclicality of life, death, and extinction. I couldn't spoil certain revelations if I tried, but it's safe to say that “On the Beach” mines a rare beauty from history's penchant for repeating itself — it's no accident that near-silent bad guy Neil Vana (Marinelli) is a dead ringer for Solid Snake, or that the boss fights against his team of ghost soldiers are largely identical to the first game's battles with tortured father figure Clifford Unger (Mads Mikkelsen). 

 










Every hard-won inch of progress in “On the Beach” is haunted by a loss of equal measure, which emphasizes — in a more literal way than most other games possibly could — the extent to which the player's journey is also their ultimate destination (the story's delicate whimper of a non-ending similarly lends itself to that feeling, albeit in less satisfying fashion). To that point, anyone who played “Death Stranding” should know to expect a whole lot of journeying. 

Trekking around the whole of Australia is significantly more fun than it was to walk across the UCA due to quality-of-life issues, delightful new innovations (including a monorail that I was obsessed with rebuilding, and a sleek black coffin you can ride like a rocket-powered surfboard), and a geographically diverse game world that is somehow even more immersive than that of the original. The improved combat system is still a sore point, if only because its elaborate arsenal and frequent invitations toward stealth are wasted on a game where charging at enemies with a shotgun works great 99% of the time, but navigating the map — and rebuilding its infrastructure — is more addictive than ever, and dominates the majority of the player's time. 

I can't tell you how many hours of sleep I lost in order to deliver “just one more package,” the unique thrill of which is deepened by two specific factors above all others. The first is the feeling that you're actually working to create a new world, a feeling again reinforced by the fact that other players can use every road, bridge, and tool you create (and vice versa). I got a little rush of dopamine every time the game informed me that another person had benefited from something I'd done, which is a remarkable sensation for a piece of entertainment to impart at a time of such egocentric selfishness, and a reward that deepens Sam's more transactional relationship with the various survivors he meets along the way (who give him new tools in exchange for the packages he delivers to them). Eventually, I found an equal joy in pouring my precious resources into mines and monorail tracks that I wasn't able to complete myself — I would happily schlep resins and “special alloys” halfway up a mountain just for the satisfaction of making life easier for someone I'd never get to meet. 

 










Which brings me to the second factor that makes the new “Death Stranding” so hard to put down: Its nagging sense of precarity. “On the Beach” is not a hard game in the traditional sense (Sam is literally immortal, and most of the boss fights are a cinch), but it's an extremely arduous one, and the player is never more than a stumble away from losing and/or destroying cargo they may never get back. While the relief of delivering packages intact is palpable enough during the journey's frictionless early stretches, it blooms into a diabolical kind of paranoia whenever Sam is stripped of his shortcuts and forced to hoof 250 kilograms of crap across an enormous mountain in whiteout conditions. To a significantly more satisfying degree than in the previous chapter, “On the Beach” subverts the typical stakes of a video game; “dying” is irrelevant, but what you're living for is always top of mind.

That inescapable sense of responsibility, along with the endorphin rush of forging relationships with strangers, allows for a singularly beautiful harmony between form and content, which is rare for a medium in which even the most heroic characters are often required to murder thousands of people (Sam only uses non-lethal ammo, as killing someone would risk a catastrophic “Voidout”). The same could be said of the original “Death Stranding,” which likewise illustrated that a “stick” could prod people into action while a “rope” could be fashioned into a noose. “On the Beach” strikes a more effective chord for its focus on the hard work of making connections in a world where people have the technology to be perfectly isolated. 

 










Without putting too fine a point on things (a rather uncharacteristic show of restraint), Kojima envisions a ruined future where colonization-minded corporations are more powerful than governments, AI is serving its own ends, and humanity's determination to forestall its own doom is imperilling the basic purpose and possibility of its survival. Like many of Kojima's stories, “On the Beach” vamps and vamps until it buries players under an avalanche of exposition during its final chapters, but the hours you spend becoming endeared to its characters — an eternally pregnant woman whose womb is frozen in time, an OBGYN who can phase her hands through matter, and, of course, a porter who's grieving the loss of the only tomorrow he ever believed in — lend backbreaking weight to Kojima's poptimistic belief that humanity has the potential to emerge stronger from its latest brush with extinction. 

So does the time you spend trudging around this spectacular game world, every detail of which betrays the human touch of its design. I awed at the raw spectacle of Kojima's Australia on a regular basis, but found myself even more impressed by the ambient beauty that he and his collaborators have suffused into every moment. Fellow porters huffing their way up a hillside; the stars twinkling above the desert sand; the layered waves of Caroline Polachek's staggeringly beautiful title song cresting over the horizon at just the right moment. (The unparalleled soundscape might be the game's most purely cinematic virtue, even more so than its cast of auteurs and fantastically well-staged cut-scenes.) Some might continue to scoff at a franchise that asks you to play as an Amazon deliveryman, but I found greater — and richer — satisfaction in this glorified walking simulator than I have in just about any other open-world video game I've ever played. 

 










“On the Beach” might argue that we can never truly escape extinction, but it makes an even more compelling case that we endure through the bridges we create between the past and the future. Tomorrow, this story insists, is never exactly what you imagined it to be. And by the time players reach the insane final battle of Kojima's latest plea, the weirdest thing about this mega-bizarre masterpiece is how convincingly it finds a silver lining in the prospect of our self-annihilation. 

“Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” will be released for the PlayStation 5 on Thursday, June 26.

Ezra Miller says their return to Hollywood has been “tough” after the numerous allegations against them. Miller, who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, was accused of abusing two children — one who was 12 at the time the alleged abuse started, and another who was 12 at the time allegations were made. However, no criminal charges were filed against Miller.

Miller issued an apology statement in 2022 and announced they were seeking mental health treatment. After a harassment order filed by one of the children's parents was lifted in 2023, Miller shared they are doing their “best” to “preserve their own wellness” while working to “reverse the collateral damage” of the accusations, claiming they had been “unjustly and directly targeted.”

Miller most recently led “The Flash,” released in 2023 by Warner Bros. Discovery, with Miller appearing at the film‘s premiere.

After breaking out at Cannes with films like “Afterschool” and “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” Miller returned to the festival in 2025 to attend the premiere of collaborator Lynne Ramsay‘s “Die My Love.” Miller told Lo Speciale Giornale (in the video below) while at Filming Italy Sardegna that being at Cannes was a “tough re-entry point” into Hollywood.

 










“Not that I don't hold a lot of remorse and lamentation for a lot of things I did and a lot of things that happened in that time, but I'm really, really grateful for the lessons that came with that abyss,” Miller said, adding that they “didn't necessarily want to go to Cannes” and “had a bit of a hard time” being there. “I came to Cannes to support one of my closest friends in the world, who is Lynne Ramsay — who I think is one of the greatest living filmmakers. […] If you've been in the woods for three years, I do not recommend going straight to Cannes. But yeah, I did that for Lynne. I would do anything for Lynne.” 

Miller and their “We Need to Talk About Kevin” director Ramsay are set to reunite for a vampire movie, with Miller co-writing. “I'm working with her again, that will likely be the first thing I do, is a film that her and I are writing together,” Miller said. “I've been writing a lot, because you can do that in solitude, which has been friendly to me.”

They added, “I came to Cannes because she asked me to come, and if there's anything I really still believe in in my life, it's devotion to one's people, one's loved ones, above all else.”

Ramsay previously announced the yet-untitled vampire project in a recent interview with The Los Angeles Times. “I'm making a vampire movie,” Ramsay said. “It's with Ezra Miller who was in ‘Kevin.' He's the main character. That's in development.”

 










Ramsay teased that in total, she has “three scripts” in the works, all at different stages.

Hot on the heels of a series of pushes to increase film and television production in Los Angeles, the California Film Commission has announced 48 new productions that will film in the state thanks of its tax credit program — among them 43 independent features and projects from the likes of Ang Lee and Issa Rae. The announcement was the ninth such of the 2024-25 fiscal year.

“California didn't earn its role as the heart of the entertainment world by accident — it was built over generations by skilled workers and creative talent pushing boundaries,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “Today's awards help ensure this legacy continues, keeping cameras rolling here at home, supporting thousands of crew members behind the scenes and boosting local economies that depend on a strong film and television industry.”

The commission said that the projects will collectively generate $664 million in economic activity for the Golden State and employ roughly 6,500 workers, as well as 32,000 background performers. Those cast and crew members will take home a collective $302 million in wages. These films and television series fall under the current version of the tax credit program, which is capped at $330 million annually. Industry professionals are currently awaiting final word on whether or not the state's next budget will include the full proposed expansion to the program, which more than doubles that cap to $750 million.
 










Los Angeles County will benefit most from the awards, with over half of the productions to be shot in the area, which the commission says will help “sustain the birthplace of the iconic industry” and support “the community as it recovers from recent wildfires.” Also included in the tax credits are productions that will utilize the Bay Area (“High Priestess of Souls”), Bakersfield (“Counting by 7s”), El Dorado (“Gold Mountain”), Ventura County (“Things We Cannot Touch”), San Bernardino (“Superbloom”), and Half Moon Bay (“Sponsor”), among other locations.

“This industry is core to California's creative economy and keeping production here at home is more important than ever,” commission director Colleen Bell said. “This round of tax credits shows our commitment to supporting both indie and studio productions while spreading the economic benefits of filming across the state.”

Among the major studio projects was producer Issa Rae's “One of Them Days” sequel, which is anticipated to spend around $39 million in qualified expenditures. TriStar Pictures president Nicole Brown said that “Los Angeles was an essential backdrop” to this year's hit “One of Them Days,” which starred SZA and Keke Palmer.

“We are thrilled that Dreux and Alyssa will embark on another authentic escapade through the city's streets in the sequel through the support of California's Film and Television Tax Credit,” Brown said.

 










The next application window for film productions looking to qualify will be July 7-9 and for television productions August 25-27. For information, visit the California Film Commission website.

[Editor's Note: This article contains spoilers for “Elio“].

Pixar's “Elio” is the latest reminder of how hard it is for original animation to succeed theatrically, especially with the kind of personal stories being made under Pete Docter's leadership. The storytelling struggle was so difficult, in fact, that it prompted a course correction. First-time director Adrian Molina (“Coco”) departed his alien abduction comedy-adventure to rejoin Lee Unkrich on “Coco 2” as co-director once again. But he tapped “Coco” story artist Madeline Sharafian to succeed him, trusting her to complete his pet project.

 










Molina was in good hands: Sharafian deeply connected with “Elio's” theme of loneliness and the search for belonging, and contributed some wonderful early concept drawings. She even stuck up for Molina during meetings with the Brain Trust when there was pushback.

“I remember being in some of those later meetings with Adrian fighting for some of the scenes in the movie,” Sharafian told IndieWire. “One was that early scene where Elio watched the Golden Record Voyager leave Earth, and there were some voices in the room that didn't think it was necessary. I could see Adrian's face sort of stricken, and I was like, ‘No, you have to ease the audience into the movie. This is thematically relevant, it's about Elio connecting with that [NASA] satellite in space.'”

 










Sharafian was soon joined by “Turning Red” director Domee Shi (they bonded during her stint as story artist on the movie). Spurred on by “WALL-E” director Andrew Stanton's rallying cry to “make me care,” they resolved to strengthen Elio's (Yonas Kibreab) motivation to escape his lonely existence on an Air Force base and find a new home with aliens who appreciate him. This meant turning his traditional alien abduction into a weird obsession.

“With Adrian, he had grown up as an artsy kid,” recalled producer Mary Alice Drumm (associate producer on “Coco”). “His dad was a military dentist, and he would talk about being this kid that didn't fit in and feeling lonely. And I think Maddie and Domi both have that similar story and overlap a lot. They're like a Venn Diagram of taste. And so I think the more we can ground ourselves in a personal connection with the character, the more it resonates,” Drumm said. “And then, honestly, with loneliness, the more we started talking to the crew about it, they really grabbed onto that idea. It really galvanized us. It became our North Star… a weird boy who learns to connect with aliens in outer space. That's what we were tracking.”

The first important change was to raise the emotional stakes by making Elio an orphan with the death of his parents, turning his mom, Olga, into his stressed-out aunt (Oscar winner Zoe Saldaña, who replaced America Ferrera when she was no longer available).

 










“So that was heavy, but it was really necessary because it makes him feel truly alone at the beginning of the movie,” Sharafian said. “And we understand immediately why space is this escape for him, like this beacon of hope for this lonely boy. It's the answer to all of his problems in that moment. And it was the right choice to not show the moment when he loses his parents, but the moment when he falls in love with space in the exhibit, as he's lying down and listening to Kate Mulgrew's voice wash over him and he's connecting with Voyager.”

This enabled Sharafian, who specializes in insightful character intros, to create the funny and quirky montage of Elio pleading to get abducted, underscored by “Once in a Lifetime” by the Talking Heads. “It just lets the audience be on board with his wackiness and his insane mission to be abducted,” added Shi. “Like when he puts on the colander, and he's listening to radio signals, and he's ignoring other kids, and he's fighting with his aunt. You know him more, you understand him more, and you're a little bit more forgiving of his wackiness.”

This completely subverts the abduction scene, with Elio excitedly beaming up to the heavenly Communiverse interplanetary space station, instead of being afraid in the first teaser trailer (“No thanks”). This makes it even more of a blast for Elio pretending to be Earth's leader.

 










“We were leaning into our love of sci-fi and horror, and it felt like a fun opportunity as well,” Shi continued. “Pixar movies make you laugh or they make you cry, but I feel like movies can make you thrilled or on the edge of your seat, or gasping, surprised, and I love getting those reactions out of audiences, too.”

One of the highlights is an “Alien” parody with the introduction of worm-like Glordon (Remy Edgerly), who appears scary at first but is just a lost and lonely kid like Elio. In fact, it was more effective having Elio bond with Glordon than with Glordon's militaristic dad, Lord Grigon (Brad Garrett), as he did in the earlier version. Now, Grigon becomes an aggressive obstacle to Elio from the very beginning. He wears an armored shell that protects him emotionally as well as physically, and his distant relationship with Glordon mirrors Olga's with Elio. The tender reconciliation between father and son was the result of a late rewrite by screenwriter Julia Cho.

There is also some fun horror subversion with Elio's ever-pleasing clone, who replaces him on Earth. The scares turn funny during key plot points. This has the added effect of developing Olga's arc to bring her closer to Elio. Olga immediately realizes this perfect Elio is a fake, and longs to be with her imperfect nephew. She gets her wish during a heartfelt reunion on the beach, which concludes with the removal of Elio's eye patch: the result of a fight with bully Caleb (Jake Getman).

 










“It was always part of his design because I think it was something that made him feel insecure and othered on earth,” Sharafian said. “But when he's in space, all of a sudden, this eye patch and the [green] cape make him look dashing like a space pirate, like a hero. It just helps add to the feeling for him that space is where he should be, and everything kind of works for him there.”

“But the payoff was new, she continued. “There were multiple spots where we thought, maybe they can take the eye patch off here, maybe there. We had it more as a joke. But what we realized was this moment of reuniting needed to be reworked because it wasn't emotional enough. And then we realized what it really was about was these two characters who didn't even know how to look at each other in Act 1. And having Olga peel off that eye patch, and finally, they're seeing each other for the first time, and she realizes she knows him, and he finally feels wanted. It was such a delightful payoff.”

Look at Oscar-winner Sean Baker's Letterboxd account, and the first thing you'll notice is how much he watches. The director behind “The Florida Project” and “Anora” logs an impressive array of films almost every day on the platform, ranging from current releases to obscure curios from the '70s and '80s. He has four favorites listed on his page — “The Idiots,” “Nights of Cabiria,” “Oasis,” and “Miami Connection” — but one wonders what else of the many, many films he watches most informs and represents the great director's taste.

IndieWire can exclusively unveil a list of some of Baker's favorite films, which the director curated in collaboration with Pluto TV. The list includes films released between 1960 and 1998, and ranges from a Best Picture-winning romantic comedy classic (“The Apartment”), grimy horror favorites (“Friday the 13th Part IV: The Last Chapter”), and tiny, provocative indies (“Buffalo '66”). It's far from a list of all his favorite films, but it's a starting point for some of his favorites — a pretty great launchpad for discovery.

Looking at the list, it's clear how some of the films here might have inspired Baker's work directing scrappy, humanistic independent movies. It's not a surprise, for example, that a director so interested in portraying the marginalized and working class onscreen would gravitate to a film like Ken Loach's coming-of-age tragedy “Kes,” a sensitive portrait of a neglected boy who finds an outlet through training a falcon. Other films are a bit more surprising deep cuts, like the 1983 juvenile detention center drama “Bad Boys,” or the 1986 action thriller “Runaway Train.”

Pluto TV will air a marathon of all 10 of Baker's picks on Tuesday, June 24, on their Spotlight Channel. The marathon comes during the free streamer's “Summer of Cinema” promotional campaign, and is part of Baker's partnership with the streamer's “Free Movie Weekend” initiative, which works to promote independent movie theaters from across the country by offering complimentary movie tickets on select weekends throughout June and July. The marathon will begin on 8 a.m. ET and run through 2 a.m. ET on Wednesday, June 25. Immediately afterwards, Baker's film “Red Rocket” will screen on the Spotlight Channel.  

Read on for 10 of Sean Baker's favorite films, listed in chronological order and with commentary from the director himself. 

“‘The Apartment' is a brilliantly layered exploration of loneliness and ambition,” Baker said, “where Billy Wilder's perfect balance of humor and heartbreak crafts a world that feels both timeless and painfully relatable.”

Baker: “‘Kes' is an unflinching portrait of youth, class, and escape, where Ken Loach's raw realism gives the film a heartbreaking authenticity, capturing the quiet rebellion of a boy's struggle to find freedom in a world that never lets him go.”

“‘The Harder They Come' is a raw, electrifying anthem of rebellion, where the gritty energy of reggae and the unrelenting spirit of its characters ignite a cinematic fire that still feels revolutionary and undeniably alive.” 

“‘The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' is a gritty, heart-pounding thriller that expertly captures the pulse of New York in the '70s, blending sharp dialogue with a tension that never lets up, making every moment feel like a breathless race against time. Also one of the most beautifully shot films of the 70's, in my opinion.”

“Sean Penn's performance in ‘Bad Boys' is a raw, unapologetic tour de force — he brings a depth to his character that's as disturbing as it is compelling, capturing the raw pain of youthful rebellion.”

“‘Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter' is about as bat shit crazy as the slasher genre got. The sex and violence is gratuitous, just as it should be. I was 13 when I saw this in the theater and loved every moment of it.”

“A raw, unrelenting tale of escape and survival, where the harsh, unforgiving Alaskan landscape mirrors the characters' inner turmoil — bringing together a pulse-pounding energy with a gritty realism that makes every second feel like it's teetering on the edge of chaos.”

“‘River's Edge' is a haunting snapshot of disaffected youth, where the film's stark, almost nihilistic realism pulls no punches in exploring the cold, chaotic disconnect between young people and the world around them. And it's Keanu Reeves' best performance, in my opinion.”

“‘King of New York' masters the art of stylized grit, blending slick visuals with an unrelenting atmosphere that pulls you into the dangerous pulse of the city, where every corner hides a raw, desperate story.” 

“The craftsmanship on display — especially the way Gallo uses color, framing, and offbeat humor — feels daring and meticulously thought-out. This film has aged like fine wine.”

James Holden discovered trance states as a child, hammering out repetitive chords for hours on the piano. For Wacław Zimpel, Polish folk music and American blues offered early glimpses of higher states of consciousness. Since those introductory ear- and mind-openers, the search for musical transcendence has guided both artists in their respective journeys. Holden began his career as a teenager playing capital-T trance music—gated chord stabs, energy-stoking snare rolls, backmasked cymbals, the whole kit and caboodle—before drifting into increasingly woolier strains of ambient techno and electronic improv, including latter-day krautrock, homages to Terry Riley, and pan-global folk music that calls to mind benevolent UFOs hovering above Stonehenge. Zimpel, a clarinetist by training, has moved through free jazz, Indian Carnatic music, and even a 2020 collaboration with Shackleton, the dubstep convert turned arpeggiator shaman. What the two men's work shares is an attentiveness to the minutiae of change, and a propensity for sequences that churn like thunderheads on the prowl.

Holden and Zimpel first linked up in 2018, recording together in the British musician's London studio on a handful of dates—connected by a string of gigs featuring the clarinetist as a member of Holden's touring ensemble, the Animal Spirits. The collaboration yielded the appropriately named Long Weekend EP, four tracks of rippling pulses and drones built up in live overdubs of reeds and modular synthesizer, one song per day. They return now with The Universe Will Take Care of You, a six-track, 51-minute album that feels bigger and more consequential in every way, folding more ideas, intensities, moods, and dimensions into its freeform sprawl.

Each of the six tracks is tagged with the date of its creation, a neat bit of marginalia that gives us some idea of how the sessions unrolled. The album begins on July 19, 2022, their third consecutive day of recording, at which point they were well and truly cooking. After a brief, breath-catching introduction that faintly recalls the vocoded lead-in to Laurie Anderson's “O Superman”—and given the title, “You Are Gods,” the reference may not be entirely coincidental—they explode into action, unleashing volley after volley of rapid-fire arpeggios that move far too fast for mere mortals to parse. (Thirty-second notes? Sixth-fourth notes? Your guess is as good as mine.) Burbling and twisting, branching and recombining, they change color as they go, arpeggios erupting out of arpeggios, like jets of water in an illuminated fountain. Holden is credited with “arpeggio clouds,” Zimpel with alto clarinet, organ, and “grains,” but which sounds belong to whom is anyone's guess—the thrill of the thing is in its overwhelming totality. Occasionally, an accidental melody asserts itself in a sequence of notes that somehow, by some miracle of filtering and timbre, breaks through the blur, but it'd be impossible to track every voice, much less every note; it's enough to let it all wash over you, a jacuzzi for the mind.

The album shifts gears on track two, “Sunbeam Path,” recorded some six weeks later, on their penultimate day of sessions. Tinged with tremolo, Zimpel's lap steel sets a luminous, liquid scene that brings to mind a particularly honeyed strain of krautrock, bent notes and erratic tape playback lending complexity to the Neu!-inspired drones. Horn-like squiggles add movement and tonal interest; the semblance of a beat eventually reveals itself inside a lattice of shakers and bells, then dissolves, returning the song to its broad, featureless ambient horizons.

The rest of the album shuttles between these two poles. “Sparkles, Crystals, Miracles” (give them credit for committing to the bit) is another wide-eyed sun salutation, kalimba-like harp plucks and strummed violin ducking through whooshing side-chain compression; the animating opposition here is that between the identifiable and the blurred, bringing to mind the tension between suggestive detail and gestural smear in some of Gerhard Richter's paintings. “Incredible Bliss,” from their first day in the studio, is an ecstatic fugue for double-piped alghoza flute and 16th-note synth chords, probably the closest thing on the album to Holden's previous work; what dazzles here is the dance between flute and synth, the way each one uses repetition to trick the other into moving forward, egging each other on as they bob rapturously in place. “Time Ring Rattles” is the album's most thrilling track, a jumble of percussive phrases that clatters like a rock tumbler gone haywire, spilling brightly colored baubles as it spins. In a coincidence that reveals the depth of their shared interests, both musicians have performed with Moroccan Gnawa ensembles, and in “Time Ring Rattles” you can hear them searching for ways to unlock some of the polyrhythmic mysteries they've absorbed in their respective travels.

The credits suggest how playful the sessions must have been: Alongside the expected instruments and sounds (bells, electric piano, alto clarinet, Prophet synth) are instruments and techniques like walnuts, “blue noise,” “bucket brigades,” teacup. For all their complexity, these tunes are never difficult; they move with fluid grace and joy, buoyed by the revelatory power of mutual surprise. Nowhere is that more evident than in the 10-minute title track, which closes the album. A halting reed loop (or, at the credits would have it, “eternal pitch-gate loops of alto clarinet”) squeaks like a screen door over a thrumming synthesizer pulse. More phrases join in—bells, breaths, rustling noises, so many brightly colored ribbons of tone that the stereo field soon resembles prayer flags fluttering in the wind, patterns upon patterns upon patterns. Zimpel has called trance “the state of mind in which time bends”; one of the ways to achieve that state, he says, is via repetition. “After many repetitions I stop thinking… and I become equally listener and player. Eventually I have the feeling that I am disappearing.” That's exactly what happens to me here: Try as I might, I find it impossible to follow the music's changes with my conscious mind, but I am borne along anyway, weightlessly.

New Orleans rapper and bounce queen Big Freedia has announced her first gospel album. Pressing Onward, which takes its name from the Pressing Onward Baptist Church, in New Orleans, is out August 8. The follow-up to 2023's Central City is Big Freedia's third career studio album. Check out the stained glass–themed cover art and full tracklist for the LP below.

“I've been waiting my whole career to make this album,” Big Freedia said in a statement. “The church always spoke to me: the drama, the choir, and the attire. We are in uncertain times. I'm hoping fans can get some faith and hope from this album.”

Big Freedia wrote Pressing Onward as a way to reflect on her lifelong connection to gospel music after joining her church choir at age 10. Further deepening its themes of love, hope, and acceptance is her choice to dedicate the album to Devon Hurst, her partner who died this past May. She spoke about Hurst in a new interview with Billboard, telling Joe Lynch, “This album started as a message of healing for the world—but now, it's me who's holding on to the music for strength.”

The 14-track Pressing Onward includes the recent singles “Take My Hand,” “Sunday Best” (featuring Tamar Braxton), and “Church.”

One of the funniest, flyest, and greatest rap albums ever is 1988's The Great Adventures of Slick Rick. With his swanky flow and ability to inhabit multiple characters on the same song, Slick Rick told madcap stories of all that can go wrong—crooked cops, dope fiends, boring jobs—when you're just a young dude in New York tryna' hangout, get a lil' bread, get laid, and fall in love. His storytelling was real as hell (is there anything more relatable than when he shoots his shot with Mona Lisa by buying her a slice of pizza?) and straight out of a fantastical comic strip at the same time. But like many of the hip-hop pioneers of the 1980s, he isn't endlessly mythologized in cross-generational online conversation nowadays, nor is he the mega-rich Roc Nation brunch mogul that some big '90s rap superstars became. If that's the kind of thing you value, then it didn't help that for a large chunk of the '90s, while the genre was in the midst of a commercial boom, Rick was in jail on an attempted murder charge.

By the time he returned to form with the pretty good The Art of Storytelling in 1999, he was an idolized veteran in his mid-30s in a radically changed rap landscape. He went 26 years before dropping another full-length release. That release is VICTORY, a short, stylish legacy album born out of boredom and an apparent itch to jog the memories of anyone who might've forgotten that this rap thing wouldn't be the same without MC Ricky D. “Had cats stayin' in Clark Wallabees, I did that/When brothers was drivin' Benzes I pushed them into Rolls Royces/Posh behavior, I did that,” he says on a spoken word interlude, over the soothing sound of waves washing the shore.

VICTORY is also part of Mass Appeal's big plan to cash in on rap nostalgia with a series called Legend Has It, in which the zine turned multimedia company and record label (co-owned by Nas) plans to release seven new albums by seven rap legends. These are the kinds of records that sound like message-board folklore: a joint tape by Nas and DJ Premier, a sequel to Supreme Clientele, and new Mobb Deep and Big L. To me it sounds like music that should stay in the vault and in the imagination, especially the posthumous projects, but VICTORY is a good choice to kick off the series because Rick's laid-back delivery isn't rusty. He's the rare 60-year-old rapper who isn't caught between trying to live up to the past and stay relevant in the present.

All these years later, Rick's sing-song, slick-worded autofiction still sounds like he's walking on air. When he sings the melancholic hook of “Spirit to Cry,” or reflects on almost getting deported back to England in the 2000s (he moved from the UK to the Bronx at 11) on “So You're Having My Baby,” the emotions feel sincere and the rhythms weightless. The same could said of the fast-paced house track “Come On Let's Go,” where he looks back on a club night so wild it made him late to work the next morning, and “Foreign,” where he spits a lightly comic story, switching in and out of patois, about messing with his Jamaican grandfather's records over a flip of a Dave and Ansel Collins reggae track. Told in less than two minutes, the tale ends with Rick imitating the grizzled voice of his grandfather, who calls his music “trash.”

“Foreign” is probably as funny as VICTORY gets. For as swagged-out as Rick's vocals are, the album is missing his sense of humor, which was always his superpower. He had a way of cutting through stories that were dark or out of pocket with his exaggerated impressions and one-of-a-kind imagination. On “Cuz I'm Here,” another house joint—Rick raps on two house records here because he heard Idris Elba, who is also an executive producer on the album, spinning them—he tells a choppy narrative about trying to pick up women on the dancefloor back in the day. There's only one verse and nothing really comes of it other than getting lightly pressed by some girl's man. And for some reason, the outro features shoutouts to Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen DeGeneres, like the song has been sitting on a hard drive since 2002.

“We're Not Losing,” though, could have been scribbled on a notepad in 1988 if you just replaced Cold War anxiety with anxiety about China. He brings up nuclear war and being forced to learn Mandarin, in what I think is satire, but the intention isn't clear enough to land. Not to forget that he busts out a Chinese accent on the outro—if you're going to go for that, you might as well weave it into the actual verse. “Documents” has a knocking self-produced beat with a little late '90s Queens sauce, but you know the jokes aren't hitting when the funniest part is the unintentional comedy of Nas seriously rapping bars like, “This that alcohol at the back of your neck, after a fresh cut.” In fact the big comic set piece is supposed to be “Landlord,” but it's a dud: just Rick venting about how hard it is to have tenants in New York City. I listened again and again trying to find the satire or metaphor as he haggles families for his rent money and threatens to evict them, but there isn't one. (Nas, in a sit-down interview with Rick, called the song “inspiring.”) I'm not expecting Slick Rick to canvass for Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign, but the Rick of the past would have fleshed out the vision by adding the perspective of the tenants or highlighting the ridiculousness of the landlord.

Yet somehow “Landlord” is still easy on the ears, because Rick's flow is effortlessly smooth and casual. That's the story, too, of his best vocal performance on “Angelic,” where he sounds like he's sipping champagne in the back of a limo as he balances the la-di-da-das he's been hitting since he teamed up with Doug E. Fresh 40 years ago with the malaise of aging in rap: “When I was young, was exciting and fun to live on/But something is happening, and ‘What is that son?'” It's tonal whirlpool that is also refreshingly low stakes, which is what VICTORY has going for it. He's not trying to make his big comeback or his 4:44. It's just a quick fly-by from one of the greatest rappers ever, a guy who seems to exist out of time.

Caroline Polachek has shared a new song. “On the Beach” appears on the soundtrack for the new PlayStation 5 video game Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which arrives this week. The song, which comes alongside an alternate “Timefall Mix,” was co-produced with Danny L Harle and co-written with Harle and Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2's writer, director, and designer. Check out both versions of the song below.

“On the Beach” is Polachek's first new track since last year's “Starburned and Unkissed,” her contribution to the I Saw the TV Glow soundtrack. She also made a guest appearance on this year's “Tell Me I Never Knew That,” taken from the London post-rock band Caroline's new album, Caroline 2. Polachek released her last studio album, Desire, I Want to Turn Into You, in 2023.

Death Stranding 2, the sequel to the 2019 blockbuster video game, is an adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world featuring a star-studded cast of voice actors, including Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, Elle Fanning, George Miller, Nicolas Winding Refn, and more. The original Death Stranding's soundtrack included original works by Chvrches, Major Lazer and Khalid, Bring Me the Horizon, and others.

							By 

	Hayes Madsen



Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is like a symphony — a gorgeous classical concerto where an electric guitar occasionally cuts in to shred an off-putting, yet surprisingly sick riff. As a whole, it's weird and uneven, but there's something undeniably compelling about how those disparate parts fit together.


	If there's one thing Death Stranding 2 (out June 26) isn't lacking, it's ambition. This is one of creator Hideo Kojima's (Metal Gear Solid) biggest and boldest games yet — unrelentingly building on the vision and style of its predecessor. In turn, Death Stranding 2 is a game about a lot of things — the way we perceive death and grief, how routine shapes our lives, a scathing indictment of American imperialism, a post-Covid reflection on isolation, and a warning about the dangers of AI and technology reliance. Sure, that's a lot to digest, but Kojima manages to somehow string together each discordant note into something unlike anything else in gaming (or any medium for that matter).

	











Death Stranding 2 is beautiful and messy all at once; a story that's as befuddling as it is enthralling, and a gameplay experience that's equally inventive and mind-numbingly routine at times. Those who didn't like the first Death Stranding (2019) definitely won't be converted here, but everyone else is in for one hell of a ride. It's a game of dichotomies, never content to be just one thing at any given time, and is one of the best of the year — if not the generation. 

	











Death Stranding 2 takes place roughly 11 months after the first game, and while there's a lengthy intro video to take newcomers through the preceding story, it's highly recommended to have played through at least a majority of the first game. 


	The story is set in a far future where a cataclysmic event (known as the Death Stranding) has wiped out much of humanity, leaving the survivors scattered and solitary. Paranormal creatures called beached things (BTs) infest the world, and whenever they consume a dead human, it causes what's called a Voidout — a massive atomic-level explosion. This has made post-apocalyptic delivery men called Porters, like protagonist Sam Bridges (played by Norman Reedus), essential as they can traverse the dangerous world to deliver goods, medicine, and the like.

	Taking place 11 months after the events of the original game, Sam and his daughter Lou have fled to Mexico to try to live a life of solitude and flee the commanding grip of the United Colonies of America (UCA). In the first Death Stranding, Sam reconnected the UCA through a sort of metaphysical internet called The Chiral Network. Now, as he tries to live his happy life in Mexico, Sam's life is hit with tragedy, and the UCA, once again, wants his help to spread the Chiral Network to Mexico and Australia — reuniting more of the world. 


	As it turns out, reuniting America has left the rest of the world more unstable than ever (it shouldn't be lost on anyone that the theme of returning America to “greatness” has had dire consequences for everywhere else). 


	Before going into more specifics on story and theme, it's important to note the gameplay formula and structure of Death Stranding 2 — as that jarring experience is so integrally tied to how players will experience the narrative. Truthfully, shifting back and forth between jarring tonal shifts feels true to what it's actually like to play it.


Death Stranding 2 is, at its core, a delivery simulator. As Sam reconnects Mexico and Australia, he has to make deliveries to different facilities and connect them to the network. Players start out making these deliveries on foot — inspired by the real-life traditional Japanese porters known as Bokka. But you progressively unlock more options for travel and delivery: vehicles, zip lines, catapults, monorails, teleporters, and more. Mexico serves as essentially a tutorial area to introduce the basics, before moving to Australia for the rest of the game, creating a massive streamlined delivery network. Of course, the other catch is the game's Strand system, which lets you see and use the items and objects of other players in your world, and vice versa.

	What's remarkable about Death Stranding 2, on a gameplay level, is that it hasn't really deviated from the vision of the first game — rather enhancing and refining it. The original Death Stranding's slow, methodical delivery experience wasn't for everyone, and it made the game better. But it's easy to see how that style of game is off-putting for some players; it's a slow burn in every regard. 


	While Death Stranding 2 does introduce some drastic new action elements, it's still that plodding delivery simulator at its heart, and it's honestly charming to see a sequel that refuses to make concessions to be more approachable. That's not to say, however, that Death Stranding 2 isn't better than the first game — it is, in pretty much every conceivable way.


	By and large, the sequel feels like the full realization of what Kojima Productions wanted to do with its delivery system. There's a layer of simulation to the entire game that's remarkably compelling, giving players  vastly more dynamic options for how to travel the world and complete orders. You can unearth mines to harvest resources and build a massive monorail network that allows for seamless  travel across the continent — but that's a huge time investment. Or you can simply hop on your trusty trike and travel Australia mile by mile. Fast travel has also been made drastically easier with the help of Transponders that teleport Sam, as well as his ship the DHV Magellan — which serves as a home base. 


	Those simulation elements also rear their head in environmental hazards. A portal known as a Plate Gate has appeared on both continents, causing earthquakes and shockwaves that can easily knock Sam over, or his vehicle off a cliff if players aren't careful. Meandering through the snowy mountains, you might also find yourself confronted by a sudden avalanche, fleeing for life from the thundering wall of snow. 


	The world itself also feels more vibrant and alive. Different variations of BTs stalk the wilderness, requiring adaptability to overcome. Mercenaries, bandits, and a new breed of enemy called Ghost Mechs also dot the landscape, necessitating weaponry to deal with. There are more opportunities for combat, and in turn, the shooting and weapons feel like they've been given more thoughtful implementation and tightened controls. There are also some gratuitously fun additions to combat, like a grenade that lets you capture big BTs like Pokémon to be summoned  in battle, triggering a delightful 1970s Godzilla-like soundtrack. Death Stranding 2 likes to have fun with its weird and wonderful weapons. 

	











	Simultaneously, the game affords far more ways to customize the player's experiences. Completing deliveries will rank up the various facilities you've connected, granting more bandwidth to build objects in the world and unlock new weapons or items, as well as points for the new APAS Enhancements system. This is essentially a perk tree for fine-tuning aspects of the game, like making canteens easier to fill in rivers or improving a gun's firing rate. It's an intuitive system that allows for a lot of mix and match customization, and a more tangible sense of reward for grinding out every location's levels. 


	All that being said, the controls can still feel frustratingly obstinate at times, and get in the way of the overall experience. Swapping weapons isn't as intuitive as it should be in a shooter, requiring players to open menus to sift through, then drop the guns when they're empty. There's a new dodge, but it can only be executed while aiming with a gun. Little frustrations like that are still present, and that's largely because the game is still primarily focused on the walking simulator, delivery experience. 


	However, the one aspect of Death Stranding 2 that does feel like a drastic leap forward are the bosses. These are some of the best boss battles in any modern video game — pitting you against fantastical creatures or gritty engagements that flip the rules of the game on its head. One has Sam fighting in an underwater world, with moon-like gravity, where you can make giant leaps. Another has you fighting through a crumbling Inception-like monorail system, where enemy soldiers leap between the floor and ceiling. There are so many big set-piece battles that are genuinely jaw-dropping, and the last four hours of the game contain some of the most fever dream-induced moments ever found in a video game, in the best way possible. 


	But that's what makes Death Stranding 2 so fascinating, how these big action movie moments are propped up against the majority of the game, which is largely about a meditative delivery gig. That juxtaposition feels even more important and intentional than in the first game, tying into the game's theme of routine, and how humans can normalize even the most oppressive of circumstances by simply sticking to the norm. 

	











Death Stranding 2's more refined gameplay experience stands in contrast to a story that's extremely gutsy, topical, and sometimes nauseatingly self-referential. Kojima is often referencing his past work in Death Stranding 2, and it does tread a fine line between pleasant and pompous. 


	It's genuinely difficult to go into more specifics of the story as there are some major, shocking twists early on that inform the rest of Sam's journey. This is, by far, the darkest story that Kojima has ever created — not shying away from themes of suicide, depression, grief, and more. Leading up to the release of Death Stranding 2, Kojima was quite open about how the Covid-19 pandemic influenced his interpretation of the first game's themes, and that's abundantly clear to see here. 


	There's a strong message of connection and the importance of traveling to meeting people in person. There's also a much larger emphasis on violence in this sequel, on how average people perceive it and use it, and how governments harness violence to get what they want. This manifests through both the narrative, combat, and environmental storytelling.


	Most of the cast from the first game plays a major role in Death Stranding 2, including the deliciously evil Higgs (Troy Baker), who morphs into a drastically better villain this time around. But there's also a new cast of characters introduced into the mix, all of whom have a vital role to play and a story to uncover. Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna)  is a mysterious girl who causes Timefall Rain whenever she steps outside, which has made society shun her — despite the healing secret she hides. Dollman (the likeness of Fatih Akin; voiced by Jonathan Roumie) is a particular highlight as Sam's new sidekick — a man with a tragic past whose soul now resides in a creepy little ventriloquist mannequin. 


	Remarkably, not a single major character is forgotten by Death Stranding 2's story; everyone feels like a vital piece in the tapestry of the narrative. And it's through their stories that we see most of the game's themes evoked — how their lives have been defined by America's obsession with gaining power, and how death defines the way they live. Sam's character arc, in particular, is remarkably moving in Death Stranding 2; it's a harrowing story of family, love, and sacrifice that goes to some genuinely unexpected places. 

	











	The fact that the story works at all despite its bizarre tonal shifts and erratic pacing is a testament to how strong the game's themes and characterization truly are. Big action pieces are bookended by hours of monotony. Thoughtfully human moments are filtered through surrealist imagery and ventriloquist dolls. But it's that befuddling mixture that gives the game so much of its personality. 


Death Stranding 2, even more than the first game, feels like something people will be talking about for the next decade to come. We'll be digging into its themes and messages for years, and there will undoubtedly be no shortage of debate on how brilliant, or terrible, it all is. But that's exactly why this game feels so important right now — in an ocean of sameness and trends to chase, it's undeniably its own thing. Death Stranding 2 isn't a sequel that course corrects; it doubles down and takes even bolder leaps in the opposite direction. And in an industry that's so obsessed with safe franchises, it feels refreshing to see something so large-scale that's so ballsy. 


	The caveat to that, of course, is that no one but Hideo Kojima would be given the time and money to make something like this — Death Stranding 2 is like a bizarre Frankenstein monster built as a monument to the game industry idolization of its “auteurs.” It's a game molded by the unending ambition of its creators, with little guard rails put up in the process. At times abrasive, unnerving, and wholly uncompromising, Death Stranding 2 is as emotionally exhausting as it is obtuse. But that's an undeniable piece of what makes the game so compelling, how it builds its themes to be utilized by the player's interpretations. This story and experience might mean something completely different to every player.

	As the industry struggles with layoffs, cancellations, and a lack of innovation — it feels so rare to see games like Death Stranding 2. Something that's big, beautiful, ambitious, chaotic, and messy all at once. This isn't a game for everyone, but for those willing to take the plunge, it's a generation-defining gaming experience.


Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out June 26 on PlayStation 5.

Margaret Cho described her strained relationship with Ellen DeGeneres during an appearance on a new episode of The Kelly Mantle Show. The comedian said DeGeneres always treated her like a stranger when she came on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, despite the fact that they had been around each other for years. 


	“Ellen was really weird and not nice to me for most of my career,” Cho said on the show. “I opened for her in the 1980s, when she was a headliner in comedy clubs. Later, when I would do her talk show in the 2000s, she would act like we just met.” 


	She added, “And I'm like, ‘Bitch, what?' That's weird. We go way back. It's so creepy and weird.”


	Cho recalled a specific incident that stuck out to her as especially odd. David Bowie appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the day after one of his concerts, at which Cho dressed up in an elaborate “Chinese emperor outfit.” Bowie complimented the costume to DeGeneres, but the remark was edited out of the final broadcast. 

	











	“The producer, who's a really good friend of mine, had to call me and tell me, ‘I can't believe she did this, but she cut it out of the show,'” Cho explained. “‘But you need to know that he was going on and on about your outfit. God said your name. He loves you.'” She admitted she wasn't sure if it was actually a vindictive move, but added, “Still, I'm going to take it personally.”

	DeGeneres' image took a hit in 2020 following a series of reports by BuzzFeed News in which employees at her show alleged racism, sexual misconduct, and intimidation at the hands of executive producers. Three producers were fired because of it, and DeGeneres issued an on-air apology. In 2022, singer Greyson Chance, whom DeGeneres signed to her label, told Rolling Stone he had “never met someone more manipulative, more self-centered, and more blatantly opportunistic.” The Ellen DeGeneres Show ultimately ended in 2022 after 19 seasons. 

	











	The host has since addressed the controversy on tour and in a stand-up special, Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval, which aired on Netflix. “The Be Kind Girl wasn't kind — that was the headline,” DeGeneres said in the special. “Here's the problem, I'm a comedian who got a talk show, and I ended the show every day by saying, ‘Be kind to one another.' Had I ended my show by saying, ‘Go fuck yourselves,' people would've been pleasantly surprised to find out I'm kind.”

Ezra Miller reflected on the numerous controversies surrounding their career in an interview with Italian outlet Lo Speciale Giornale. In the interview, filmed during the Cannes Film Festival in May and published on June 19, Miller (who uses they/them pronouns) explained why they joined the red carpet for Lynne Ramsey's new film Die My Love. 


	“I'm working with her again,” Miller confirmed of the filmmaker. “That will likely be the first thing I do, is a film that her and I are writing together. I've been writing a lot because you can do that in solitude, which has been friendly to me… And I came to Cannes because she asked me to come. If there's anything I still believe in, in my life, it's devotion to one's people, to one's loved ones, to one's friends, to one's comrades, above all else.”


	They added, “I didn't necessarily want to go to Cannes. I had a bit of a hard time. That's a tough re-entry point. If you've been in the woods for three years, I do not recommend going straight to Cannes, where every photographer and every weirdo, every rich genocidal freak [will] be there, you know what I mean? It's not an easy re-entry.”

	The actor didn't specifically speak about their past wrongdoings, which include multiple arrests, but did reflect on what has come since. “When we go through those crucibles, if we can survive, which was up in the air for me if I'm being real, we then have that capacity to see other people in their crucibles and just to reach towards them,” Miller said. “I think that grows more and more rarefied in our world, too. Like, the capacity to do that, the desire to do that, the willingness to do that.”

	











	They added of the circumstances that have followed, “Not that I don't hold a lot of remorse and lamentation for a lot of things that I did and for a lot of things that happened in that time, but I'm really, really grateful for the lessons that came with that abyss.”


	When asked to characterize his relationship with the film industry in the interview, Miller replied, “Tentative — I'd say on tentative grounds.”

	In 2020, Miller was seen in a viral video choking and throwing an unnamed woman to the ground at a bar in Reykjavik, Iceland. In 2022, the actor was arrested in Hawaii for disorderly conduct and harassment, including at a local karaoke bar, where Miller allegedly started “yelling obscenities and became agitated when a couple began singing Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's ‘Shallow' at a karaoke bar.” Later that same night, police were called to remove Miller from the property the actor was staying at over another disturbance.


	Miller was subsequently arrested again in Hawaii and charged with second-degree assault. Later that same year, the concerned parents of Gibson Iron Eyes — a notable Standing Rock activist — accused Miller of grooming and controlling the then-18-year-old. Shortly thereafter, Rolling Stone published an exclusive report that revealed Miller had a 25-year-old mother and her three children under the age of five living at their 96-acre farm in Stamford, Vermont, which worried the children's father and people familiar with the situation.

Iran reportedly targeted American military bases in Qatar and Iraq on Monday, after President Donald Trump launched preemptive strikes against three Iranian nuclear development facilities over the weekend. 


	According to multiple news outlets, Iran launched at least six missiles towards U.S. military bases in Qatar. Ahead of the missile launches, Qatari airspace was shut down to commercial air travel, after the Department of Defense assessed what they called a “credible” threat of military action from Iran. 


	A Reuters witness reported hearing several explosions over Doha, the Qatari capital, indicating that some of the munitions may have been intercepted by defense systems. According to Axios, similar defense systems were activated at the al-Assad airbase in Iraq. 


	In a statement to MSNBC, a White House official said, “The White House and the Department of Defense are aware of and closely monitoring potential threats to Al Udeid air base in Qatar.” The official added that “President Trump, Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine, along with other officials in the White House, are in the situation room monitoring the latest.”

	In a statement released on social media, Qatar's Foreign Ministry said that “the State of Qatar strongly condemns the attack that targeted Al-Udeid Air Base by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. We consider this a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law, and the United Nations Charter.” 

	











	“We also emphasize that the continuation of such escalatory military actions will undermine security and stability in the region, dragging it into situations that could have catastrophic consequences for international peace and security,” the nation wrote. “We call for the immediate cessation of all military actions and for a serious return to the negotiating table and dialogue.” 


	According to The New York Times, which spoke to three Iranian officials familiar with the strike plans, the attack was coordinated with the Qatari government, which was given advance notice. The officials added that the move was largely a “symbolic” action, an echo of a similar strategy employed in 2020 in the aftermath of the U.S.'s killing of former Iranian General Qasem Soleimani during Trump's first term.


	The attacks come two days after Trump launched preemptive strikes on nuclear sites in Iran, which has been trading attacks with Israel since June 13. In his address Saturday evening, following the U.S. attacks on Iran, Trump demanded that Iran “now make peace,” adding: “If they do not. Future attacks would be far greater and a lot easier.”

	When deciding to launch a bomb (or several dozen) at another nation, it is critical to consider that even though the target of your munitions may be thousands of miles away, the geopolitical and economic fallout could extend far beyond tit-for-tat airstrikes. 


	Over the weekend, President Donald Trump authorized potentially crippling strikes against three of Iran's nuclear research and development sites, and now the world waits for potential retaliation. Outside of lobbing their own bombs, one option being floated by Iran is cutting off access to the Strait of Hormuz — a 90-mile stretch of water that connects the Persian Gulf and its surrounding oil-rich nations — to the open ocean. Approximately 30 percent of global liquid natural gas and 20 percent of the world's oil pass through the strait. Its closure would cause oil prices to soar. 


	Oil prices are set on a global market, but in Trump's mind, the consequences of committing an act of war against a global oil-baron can be staved off with a stern Truth Social post. 

	











	“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” The President wrote on his personal social media platform Monday morning. 


	In a separate post, Trump demanded that the Department of Energy “DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!  And I mean NOW!!!” Of course, there are not necessarily spare oil refineries, wells, and accompanying infrastructure waiting to be activated in the event of the president choosing to commit an act of war because he thinks it will play well on Fox News. 

	











	According to a Monday report from CNBC, shipping groups are already taking steps to avoid the Strait of Hormuz — or outright pausing transit through the area — in an attempt to avoid any potential fallout. The Iranian parliament has already backed a potential blockade of the strait. 


	In an effort to stave off another blow to global energy markets already strained by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the United States has apparently been forced to turn to another nation that is supremely irked with the American president's impulsiveness: China. 


	In a Sunday interview with Fox Business, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he “would encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call [Iran] about that, because they heavily depend on the Straits of Hormuz for their oil.”

	The United States and China remain locked in a tense tug of war over Trump's effort to slap potentially ruinous tariffs on goods imported from the nation earlier this year, resulting in a protracted trade war that was put on ice only after Trump agreed to a 90-day stay on the enforcement of the highest trade penalties. 


	For now China is keeping its cards close to its chest. On Sunday, China's United Nations Ambassador told a state-controlled broadcaster that while Iran took significant damage the strikes “also harmed is U.S. credibility — as a country and as a party to any international negotiations.”

	It's just before 9 a.m., and the girls of Katseye are already dressed and ready for rehearsals ahead of the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards. They sometimes let out a little yawn while answering questions, but Sophia, Manon, Lara, Yoonchae, Megan, and Daniela are hyped for the week ahead as they gear up to drop their sophomore EP, Beautiful Chaos, on Friday.


	“It's us stepping into our maturity,” says Lara. “I feel like this era, we have been a lot more authentically ourselves. I don't have to put on a facade of any kind when talking to anyone anymore. I think that's a beautiful thing, and you can see that more within the album. You see more of our fire.”


	It's undeniable: Katseye is going through their biggest moment yet. Formed in November 2023, the Geffen/Hybe artists have quickly risen as the present and future of the pop girl group. The six members were handpicked after competing on the Netflix reality show Pop Star Academy: Katseye, making it to the top out of 20 finalists, chosen from nearly 120,000 hopefuls wanting to be part of a new K-pop-styled band. The Netflix series followed the top 20 finalists as they took on challenges sharpening their dance skills, vocal abilities, and star quality.  Their rise as a six-piece has been fast, and they've already built a massive following of EYEKONS who follow their every move. On their first EP, SIS (Soft Is Strong), they introduced their chemistry and delivered a hit, “Touch,” which became a mainstay on TikTok, thanks to its infectious chorus and fun-to-learn dance routine. With Beautiful Chaos, the group proves that their strong friendship and shining individuality is here to stay.

	











	“We can't fake this,” admits Sophia. “We all have that shared goal of Katseye's success and we really nurtured our friendship a lot. We got really lucky.”

	











	“We really, really, really spent so much time together and put in a lot of effort to develop our relationship with each other,” adds Lara. “This isn't something you could manufacture or develop. It's a genuine friendship with a deep bond.”

	Members of past girl groups, including Little Mix and Fifth Harmony, have frequently said that what made being in a group so difficult was having to hold in their individuality for their brand as a collective. The opposite rings true in Katseye, where each of the women's individuality and cultures are celebrated — it's part of the “global girl group” identity Hybe and Geffen set out to build when they started the search for the group.


	Lara, for example, is often photographed in a bindi or wearing attire celebrating her South Asian heritage, while Daniela, who's of Cuban descent, sings the bridge to their latest single “Gabriela” in Spanish. “We really are pushed to shine individually with our strengths,” says Sophia, who's Filipina. “We're Katseye members first, but we also shine on our own.”


Beautiful Chaos shows off the diversity in their styles and vocal versatility. There's pop, R&B, a ballad, and “Gnarly,” the polarizing campy single that kicked off a dance trend and quickly earned the group their second big hit after 2024's “Touch.” Manon says making their second EP felt “so authentic to who we are right now” in both their lyricism and the manifestation of their artistry, and it's also a “very transitional” EP for the group, as Sophia explains it.


	“We've paid a lot more attention to detail,” says Manon. “It's been a really fun experience and it feels authentic to us.”


	The five-track EP closes with what they all agree is their favorite song, “M.I.A.” It's a stadium-ready anthem, more in line with girl groups like Blackpink, the kind of track made to be sung back by a crowd. “We screamed when we heard it,” says Daniela.

	“This is exactly our taste,” adds Lara. “I think the production is fire and we really showed our individuality.”


	“Game Boy,” the girls say, is like a sequel to “Touch, and made for the fans who enjoyed that era. “It's a feel-good song and like an elevated ‘Touch,'” says Megan. “I'm excited for ‘Game Boy' because it's going to be the favorite of the Eyekons who really like our ‘Touch' era,” adds Yoonchae.


	Manon steps up to talk about their single “Mean Girls,” a slower ballad that offers love to the “dream girls, free girls,” and “even the mean girls.” On it, the girls sing: “This is why I hate the internet, you're not gonna kill my happiness.”

	











	During Dream Academy, Manon faced an unfair level of backlash from people who questioned her place in the group. Now, she's putting any narratives to rest. “A lot of us got called mean girls after the documentary dropped and all these narratives started running, so it's kind of an homage to that,” Manon says. “It's giving killing them with kindness. This song is closing a chapter.”


	“Mean Girls” also ends with the girls declaring, “God bless the T girls, and all the in-between girls.” Since their formation, Katseye has been open about their closeness to queerness — two of the members are bi — and just how much the LGBTQ community has shaped both their artistry and their fandom. But the community has also played a closer role: For a recent performance, trans designer Gigi Goode crafted custom looks for the group, and they even posted a video dancing with Vivian Wilson, Elon Musk's estranged trans daughter. (It might've been a tongue-in-cheek nod to their Tesla reference on “Gnarly.”)


	“We work a lot with the trans community all the time, whether it's fashion or music,” says Lara. “We are constantly around trans women, and I think we have so much love and respect for them. We wanted to shout them out.”


	For Beautiful Chaos, the group's studio process started with the girls being played songs and offered pre-selected verses and parts to try out. Manon says having a team guiding the creative process is helpful, but once they're in the booth, they'll “try each other's parts,” and whatever sounds best is what makes the cut. They also have a group therapist who allows them a “safe space” to work through any issues that could come up with being young adults navigating stardom together in a group.

If you were to ask someone about UFO's (unidentified flying objects) or Aliens 15 or 20 years ago, you may be filed away as some crazy person wearing a tin-foil hat in your free time. These days, the topics of living beings in outer-space are far more common.

Take for example, earlier this year. Something mysterious was flying over the skies of Southeast Boise and some folks were able to grab decent footage to post online.

Take a look at this mysterious object--and what many in Boise are saying about its sighting!

Do you know anything about what was zipping around Boise skies just months ago?

Think it's real? A Drone? What could it be?

Let's be honest, nobody really knows and apparently, according to the data for the State of Idaho, it isn't a surprise.

Recent findings from 'Action Network' suggest that among all 50 states in the United States of America, Idaho ranks 9th for most UFO sightings.

Action Network is an online gambling site, so their take is unique. They suggest the 'odds' of seeing a UFO which is peculiar given we don't even know if UFO's are real?

States ranking higher than Idaho?

Talk of aliens and life beyond Earth continue to get more and more serious as now, official government hearings have been held, some public and some behind closed doors, after military whistleblowers have come forth to say that they're seeing things in the sky that cannot be explained.

ET-- is that you??

See the video of that recent Boise for yourself, below: 

 

 

Anyone just see this in SE Boise?byu/hdninplainview inBoise



 

 

This most recent sighting, of course, is not the first time we have heard of an alien or an alleged UFO flying over the Idaho skies. We can't really believe that we are the only living beings in this massive universe, can we!?

Venture out of your world with the trailer for Star People.

The sci-fi thriller will premiere at Dances with Films in Los Angeles this Saturday, June 28, before hitting theaters on July 25 and VOD on August 12 via Blue Harbor Entertainment.

The film is inspired by the Phoenix Lights, the largest mass UFO sighting in U.S. history. The 1997 event has inspired several other movies, including 2007's Night Skies, 2015's The Phoenix Incident, and 2017's Phoenix Forgotten.

It tells the story of a photographer who receives a tip that could finally shed light on her childhood UFO sighting, but a deadly heatwave and unexpected guests threaten to derail her obsessive search for answers.

Kat Cunning (“The Deuce”), McCabe Slye (Fear Street Part Two: 1978), Eddie Martinez (“The Sinner”), Bradley Fisher (“Westworld”), Adriana Aluna Martinez (“Duster”), and Connor Paolo (“Gossip Girl”) star.

Writer-director Adam Finberg makes his narrative feature debut.

“We're all in on Blue Harbor's vision for launching Star People,” commented producer Josh Shader. “With their transparent, collaborative approach, the filmmaker isn't just a spectator — they're part of the marketing and distribution game plan from the start.”

“We're excited to share Star People with audiences everywhere later this summer,” added Blue Harbor. “This eerie, atmospheric thriller deals with one of the more confounding events that remains in question today. Adam and Josh have really captured the unease and wonder of the unknown while keeping you on edge throughout.”

Jurassic Park writer David Koepp has finally shared an update regarding the current status of the upcoming Steven Spielberg UFO movie. This marks the creative duo's latest collaboration, after first working together in the iconic 1993 dinosaur movie. The untitled film is currently scheduled to arrive in theaters on June 12, 2026.

The ensemble cast includes Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Wyatt Russell (Thunderbolts*), Josh O'Connor (The Crown), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Eve Hewson (The Perfect Couple), and Noah Robbins (Fly Me to the Moon). It is produced by Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger for Amblin Entertainment, along with Chris Brigham.

During a recent interview, Koepp confirmed that production on his next Spielberg movie had officially wrapped three weeks ago. Although he wasn't able to tease more of the project's plot and characters, he did reveal that “[Spielberg] was the most involved on this as he's been on any movie I've [he has] written for him to direct.”

“Unfortunately, there's very little I can say about it other than that we finished shooting about three weeks ago,” he said. “I think it looks fantastic and it comes out next June.”

Koepp continued, “I say anything, I get killed. What he [Spielberg] does so brilliantly is that he combines a vast spectacle with really honest, human emotion, unlike, I think, any other director. It's a very emotional experience, this movie.”

The untitled UFO movie is being directed by Spielberg from a screenplay written by Jurassic Park scribe David Koepp, based on a story by the Oscar-winning filmmaker. This marks Spielberg's first sci-fi movie since directing the 2018 film adaptation of Ready Player One. This will be Spielberg's latest directorial feature project since helming 2022's The Fabelmans, which was loosely based on his early life. The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Michelle Williams), and Best Supporting Actor (Judd Hirsch).

IN a world where sustainability has become more than just a buzzword, the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) Qatar Chapter stepped up with action and heart. Staying true to its commitment to environmental responsibility and community well-being, it proudly conducted its first green initiative for fiscal year 2024–2025 with the inspiring program, ""Turn Your E-Waste to Health & Wellness.""

More than just a recycling effort, this initiative was a call to care for the planet and human welfare. In partnership with Wellkins Medical Centre, a trusted name in health care in Qatar, the chapter invited members to dig deep into their drawers and closets, and then gather and bring their broken, obsolete, and unused gadgets, phones, laptops, keyboards, chargers, and other tech items to the General Membership Meeting.

Each piece of discarded tech wasn't just weighed — it was transformed into something meaningful. For every kilo of e-waste donated, members earned QAR 5 (approx. P75) in digital wallet credits, redeemable for medical services at Wellkins. Every participant was issued a Wellkins e-Wallet, recording their contribution and allowing them to turn environmental responsibility into personal wellness benefits.

But the story doesn't end there. With the help of Seashore, one of Qatar's licensed recycling facilities, UAP Qatar ensured that all collected electronics totaling an impressive 150 kilograms were properly and sustainably recycled. The success of the event, held at Casa Milano Showroom on Feb. 21, was marked with the awarding of a Certificate of Recycling, a symbol of impact and proof that every little effort counts.

UAP Qatar's ""Turn Your E-Waste to Health & Wellness"" is more than a campaign; it's a mindset shift. It's about turning small, mindful actions into lasting benefits for our environment and our health. As the chapter continues to champion green architecture and sustainable living, this initiative stands as a powerful reminder that when we care together, we grow together — stronger, healthier and greener.

Omen, as a title, stirs a sense of eerie intrigue, and that's no coincidence. This upcoming film yet again explores the horror genre with a bold choice: the found footage format, a style that is slowly picking up in Kannada cinema.

Helmed by Vibin S Santosh, who has written, directed, and edited the film, Omen centres around a haunted house where a paranormal investigation takes a terrifying turn. The story unfolds as if the audience is sifting through raw, real recordings, intensifying the fear and suspense.

The protagonist, played by Ajay Kumar, is a YouTuber who sets out to explore the mysteries surrounding the house, while Neeshma Shetty stars as a paranormal researcher determined to uncover the truth. The film invites viewers to step into their shoes, witnessing unexplained events through shaky cams, night vision, and the audio captures—techniques that blur the line between fiction and reality.

Omen is produced by Ajay Kumar and V Mirunalini's Maravanji Productions and Sri Angalaparameshwari Movie Makers. 

The cast also features Maitri Jaggi, Keerthana Pulki, Raghu Kalavida, and Akash Kulkarni, all of whom portray characters caught in the vortex of the house's haunted history.

The technical team includes music composers Bhuvan Shankar and Sanskaar, and SFX artist Ansho S Simon.

The film, having completed its censor formalities, is expected to hit theatres this July.

Dr. Jacob Haqq-Misra and his team recently published a fascinating paper outlining 10 possible futures for Earth's technosphere. 

For decades, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has largely been predicated on a specific assumption: that advanced civilizations will inevitably grow, expanding their energy consumption and building colossal structures detectable across vast cosmic distances. This idea, famously encapsulated by the Kardashev scale, envisions civilizations as endlessly progressing, building gigantic spaceships or Dyson spheres around their stars. But what if this isn't the only possible future for a civilization? What if other, less visible, less ""noisy"" paths exist?

This intriguing question was at the heart of a recent SETI Live discussion featuring Dr. Jacob Haqq-Misra, a researcher at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, along with SETI Institute planetary astronomer, Dr. Franck Marchis.

Dr. Haqq-Misra and his team recently published a fascinating paper outlining 10 possible futures for Earth's technosphere (the total of all Earth's technology and its interactions). This pioneering work challenges conventional SETI assumptions and suggests new avenues for discovering intelligent life beyond Earth.

To understand these future scenarios, Dr. Haqq-Misra first clarified the concept of a technosphere. Analogous to Earth's biosphere (the total of all life and its effects on the planet), the technosphere encompasses the entirety of our technological infrastructure – everything from computers and concrete to the satellites in orbit and even the rovers exploring Mars. It represents the global impact of human technology on Earth's systems and already extends beyond Earth's biosphere, with technology deployed on Mars and probes sent beyond our solar system.

Dr. Haqq-Misra's team developed 10 detailed scenarios for Earth's technosphere over the next thousand years, deliberately designed as projections rather than predictions. ""You can't predict the future for human systems,"" he explained. Instead, these scenarios bracket the possibility space, stretching our imagination and providing a systematic way to think about diverse outcomes. These methods, widely used in fields from military strategy to product development, are now applied to the long-term evolution of our planet's technological footprint.

Dr. Haqq-Misra highlighted a few iconic examples:

The Kardashev scale, proposed by radio astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in the 1960s, classifies civilizations based on their energy consumption:



Traditional SETI has often focused on detecting Type II or Type III civilizations, assuming exponential growth is inevitable. However, Dr. Haqq-Misra's research directly challenges this assumption. Of their 10 scenarios, only four exhibit continuous growth, and just one reaches the Kardashev Type I scale. Other growth scenarios are much slower, while some stabilize, collapse, or even oscillate in a cycle of growth and collapse, drawing parallels to historical patterns like Chinese dynasties.

This work suggests that the universe may teem with civilizations not following this singular, exponentially expanding trajectory.

Perhaps the most profound implication of this research is for SETI strategies. If not all civilizations exhibit continuous, high-energy growth, our current search methods might be missing a vast number of potentially advanced societies.

Dr. Haqq-Misra noted that in several of their scenarios, an exoplanet hosting a technologically advanced civilization would appear identical to pre-agricultural Earth if observed with a powerful space telescope. The atmospheric gases would show evidence of biology but no detectable technosignatures (observable indicators of technology). Yet, in these same scenarios, technology thrives elsewhere in the system, extending to dwarf planets and the Kuiper Belt.

This poses a critical challenge: our current, limited observational capabilities could lead to false negatives, where we conclude a planet only hosts simple life when it is, in fact, teeming with advanced technology existing in less detectable forms. This highlights the urgent need to think more strategically about detecting diverse technosignatures. While interstellar probes remain the ""easiest way"" to confirm advanced civilizations, in the interim, we must broaden our search methodologies beyond the conventional.

When asked about his outlook for humanity's future, Dr. Haqq-Misra expressed optimism. He believes humans possess the qualities to solve global problems and navigate upcoming transitions, even if imperfectly. ""We can't be lazy, but we can be innovative,"" he stated, encouraging a proactive and hopeful approach to shaping our future.

The work of Dr. Haqq-Misra and his team opens new frontiers for SETI, encouraging us to look for intelligence in unexpected places and forms. By expanding our understanding of what a civilization might look like, we enhance our chances of truly answering the age-old question: Are we alone?

Watch the full conversation with Dr. Jacob Haqq-Misra and learn more about this exciting research.

Chrissy's open shelves need to be seen to be believed – I've written about kitchens for years, but these stopped me in my tracks


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Over the last five years, I've seen hundreds – if not thousands – of celebrity kitchens, all of which exhibit a quality that makes them feel unique and personal to their owners. In the case of Chrissy Teigen's marble kitchen, her 'floating' shelves are unlike anything I've ever seen before. Few features often stop me in my scrolling tracks, but the optical illusion seen in her background stole all my attention, and I think you'll be amazed, too.

The ultra-modern space, designed by Jack Arnold, features white, veined marble shelves that seamlessly blend with the splashback of the same material. She places neutral cookware on one shelf, but her bookshelf (the highest one) has the real supernatural quality.

It appears as though her books are floating above the marble shelf, creating an optical illusion that differs from anything I've ever seen before. It's kitchen storage, with a magical twist, and if you're anything like me, you'll spend a lot of time admiring its power.

This clever bracket is made from high-grade alloy metal material, which is rust-free for life. The rods are set at a 90-degree vertical angle, so you have no need to worry about the difficulty of inserting rods into the holes. It makes getting Chrissy's look simpler. 

Loved by Chrissy



Bake, steam and strain all in one lightweight pan with this chic Dutch oven. They were designed by Chrissy, and loved by her in her kitchen. 

Stackable



Cook multiple dishes at once with this multi-tray, silicone bakeware set. It's chic but so practical, you'll wonder, and of course, Chrissy-approved.

As expected, creating a floating kitchen shelf with the same impact as Chrissy's is an art. However, with some planning and hidden accessories (discreet wall brackets, we're looking at you), it's possible to achieve a similar aesthetic.

'To create that clean, 'floating' open shelving look in a kitchen, the key is simplicity and clever concealment,' comments Claire Garner, the director at Claire Garner Design Studio.

'Choose wall-mounted shelves with hidden brackets [such as this one from Amazon] or floating shelf systems that are anchored directly into the studs, which will give the illusion that the shelves are weightlessly suspended,' Claire explains.

The materials you use are similarly important. 'Choose materials with a slim profile, like oak or powder-coated steel, which will help to add elegance without the visual bulk,' she explains. 'When styling your shelving, aim to keep it minimal by grouping items by colour or material, and leaving a little breathing room between objects so the wall still feels light and open.'

Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.

I hope to bring this look into my kitchen sometime very soon. In the meantime, I'll keep returning to Chrissy's space as the most magical space I've seen so far this year. It's truly stunning.

Posted in: BBC, CW, TV | Tagged: doctor who, Supernatural

It was an unofficial Supernatural/Doctor Who crossover during Heroes Dutch Comic Con, with Misha Collins and David Tennant checking in.

Earlier today, we had a chance to cover what Jared Padalecki had to share during Heroes Dutch Comic Con about filming the fifth and final season of Prime Video's The Boys and his upcoming in-development CBS medical drama. But that was far from the only cool thing to come out of the con this weekend and hit social media. For example, where else but at a pop culture convention or fan event could you find the Tenth/Fourteenth Doctor and Castiel spending some green room time together? That's right, Supernatural star Misha Collins and Doctor Who star David Tennant had a chance to enjoy some hanging-out time during the big event, and Collins was kind enough to post a look.

""It's weird, but the green room at [Heroes Dutch Comic Con] is MUCH bigger on the inside,"" read the caption to Collins' Instagram post, which included a selfie of Tennant and Collins together:

 

 

A post shared by Misha Collins (@misha)

Back in April, we had a chance to pass along some of what went down when Supernatural and The Boys co-stars Collins, Padalecki, and Jensen Ackles made their way to Creation Entertainment's ""The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Minneapolis"" – including insights into Ackles' upcoming Prime Video series, Countdown, and Padalecki's experience filming the final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's Prime Video series. Collins also offered a behind-the-scenes look at the shenanigans that go on behind the scenes, like what happens when Collins leaves his phone in the green room during the fan event and Ackles gets his hands on it. ""Jensen got into my phone again in the green room. Do I never learn? (The last image is an 8X10 photo that was sitting on the table. He doctored it with a red Sharpie. ),"" Collins wrote as the caption to his social media posts, including the evidence of Ackles' mischief:

I get emails touting findings from studies all the time, and unless they stand out, they usually make their way to a digital trash can at some point.

But there's one finding that consistently makes its way back to my inbox anyway.

Wyoming is often listed in the top 10 as an alien hotspot.

The most recent of which reads: ""With World UFO Day approaching on July 2, Action Network examined UFO sighting reports across all 50 states, calculating the per capita figures to reveal where you're statistically most likely to encounter something strange...""

And you guessed it, Wyoming is at the top of that list, ranked #10 -- a different study last fall suggested the Cowboy State claims the 8th spot.

The sponsor of the study is a sports betting and analysis site. They looked at data from the National UFO Reporting Center, yes it's a thing. You can file a report here.

A map from NUFORC shows hundreds, maybe thousands of reports from Wyoming.

On October 6, 2002 the summary, very brief, reads: ""A green circular light appeared and then darted behind the mountains.""

In February 2004 a report says, ""8 sided diamond, (I think that is a tetrahedron), just appeared or we just noticed it after it appeared. It hovered high above the moun [sic]""

Another report from November 25, 2017: ""There was a bright white light floating in the sky and it turned orange when we started to talk about it. The light vanished quickly.""

Looking at UFO sightings per 100,000 people, Vermont takes the cake.

The Green Mountain state's peaceful rural skies and clear nights make it the perfect backdrop to witness some weird activity. They're followed, in this order, by Montana, Washington, Alaska, Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, New Mexico, Idaho, and Wyoming.

The Cowboy State's vast wilderness and low light pollution create ideal conditions for spotting mysterious lights, while Washington's blend of urban areas and dense forests makes it a hotspot for a wide range of UFO encounters.

On the flip side, Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia report some of the lowest UFO sightings per capita. While Texas has a relatively high total of 6,517 sightings, its large population means UFO encounters are less common, 21.7 sightings per 100,000 people. Louisiana and Georgia follow closely behind, with 25.9 and 26.3 sightings per 100,000, respectively.

Massachusetts, Vermont, and Oregon stand out as some of the most UFO-curious states. Massachusetts leads the way with around 6,600 monthly searches for UFO phenomena, averaging 94 per 100,000 people. Vermont follows with 91 searches per 100,000, and Oregon rounds out the top three with roughly 84 searches per 100,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Our sister died because of our mum's cancer conspiracy theories, say brothers","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crenzwyvpn1o","Mon, 23 Jun 2025 05:00:05 GMT","

Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani watched with concern as their mother Kate rose to notoriety during the pandemic, eventually getting struck off as a nurse for promoting misinformation about Covid-19.

Then, their sister Paloma was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors told her she had a high chance of survival with chemotherapy. But in 2024, seven months later, she died - having refused the treatment.

The brothers blame their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories for Paloma's death at 23 - as cancer doctors tell BBC Panorama these beliefs are becoming more mainstream.

Kate Shemirani has not responded directly to the allegations we raised, but she has publicly blamed the NHS for her daughter's death.

She and her ex-husband, Paloma's father Faramarz Shemirani, wrote to us saying they have evidence ""Paloma died as a result of medical interventions given without confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent"". The BBC has seen no evidence to substantiate these claims.

Paloma's elder brother Sebastian says: ""My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have.""

Both brothers say they contacted me about Paloma in the hope they could prevent other deaths, and they believe social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation - which the BBC has found is being actively recommended on several major sites.

""I wasn't able to stop my sister from dying. But it would mean the world to me if I could make it that she wasn't just another in a long line of people that die in this way,"" says Gabriel.

For Panorama and BBC Radio 4's Marianna in Conspiracyland 2 podcast, I pieced together how this young Cambridge graduate came to refuse treatment that might have saved her life, following an online trail and interviewing people close to her.

And I found that conspiracy theory influencers such as Kate Shemirani are sharing once-fringe anti-medicine views to millions - which can leave vulnerable people at risk of serious harm.

It is getting harder to fight medical misinformation because of the prominence of figures such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, who have previously expressed unscientific views - says oncologist Dr Tom Roques, vice-president of the Royal College of Radiologists, which also represents cancer specialists.

When you have a US health and human services secretary ""who actively promotes views like the link between vaccines and autism that have been debunked years ago, then that makes it much easier for other people to peddle false views,"" he says.

""I think the risk is that more harmful alternative treatments are getting more mainstream. That may do people more active harm.""

Since becoming Health and Human Services Secretary, Mr Kennedy has said he is not anti-vaccine, and that he just supports more safety tests.

Paloma and her twin Gabriel, along with Sebastian and their younger sister, grew up in the small Sussex town of Uckfield, where they were exposed to conspiracy theories at home, her brothers say.

The ""soundtrack"" to their school runs, Gabriel says, was conspiracy theorist Alex Jones talking about how the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged or 9/11 ""was an inside job"".

The brothers say it was their father who first got into conspiracy theories, which piqued their mother's interest. The children absorbed outlandish ideas, including that the Royal Family were shape-shifting lizards, says Gabriel. ""As a young child, you trust your parents. So you see that as a truth,"" he says.

Sebastian believes their mum used her ideas as a way of controlling them. On one occasion, Kate Shemirani decided wi-fi was dangerous and switched it off at home, he says, ignoring his pleas that he had to submit GCSE coursework. ""That only fed the joy that she had for using her irrational system of beliefs to control me,"" he says.

According to her sons, Kate Shemirani's anti-medicine views were accelerated in 2012, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Even though she had the tumour removed through surgery, she credits alternative therapies for her recovery and says online how she used a programme including juices and coffee enemas to become ""cancer-free"". She doesn't use the word cured.

Paloma absorbed some of these ideas, says Chantelle, one of her best friends from school. ""Paloma spoke about her mum curing herself, and she believed sunscreen could cause cancer. I remember she used to get burned so badly at school,"" she says.

After their parents split up, Gabriel and Sebastian became estranged from their mother. But Paloma maintained contact with her, even when she went off to study at Cambridge in 2019.

""Paloma's strategy was to appease, to be sweet, to try and win the love that she hadn't been granted earlier,"" says Sebastian.

Messages Paloma shared with her then-boyfriend Ander Harris - and which he has shared with the BBC - reveal a relationship with her mother that had moments of love and care, but also times when Paloma saw it as toxic and abusive.

Over Christmas 2022, she told Ander her mother was blaming her for other children not coming home for Christmas. ""I'm so so so sick of being abused"", she wrote, suggesting with an expletive that this treatment happened all the time.

Her mother kept coming into her room and ""being mean"", Paloma said in one message, adding that her mother had hit her. Paloma left for a friend's house. She later shared her parting message to her mother with Ander, saying it was ""the last straw. You hurt me every time I let you in and I never ever will again. I'm beyond hurt"".

Back at university, Paloma seemed to be moving away from her mother's beliefs at times. Chantelle says she began eating meat and using fluoride toothpaste. But both Chantelle and Ander say she remained sceptical about the Covid-19 vaccine and refused to have it.

In late 2023, not long after graduating, Paloma began to have chest pains and breathing difficulties. She went to the hospital.

Doctors suspected a tumour, but Ander says he and Paloma, ""one of the smartest people I've ever met"", were hopeful at first that it would turn out not to be malignant. Paloma made light of it, nicknaming the tumour ""Maria the Lung Mass"", he says.

But on 22 December, Paloma and Ander went to Maidstone Hospital where doctors gave her the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Untreated, this type of cancer can be fatal, but doctors told Paloma she had an 80% chance of recovery if she had chemotherapy.

Paloma told her mother the news. Ander says Paloma still wanted her support, even though their relationship had recently been through a rough patch. Kate Shemirani said she would come to the hospital. Paloma was worried about seeing her, though, and spoke to medical staff about her concerns, her then-boyfriend says.

Evidence seen by the BBC suggests Paloma's thinking could have been influenced by her mother during the two days she was an inpatient at Maidstone Hospital.

Kate Shemirani texted Ander to say: ""TELL PALOMA NOT TO SIGN [OR] VERBALLY CONSENT TO CHEMO OR ANY TREATMENT.""

Ander and his own mother, who was also there, raised concerns with hospital staff about Kate Shemirani's beliefs and her relationship with Paloma.

Medical staff discussed safeguarding concerns about Paloma among themselves and wrote that they had ""a concern regarding parental influence"" on her. But they also thought that she did have the capacity to make her own decisions.

For advice, Paloma reached out to a former partner of Kate Shemirani called Patrick Vickers. Paloma had a good relationship with him, Ander says. He is also an alternative health practitioner.

When Paloma asked him about the ""80% chance of cure"" the doctors had said chemotherapy would offer, Mr Vickers said that was ""exaggerated"". He encouraged her to start Gerson therapy and to maybe consider chemotherapy if her symptoms did not improve after six weeks.

Mr Vickers told us that any ""assertions that I played a role in her [Paloma's] death are legally inaccurate"". He also shared documents with the BBC in support of Gerson therapy.

Gerson therapy involves a strict plant-based diet, along with juices, supplements and coffee enemas. Some people claim - without scientific evidence - it can be used to treat a range of cancers.

Paloma was worried about the negative side effects of chemotherapy, Ander tells me, as it can cause fatigue, sickness, hair loss and affect fertility. Nursing staff spoke to Paloma about egg-freezing and wigs when she was diagnosed.

But the charity Cancer Research UK says Gerson therapy can also have severe side effects, including dehydration, inflammation of the bowel, and heart and lung problems.

At some point during the two days in hospital, Ander says, Paloma made up her mind. She decided not to pursue chemotherapy - at least for the time being - and would try Gerson therapy to start with.

On 23 December, Kate Shemirani sent Ander a voice note giving him instructions to drive Paloma to her house, saying she had arranged doctors for her. She suggested Paloma's time with a friend she wanted to see should be limited on Christmas Day - and said in the message that they could ""see her for maybe half an hour or whatever here, or they can do it on FaceTime"".

Ander says he felt he could not argue. Paloma ""was in fight or flight and really just wanted to be taken care of and, you know, not have to make the hard decisions"", he says. ""Her mum kind of swooped in and took advantage of that.""

Kate Shemirani promotes ideas which she recommended to her daughter to a wider public online. A former NHS nurse in the 1980s, she calls herself ""the Natural Nurse"" on social media.

On her website, she sells apricot kernels for their ""potential health benefits"" along with nutritional supplements, and offers information and advice.

She charges about £70 for an annual membership to her site, and charges patients - including those with cancer - £195 for a consultation and personalised 12-week programme.

On social media she posts videos promoting her products and sometimes criticises ""ill-informed people"" for treating cancer with chemotherapy, or ""pumping mustard gas into their veins"" as she characterises it.

When the Covid pandemic hit in 2020, Kate Shemirani was one of many conspiracy theory influencers who found a wider audience. Her beliefs appeared to have evolved from alternative health ideas to sprawling anti-establishment conspiracy theories.

She promoted the false ideas that the pandemic was a hoax, that vaccines were part of a plan to kill lots of people, and that doctors and nurses should be punished for their part in it all.

In 2021 a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel determined that Kate Shemirani should be struck off as a nurse for promoting misinformation about the pandemic. Several social media companies also suspended her profiles for promoting misinformation. ""She went into obscurity,"" says Sebastian.

But once Elon Musk bought X in 2022, lots of conspiracy theory accounts were reinstated, including Kate Shemirani's. She was also reinstated on Facebook and she joined TikTok.

Her audience has grown again - in the past six months she has had her content viewed more than four and a half million times across the major social media sites. I have found dozens of comments on X where she encourages people to get in touch, including those with cancer.

TikTok says it has now banned Kate Shemirani's account for violating medical misinformation policies. According to Meta, Instagram and Facebook do not allow harmful medical misinformation. X did not respond.

Paloma continued on Gerson therapy. Some of her friends noticed how she became more and more unwell.

On one video call, Chantelle says, Paloma said she had a new lump in her armpit, and her mother had told her it meant that the cancer was going out of her body. ""I knew she was really struggling,"" she says, adding that Paloma told her she had lost control of her bodily functions.

But she says Paloma also said she felt pressured by doctors and friends to reconsider her decision to pursue alternative therapies on their own. Chantelle says she did not agree with the alternative therapy either, but wanted to be there for her friend.

Paloma had mentioned other people trying to change her mind and discussed ""cutting them off"", Chantelle adds. ""I thought I don't want to be cut off especially when she's struggling like this.""

Over the months that they spoke on the phone, Chantelle says she noticed that Kate Shemirani was ""taking very good care of Paloma"". But she does not think Paloma would have made the same decisions without her mother.

""I don't think her ideology was strong enough to make those decisions is my personal belief. People have different opinions about these things, but I think her mum played a massive, massive role into it,"" Chantelle says.

In March 2024, Paloma ended her relationship with Ander. Other friends and family felt that Kate Shemirani was isolating Paloma from them.

Gabriel says he asked to meet Paloma not long after she was diagnosed but his sister said she could not go out because of the ""bad air"". Their mother had convinced her that the ""damp air"" would cause her to become more ill, he says.

Sebastian and Gabriel were so worried that Gabriel started a legal case. He was not arguing Paloma did not have capacity, but he wanted an assessment of the appropriate medical treatment for her.

But events overtook them and the case ended without a conclusion in July - because Paloma had died.

Gabriel only learned of his sister's death several days afterwards, in a phone call from their lawyer. He had to break the news to his brother. ""It's like being burnt alive and you feel the searing pain every time it comes out of your mouth,"" Gabriel says.

Sebastian says he blamed himself. ""I haven't come to terms with that at all,"" he says.

When Ander heard, ""I broke,"" he says. ""I was just, like, screaming and crying at the top of my lungs.""

Paloma had suffered a heart attack caused by her tumour. She was taken to hospital, but after several days, her life support was switched off.

An inquest is due to begin next month to establish the circumstances surrounding Paloma's death.

Kate Shemirani has promoted a range of unproven theories on social media and fringe political podcasts about how she believes Paloma was murdered by medical staff - and that this was followed by a cover up. The BBC has not seen evidence to support these claims.

Paloma's death was devastating for her family and loved ones. But for Sebastian and Gabriel, it is also a warning of the potential consequences for people who believe anti-medicine conspiracy theories like their mother's.

The ex-BBC and Sky journalist says he is ""responding positively"" to treatment and is ""feeling well"".

Chantelle began on a Royal Cornwall Hospital clinical trial and had the all-clear 18 months later.

Tim Strugnell, 76, says he feels as if his life has changed after taking part in clinical trials.

The Reverend Matthew Simpkins says the disease has not shown up on his last five scans.

David Young disappeared from Red Bluff in 2019

RED BLUFF, Calif. - The mystery surrounding the disappearance of David Young, a man from Red Bluff, continues to haunt his family. He vanished six years ago, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions.

Young's sister, Amber, remains hopeful as she searches for answers. ""I reached out to every single person I could think of who even knew who he was who had any connection with him in the last several years,"" she said. Amber thinks her brother might see this story and hopes it reaches him.

David Young disappeared in January 2019 at the age of 26. He left his sister's home on Orange Street in Red Bluff early one morning, taking only his cell phone. He sent Amber a final text message saying, ""we deserve better and goodbye.""

Amber believes Young, who was suffering from depression, became overwhelmed. ""Unfortunately, he has enough skill set if he wanted to just disappear for a while he could,"" she said.

Young, who used to work at Walmart, is well-known in the Red Bluff community. Amber describes him as tall and slender with beautiful blue eyes. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds.

""If he can see this, it doesn't matter how much time has passed or what's happened? I love you. We love you. We want you here with us no matter what,"" Amber said.

Last week marked David's 33rd birthday. Amber urges anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact the Red Bluff Police Department, hoping to bring her brother back home.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has unveiled a ""sneak peek"" of the first images taken with its powerful astronomy camera — and the results are stunning.

The exceptionally detailed images are peppered with multicolored stars and spiraling galaxies. In one photo, the observatory has captured two nebulae, filled with bright pink clouds of gas and dust.

The Rubin Observatory is a next-generation telescope equipped with the world's largest digital camera. These first preview images are a major milestone for the observatory, which will become fully operational later this year.

Representatives for the Rubin Observatory shared the stunning night-sky snaps on social media, ahead of an official presentation at 11 a.m. ET on Monday (June 23) via the Rubin Observatory's YouTube channel.

Observatory staff didn't reveal which parts of the night sky were captured in the preview images, and instead asked social media users to guess. Some users were quick to point out that the bright pink nebulae were the Trifid and Lagoon nebulae, located in the Sagittarius constellation around 9,000 light-years from Earth.

BBC News reported that one of the other images is of the Virgo cluster. This large cluster of galaxies has more than 1,000 members. In the Virgo cluster photo, two of its spiral galaxies are clearly visible as bright blue swirls.

Researchers plan to use the Rubin Observatory's massive camera to observe the universe from Earth in never-before-seen detail. Jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, the Rubin Observatory is located high in the Chilean Andes, on a mountain called Cerro Pachón.

Later this year, the Rubin Observatory will begin surveying the night sky as part of a 10-year mission. By capturing images around every 40 seconds, researchers will create a time-lapse of the visible universe across space and over time. When it's finished, the Rubin Observatory will have collected the largest optical astronomy dataset in history, according to the Rubin Observatory.

""This enormous, all-purpose dataset will bring the night sky to life, enabling scientists around the world to better understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy, create an inventory of the Solar System, map the Milky Way, explore the dynamic sky, and more,"" a representative from the observatory wrote on YouTube.

The Rubin Observatory's next-generation camera should help spot ""planet killer"" asteroids hiding in the sun's glare, and may also help settle the debate as to whether there's a ninth planet hiding in the outer solar system.

Germany is planning to lift core defense spending to 3.5% of gross domestic product over the next five years as part of a massive increase in government investment in the military.

The boost in defense outlays will help Germany meet the NATO alliance's new goal of committing at least 3.5% of GDP to defense, up from 2% currently. An additional 1.5% in military-related spending will be required to reach the 5% benchmark that US President Donald Trump has demanded — and which NATO members are set to back at this week's summit in The Hague.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In an interview with DW, Iran's ambassador to Germany, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi, reiterated Tehran's stance that its nuclear program is peaceful and rooted in national pride.

""Iran is not in favor of nuclear weapons at all,"" he said. 

However, he declined, when pressed, to clarify the purpose of Iran's stockpile of over 400kg of 60% enriched uranium, an amount that has drawn serious concern from the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA.

""Having enrichment material, uranium enrichment material doesn't mean nuclear weapons,"" he said. 

Nili Ahmadabadi condemned the US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as violations of international law and defended Iran's right to respond. 

The interview was conducted before Iran's latest strikes on the US airbase in Qatar.

The majority of Americans are concerned about a further escalation in the conflict with Iran, according to a new poll published by Reuters on Monday.

Some 84% of respondents said they were worried in general about the growing conflict while 79% said they were worried ""that Iran may target US civilians in response to the US airstrikes.""

The poll surveyed 1,139 US adults over three days, ending on Monday.

Only 32% of respondents said they supported a continuation of US bombing of Iran compared to 49% against. Among Republicans support was higher, reaching 62% in support of further strikes and 22% opposed.

The US military says there were no injuries or deaths resulting from Iran's attack on its Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

A US defense official said the base was attacked with short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles.

Earlier, Qatar's Defense Ministry said its air defenses had intercepted the missiles.

The US said it was continuing to monitor the situation.

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed French ""solidarity"" with Qatar following the Iranian strikes on the US Al Udeid air base.

He said in a post on X that he was in contact with Qatari authorities and other partners in the region.

""I call on all parties to exercise the utmost restraint, to de-escalate and to return to the negotiating table,"" he said.

""The spiral of chaos has to end.""

Airports in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have warned airline passengers of further delays after Iran's attack on the Al Udeid US military air base in Qatar.

Both countries closed their airspace and diverted planes during the attack.

Some of the world's largest international airlines, including Emirates, Qatar and Etihad, have been avoiding airspace over Iran, Iraq, and Israel since Israel first launched strikes. They have their hubs in Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi, respectively 

Airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have written on their websites that passengers may experience delays, cancellations, or diversions. 

Meanwhile, Doha International Airport said it was working ""with government stakeholders and airline partners to cater to passengers that have been impacted.""

French President Emmanuel Macron has said that the US strikes that hit several nuclear facilities in Iran over the weekend had ""no framework of legality,"" but said he supported efforts to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.

""There is no framework of legality in these strikes, even if France shares the objective not to see Iran acquire nuclear weapons,"" he told reporters during a press conference in Oslo alongside Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere.

He rejected calls for regime change in Iran, saying: ""I believe in the sovereignty of peoples and territorial integrity ... so I don't think we can take the place of a people to change its leaders.""

The French president also criticized Israel's strikes on Evin prison, saying they ""put the lives of Iranian and foreign civilians in danger.""

Two French citizens are currently being held in Evin prison. The French Foreign Ministry said they had not been harmed in the strikes.

After Iran said it had struck a US base in Qatar, other countries in the Persian Gulf region have begun closing their airspace.

Bahrain and Kuwait said they had temporarily closed their airspace as a precautionary measure.

Bahrain's Ministry of Transport said it was closely monitoring the situation while Kuwait's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it was suspending air traffic until further notice.

Qatar said it ""reserves the right to respond"" following Iran's attack on the US Al Udeid base.

""We affirm that the State of Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner proportional to the nature and scale of this blatant aggression,"" foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement.

The ministry described the strike as a ""a flagrant violation of Qatar's sovereignty, its airspace, and international law.""

Meanwhile, Qatar's Defense Ministry says its air defense systems successfully intercepted missiles targeting Al Udeid Air Base, and no casualties were reported.

Iran's strikes against US bases suggest that Iran is hoping for de-escalation, rather than escalation.

Iran said it had targeted the US base in Qatar because it was outside of urban areas. It also said it dropped the same number of bombs that had been dropped by US heavy bombers over Iran on early Sunday.

Reuters reported that Iran also gave Qatar advance warning of the attack, allowing it to close its airspace.

US news outlet Axios reported that US President Donald Trump's administration was aware of the threat in advance.

It remains to be seen how the US will respond to Iran's retaliation.

Qatar said that no casualties were reported from the strike.

As well as launching strikes against a major US air base in Qatar, Iran said it had fired missiles toward a US base in Iraq.

""The operation of Iranian missiles against American bases located in Qatar and in Iraq has begun, and is called 'Blessing of Victory',"" the official press agency IRNA said.

Iraqi media earlier reported that a state of maximum alert had been declared at the Ain al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq.

DW could not independently verify the report of an attack on the US base in Iraq and US officials reportedly denied such an attack took place.

Iran has confirmed that it launched missile strikes against the US's Al Udeid base in Qatar.

Iranian state-run news agency Tasnim cited the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying it had responded to the ""clear military aggression of the criminal regime of the United States of America.""

AFP and Reuters journalists reported hearing explosions over the Qatari capital Doha late on Monday.

The reports came amid fears of an Iranian attack on the US air base in the country in response to US attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities early on Sunday.

Axios reported, citing Israeli officials, that Iran had launched six missiles at the base.

US President Donald Trump dealt a heavy blow to Europe's hopes to be a meaningful actor in bids to end the conflict between Israel and Iran last week. 

First, he branded Europe's efforts irrelevant, then he ignored the EU's calls for de-escalation by bombing Iranian nuclear facilities. 

But Monday's apparent irrelevance was not inevitable.

A decade ago, Europe had a seat at the table. The so-called E3, France, Germany and the UK, were key players in negotiating the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal. China and Russia were involved, too, as permanent members of the UN Security Council. 

French and German ministers who gathered in Brussels with their EU counterparts on Monday stressed that they think Europe can have a role again.

""Europe has the experience and deep understanding necessary to open space for negotiations that would bring about strict oversight of Iran's destabilizing activities,"" France's Jean-Noel Barrot told reporters at the talks.

However, EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas would not discuss whether and when she and the E3 might hold fresh talks with their Iranian counterpart.

When asked how the bloc was pressuring the Americans to come to the table, she said, ""Via diplomacy, of course, via different channels— also talking to all the parties, [saying] that this escalation benefits no one.""

The primary victims of the conflict are civilians in Iran and Israel caught up in the crossfire and others fearing spillover in the region. But there is no doubt that Europe has skin in the game here, too. 

If Iran were to block the Strait of Hormuz, this could heavily impact European energy security. Kallas acknowledged the gravity of that scenario on Monday. The EU once relied on Russia for fossil fuel imports, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the bloc has been seeking out new partners, including in the Gulf.

If exports from that region can't reach Europe, that's bad news for the continent.

Diplomats in Brussels told DW they also fear a spike in oil prices could be a boon for Russia. Moscow has managed to replace its old European customers with other buyers, especially in Asia, and the concern here is that beefed-up oil revenues could help Russia further fund its war in Ukraine.

There are nuances to how EU leaders responded to the Israel-Iran conflict and the United States' role. 

EU Council chief Antonio Costa, a center-left politician from Portugal, said he was ""alarmed"" by the escalation after US strikes and stressed the impact on civilians. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who hails from Germany's center-right, centered her statement on Iran and pressure for the regime to engage in a ""credible diplomatic solution.""

But EU powers seem to be broadly on the same page on a few key points. They say Iran must never have a nuclear bomb and Russian President Vladimir Putin has no credibility as a potential broker given the war he is waging in Ukraine.

Now, Europe is under pressure to prove it has the credibility and clout to help shift the dial.

As Israeli airstrikes intensify and the US enters the war, Iranians are fleeing to safety, with thousands crossing into Turkey.

DW's Julia Hahn spoke to some in Kapikoy near the eastern Turkish city of Van — one of the main crossing points.

Iranian authorities have arrested an individual they accuse of spying for Israel in the city of Hamedan.

The state-run news agency Tasnim said that an individual had been determined to be from a European country, but it did not say which one.

The agency reported that the suspect had entered Iran on a tourist visa. It also said they had been gathering information on Iran's missile systems.

Iran has arrested numerous people accused of spying for Israel, especially since Israel launched its barrage of strikes on the country just over a week ago.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"
