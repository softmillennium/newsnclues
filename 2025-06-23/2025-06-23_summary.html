The official said it's her responsibility to ensure “every person on this planet” recognizes the importance of Israel.

State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce has sparked condemnation after a reporter unearthed an interview in which she said the U.S. is the best country on Earth “next to Israel,” in yet another show of U.S. leaders' capitulation to Israel under a president who ran on the slogan “America First.”

“In the greatest country on Earth, next to Israel, it's an honor to be able to make a difference,” Bruce told Israeli outlet i24NEWS in an interview, smiling. “Next to,” notably, is a phrase meaning adjacent to or immediately following.

The interview occurred in May, but the clip spread across social media on Sunday after it was posted by independent journalist Ken Klippenstein on X.

The statement is remarkable coming from the top spokesperson for the department responsible for conducting foreign affairs. 

In response to the clip circulating online, Bruce told Newsweek that people were taking the comment out of context. “My work obviously speaks for itself, which is a reflection of my love for the United States, as I said in that interview, the greatest country on Earth. The assertion by certain anonymous users online is a typically out-of-context and absurd effort to create fake news for clicks and to smear,” she said.

It's absurd for a spokesperson for one of the most powerful agencies in the world to complain about their comments being misconstrued, especially when social media posts have been directly quoting her.

The clip was posted with context by Klippenstein. The context surrounding Bruce's comment doesn't change its nature at all, with the remark coming in response to a question about her professional background as a conservative writer and Fox News correspondent.

Other comments made during the interview, in fact, even further demonstrate where her and the administration's priorities lie. Speaking about and defending Israel is “the easiest thing in the world for me,” she said, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio feeling “very passionately” about the genocidal state.

“We have an obligation and a duty to make sure that people understand why Israel matters, why the Jewish people matter and why it is the responsibility of every person on this planet to recognize that,” Bruce went on.

Other actions taken by the Trump administration have shown the U.S.'s alliance to Israel over the American public. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemingly swayed Trump's opinions on U.S. involvement in the Middle East massively, with Trump changing his tune on war with Iran in recent months, reports have said — leaving some commentators asking about whatever happened to “America First.”

War with Iran is extremely unpopular among the American public. Polling conducted around the time Israel launched its latest round of unprovoked strikes on Iran on June 13 found that 60 percent of Americans oppose U.S. involvement, with just 16 percent saying they support it. Majority opposition was seen across all party affiliations, with 53 percent of Republicans also opposing war.

War with Iran may prove extremely costly — at a time when the Trump administration is threatening to cut welfare benefits for tens of millions of Americans under the guise of saving money. 

Israel is already estimated to be spending billions of dollars on the war. The cost to the U.S. is multiplied, and includes the costs of the U.S.'s equipment and bombs in airstrikes, the cost of the military helping Israel to shoot down Iranian attacks and the U.S.'s tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.

Truthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

We rely on your support to publish movement journalism — in fact, we're almost entirely funded by readers like you. Yet, donations are down at this moment of crisis. We may end this month in the red without additional help, so we've launched a fundraiser.

We have 3 days to hit our $28,000 goal. Please contribute a tax-deductible gift to Truthout at this critical moment.

Man got stuck near the flue of the chimney in a parks building after doors automatically locked for the night

Firefighters had to rescue a man who got stuck in the chimney of a Connecticut parks building while trying to retrieve his dog from a bathroom when the doors automatically locked for the night.

Police were called Sunday morning to Rockwell Park in Bristol for a burglary complaint and were told by parks employees that someone was in the chimney. Firefighters responded to the scene and got the man out after having to remove parts of the chimney and building, causing $5,000 to $10,000 worth of damage, police said.

The Bristol man, who was not injured, was arrested and charged with burglary, trespassing and criminal mischief. He was released on bond and ordered to appear in court on 7 July.

The man got stuck near the flue of the chimney of Mrs Rockwell's Pavilion, a building named after a benefactor of the park. Locks on the doors to the bathrooms are on new timers and automatically lock at 10pm every night, said Erica Benoit, community engagement coordinator for Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services.

It is not clear how the dog got stuck in the bathroom or how long the man was in the chimney. The doors can be opened from the inside after they are locked for the night.

The dog was unharmed, police said.

“It is a bit of a crazy scenario,” Benoit said. “If he had just contacted police in the first place, we might have been able to avoid the situation.”

Iran said it had fired missiles at a US military base in Iraq, Iranian state media Tasnim reported. The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter.

Walking through Providence, Rhode Island, it's hard to miss the flyers posted on storefronts, bulletin boards, and lamp posts rallying passersby with a defiant call to action: Let's Fight Trump's Fascism! Defend Our Communities! Build a Better World! Come to the Providence General Assembly.

For months, popular assemblies such as these — in Providence, Detroit, and Richmond, Virginia — have been diligently laying the groundwork for resisting Trump's agenda and building self-governance. In Providence, organizers with the General Assembly tabled at last weekend's No Kings demonstration, which drew thousands. Some members help operate a hotline for reporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sightings, a key part of deportation defense efforts that helps alert communities to raids, and makes large-scale, coordinated responses — like those in Los Angeles — more likely to materialize.

But what is a popular assembly, exactly? In Providence, assemblies have been held every other Saturday in a downtown Methodist church since November of last year. These gatherings offer a space for anti-fascist and progressive forces to coordinate, strategize, and make decisions together to build power that can be leveraged against the U.S. government. “We need regularly scheduled radically-democratic meetings to organize, coordinate, mobilize in active defense of our friends, neighbors, and loved ones,” the Providence General Assembly (PGA) writes in its mission statement, “and to fight to create the type of communities and world we want through our collective actions.”

The assemblies are open to all. At a Providence assembly attended by Truthout in March, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming for newcomers. Attendees were greeted at the door by PGA organizers and directed to a table stocked with name tags, free masks, snacks, printed meeting agendas, and informational pamphlets. Community agreements — posted on the wall in both English and Spanish — encouraged participants to stay curious, open, and respectful, and to give and receive feedback with honesty and compassion.

To open the meeting, two facilitators welcomed the semicircle of about 75 people, guiding them through a preset agenda crafted by the Providence General Assembly's coordinating committee, a group open to anyone who's attended at least one gathering. Voices from across the room spoke up during the announcement period and open forum, with attendees raising hands to share updates, concerns, or reflections. Five working groups — Mutual Aid, Community Defense, Unhoused Solidarity, Class Struggle, and Anti-Imperialism — briefly summarized their recent efforts in report-backs. Mutual Aid was organizing a mental health free clinic, cooked free meals for the public every weekend, and was involved in starting a community garden at a local school. Anti-Imperialism was collaborating with Jewish Voice for Peace Rhode Island's campaign to divest from Israel bonds. Community Defense publicized the ICE Watch Defense Line and an upcoming demonstration at ICE headquarters. 

The meeting culminated with a proposal to organize a family-friendly May Day demonstration. Several members had brought forward this proposal through the PGA's formal decision-making process, which asks sponsors to submit proposals 24 hours in advance of the assembly and introduce them formally during the meeting, where it is then debated and discussed, and finally voted on. Proposals must win the support of at least two-thirds of assembly attendees to be adopted/passed.

A lively 20-minute discussion of the May Day demonstration followed, with time set aside for clarifying questions, suggested amendments, and objections. Some attendees weighed the benefits and drawbacks of securing a city permit, while others questioned the strategy of protesting in front of vacant buildings. One participant voiced concern about whether there was enough time to pull the event together. “We'll try our darndest!” a sponsor responded with a grin. Another sponsor invoked the memory of Providence's 2006 May Day demonstration, which had drawn hundreds of immigrant workers into the streets. They noted that the PGA was the most broad-based, nonsectarian organizing space seen in Providence in years. In the end, with no major objections and energy high in the room, the proposal passed easily — clearing the required two-thirds majority and sparking a round of applause and celebratory cheers.

Similar people's assemblies that have taken root in cities like Detroit, Michigan, and Richmond, Virginia, signal the rise of a national movement for self-governance in response to growing authoritarianism in the United States. 

Hundreds joined the first People's Assembly in Detroit on January 26, rallying around one clear and urgent goal. “We have a solid stance against ICE, that is the bottom line,” said Ame, a Detroit-based organizer who helped launch the initiative and withheld their last name because of privacy concerns. To put this stance into action, the assembly formed several working groups to support immigrant Detroiters in different ways.

The mutual aid group operates a hotline connecting residents with legal and material support, and offers weekly immigration office hours to provide legal education and assist with paperwork.

The political education group organizes events and actions, including know your rights training and public demonstrations.

Meanwhile, a third working group called Migra Watch patrols local neighborhoods and attends court hearings, monitoring ICE activity on the ground. When they witness an arrest, they try to collect the individuals' contact information in order to alert their families and help secure legal support.

“We want to make sure that ICE and all the agencies working with them know they're not welcome here,” Ame said. “We're not going to allow people to just be kidnapped and taken away, to have our communities ripped apart and destroyed.”

Most recently, the People's Assembly in Detroit has begun training local businesses on how to respond to ICE raids. On June 11, assembly organizers rallied outside of the McNamara Federal Building in downtown Detroit after several asylum seekers were detained following their court hearings due to expanded “expedited removal” policies. On June 8, assembly organizers attended a Detroit Public School's Community District Board meeting to demand that the board take a stand in support of Maykol, a student who was detained by ICE. “Maykol was 3.5 credits away from graduating,” said Ame. “The board made the statement, but he still got detained so we've been fundraising, noticing that people who have lawyers are less likely to get deported.”

Assemblies in Richmond have conducted visualizations and thought experiments about what large-scale self-governance could look like.

Across the board, the assemblies are committed to building people's power beyond the confines of the electoral system. A spokesperson for the Richmond People's Assembly, who goes by the moniker Ezra, explained that while voting and electoral strategies can sometimes lead to short-term improvements, they ultimately disempower communities by transferring power to officials who rarely bear the consequences of the policies they impose. The assembly hopes to return that decision-making power to the people who have to live with the outcomes of those decisions.

To pursue these goals, Richmond held its first citywide assembly on January 18, drawing a crowd of more than 500 people. During that initial gathering, a group of organizers introduced a proposal to create neighborhood-based assemblies. The proposal passed, and nine neighborhood assemblies have formed across the city in the months since. Since then, they've organized community CPR classes, “swap parties” with free clothing and other goods, community discussions with potlucks, block parties, and more.

“We wanted people to be able to address hyperlocal problems,” Ezra explained when asked about the neighborhood-based strategy. “We felt like we couldn't start at the citywide level without it just becoming an organization of organizers.” The goal is to engage residents who aren't already politically active — to avoid replicating the racial, class, and age conformity that can sometimes characterize grassroots organizing efforts. One neighborhood assembly is loosely connected to a squatted community garden that's drawn a diverse crowd — something Ezra sees as a meaningful step toward building broader solidarity. Still, they admitted that the strategy is a work in progress for the relatively short-lived experiment. “[The assemblies are] definitely still mostly folks who are already in organizing circles,” they said, “and that's something we're actively trying to push past.” 

Organizers with Detroit's assembly also promoted the strategy of supporting neighborhood assemblies in a piece they wrote for Left Voice, highlighting the need to support workers and community members at sites where ICE raids happen, like schools and hospitals (as opposed to solely forming “roaming squads” that may be disconnected from impacted communities). 

In Richmond, organizing efforts also extend beyond the neighborhood level by hosting quarterly city-wide gatherings, which offer workshops, informal socializing, and shared meals in addition to an assembly. “That flow of energy from a meeting setting into these more open forum workshops was really appealing to people,” Ezra reflected. “It's what helped folks stay engaged through what was nearly a 10-hour day.” 

At the heart of these gatherings is the assembly component, which links Richmond's nine neighborhood assemblies through a spokescouncil. Each neighborhood sends two spokespeople — not to make decisions on behalf of their group, but to communicate important information and report their group's interests to the wider assembly. This structure is designed to keep power decentralized by preventing a person or small group from wielding a disproportionate amount of influence over others. 

This spokescouncil model, Ezra explained, draws inspiration from international examples of direct democracy — most notably Rojava, a multiethnic, feminist movement involving more than 4 million people in North and East Syria. In Rojava, most neighborhoods host at least one “commune,” a form of popular assembly that functions as both a decision-making space and a hub for coordination. These communes manage society's core needs through dedicated committees for self-defense, food, water, education, electricity, heating oil, health, and garbage collection. Each commune is led by two co-presidents, one male and one female, who convene in regional assemblies. Similarly, every committee is represented by co-spokespeople who meet with their counterparts across the region, forming a federated structure of grassroots governance.

In Syria, years of grassroots organizing — door-knocking and deep conversations with neighbors about their shared struggles — helped build up social acceptance for revolutionary ideologies among the Kurdish population. So when many of Assad's forces withdrew from North and East Syria in 2012, amid the chaos of the Syrian Civil War, communities were ready to self-organize. Masses of people stepped in to fill the power vacuum to build a new, participatory form of governance. 

Without access to formal municipal power as in Rojava, assemblies in Richmond have conducted visualizations and thought experiments about what large-scale self-governance could look like. At the citywide gathering in April, the assembly used a recent water crisis in the city as a springboard for discussing current power structures in Richmond, and to imagine what it would take to build infrastructure capable of managing water for hundreds of thousands of people.

Turning such ambitious visions into reality requires scaling up our movements. For Ezra, the movement's ability to grow and generalize hinges on recognizing how organizational structures (or the lack of them) influence the quality and scope of our relationships. “People often say that this is relational work, and that is true, but it is only true so far as your relationships are in community, are in dialogue with structure,” they said. “There is a dialectic between relationship and structure that allows for organization. When we lean too far into either end, we will pigeonhole ourselves into either subcultural party scenes, or into a very rigid form of politics that never steps into the real world.” 

At a late-March assembly in Providence, participants similarly grappled with the dual challenge of building meaningful relationships while resisting the pull of subcultural insularity. A proposal to form a social committee for organizing and promoting nonpolitical events was ultimately voted down after a thoughtful and good-faith debate. While many assembly-goers agreed on the importance of building connections, they emphasized that relationships would develop organically within the working groups themselves and through shared struggle approached with sincerity, curiosity, and joy. 

That spirit came to life a month later during the May Day demonstration, when a crowd gathered together to gleefully thwack effigies of President Donald Trump and a Tesla Cybertruck. It was a collective and cathartic act symbolizing a vision shared by all three assemblies: the dismantling of oppressive systems and the creation of liberatory structures in their place, of a world where people live without the constant fear of displacement, deportation, and state violence

International Atomic Energy Agency head says no one in a position to fully assess damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities

 Live coverage: Iran's Fordow nuclear site hit again, state media says

Donald Trump has doubled down on claims “monumental damage” had been done to Iran's nuclear sites, as the head of the UN's nuclear agency said that while he anticipated “very significant damage” at the underground Fordow site, the agency had not been able to assess it.

Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, confirmed that Iran had told the agency it had planned to take “special measures” to protect equipment and nuclear materials on 13 June.

Trump, who has a reputation for hyperbole, again stated that the sites had been “obliterated” by this weekend's US bombings, in contrast with the more cautious language from the Pentagon and Israeli officials.

“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images,” he said in a social media post. “Obliteration is an accurate term!” Pentagon officials have characterised the damage to the sites – at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan – as “severe”.

Assessing the extent of the damage has been complicated by the fact that the US, Israel and the IAEA only have access to surface satellite imagery of the sites and reporting from Iran's nuclear agency on any contamination.

Satellite imagery of Fordow taken in the days before the US attack showed an unusual volume of truck traffic. The images appeared to confirm that Iranian authorities had preemptively removed some material from the site, possibly including its uranium stockpile – or parts of it.

On Monday, Israeli jets struck Fordow in order to obstruct its access routes, the IDF said.

According to briefings from unnamed US and Israeli officials to American and Israeli media, Fordow had been heavily damaged but not destroyed. A senior US official told the New York Times the site had been taken “off the table” but that even 12 bunker-busting bombs could not destroy it.

Speaking in Vienna, Grossi said that given the “explosive payload utilised and the extreme vibration sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred.”

He added, however, that “at this time, no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to have fully assessed the underground damage.” Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had earlier said Tehran was still “calculating the damage”.

Grossi also called for agency inspectors to be allowed to return to Iran's nuclear sites in an effort to “account for” Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpiles and a “return to the negotiating table”.

Whether or not Iran had managed to remove technology and uranium from the attacked sites is likely to be a key question in the coming days and weeks.

“We are going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel and that's one of the things that we're going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” the US vice-president, JD Vance, told ABC's This Week on Sunday, referring to the stockpile of uranium theoretically sufficient to make nine or 10 atomic weapons.

Satellite images released by several imaging companies in the immediate aftermath of the US strikes suggested changes to the above ground topography of the Fordow site, which is buried beneath layers of sedimentary rock in the Zagros mountains.

Other images showed what appeared to be two distinct clusters of holes in a ridge at the site, caused by the entry of the dozen bunker-busting Massive Ordinance Penetrators dropped by US B2 Spirit stealth bombers.

According to Joseph Rodgers, deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Project on Nuclear Issues, the US bunker busters appeared to have targeted ventilation shafts at the Fordow facility.

“The reason that you'd want to target a ventilation shaft is that it's a more direct route to the core components of the underground facility,” Rodgers told Wired magazine.

Among those so far sceptical about the impact of the US strikes was Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, who tracks Iran's nuclear facilities.

“At the end of the day there are some really important things that haven't been hit. If this ends here, it's a really incomplete strike,” Lewis told NPR, echoing other experts who pointed to Iran's continued retention of enriched uranium as the key issue.

In a lengthy thread on social media, Lewis expanded his point: “This means Iran has retained 400kg [of 60% highly enriched uranium], the ability to manufacture centrifuges, and one, possibly two underground enrichment sites.

“That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA's calculation, although Iran insists it does not seek nuclear weapons.”

“That is also to say nothing of possible secret sites, which opponents of the JCPOA [the Iran nuclear deal Trump pulled out of] used to invoke all the freaking time,” Lewis said.

“If the strike leaves the current regime, or something very much like it, in power with a nuclear option then it will have been a strategic failure. What does it say when two of the most amazing military operations in modern memory are still unable to fully eliminate Iran's nuclear programme? I think that's proof that this is tactical brilliance […] may be in service of a foolhardy strategy.”

Abortion rights supporters say that it would protect telehealth providers as states increase efforts to target them.

Out-of-state doctors are pushing for laws that will make it harder to detect who prescribes and sends abortion medication, as anti-abortion lawmakers look for ways to stop the flow of pills to their states. 

Patients have continued to receive abortion pills in states with near-total bans, so much so that the number of abortions has actually increased since the fall of Roe v. Wade, despite near-total abortion bans. This is mostly thanks to “shield laws.” Working from states like New York, California and Massachusetts, providers meet virtually with pregnant patients in states with bans and write them abortion pill prescriptions. Patients receive the pills in the mail to take from home. One in 5 abortions are now done through telehealth, according to the Society of Family Planning, and about half of those are for people getting care because of shield laws. 

Now, doctors are working to anonymize that process by pushing to hide the name of the prescriber from the labels of mifepristone and misoprostol — the two drugs used in medication abortions. The effort marks a new step in the escalating battle between states over whether and how people in America can get abortions — and to what extent individual states' laws can influence medical care coming from another.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“We are seeing two very different worlds right now in the United States in terms of the directions of laws and policies,” said Dr. Angel Foster, who provides telehealth abortions from Massachusetts to people in states with bans. “Shield law states are doing more to not only protect reproductive rights within their own state, but to protect avenues for all abortion seekers in the country to be able to get safe and legal care.”

Typically, prescription bottles include information such as the name of the doctor who prescribed medication, details about the medication and appropriate dosage, and the name of the patient receiving medication. But that information has become invaluable in civil and criminal cases filed by anti-abortion law enforcement officers.

A handful of states — New York, Maine, Vermont and Washington — have already passed laws to remove prescriber names from abortion pill bottles. Proposed legislation in Massachusetts, currently working through the state Senate, would similarly allow this change, although at least one shield law practice in the state, Foster's Massachusetts Medication Abortion Project, has already removed prescribing doctors' names from pill bottles citing guidance they received from the state attorney general. 

A proposal in California, the largest shield law state, would go a step further. The bill, currently making its way through the state Senate, would remove not only the name of the prescribing health care provider but also the patient receiving medication. Proponents say that could protect patients who are concerned about someone discovering they ordered abortion pills.

The legislative trend comes as abortion opponents are ramping up efforts to stop telehealth abortion. Both Texas and Louisiana's attorneys general have pushed criminal and civil cases targeting Dr. Margaret Carpenter, a New York-based physician who allegedly prescribed abortion pills to patients in those states. The cases pose a first test of shield laws and are likely to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.

The Texas suit against Carpenter was filed after a pregnant woman in the state developed bleeding and went to the hospital, according to court filings from the state. The filings assert that the “biological father of the unborn child” found medications that appeared to be prescribed by Carpenter.

“If an abusive partner were to find a package of abortion pills in the trash can, if it says Dr. XYZ, already you have someone to name in a lawsuit,” said Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has advised state lawmakers on crafting shield laws. “If it doesn't have it, it's a critical piece of information. How do you know who prescribed the pills?”

Separately, legislators in Texas unsuccessfully sought to end telehealth prescriptions with a bill, which died in the legislature, that would have allowed anyone to sue people who prescribe or send abortion pills to Texans for at least $100,000. Louisiana lawmakers are poised to pass legislation that would create similar punishment structures, allowing the “biological father,” his parents, or the parents of the pregnant person to file civil suits against out-of-state abortion providers. 

Abortion rights supporters say that removing the doctor's name from a prescription label would add security for those who rely on shield laws but are nervous about heightened efforts to target providers, a concern that has only grown since this weekend's shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses. News outlets have reported that the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter, had a list of alleged targets in his car that included abortion providers.

“It goes a long way in ensuring that providers are protected at a time when we've seen increased violence and animus toward abortion providers and reproductive health providers generally,” said Lizzie Hinkley, senior state legislative counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which worked to help pass such a bill in New York. “Anyone who has their name on a pill bottle will risk detection by hostile parties in states that have banned abortion.”

One California doctor who practices with telehealth practice A Safe Choice said he deliberately keeps a low profile. Only a few close friends know about his work providing abortions to people out-of-state. But through his organization, he hears almost once a week from other health care professionals who want to offer telehealth abortions to patients living under bans. He believes a bill like California's could encourage even more to do so.

“Allowing the provision of services without the providers needing to put their name on the prescription labels will add an additional layer of security and confidence for the providers,” said the doctor, who asked that his name be withheld because of the ongoing legal threats against abortion providers. “This is a very important next step.”

The California bill could have an outsized impact. Most shield law prescriptions are filled by California-based pharmacies. That includes those called in by doctors who are practicing in other states, such as New York, but who don't want to mail the pills themselves.

“There is no pharmacy in New York state that mails pills for us, so we have to rely on pharmacies in California,” said one physician in New York, who asked that her name be withheld because of the legal actions taken against Carpenter. “All the shield law providers across the country are waiting with bated breath for this bill to be passed.” 

New York has passed a law removing prescriber names from abortion medication labels created in the state, she said, but that hasn't affected her. Because she calls prescriptions into a pharmacy in California the labels are subject to the Golden State's laws — and as a result, her name is still listed on the bottle when she orders abortion pills for out-of-state patients. Her patients live in states all over the country.

“It's very stressful. I wish we could get California to move a bit faster,” she said.

The California bill has been approved by the state's lower chamber but is still awaiting Senate passage. It's faced little resistance and has received support from the state's attorney general and lieutenant governor. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has built a public profile in part through vocal support of abortion protections, has not weighed in, and his office said he does not comment on pending legislation.

Still, there are legal questions about bills like California's. Federal law requires that medication labels include the prescriber's name — a stipulation that some argue could conflict with and possibly override the state-level protection. 

But these questions haven't been raised regarding other similar laws. Some legal scholars argued that the federal statute is ambiguous, and that pharmacies could say the state law still satisfies federal requirement by including the name of a medical practice — as New York's and Maine's do — rather than of an individual prescribing doctor or nurse.

“If you have the address and the practice and you're able to easily identify where the prescription came from, that's the purpose of this rule,” said Rachel Rebouché, dean of the Temple University School of Law. “The issue is being able to, for safety reasons and for monitoring, understand that someone who has the authority to do this has done it. There's no question that putting the name of the practice does that.”

The blue-state push comes as abortion opponents have stepped up their efforts not only in individual states, but in their quest for national restrictions on mifepristone, calling for the federal government to prohibit dispensing it through telehealth. 

That campaign has included building a body of research that they say highlights its potential risks — which runs against mainstream medical findings and that some researchers have said rely on “junk science.” 

While President Donald Trump has remained quiet on abortion, members of his administration have suggested openness to curbing access to medication. This month, Food and Drug Commissioner Marty Makary committed to having his agency review mifepristone's approval, though it's not clear what that would ultimately mean. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also said he supports taking another look at the drug's safety. 

“In light of the situation at the FDA, it is urgent to ensure that California clinicians and pharmacists can prescribe and deliver mifepristone to the patients who rely on us,” Dr. Kelly Pfeifer, a California-based doctor who also provides abortions in Kansas, said at a committee hearing for the state's bill. “This bill will allow us to continue to treat our patients even if politicians in Washington act against the science to further limit mifepristone.”

            Tesla's much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company's fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat.
    


            It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step.
    


            Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet.
    


            But the start of the Tesla service Sunday was only a fraction of any of that. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March.
    


            But the Austin test pressed on regardless.
    


            The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives' team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday.
    


            Ives' note to clients, which cited how a Tesla “safety monitor” sat in the front passenger seat while no person was in the driver's seat, praised the quality of the rides taken by his team member.
    


            “We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.”
    


            But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. In one YouTube video, the robotaxi drove on the wrong side of the road after it attempted and abandoned a left turn, only to continue traveling down the street on the opposite side of a double yellow line before making the left turn on the following block. Fortunately, there were no vehicles driving on the other side of the road.
    


            A separate YouTuber posted a video in which the robotaxi kept driving past its destination for several minutes as he tried to get it to pull over so he could get out.
    


            “Please exit safely,” a screen in the rear seat of the car said, as it continued driving down the road.
    


            All the rides on Sunday, no matter the distance, cost $4.20, a favorite number of Musk based on its association with marijuana.
    


            Musk reposted tweets on X from others who took rides on the initial day of service. Unsurprisingly, all the posts were positive. Musk and his fans have insisted the service will rapidly be expanded to other cities and will dramatically change the financial performance of Tesla.
    


            But the EV maker is playing a game of catch up. Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been providing paid rides since 2020, and now provides more than 250,000 rides a week to paying riders in Austin, Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco. It soon plans to expand the service to Atlanta, Miami and Washington, DC.
    


General Motors pulled the plug on its own self-driving car hailing service in December, citing the “considerable” resources needed and “an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.” It also had an accident in which one of its robotaxis in San Francisco hit a pedestrian and dragged the woman along the road for 20 feet. The woman had already been hit by a human-driven car before she was struck by GM's robotaxi. California authorities ordered the company to halt its operations in the state as a result.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated with additional details.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov on June 23 was formally named a suspect in a high-profile illegal land grab case, becoming the highest-ranking official in Ukrainian history to face such charges while in office.

After reports and public speculation around Chernyshov's potential involvement, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) released a statement announcing that he was the sixth suspect in a “large-scale” corruption scheme lead by a property developer from Kyiv who illegally claimed a land plot to build a residential complex. 

In a comment to the Kyiv Independent, Chernyshov denied the accusations against him. "I'm absolutely not involved in that (scheme). That's clear," he said. He also said he won't step down from his post."I will stay in this position," he said.Chernyshov, who heads the new National Unity Ministry in charge of returning refugees, is a close ally of President Volodymyr Zelensky. He raised eyebrows in Ukraine after leaving the country days before law enforcement revealed a massive corruption scheme and detained two of his former close associates — Maksym Horbatiuk and Vasyl Volodin. 

According to the anti-corruption agency, during his time as Development of Communities and Territories Minister in 2020-2022, Chernyshov and his associates undervalued land plots by five times to benefit the developer, which Ukrainian media identified as Serhii Kopystyra, which allegedly cost the state Hr 1 billion ($24 million).

In exchange, NABU says the developer gave kickbacks to Chernyshov and his accomplices with "significant" discounts on apartments in his existing buildings, totaling over Hr 14.5 million ($346,000). Ukrainian news site Ukrainska Pravda reports this took place between 2021-2022. 

NABU and Ukraine's Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) seized the plot to prevent the scheme. Most of the illegally obtained apartments have been seized. 

Chernyshov arrived back in the country on June 22 after suspicions mounted in Ukraine that he was on the run and avoiding detention. "I was definitely on a business trip and I was not escaping out of Ukraine," Chernyshov told the Kyiv Independent. "The rumors of me not returning is nothing but manipulation. I came exactly once my trip was over. I had a very intensive trip in Europe."

Chernyshov said he was targeted by a "smear campaign" but said he didn't know who could be behind it.Chernyshov said that he came back on his own accord and denied that anyone had asked him to return. 

He arrived at NABU offices on June 23, after the agency summoned him to be charged. Upon leaving the bureau, Chernyshov wrote on Facebook that he had a “constructive chat” with detectives and will cooperate with the organization. 

An investigation into Chernyshov and two of his associates took place last year after suspicions arose, according to Ukrainska Pravda, with the agency obtaining a warrant to search Chernyshov's home. However, sources in anti-corruption agencies told Ukrainska Pravda that the head of NABU, Semen Kryvonos, blocked police searches due to his close relationship with Chernyshov, who was his boss when Kryvonos headed the State Architecture Inspection, an agency that subordinated to Chernyshov's former ministry. 

The searches allegedly happened a few weeks ago, after a one-year delay, according to Ukrainska Pravda.Chernyshov said that while he knows Kryvonos in a professional setting, the two are not in contact. He added that the allegations against Horbatiuk and Volodin look "quite serious" but that it was for law enforcement to decide if their detention is justified. 

Chernyshov was appointed head of state-owned energy giant Naftogaz in 2022 after the dissolution of the Communities and Territories Development Ministry. He became the national unity minister in December 2024, a ministry created from scratch. 

He is widely believed to have a personal friendship with Zelensky. According to a report by Ukrainska Pravda, Chernyshov was among only a handful of guests invited to celebrate Zelensky's birthday during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 — and the only member of the Cabinet of Ministers in attendance.

U.S. President Donald Trump on June 23 called for urgent measures to prevent rising oil prices amid escalating tensions with Iran.

"Everyone, keep oil prices down. I'm watching," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "To the Department of Energy: Drill, baby, drill! And I mean now."

The post comes after global oil prices surged on June 13 following a series of Israeli air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The escalation sparked fears of broader conflict in the energy-rich Middle East, home to critical oil shipping routes. 

The surge in oil prices risks undermining Western attempts to curb Russia's war funding, as the Kremlin relies heavily on oil revenues to sustain its invasion of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that a price surge could further embolden the Kremlin. 

On June 21, the U.S. joined Israel in conducting airstrikes that targeted three nuclear facilities in Iran — Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. The operation triggered a strong response from Tehran, which threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a key global oil transit route.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance responded on June 22 that any Iranian attempt to shut the strategic waterway would "destroy their own economy." The strait is a vital chokepoint for global energy supplies, with nearly a fifth of the world's oil passing through it daily.

Amid the turmoil, the EU has reportedly postponed plans to tighten the $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian crude, originally imposed in December 2022. The mechanism restricts Western firms from shipping or insuring Russian oil sold above that threshold.

The Russian Finance Ministry has relied heavily on energy revenues to sustain defense spending, which hit record highs this year.

            The Supreme Court agreed Monday to take up the case of a Rastafarian man seeking to sue prison officials in Louisiana who cut off his dreadlocks while he was incarcerated.
    


            The case is the latest that involves religious rights to catch the high court's attention, and it could have significant implications by allowing prisoners to sue government officials for damages when their religious rights are burdened under a federal law enacted 25 years ago.
    


            Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian who began serving a five-month prison sentence in 2020 for drug possession, had taken a religious vow years earlier to not cut his locks.
    


            But his situation took a turn for the worse after arriving at a new prison weeks before his release. He handed officials a copy of an appeals court ruling from 2017 that allowed prisoners to have dreadlocks. The guards tossed it in the trash. They then handcuffed him to a chair and forcibly shaved his head.
    


            Following Landor's release, he sued Louisiana prison officials and guards for damages under a decades-old law that protects the religious interests of inmates. But lower courts dismissed his case, ruling that the law doesn't allow individuals to pursue damages against prison officials for alleged violations of it even though, in one court's view, he had been the victim of a “grave legal wrong.”

            The conservative New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision last year that it “emphatically” condemned “the treatment that Landor endured,” but an earlier appeals court precedent settled the case against him. The full 5th Circuit divided on whether to hear the case.
    


            President Bill Clinton signed the bipartisan law in 2000 that protects the religion interests of state prisoners but it's not clear whether that law allows people who were harmed to sue for money damages. The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that a similar law with nearly identical language allows people whose religious rights have been burdened to seek damages against government officials acting in their individual capacity.
    


            “Without a damages remedy,” lawyers for Landor told the justices in court papers, inmates “will often be left without meaningful protection for their religious exercise.”
    


            In other words, once Landor's head was shaved, the only way for him to have some legal remedy is through monetary damages.
    


            “The no-damages rule ensured that respondent officials would not be held accountable for violating the religious rights of a prisoner set for release in just three weeks and prevented him from obtaining any relief for the abuse he suffered,” his lawyers said.
    


            Attorneys for the Louisiana state officials urged the court to not take up the case, arguing among other things that Landor could bring his claims under state law. They also told the justices that permitting the lawsuit to move forward could hamper the state's ability to hire staff in its prisons.
    


            Siding with Landor, they told the court, “would almost certainly deepen the problem by driving down staffing levels and dissuading job applicants.”
    


            “That, in turn, inevitably would lead to worse prison conditions and perhaps lessened protections for religious liberty, as understaffed prisons attempt to survive the growing prison populations,” they added. “No one wins in that situation.”
    


            The Trump administration, meanwhile, had asked the justices to take up the matter. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court in May that the federal government has an interest “in ensuring that prisons or other institutions receiving federal funds do not substantially burden religious exercise, and damages liability is closely connected to that interest.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023 authorized the ordering of at least two attempts to assassinate Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Gordon, Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk told media on June 23,  RBC-Ukraine reports.

Gordon is a prominent journalist and media personality popular in both Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries, known for his sharp criticism of Russian aggression. His YouTube channel has 4.5 million subscribers. 

"Gordon triggers Russians. He has a large audience in Russia and in the (Russian) occupied territories (of Ukraine)," Maliuk said. "There are two networks that worked on Gordon that we can speak (publicly) about."

According to the SBU, the first network was led by a former lawmaker from the now-banned pro-Russian Party of Regions, originally from Poltava Oblast. The agency did not name the lawmaker. 

The former MP was allegedly tasked by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) with coordinating surveillance and preparations for a strike that would kill Gordon.

"The plan was to use a homemade explosive device or coordinate a missile or a drone strike — but only if Gordon's presence in the targeted house was confirmed," Maliuk said.

The SBU had already been investigating the ex-lawmaker for involvement in a separate railway bombing case in Poltava Oblast when the assassination plot was uncovered. The group was arrested before executing the plan.

The second assassination team, Maliuk said, was a criminal group from Dagestan working secretly for the FSB under the cover of being fugitives from Russian law enforcement.

"They sent this individual here long before the full-scale war. He carried out FSB tasks all the time — very professionally, very covertly," Maliuk said.

The group monitored Gordon's movements and residence, planning to assassinate him either with a short-barreled weapon if he was alone, or with a rifle and follow-up pistol shot if accompanied by a bodyguard.

The SBU detained the group, and its leader confessed to preparing the hit on Moscow's orders. He said he had been promised $400,000 for the killing.

Gordon, who has become a high-profile figure on Ukraine's information front, regularly uses his platform to expose Russian disinformation and advocate for Ukrainian sovereignty.

Russia launched a wave of missile and drone attacks on Kyiv and surrounding region overnight on June 23.

Ukraine has said the practice of passing off the bodies of  Russian soldiers as Ukrainian is part of an attempt to obscure the scale of its military losses from the Russian public.

Zelensky's visit comes just a few hours after yet another Russian attack on Kyiv, which killed at least seven.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and the true extent of the death toll is simply not known. 

The number includes 1,010 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.


"After the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, there was an uproar from Moscow," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia deployed 368 aerial weapons, including 352 attack drones, 11 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 5 Iskander-K cruise missiles, striking primarily Kyiv. Ukraine's air defenses destroyed 354 of them.

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov returned to Ukraine on June 22 following his official trip abroad amid media speculations connecting Chernyshov's absence to an ongoing corruption investigation.

President Zelensky is expected to address the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on June 26 during its summer session in Strasbourg, though his attendance has not been confirmed. The session agenda includes discussions on Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine.

Norway will invest $400 million in Ukraine's defense industry to support drone production, President Zelensky said on June 22. The two countries also agreed to jointly produce air defense missiles.



Ukrainian journalist Vladyslav Yesypenko was released on June 22 after more than four years in Russian imprisonment, and has left Russian-occupied Crimea.

Russia launched two Iskander-M or North Korean KN-23 ballistic missiles, an S-300 anti-aircraft missile, and 47 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, primarily targeting Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said on June 22 that Iran's nuclear program must be dismantled to prevent it from threatening the Middle East or the wider world, following U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

"Unfortunately, there are some dead and wounded," the statement read. The Ground Forces said that greater personnel losses were avoided thanks to the timely security measures taken when the air raid alert was issued.

            Zohran Mamdani could barely walk a few feet at a recent Juneteenth festival in Queens without a crowd of selfie-demanding admirers trying to stop him.
    


            Mamdani is a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist who's surged in the campaign for New York City mayor with a mix of viral videos and proposals appealing to younger progressives. He's capitalized on progressive frustration with Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor mounting a political comeback with a mayoral run; in one of his videos, he explains New York City's ranked-choice voting system in Hindi and Urdu and likens Cuomo to a Bollywood villain.
    


            Now running as Cuomo's top rival in Tuesday's primary, Mamdani's rise has also caused growing consternation from the Democratic establishment. His critics argue his platform is too far to the left for moderates and certain to be weaponized by local and national Republicans trying to paint the Democratic Party as out of touch. He's also faced criticism about how he's addressed the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            That concern was hard to find at Thursday's festival in Queens. Mamdani stood onstage awkwardly but joyfully two-stepping and swaying side to side next to other candidates in the primary. Then he walked through the park on a sweltering day, joking that he was fine in his wool suit because he had on an undershirt.
    


            “We've seen a campaign that is powered by the hunger of New Yorkers for a new generation of leadership,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Here's what to know about Mamdani and his campaign.
    


            Mamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who represents parts of Queens, one the most diverse areas in the nation.
    


            He is an immigrant from Uganda who was first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, and later in New York City, attending the prestigious Bronx High School of Science before enrolling at Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include “Mississippi Masala” and “Monsoon Wedding.”
    


            Prior to his mayoral campaign, Mamdani made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt. He also moonlighted as a rapper under the stage name Mr. Cardamom rapping about chapati, an Indian flatbread, and worked as foreclosure prevention counselor.
    


            If elected mayor, he would become one of the youngest people to ever hold the post. Mamdani would also become the first Muslim mayor in the history of the city — home to more than half a million Muslims and one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel.
    


            Mamdani wants to freeze the rent for nearly 1 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments and provide free city bus service, universal childcare and city-subsidized grocery stores.
    


            Mamdani has said he will pay for it all by raising taxes on the city's wealthiest, even though he would have little power to do so from City Hall. Taxes can be raised or lowered only by state lawmakers with approval from the governor. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has already thrown cold water on the proposal, saying the move is likely to drive more New Yorkers out of the concrete jungle and toward Florida and other lower-tax destinations.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has raised $7 million from thousands of individual donors and mobilized an army of volunteers. He secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the United Auto Workers union.
    


            “This race is not just symbolic about the future of New York City, this race is symbolic about the future of our country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during a campaign rally packed with more than 2,000 supporters last week. “For so long we have had political leadership, including in the Democratic Party, that has just wanted to play it safe.”
    


            Democratic establishment concern was laid out in a recent call held by Third Way, a national think tank that favors a centrist political agenda. The group released a memo last week, warning that a Mamdani's win would be “a devastating blow in the fight to defeat Trumpism.”
    


            “We're really worried about all Democrats going forward if Mamdani were to win,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs, told reporters during the call. “Even if he doesn't win the election, if he just wins the Democratic nomination, that can hurt Democrats.”
    


            Cuomo has made his long career in government and experience with President Donald Trump the cornerstones of his comeback run. He dismisses Mamdani as an inexperienced leader with unrealistic ideas and suggests Trump would run through Mamdani like “a hot knife through butter.”
    


            “He's never done any of the essentials. And now you have Donald Trump on top of all of that,” Cuomo said during a recent debate.
    


            Mamdani has responded by zeroing in on Cuomo's sexual harassment scandals, his reputation as a bully and his billionaire donors. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the misconduct allegations.
    


            “I've never had to resign in disgrace,” Mamdani said during one debate. “I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done these things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.”
    


            Cuomo and other rivals of Mamdani have called out how he's spoken about antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war.
    


            Mamdani has accused the Israeli government of carrying out a “genocide.” And he defended the use of the slogan “globalize the intifada” as a rallying cry for Palestinian human rights during an interview with The Bulwark.
    


            Mamdani said he believed the phrase was about “a desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,” explaining that the US Holocaust Museum used a similar Arabic word meaning “uprising” to describe the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis.
    


            “I have shared my opinions with New Yorkers over the course of this race, opinions that always come back to a belief in universal human rights, that means taking on antisemitism and Islamophobia,” Mamdani told CNN.
    


            Mamdani's campaign has proposed making an increase of 800% for the city's anti-hate crime program.
    


            Still, the criticism to those comments came fast and furious. Mamdani was condemned by the Holocaust Museum and some fellow Democrats for using a phrase they believe encourages violence against Jews.
    


            City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is running third behind Mamdani and has cross-endorsed him under the primary's ranked-choice system, said he preferred Mamdani avoid the term altogether.
    


            Mamdani's reaction was equally visceral. He became emotional and cried while speaking with reporters about the backlash, detailing the multiple threats and the near-constant harassing calls his office now receives on a daily basis.
    


            “It pains me to be painted as if I am somehow to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love that are such a key part of this city,” Mamdani said. “When I speak, when I speak with emotion I am characterized by rivals as being a monster. I get messages that say, ‘The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim.' I get threats on my life, on the people that I love.”
    


            He has also accused a pro-Cuomo PAC of designing a campaign mailer that featured his photo appearing to be altered to make his beard look darker and thicker next to text saying Mamdani “rejects Jewish rights.” The Cuomo campaign said it never sent out the mailer and it was made up by an independent vendor.
    


            Mamdani called the strikes ordered by Trump “a new, dark chapter in his endless series of betrayals.”
    


            “While Donald Trump bears immediate responsibility for this illegal escalation, these actions are the result of a political establishment that would rather spend trillions of dollars on weapons than lift millions out of poverty, launch endless wars while silencing calls for peace, and fearmonger about outsiders while billionaires hollow out our democracy from within,” he said in a statement.

The State Department has issued a “worldwide caution” for U.S. citizens living abroad in the wake of the escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, following U.S. intervention targeting Iran's nuclear sites.

“The conflict between Israel and Iran has resulted in disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East,” the bulletin stated, calling on U.S. citizens worldwide to exercise “increased caution.”

Advocates fear Senate's version of Trump's budget bill could leave millions without healthcare and boost corporations

Advocates are urging Senate Republicans to reject a proposal to cut billions from American healthcare to extend tax breaks that primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations.

The proposal would make historic cuts to Medicaid, the public health insurance program for low-income and disabled people that covers 71 million Americans, and is the Senate version of the “big beautiful bill” act, which contains most of Donald Trump's legislative agenda.

“With the text released earlier this week, somehow the Senate made the House's ‘big, bad budget bill' worse in many ways,” said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Families USA, a consumer healthcare advocacy group, in a press call.

The Senate's version makes deeper cuts to Medicaid and so-called Obamacare (Affordable Care Act) plans, “both by expanding paperwork requirements and making it harder for states to fund Medicaid coverage for their residents”, said Wright.

If passed, the House-passed bill would have already made the biggest cuts to Medicaid since the program's enactment in 1965. With red tape and an expiration of additional healthcare subsidies to Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the House version would leave 16 million people without health insurance by 2034.

CBO has not yet released estimates, or “scored”, the impact of the Senate proposal, but advocates and experts said the cuts are more draconian, “punish” states that expanded Medicaid, and attack Medicaid by going after its byzantine financing structures.

“If we look at the big picture of our healthcare system that's where the inefficiencies are – not in Medicaid – but in all the groups profiting off the system,” said David Machledt, a senior policy analyst at the National Health Law Program, referring to Republicans' assertions that they are targeting “waste, fraud and abuse” with cuts.

“What these cuts are going to do is look at the most cost-efficient program and squeeze it further, and take us backwards, and put us back at a system where the people at the low end are literally dying to fund these tax cuts for rich people and businesses.”

A recent study found that expanding Medicaid, as was done during the Obama administration, probably saved an additional 27,400 lives over a 12-year period, and did so cheaper than other insurance programs. The same study found that about a quarter of the difference in life expectancy between low- and high-income Americans is due to lack of health insurance.

Republicans, such as senator John Thune of South Dakota, argue that their bill “protects” Medicaid by “removing people who should not be on the rolls”, including working-age adults, legal and undocumented immigrants; by adding work requirements and by going after a tax maneuver states use to bring in more federal Medicaid funding.

“Removing these individuals is just basic, good governance,” said Thune.

But experts and advocates argue the cuts will not only remove the targeted individuals, including many who are working but struggle to get through red tape, but will also place states in impossible situations with potentially multibillion-dollar shortfalls in their budgets.

Both versions contain so-called work requirements, which analyses show will cause people to lose coverage even if they are eligible, experts said. Instead, the largest difference between the Senate and House versions of the bill is the Senate's attack on Medicaid's complex financing arrangements.

Medicaid is jointly financed by states and the federal government, making it simultaneously one of states' largest expenditures and sources of revenue. The Senate's version specifically attacks two ways states finance Medicaid, through provider taxes and state-directed payments.

With a provider tax, states bring in additional federal revenue by increasing payments to providers. Because the federal portion of Medicaid is based on a percentage rate, increasing payments to providers in turn increases the amount that federal officials pay the state. States then tax those same providers, such as hospitals, to bring the funding back to the state.

Although this maneuver has been criticized, it has also now been used for decades. It's in place in every state except for Alaska, is legal and openly discussed. The Senate bill caps this manuever by cutting the tax rate by about half, from 6% to 3.5%, according to Machledt.

In a 2024 analysis, the Congressional Research Service estimated that lowering the provider tax cap to 2.5% would effectively cut $241bn from Medicaid payments to states. Although the exact impacts of the Senate tax cap are not yet known, Machledt expects it would be in the billions, which states would then be under pressure to make up.

“We took great pains to close a $1.1bn shortfall caused by rising healthcare costs,” said the Colorado state treasurer, Dave Young, in a press call. “To protect healthcare and education, we had to cut transportation projects, maternal health programs and even $1m in aid to food banks.”

Because of taxing provisions in Colorado's state constitution, Young said: “It will be nearly impossible to raise taxes or borrow money to make up the difference.”

Similarly, the Senate bill goes after “state-directed payments”. To understand state-directed payments, it's helpful to understand a big picture, and often hidden, aspect of US healthcare – health insurance pays providers different rates for the same service.

Providers are almost universally paid the worst for treating patients who have Medicaid. Medicare pays roughly the cost of providing care, although many doctors and hospitals complain it is still too little. Commercial insurance pays doctors and hospitals most handsomely.

To encourage more providers to accept Medicaid, lawmakers in some states have chosen to pay providers treating Medicaid patients additional funds. In West Virginia, a federally approved plan allows the state to pay providers more for certain populations. In North Carolina, state-directed payments allow the state to pay hospitals rates equal to the average commercial insurance rate, if they agree to medical debt forgiveness provisions.

The first state-directed payment plan was approved in 2018, under the first Trump administration. These kinds of payments were criticized by the Government Accountability Office during the Biden administration.

However, the Senate bill goes after these rates by tying them to Medicaid expansion – a central tenet of Obamacare – and gives stricter limits to the 41 states that expanded the program. Doing this will effectively be “punishing them”, Machledt said, referring to states that participated in this key provision of Obamacare, “by limiting the way they can finance”.

Advocates also warned of unintended knock-on effects from such enormous disruption. Medical debt financing companies are already readying new pitches to hospitals. Even people who don't lose their insurance and are not insured through Medicaid could see prices increase.

When Medicaid is cut, hospital emergency rooms are still obliged to provide stabilizing care to patients, even if they can't pay. Hospitals must then make up that shortfall somewhere, and the only payers they can negotiate with are commercial: for example, the private health insurance most people in the US rely on.

“Folks who do not lose their health insurance will see increased costs,” said Leslie Frane, the executive vice-president of SEIU, a union that represents about 2 million members, including in healthcare. “Your copays are going to go up, your deductibles are going to go up, your bills are going to go up.”

Republicans hope to pass the bill by 4 July.

Department said message saying ‘our hearts go out to the victims and families impacted' by strikes was ‘offensive'

The Los Angeles county sheriff's department deleted and then apologized for posting a message expressing sympathy for “the victims and families impacted” by US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

The message, posted on X, Facebook and Instagram, said the sheriffs' “hearts go out” to Iranian “victims”. A swift online backlash followed, and the department then issued an apology that referred to its own original post as “offensive and inappropriate”.

According to a screenshot of the now-deleted post from KTLA, the post read: “Our hearts go out to the victims and families impacted by the recent bombings in Iran. While this tragic event occurred overseas, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is closely monitoring the situation alongside our local, state, and federal partners.”

The since-edited version excludes any mention of Iran, and instead says the department is monitoring “the situation overseas”. In its apology, the department said the original social media post was put up in error and did not reflect views of the chief sheriff, Robert Luna, or the department.

“As a law enforcement agency, we do not comment on foreign policy or military matters. Our mission remains solely focused on protecting public safety and serving our diverse communities,” the statement said. It added that it strengthen “social media oversight protocols”.

Los Angeles is home to a large population of Iranian Americans, numbering about 400,000, and had gained the nickname Tehrangeles. It is also home to the second largest Jewish population after New York, numbering about 500,000.

Politico noted last week that the war between Israel and Iran put the Iranian American population, many of whom fled Iran after the 1979 revolution, in a difficult situation. Many are opposed to the current Iranian government.

The introduction of the sheriff's department's thoughts on the issue may come as jarring for some. The department soon got back to more ordinary business with a message more focused on possible security risks because of the overseas conflict that the US is now militarily involved in.

“At the moment, there are no known threats to Los Angeles county. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are increasing patrol checks at places of worship and other sensitive locations throughout the county,” the sheriff's department said.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated as new details emerge.

Russia launched a mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 23, killing at least nine people and injuring 33 others, including four children, local officials reported.

Kyiv Independent journalists heard explosions and kamikaze drones flying overhead from around 1 a.m. Louder explosions from ballistic missiles were heard an hour later, with the attack lasting around 3.5 hours in total.

The heaviest damage occurred in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the city, when a five-story building partially collapsed after being hit by a ballistic missile, Ukraine's military reported. At least nine people died as a result, and more may be trapped under the rubble. 

An 11-year-old girl was confirmed as the ninth victim of the strike, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said. Her mother's body was recovered earlier from the rubble.

Student Veronika Sherinova, who lives in a nearby building, said she didn't sleep all night — first because she was hiding from the attack, then because the missile strike shattered the windows in her home and neighboring apartments.

"Most of my former classmates lived in this building (that was hit), most of my friends and acquaintances, too," she told the Kyiv Independent at the site of the strike. "We got dressed right away and went over."

"When my mom and I arrived, I saw them coming out in just their underwear, covered in blood, wounded. It was impossible to look at. It was pure shock. We were all in a state of shock."

At first, she just wanted to help clear the shattered glass and debris. But after seeing the extent of the destruction, Sherinova realized that some of the people she knew might not have survived the attack.

"The strike hit exactly the floors where our friends lived," she said. "Unfortunately, they didn't survive. My other friends did — they were on the first floor," she added, her eyes filling with tears.

"It was a miracle they came out without a single scratch. But the upper floors were just blown away, there wasn't even a chance for anyone up there to survive."

According to Sherinova, the Russian strike killed a family living on the upper floor — a father, mother, and grandfather — but their teenage son survived. 

"We suspected it right away, but we didn't want to believe it until the very end. But then we found out that they were the first ones they carried out," she said. "The boy is in shock right now; he doesn't realize what's happened. He's just not reacting at all."

She said her two other friends who lived in the building left for abroad immediately after the strike. 

"They went abroad — they took a bus and left right away."

State Emergency Service spokesperson Svitlana Vodolaha told journalists at the site that when rescuers arrived, they had been told only a few people would be affected there.

"As it turned out, the information we had was not reliable — there were more people here than we had been told. At this moment, we still don't have complete information on how many people might be trapped under the rubble," Vodolaha said. 

"That's why we'll keep working until the very end, until we're completely sure no one is left under the debris."

Shortly after their arrival, rescuers pulled 10 people from under the rubble, including two children and a pregnant woman, Vodolaha said. 

Vodolaha did not rule out the use of cluster munitions in this attack. After arriving at the site, Kyiv Independent journalists observed holes in the building across from the one that was hit, resembling those from the previous strike on the capital on June 17.

Cluster munitions are banned under international law by more than 100 countries due to their indiscriminate nature and the long-term threat they pose to civilians, especially when unexploded submunitions remain hidden in residential areas.

"It's possible as such incidents have happened not only during today's attack but at other times as well," Vodolaha said. 

"I think everyone has noticed how our attacks have become longer and more intense, even across the capital," she added. "That's why this morning we were working simultaneously at 15 locations."

Fifteen-year-old Roman Turko arrived at the site in the morning after the attack with his friend. His uncle lived in the destroyed building but, luckily, wasn't home when the strike happened.

"He's currently serving (in the military), he's a border guard. He was on duty, so luckily he wasn't home," Turko told the Kyiv Independent. "His apartment doesn't really exist anymore: The balcony is gone, the walls are gone."

"If he had been there, it probably would have been the end for him."

After surviving such a heavy attack, Sherinova is now considering leaving Kyiv, at least for a while. But she says it feels like there's nowhere left to hide from the Russian war.

"There's a kindergarten nearby where my mom works. It has a shelter, and that's where we usually go when we see reports of (Russian) jets taking off or a possible strike."

"But today it happened so suddenly, we wouldn't have had time to run anywhere. We just stepped into the hallway, crouched down, and covered our eyes and ears," she said. 

"It's hitting everywhere, strikes are happening everywhere. I still can't believe it happened to me, to my neighborhood, where I was born and have lived my whole life."

"I just can't believe it. I'm still in such a state of shock, looking at all of this and not believing it really happened."

In the wider Kyiv Oblast, a woman was killed and eight others injured in Bila Tserkva, the Kyiv Oblast Military Administration reported. 

Casualties were also reported in other areas around the capital in Kyiv Oblast, including Bucha, a town just northwest of Kyiv.

According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia deployed 368 aerial weapons, including 352 attack drones, 11 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles, and 5 Iskander-K cruise missiles, striking primarily Kyiv. Ukraine's air defenses destroyed 354 of them. 

Russian forces reportedly struck six locations directly, with debris falling in 25 sites across Kyiv and its surrounding region.

Earlier, it was reported that a high-rise apartment building was damaged as a result of the attack in the area, as well as an exit at the Sviatoshyn metro station and a nearby bus shelter.

Reports indicate that the Darnytskyi, Podilskyi, Solomianskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, and Sviatoshynskyi districts had been affected by the attack. 

Fires also broke out in the Podilskyi district, where debris struck a residential building and a vehicle. 

A large fire was also reported at a four-story office building in the Solomianskyi district. The fire reportedly covered an area of 800 square meters, the State Emergency Service said, with firefighting efforts ongoing.

Drone strike debris also landed in an open area of a stadium in Sviatoshynskyi without causing injuries or fire.

President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, noting that while Moscow had previously criticized strikes on Iran's nuclear program, it remained silent following its own "cynical" bombardment of Kyiv with Shahed drones and missiles. 

"Only in Kyiv, five apartment buildings were damaged. These are ordinary residential buildings," he said, adding that one person was also killed in Bila Tserkva after a Shahed drone hit a hospital. 

Zelensky said the attack damaged sites in four Ukrainian regions and involved 352 drones—including 159 Shaheds—and 16 missiles, possibly including North Korean ballistic missiles. 

"Every country near Russia, Iran, and North Korea should be thinking about whether they can protect life if this coalition of killers continues spreading terror," Zelensky said.

The attack on the capital comes just days after Russia launched one of its largest attacks on Kyiv, killing 28 people and injuring 134 others.

Russia's latest round of large-scale attacks comes as Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi warned on June 21 that Russian forces are attempting to advance along almost the entire front in eastern Ukraine while trying to establish a buffer zone in northeastern Sumy Oblast.

A Montreal memorial for the victims of Air India Flight 182, in Lachine, Que., on June 23, 2022.Christinne Muschi/The Globe and Mail

Nisha Thampi is an Ottawa-based physician. Her mother, Vijaya, was murdered in the bombing of Air India Flight 182.

Today is the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, which has been recognized since 2005 as a day to “remember and honour every Canadian whose life was cut short or forever changed by a terrorist attack.” What Canadians might not realize is that we commemorate this on June 23 for a reason. On that day, in 1985, Air India Flight 182 - flying from Montreal to London on its way to Delhi and Mumbai – exploded over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people aboard, including 268 Canadians. It remains the deadliest terror attack in Canadian history.

Forty years later, we mark this grim anniversary at a time of geopolitical tensions and in the aftermath of another horrific Air India crash two weeks ago, in Ahmedabad, India. The bombing of Flight 182 is often presented as a distant tragedy – one that occurred over the ocean and left no survivors, at a time when there was no 24-hour news cycle or social media. The Canadian public was largely shielded from the horrors witnessed by British and Irish recovery teams.

But Flight 182 also represents the tragedy of distance: too many Canadians simply didn't feel connected to an explosion involving a foreign airline carrying many hyphenated Canadians who did not look like them. The Canadian government perpetuated this: For years afterward, Ottawa declined to confirm that the flight was bombed at all, thus abdicating the responsibility to pursue justice for the 268 Canadian citizens and 61 foreign nationals who perished on the flight, and denying support to families and broader communities whose civil litigation in pursuit of healing needed to prove that the plane was brought down by a bomb. 

How families are building a digital archive to commemorate the Air India bombing

It took 15 years for charges to be laid in relation to the bombing, another five years for a trial to end with stunningly light consequences, and another five for an official apology by then-prime minister Stephen Harper. A federal inquiry's report spoke of a “cascading series of errors,” yet it still excluded expert testimony that alluded to the racist structures that perpetuated harm against victims' families.

But this was an act of homegrown terror – a plot that authorities now blame on a group of Khalistani militants living in Canada. Yet 40 years on, the tragedy remains largely forgotten in the public memory. 

I do not have the luxury of forgetting. My mother was on the flight. My father went on to remarry a woman who had lost her husband, K. Lakshmanan, and daughter, Preethi, in the same bombing. I grew up in a community shattered by this sudden loss and marginalized by the institutional indifference that followed. 

Yet, despite these intersections, it took me a long time to engage more fully with this history. As I experienced milestones as a daughter, sister, wife, mother and physician, it became clear that Flight 182 is refracted in my life, my work and my family. 

Liberal MP sponsors petition to open a new Air India bombing investigation

A view of a section of Air India Flight 182 is shown in this handout photo released on April 27, 2004.

The history of the Air India bombing is difficult to teach and learn. There is the inherent violence, the sheer scale of which is hard to comprehend; less than 5 per cent of the wreckage was recovered but is not accessible to the general public. As journalist Kim Bolan wrote: “I wish that all Canadians could have seen the absolute devastation... to have understood the magnitude of the calamity.” How can we comprehend a tragedy we cannot see? If we cannot understand its magnitude, how can we ever hope to prevent its recurrence?

There is also the disturbing timeline of events indicating that the bombing was preventable – that Canadian authorities failed to adequately respond to warnings about the planned attack. These revelations should challenge Canadians' sense of identity – and force us to reflect on what it really means to belong here.

It doesn't help, either, that the framing of the tragedy has strategically shifted over the years. It's gone from a foreign event to a costly trial to a post-9/11 talking point, always suiting the dominant narrative and offloading the burden of remembrance onto victims' families.

It is no surprise, then, that a 2023 poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that nine out of 10 Canadians had little to no knowledge of what it called “the worst single instance of the mass killing of their fellow citizens”. Sixty per cent of Canadians aged 18-to-34 had never even heard of this event. As younger Canadians grow more removed from the bombing, there is a real risk that it will fade entirely from our collective memory.

Wreckage of bombed Air India aircraft should be on display, say victims' families

The story of Flight 182 represents a stark warning against sacrificing human rights and justice for political expediency. This dark chapter should be discussed in Canadian schools, museums and other public spaces to foster the discourse that leads to institutional introspection and accountability, and placed in the context of other difficult histories that have shaped our country. By confronting the bombing and the structures that contributed to the harms afterward, we can better address the historical injustices that live on in the present. We cannot prevent future acts of terrorism if we don't learn from past ones. 

Forty years after Flight 182, Canada now has a choice: Will we finally learn from our history, or are we destined to repeat it?

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department apologized on Sunday for a social media post that expressed condolences to people affected by bombings in Iran following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on June 21.

The now-deleted post on the social media platform X read, “Our hearts go out to the victims and families impacted by the recent bombings in Iran.” The department also referred to the incident as a tragic event.

General Dan Caine and defense secretary Pete Hegseth are in the situation room with Trump right now monitoring Iran's attack on US bases in Middle East, CNBC reports

Iran-Israel war – live updates

Joint Chiefs Chair General Dan Caine and Secretary Pete Hegseth are in the Situation Room right now monitoring potential Iranian retaliation, per a senior White House official. Trump is currently in the room with them, CNBC reports.

Trump had visited the Qatari base Iran is attacking just last month. The president addressed US and Qatari troops there in May during a trip to the region.

Speaking to US troops at the base just weeks ago, Trump said “my priority is to end conflicts, not start them.”

He added: “But I will never hesitate to wield American power, if it's necessary, to defend the United States of America or our partners. And this is one of our great partners right here,” referring to Qatar. “When we're threatened, America's military will answer our enemies without even thinking about it. We have overwhelming strength and devastating force.”

Joint Chiefs Chair General Dan Caine and Secretary Pete Hegseth are in the Situation Room right now monitoring potential Iranian retaliation, per a senior White House official. Trump is currently in the room with them, CNBC reports.

An Axios reporter, citing an Israeli official, said that six missiles had been launched by Iran directed towards US airbases in Qatar.

A western diplomat told Reuters that there has been a credible Iranian threat against the US-run al Udeid airbase in Qatar since noon.

The airbase in Qatar is the Middle East's largest US base that houses about 10,000 troops.

At the same time, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Iran is moving missile launchers into place for a potential attack on US forces in the Middle East, citing US officials.

France's president, Emmanuel Macron, said today that there was no “framework of legality” regarding the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, adding any regime change in the country should be a result of the will of the people, not of bombs.

“There is no framework of legality in these strikes, even if France shares the objective not to see Iran acquire nuclear weapons,” he told reporters during a press conference in Oslo alongside the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre.

“I believe in the sovereignty of peoples and territorial integrity … so I don't think we can take the place of a people to change its leaders,” Macron added.

A group of 12 House Democratic military veterans are backing efforts to constrain Donald Trump's military authority, announcing they will support a War Powers Act resolution in response to the US president's go ahead for airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

The veterans – some of whom served in Iraq and Afghanistan – were strongly critical of Trump's decision to launch what they called “preventive air strikes” without US congressional approval, drawing explicit parallels to the run-up to some of America's longest recent wars.

“Twenty years ago, in their rush to appear strong and tough, politicians – from both parties – failed to ask the hard questions before starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” they wrote in a letter led by Representative Pat Ryan to Trump sent on Monday. “We refuse to make those same mistakes.”

Their intervention comes as multiple war powers resolutions are gaining momentum on Capitol Hill, with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, pushing for a vote as early as this week to rein in the president's military actions. The veterans did not specify which measure they would support, as competing versions are being drafted by different Democratic factions alongside a bipartisan effort.

Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team at 1pm ET in the Oval Office.

Trump responded to Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia and an ally of Vladimir Putin, who said on social media that a “number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads”. In response, Trump said that “The ‘N word' should not be treated so casually. I guess that's why Putin's ‘THE BOSS.'”

Trump issued a warning about oil prices after White House adviser says Iran strike won't disrupt markets.

The US embassy in Qatar advised American citizens there to “shelter in place until further notice” and on Sunday night, the state department issued a “worldwide caution” security alert advising US citizens abroad to “exercise increased caution”.

Pakistan has condemned  Trump for bombing Iran, less than 24 hours after saying he deserved a Nobel peace prize for defusing a recent crisis with India.

Trump is set to attend the two day Nato summit beginning on Tuesday. The White House said that at the summit, Trump will push Nato members to increase defense spending.

Trump insisted that “monumental damage” had been done by US strikes to Iran's nuclear sites, but the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency says no one in a position to fully assess damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities.

The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that the US position on Iran regime change has altered, despite Trump raising the prospect of regime change in Iran on Sunday.

Democratic senator John Fetterman called US strike on Iran “entirely appropriate” and criticized his Democratic colleagues who have condemned the strikes.

On Monday morning, Trump once again hit out at Republican representative Thomas Massie, who has publicly opposed Trump's decision to strike Iran.

The LA county sheriff's department deleted and then apologized for posting a message expressing sympathy for “the victims and families impacted” by US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Donald Trump has responded to Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia and an ally of Vladimir Putin, who said on social media that a “number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads”.

In a post on Sunday, Medvedev also wrote that Trump, who he said was “once hailed as ‘president of peace” has “now pushed the US into another war”.

On Monday morning, Trump responded on Truth Social, writing in a lengthy post, “Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the ‘N word' (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran?”.

He added: “The ‘N word' should not be treated so casually. I guess that's why Putin's ‘THE BOSS.'”

German chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday that there was “no reason to criticize” the US over its strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran.

In a speech on Monday, Merz said:

There is no reason to criticize what America did at the weekend. Yes, it is not without risk. But leaving things as they were was not an option either.

Messaging app WhatsApp has been banned on devices used by staff in the US House of Representatives, per reports.

According to Reuters and Axios, the US House's chief administrative officer (CAO) notified congressional staffers on Monday that WhatsApp is now prohibited from their government devices.

The email, obtained by Axios, reportedly stated that the “Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high-risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.”

It further specified, “House staff are NOT allowed to download or keep the WhatsApp application on any House device, including any mobile, desktop, or web browser versions of its products.”

Additionally, it mentioned that those who have the WhatsApp application on their House-managed devices will be contacted to remove it.

The email listed Microsoft Teams, Wickr, Signal, iMessage and FaceTime as acceptable alternatives to WhatsApp.

On Fox News this morning, Democratic senator John Fetterman, who has been a vocal supporter of Israel and has advocated for the US to join Israel's attack of Iran, criticized members of his own party who have condemned Trump's attack on Iran over the weekend.

“There's going to be a lot of people in my party who are going to disagree with the strike in Iran,” Fetterman said. “And I actually support that. I've always been calling for that thing. I think it was entirely appropriate. And again, there might be votes on that. So for me, that's not a war. That was a very limited military exercise.

“I've been always calling to destroy these nuclear facilities,” he continued. “Now let's talk about the context in the middle of all that now, too. Now, our party has been often wrong, and they were pushing for a ceasefire last year, and now Israel pushed through that and has broken Hamas and Hezbollah as well now, too.

“And now here it is right now, Israel has air supremacy over Iraq right now,” he said. “And now, here's where Iraq – I mean, excuse me, where Iran is right now. Their capabilities are severely limited, and now that was an entirely appropriate to finally take out those nuclear facilities.”

The Los Angeles county sheriff's department deleted and then apologized for posting a message expressing sympathy for “the victims and families impacted” by US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

In the original post, according to a screenshot by local news station KTLA, the Sheriff's department said: “Our hearts go out to the victims and the families impacted by the recent bombings in Iran.”

A swift online backlash followed, and the department then issued an apology on Sunday that referred to its own original post as “offensive and inappropriate” and “unacceptable”.

The Department said that the post was “made in error” and “does not reflect the views of Sheriff Robert G Luna or the Department”.

“As a law enforcement agency, we do not comment on foreign policy or military matters” the statement on Sunday added. “Our mission remains solely focused on protecting public safety and serving our diverse communities.”

In a post on Truth Social this morning, Donald Trump has once again hit out at Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who has publicly opposed Trump's decision to strike Iran.

Last week, in a rare moment of cross party cooperation, Massie collaborated with Democratic California congressman Ro Khanna, to introduce a measure that would force Trump to get congressional approval to enter Israel's conflict with Iran.

On Sunday, Trump took aim at Massie in a lengthy post on Truth Social, describing him as “a negative force”, “a simple minded ‘grandstander'”, “weak” and “ineffective”.

“Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is,” Trump wrote on Sunday. “Actually, MAGA doesn't want him, doesn't know him, and doesn't respect him.”

In response to Trump's comments, Massie wrote on X: “@realDonaldTrump declared so much War on me today it should require an Act of Congress. #sassywithmassie” tagging Trump's X account.

And now, on Monday morning, Trump added to his attacks on Massie, saying “GET THIS “BUM” OUT OF OFFICE, ASAP!!!”

Axios reported on Sunday that Trump's political operation had launched an aggressive effort to unseat Massie.

In a post on Truth Social this morning, President Donald Trump issued a warning on oil pricing.

“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” Trump wrote on Monday morning.

In a second post, he added, “To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!.”

Earlier this morning, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that the US strikes on Iran over the weekend had “not really disrupted global oil markets”.

In an interview with CNBC, Hassett said, “if you look at the excess reserves that oil producing countries have around the world, it's maybe about three times as big as total Iranian production”.

“There's a lot of room to adjust, should we need to,” he said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared on Good Morning America this morning and said that the Trump administration was confident that the airstrikes the US carried out on Saturday in Iran “completely and totally obliterated” Iran's nuclear facilities.

“We are confident that Iran's nuclear sites were completely and totally obliterated,” Leavitt said. “And we have a high degree of confidence that where those strikes took place is where Iran's enriched uranium was stored.

“The president wouldn't have launched the strikes if we weren't confident in that” Leavitt added.

Trump will push Nato members to increase defense spending when he goes to the Nato alliance summit on Tuesday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt says.

In an interview with Fox News on Monday morning, Leavitt said that Trump would push Nato members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP.

“One of the main topics of discussion will be that 5% threshold that our Nato allies have to hit” Leavitt said. “The president has been calling on our Nato allies to do more for quite some time. He got them to step up and do more in his first term, and you'll hear the president talk about that on this next historic trip to Europe.”

The US president and his Nato counterparts are scheduled to meet for the annual Nato summit, which will take place over two days in The Hague, Netherlands, on Tuesday.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked just now about Trump's statements last night regarding regime change in Iran.

“The President's posture and our military posture has not changed” Leavitt said. “The President was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking, if the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks … if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime?”

“That's a question the President raised last night,” she added. “But as far as our military posture, it hasn't changed.”

Leavitt also said that there has been both “public and private messages sent to the Iranians” since Saturday night.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team at 1pm ET today in the Oval Office, according to his schedule.

This comes as on Sunday evening, Trump hinted at the question of regime change in Iran, despite top officials in his administration, including Vice-President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, have stressed over the last few days that the Trump administration was not interested in overthrowing Iran's government.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???” Trump posted on social media. “MIGA!!!”.

HUSSEIN AGHA spent more than 25 years as a Senior Associate at St. Antony's College, University of Oxford, and has been involved in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations for more than three decades.

ROBERT MALLEY is a Lecturer at Yale University's Jackson School of Global Affairs. He served in the Biden administration as Special U.S. Envoy for Iran and in the Obama administration as White House Middle East Coordinator.

They are the authors of the forthcoming book Tomorrow Is Yesterday: Life, Death, and the Pursuit of Peace in Israel-Palestine.

 Hussein Agha and Robert Malley

To many outside the Middle East, the American and Israeli war with Iran reads like a linear narrative: the two allies' formidable militaries and intelligence agencies arrayed against their adversary, poised to prevail, on the cusp of indisputable, decisive triumph. The fight and its expected outcome are viewed through the prism of familiar antecedents: Hitler's Germany overwhelmed, defeated, willing to acquiesce to the victor's demands; Japan following suit. When proponents of this war speak of one side's surrender and of the other being on the right side of history, it is on such clear-cut notions of progress and finality that they rely. History, to them, advances in a straight line, swiftly heading to safe shores, and one had better choose the correct side or be left adrift.

To those who know the Middle East, such thoughts make little sense. They are hogwash.

The region has its own favored antecedents. As early as the 1970s, Jordan's crushing of Palestinian guerrillas prompted the emergence of the Black September organization and the Munich Olympic massacre of Israeli athletes. Israel invaded South Lebanon in 1982 and forced the Palestine Liberation Organization's exile to Tunisia. The result: the ascent of an energized Hezbollah and, in time, the movement of banished Palestinians closer to Israel, in Gaza and the West Bank. In the 1980s, Washington's support for Afghan mujahideen helped drive out Soviet forces. It also led to the rise of the Taliban and a generation of jihadist groups, including al-Qaeda, for whom Americans were the chief villains. After Washington's victory in the 1990-91 Gulf War, Osama bin Laden and his followers made the United States their primary target. After they carried out the 9/11 attacks, the George W. Bush administration invaded Afghanistan, routing the Taliban, and later toppled Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. Twenty years later, the Taliban returned to power. In Iraq, the Islamic State rose from the rubble, and pro-Iranian militias played a dominant role in the country.

When revolts broke out across the Middle East in 2010-11, Westerners embraced “the Arab Spring,” feted liberal activists, and hailed the spread of democracy. Darkness rapidly descended; the peaceful demonstrations and lofty values that inspired them became distant memories. The regime of Egypt's deposed president, Hosni Mubarak, eventually gave way to an even more brutal autocrat. The overthrow of Yemen's government hatched Houthi dominance; the fall of Libya's Muammar al-Qaddafi yielded bedlam, instability, and violence. Bashar al-Assad is gone yet Syria's fate is far from settled. History does not move forward. It slips sideways and lands in the most unexpected of places.

Israel may yet prevail in its war against Iran, just as it may in the Palestinian occupied territories, in Lebanon, and in Syria. It might emerge, triumphant, as the uncontested regional hegemon. Iran will appear a paper tiger; its non-state partners defeated or deflated; its nuclear program in shambles; its military a shadow of its former self. Israeli dreams of regime change may be unfulfilled, but chaos could reign. To all who saw Iran as a behemoth, were daunted by its deterrence and paralyzed by its threats, these are days of reckoning.

This could last for a while. The time lag between the immediate result and what happens as a result of that result may stretch: “Mission Accomplished” may go on for days, weeks, months, even years. Then what? It is tempting to read the immediate turn of events as the most pertinent. That is true only until the next. The story does not end. Force invites counterforce. Success generates reactions that yield its opposite. The closer Israel gets to total triumph, the closer it will be to complete uncertainty, to perils unleashed by pent-up humiliation, anger, and fury. That sort of victory is not a safe place.



For Israelis, the temptation to act was irresistible. They waited decades for the opportunity to take down their foes, immediate or remote, real or imagined. With all constraints gone, they believe themselves to be limited solely by what they can do—and they can do a lot. But the United States and European countries should know better. Jews did not forget their attachment to the Holy Land after 2,000 years of exile. Palestinians, Lebanese, and Iranians—those who still recall the seventh-century Battle of Karbala, which led to the martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson Hussein—will not fail to remember the horrors that befell Gaza, the bombings of their cities, the massacres, the shame, the killings of their leaders, the West's duplicity, hypocrisy, and moral desolation. With memories so profound and vistas so far-reaching, much that is viewed as crucial today will be of little interest to the future.

The dangers that await may not be of the familiar sort. They could entail a revamping of Iran's “axis of resistance” no less thorough than the one Israel wreaked by force. Over the years, flush with a sense of power, Iran built up its conventional arsenal, believing it could deter and challenge Israel in an arena over which the Jewish state had long enjoyed mastery. Hezbollah and, following in its footsteps, Hamas erected quasi-states in Lebanon and Gaza, both with cumbersome civilian responsibilities and quasi-regular armies. The three saw these achievements as indices of potency, overlooked how vulnerable these feats had made them, how weakness sprang from apparent strength.

There is a reason why they initially embraced more mobile, elusive methods of guerrilla groups. Their power rested in asymmetry. When they deviated into trying to match their enemy, they went astray and lost the plot. They were exposed. In the days and years ahead, they may feel compelled to revert to older tactics. It may not be long before more Palestinians, Lebanese, Iranians, and others motivated by their cause—desperate, friends or family members wiped out, craving revenge, with darkness as their sole horizon—resort to unconventional forms of warfare, at times well planned, at others impromptu, today's more lethal and technologically adept versions of yesterday's hijacked planes and buses, hostage takings, and suicide attacks. Something new, different, more devastating, and at the same time a reversion to the past. Israeli achievements in technical intelligence, cyberattacks, pager detonations, precision killings, mass civilian carnage, and more, may point the way to methods that will be employed by all and sundry. Signs are visible already.

It takes time for history to reach its destination, and not before it sets out on many false trails. The years that lie ahead will not reflect tidy plans and rigorous policy prescriptions. They will be shaped by instinct and emotion, inspired by raw, deeply-rooted yearnings for historical redress and vengeance. This is not a world built by or for Americans. They will be at sea.

JOSEPH TORIGIAN is an Associate Professor in the School of International Service at American University and the author of The Party's Interests Come First: The Life of Xi Zhongxun, Father of Xi Jinping.

 Joseph Torigian

In 1980, Xi Zhongxun, a major Chinese Communist Party heavyweight and the father of the current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, visited one of the premier tourist attractions of central eastern Iowa: the Amana Colonies, a German heritage site founded on communitarian principles, now known for beer and crafts. The experience shook him. At 67 years old, Xi was leading a delegation of provincial governors to the United States. It was a historic moment in China's opening to Western business and investment. Xi, as leader of the southern province of Guangdong, was at the forefront of that process. Guangzhou, the provincial capital, had just seen the inauguration of the first U.S. consulate outside Beijing. Xi was also launching the Special Economic Zones—areas designed to attract foreign businesses—that would symbolize China's new relationship with the outside world.

The Americans at the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations who staffed the trip remembered Xi as a friendly and charismatic man, the kind of person who would make sure his translators had a glass of water. Yet he would sometimes go quiet as if he were preoccupied and could come across as reserved and distant.

That changed at the Amana Colonies. According to one person who was present, Xi was enthralled as he listened to the tour guide. His reaction was so strong that it seemed as if he “became a different guy,” according to a U.S. foreign service officer.

That change probably occurred because Xi saw in the heritage site a frightening possibility. Here was a community built on collectivist and utopian principles that had decided 88 years after its founding to disband. In other words, it was a story about how a communist society had reduced itself to a tourist destination.

At the time, a few years after the death of Mao Zedong, Xi and his comrades were worried that what they had built with all their sacrifices would not endure. From Xi's position as governor of Guangdong, it did not look good. Tens of thousands of people were fleeing the poverty of the communist mainland for capitalist Hong Kong. New economic ties with the outside world could help stem the tide and create prosperity, but fears of Western ideological infiltration were especially palpable in Guangdong because of its proximity to the British colony. Young people in Guangzhou were taking to the streets to demand that the party move faster in the new direction of “reform and opening.” And even though Mao's chaotic tenure had warned the party about the dangers of strongman rule and the explosiveness of succession politics, a new autocrat in Beijing, Deng Xiaoping, was using Machiavellian means to defeat Mao's initial successor, the more consensus-oriented Hua Guofeng.

Soon after his trip to the United States, Xi moved to work in Beijing to assume a weighty position in the Secretariat, the party's “brain.” It placed him at the very center of debates about how to save the revolution.

His son Xi Jinping has now inherited that mission. Inspired by his father, the son dreams of no less than breaking the cycles of dynastic collapse that have marked Chinese history for millennia. And he wants to achieve that through continuous “self-revolution,” a campaign that aims to keep the revolutionary spirit alive by calling on the Chinese people to continually study the lives of the founding generation.

In charting the party and the country's way forward, he is no doubt informed by his father's struggles through the convulsions that shook China in the twentieth century. A close examination of the life of Xi Zhongxun reveals the profound challenges that have marked party politics from the beginning, in particular in terms of the dilemmas posed by the role of ideology in Chinese political life and the party's plans for succession. They are dilemmas that can be managed, not problems to be solved. And they provide essential context for understanding what Xi Jinping is trying to achieve today and whether he will succeed in the future.

The elder Xi endured extraordinary suffering for the sake of the cause, at the hands of both Nationalist foes and the Communists themselves. His travails simultaneously reveal the dangers of taking ideology too seriously and not seriously enough. After his release from a Nationalist prison when he was 15 years old, Xi did not rekindle his enthusiasm for revolution by reading Karl Marx. As he later told his son, it was a novel, The Young Wanderer, by Jiang Guangci, that he found most inspiring. Its protagonist experiences one disaster after another and concludes that “the more pain that evil society brought me, the more powerfully did my resistance develop.”

Xi, then, was sensitive to the importance of cultural products for the communist cause. In 1952, he became minister of propaganda. He was tasked with educating a country of hundreds of millions of people about communism and why they should sacrifice to build it.

But ideology not only motivated Xi and helped him explain why the party deserved devotion. It also nearly got him killed. When the party persecuted him, which it did on numerous occasions, it was because differences of opinion were understood as manifestations of ideological heresy. That is why even though it was a novel that inspired Xi to stay with the revolution in 1928, it was yet another novel, Liu Zhidan, that got him purged in 1962. Mao concluded that Xi's decision to allow a woman cadre to write the book—a fictionalized narrative of a leading revolutionary from the Northwest—was a manifestation of “class struggle.” Xi was dispatched into the political wilderness for 16 years.

His fall foreshadowed one of the great tragedies of Chinese history: the Cultural Revolution. During those frenzied years in the 1960s and 1970s, authorities banished Xi from the capital and subjected him to solitary confinement and physical abuse. After Mao's death in 1976, leaders recognized that the Cultural Revolution was such a failure that the party would have to change in its aftermath. When Xi returned to work in Beijing in 1981, he faced a new question: how to maintain a sense of idealism and conviction when no one could explain what communism really was anymore, a reality that even Xi acknowledged.



Xi knew that achieving greater economic development would give the party the legitimacy it desperately needed. Yet he was also afraid of what might happen if that new economic model caused people to lose faith in the party's ideological commitments. He worried about how China would change with the arrival of Western investment, the introduction of market mechanisms, and the use of material inducements to encourage hard work. Xi wanted to give space to new voices that could justify the party's new economic direction, or even provide new ideas about how to achieve limited political reforms, but he was afraid of chaos and wanted the loudest critics to stop creating problems for him. There was always the risk that he could be associated with more strident calls for change and earn the ire of his superiors. It was a recipe for confusion and dysfunction. Throughout the 1980s, the party regularly launched crackdowns that raised fears of another Cultural Revolution and then rapidly pulled back when the campaigns threatened economic growth.

Finally, there were consequences for the party elite itself. In 1987, after student protests, Deng purged General Secretary Hu Yaobang from the leadership. The party accused Hu of “bourgeois liberalization.” Xi, his close associate, was said to have “gone even further” than Hu, according to Yang Shangkun, a Politburo member. Xi hated the charges. He knew that Hu never opposed Deng. The real problem was that balancing reform and opening with conservative principles had proved to be a near-impossible task. And Hu and Xi were blamed when the contradiction became too obvious to ignore.

Xi Jinping faces the same problem of balancing growth with ideology that his father did, but he has his own approach to solving it. The son clearly cares about economic development. Yet he is also preoccupied with instilling a sense of idealism and conviction in both the party and the rest of the Chinese population. He believes that the party should avoid the extremism of the Mao era but also needs to reinvigorate its members with a call to struggle and vigilance. He has tried to avoid the dramatic zigzags that marked the Deng period even as he has attempted to be flexible with limited course corrections.

The problem for him is that the “struggle” he demands of his people is an inherently ambiguous notion. Too much and too little are both dangerous. As the economy slows down, the challenge of meeting the material needs of China's population while pursuing strategic and ideological goals is likely to get worse. Xi Jinping's “middle path” approach could achieve the best of both worlds by using growth to facilitate greater security and stability (and vice versa), or it could simply be a recipe for muddling through.

Party leaders might have done a better job with thorny ideological debates if they had evaluated different approaches dispassionately. But the problem was that ideology mixed with another issue, the most explosive one in the history of the party: succession politics.

And no one witnessed the pathologies and dangers of succession politics more closely than Xi Zhongxun. Xi served premier Zhou Enlai in the 1950s and early 1960s and then General Secretary Hu Yaobang during the 1980s. In other words, he witnessed firsthand the relationships between the Chinese paramount leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and their most significant deputies.

Xi would have seen how party politics at the very top was about much more than executing the senior leader's wishes. The implementers were told to pursue multiple goals at the same time without clear guidance about which mattered more or how to achieve them. Commands would often include two contradictory orders separated by a “but”: make sure the campaign is thorough, they were told, but avoid going too far too fast. If they went too far in one direction, either to the “left” (too radical) or to the “right” (too cautious), they could face charges of ideological heresy. Setbacks might mean losing authority to someone else.

As paramount leaders, Mao and then Deng were often distant, vague, mercurial, and suspicious. If a deputy reported too much to them, they could feel overwhelmed and bogged down by details. But not enough communication could lead them to suspect that underlings were trying to run the country themselves. Private, frank meetings between leaders and their lieutenants were extremely rare, and even then there was no guarantee that they would reach a durable understanding. When deputies got it wrong, their bosses stripped them of power—or worse.



This was an almost impossible situation for deputies to navigate. Xi watched as Mao regularly humiliated Zhou Enlai. On one occasion in 1958, Zhou, after an excruciating self-criticism that lasted several hours, plaintively admitted to Xi that Mao had criticized him once again. Xi promised to share the blame with Zhou. He was shaken by how the experienced Zhou, who understood Mao better than most, could nevertheless face devastating setbacks.

Xi thought Mao's personality cult during the Cultural Revolution was disastrous. He was thus disappointed as Deng became another despot over the course of the 1980s. Xi suggested to Hu that he should speak to Deng more to make sure they understood each other. But Hu thought he had Deng's complete trust. He was wrong. When Deng said that he was planning to retire in 1986, Hu made a fatal mistake. He agreed that Deng should go, which in turn led Deng to conclude that Hu was eager to push him out. And so Hu was booted out. In the aftermath, it became clear to Xi that the party was less inclined to resolve the problems inherent in its leadership system than it was to repeat them.

Like Mao and Deng before him, Xi Jinping has arrogated to himself great power. His model of rule makes some sense given his father's experiences. If the jealousies and insecurities that come with succession politics are dangerous, then it is no surprise that Xi has not picked a successor. A named successor might create more than one center of authority in the party, and Xi does not want to risk the instability that might result if he has to purge such a figure. If too much daylight between a leader and his deputies is a problem, then we can understand Xi's decision to concentrate control in his own hands, as he did when he undermined Li Keqiang, the premier at the time, by restricting Li's latitude to make decisions about the economy.

Yet those are only temporary solutions. Sooner or later, Xi will be tempted to pick and test a successor. As he ages, he may lose energy and want to focus on bigger issues, which will mean delegating more authority to others. The same problems that tormented his father could reappear.

At the twilight of his career, in 1990, just a few months after the People's Liberation Army massacred many of the young protesters who had called for change in Tiananmen Square, Xi Zhongxun assumed one of his last titles: co-chairman of the Care for the Next Generation Committee. It was a fitting coda to a life that had been marked by constant worry about an existential question: Would younger and future generations accept the continuing legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party?

For Xi, of course, it was not just a professional concern but a personal one, too. He wanted his children to be just as dedicated to the cause as he was. He regaled them with stories of the revolution to inspire them and imposed brutal discipline to familiarize them with collective values.

Yet his children saw something else, as well. They saw how the party that Xi served executed policies that brought tragedy to the Chinese people. They saw the humiliation, persecution, exile, and incarceration to which the party subjected Xi. And they saw the guilt and shame he experienced as both a victim and a victimizer. They witnessed the same tragedy but lived very different lives. One of Xi's children, Heping, committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution. Another came to associate with veteran pro-reform officials and intellectuals. Others made a lot of money in business ventures.



Even Xi Jinping has admitted that the torment he endured as a young person led to doubts about the state and the party. Indeed, he was convinced that his ordeal was worse than what many others suffered during the Cultural Revolution, since he was the son of a leader who had been purged earlier than most senior revolutionaries. Nevertheless, he has spoken with great pride of the toughness these horrific experiences inculcated in him. And he has asserted that his ideals and convictions are unshakable precisely because he went through a period of confusion before recognizing that only the party's path was the right one.

Instead of turning him away from the party, these experiences seem to have led Xi to subscribe to a cause for which his father suffered so much and to seek to regain pride and legacy for a family that had been humiliated so many times. With that in mind, he followed his father into politics. But will future generations feel the same way as their parents? Xi believes that China's Western adversaries want to instigate young people today to demand radical political change. To combat this danger, Xi hopes to inspire China's youth with a mission of national rejuvenation, of sacrifice, of “eating bitterness” for the greater good.

Some will inevitably be proud to accept that task. But others may hear Xi Jinping's call not as a rallying cry but as a weary echo of the past. Many young Chinese people might be more interested in living less ardent lives than what Xi demands of them. The Xi family story raises questions about just how these young people can be won over. A message of suffering and struggle can indeed be meaningful for some—but for others, it may only lead to alienation.

Iran threatened to activate terror sleeper cells inside the United States if the country attacked, reports suggest.

Sources told NBC News that Iran sent a communiqué to Donald Trump in the days before the US's strikes, threatening to green-light the terror sleeper cells.

Mr Trump received the message via an intermediary at the G7 summit in Canada last week. He later told reporters he was not “in the mood” to negotiate with Iran.

Sleeper cells are essentially spies or terrorists who operate in the US and remain inactive until they are ordered to act.

It comes as Mr Trump authorised strikes on Iran's three nuclear bases, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, on Saturday night in a stealth mission he hailed “a spectacular military success”.

The US president had previously vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to American officials.

Israeli officials said they believed Iran's heavily-fortified nuclear site at Fordow sustained serious damage from the strikes but had not been completely destroyed. A US official told the New York Times it had been taken “off the table”.

On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, claimed Israel was “close” to wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles.

Thank you for following our live blog. We will back shortly to bring you the latest out of the Middle East conflict.

Air raid sirens are ringing through central Israel early this morning, as the military works to intercept Iranian missiles. 

🚨Sirens sounding across central Israel due to a missile launch from Iran🚨

Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Moscow as he embarks on a campaign to “rally the world against Israel”, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

Mr Araghchi earlier slammed the US's attack, calling it an “outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation” of international law.

The Israeli army said it carried out strikes on Iranian “military targets”, including missile launch and storage sites on Sunday.

“Approximately 20 (Israeli airforce) fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes using over 30 munitions on military targets in Iran,” the Israeli army wrote on Telegram.

The attacks struck “storage and missile launching infrastructure sites”, as well as “military satellites and radar sites”.

Iran sent a communiqué to Donald Trump in the days before the US's strikes, threatening to activate sleeper-cell terror inside the country if it attacked, sources said.

Sleeper cells are essentially spies or terrorists who operate in the US and remain inactive until they are ordered to act.

Mr Trump received the message via an intermediary at the G7 summit in Canada last week.

The US president left the summit early to deal with escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The dollar strengthened in early trading as investors sought havens in a move to shield against mounting geopolitical risks.

The US currency was quoted stronger against the euro and most major foreign-exchange peers as markets opened for the week in Sydney. Traders are forecasting a drop in stocks and a jump in crude prices and gold as the bombing fuels demand for safety and angst about energy supply. 

In another early sign of risk aversion, Bitcoin slid below $100,000 for the first time since May and Ether sank sharply as cryptocurrencies posted broad-based declines. 

Market reaction had been generally muted since Israel's initial assault on Iran earlier this month: Even after falling for the past two weeks, the S&P 500 is only about 3 per cent below its all-time high from February. And a Bloomberg gauge of the greenback is up less than 1 per cent since the June 13 attack. 

That's mostly because investors have expected the conflict to be be localised, with no wider impact on the global economy. But moves stand to get bigger if Iran responds to the latest developments with steps such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for oil and gas shipments, or attacking US forces in the region, market watchers say. 

The biggest market reaction since the start of the escalation has been in oil, with Brent futures jumping 11 per cent to $77 a barrel. 

Traders are preparing for another surge in crude prices even as it's unclear where the crisis goes from here. That rise is expected to restart on Monday, after the US assault dramatically raised the stakes in a region that accounts for a third of global oil output.

Donald Trump has stopped short of saying that the goal of US strikes was to topple the government in Tehran, but he said “regime change” would happen if its leaders were “unable to make Iran great again”.

Yet, according to US officials, he had already vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Hawks within the Israeli establishment, and many ordinary Israelis, would love to see Khamenei dead, arguing that he is a legitimate target whose removal would eliminate one of the gravest threats to the Jewish state.

To bolster their case, they note the limited backlash following the assassinations last year of Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah chief in Lebanon, and Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader behind the Oct 7 massacre.

But many analysts believe assassinating Khamenei would be a perilous gamble – one that could easily misfire by paving the way for an even more hardline successor.

Khamenei may be no peacemaker, but he did place a fatwa effectively banning Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It is unclear whether the ruling has survived in its original form, and many in Israel set little store by it.

The assassination of 10 senior Iranian generals may already have strengthened the regime's fundamentalist wing, even as it has dealt a serious blow to its military command structure.

Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, has slammed the US for its strikes.

Mr Iravani told the UN Security Council: “The United States, a permanent member of this Council... has now once again resorted to illegal force, waged a war against my country, under a fabricated and absurd pretext: preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.”

He said the US had “decided to destroy diplomacy” and that the Iranian military would now decide the “timing, nature and scale of Iran's proportionate response”.

“We will take all measures necessary,” Mr Iravani told the meeting.

In a post on his Truth Social network, Donald Trump has said: “It's not politically correct to use the term, “Regime Change,” but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!”

Just hours ago, Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth stressed that Washington was not seeking to topple the Iranian government or force “regime change”.

Speaking to the UN Security Council by video link, Rafael Grossi also provided insights into the extent of the damage caused by US attacks on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility.

 There were visible craters “indicating the use by the United States of America of ground-penetrating munitions,” the IAEA director said.

But Mr Grossi noted that no one had been able to assess the underground damage at Fordow.

He added that “armed attacks on nuclear facilities should never take place and could result in radioactive releases with grave consequences within and beyond the boundaries of the State which has been attacked”.

 

Rafael Grossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), spoke at the special United Nations meeting where he voiced fears over “potential widening” of the Middle East conflict.

“We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy,” Mr Grossi said.

“If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall.”

United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has warned against yet “another cycle of destruction” and retaliation following the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, which he said marked a “perilous turn” in the region.

“I have repeatedly condemned any military escalation in the Middle East,” the secretary-general told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

“The people of the region cannot endure another cycle of destruction. And yet, we now risk descending into a rathole of retaliation after retaliation.”

 

 

 

A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister spoke to the President of the United States Donald Trump this evening. 

“The leaders discussed the situation in the Middle East and reiterated the grave risk posed by Iran's nuclear programme to international security. They discussed the actions taken by the United States last night to reduce the threat and agreed that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. 

“They discussed the need for Iran to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to make progress on a lasting settlement.

“They agreed to stay in close contact in the coming days.”

A powerful explosion was heard in central Isfahan at 10:48 pm local time as air defence activity intensified across multiple Iranian cities, Iranian media reported.

Citizens in Isfahan reported hearing a “big explosion” from the southeastern part of the ancient city.

Air defence activity also intensified in Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz and Ahvaz late on Sunday, according to Iranian media.

Isfahan is home to one of Iran's major nuclear facilities that was targeted in the American strikes.

UK bases in the Middle East are on heightened alert for drone strikes after the US bombing of Iran.

John Healey, the Defence Secretary, said UK Armed Forces protection was at its “highest level” amid fears that the US action could escalate into a wider conflict.

It is understood UK bases across the Middle East have increased security since the US action in the early hours of Sunday morning, with personnel on high alert for drone attacks as well as conventional rockets and missiles.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is addressing the UN about the US strikes last night.

“Craters are visible at the Fordow site, Iran's main location for enriching uranium at 60 per cent, indicating the use by the United States of America of ground-penetrating munitions,” he said.

“No one... is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.”

At the Isfahan site, Mr Grossi continued, “additional buildings were hit overnight with the US confirming their use of cruise missiles.”

“Affected buildings include some related to uranium conversion processes. Entrances to tunnel used for the storage of enriched material appear to have been hit,” he said.

At Natanz, a “fuel enrichment plant has been hit, with the US confirming it used ground-penetrating munitions.”

Several explosions were heard in the northwestern city of Tabriz around 10 pm local time following an Israeli attack, Iranian state media reported.

“Around 22:00 on Sunday, following the Zionist attack, the sound of several explosions was heard in Tabriz,” Fars news agency said.

A Fars correspondent reported hearing the sound of a fighter jet over Tabriz, according to the agency.

Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has arrived in Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin following a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites.

“Abbas Araghchi ... arrived in Moscow to hold consultations with the (Russian) president and other senior officials of Russia regarding regional and international developments following the military aggression by the United States and the Zionist regime against Iran,” state media reported.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israel is “close” to destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities and stock of ballistic missiles.

He vowed not to be dragged into a “war of attrition with Iran”, saying: “When we achieve our objectives, the fighting will stop.”

However, senior members of Donald Trump's administration on Sunday issued a more conservative assessment of the damage inflicted on Tehran's nuclear ambitions.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said its capabilities had been “degraded” and “set back” but stopped short of saying they had been outright destroyed.

Similarly, JD Vance, the US vice president, said last night's strikes on three Iranian facilities had “substantially delayed” Iran's ability to develop of a nuclear weapon “by many, many years”.

Danny Danon criticised António Guterres after the UN secretary general said he was “gravely alarmed” by the US bombing Iran's nuclear sites.

“It was very disappointing because the secretary general failed in his remarks to mention the threat of a nuclear Iran,” he said.

“He knows better. He knows diplomacy has failed for the last decades, and should thank the US for bringing stability and bringing peace through power.”

Danny Danon said “the entire world is safer” following the US' strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities last night.

“You don't have a radical regime which threatens to destroy member states of the UN,” he said, adding: “Today I think we have historic days.”

Mr Danon said he wanted to see regime change but conceded “that's for the Iranian people to decide, not us.”

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations has warned the West it cannot “sit out” the conflict with Iran.

Danny Danon, speaking shortly before an emergency security council meeting: “[Iran] threatens every capital in the West with its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles.

“You cannot sit this one out. You cannot condemn the firefighters while the arsonist tries to light more fire. You cannot protect peace by appeasing evil.”

He warned Tehran: “Under this, any further attacks against our civilians will be met with overpowering, righteous force, unlike your actions against our civilians”

America is on alert for an attack on home soil by Iranian-backed terrorists, JD Vance has warned.

Authorities are preparing for a possible attack after Donald Trump bombed Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday morning local time, with security being increased at places of worship in major cities.

Speaking to NBC's “Meet the Press”, Mr Vance, the US vice president, claimed that individuals “on the terrorism watch list” had been allowed to enter the country during Joe Biden's administration.

“We feel very confident in our FBI and law enforcement that we're on top of the situation, but yeah, we're looking at this very closely,” he continued.

“We're doing everything that we can to keep our people safe.”

Police in Washington, DC, New York and other major American cities said they had increased their presence outside places of worship on Sunday following the US air strikes.

The White House has reportedly been monitoring possible Iranian sleeper cells in the US, which could be ordered by Tehran to launch an attack in retaliation for the damage inflicted on its nuclear programme.

The next 48 hours are considered the most dangerous period for an Iranian attack, either on American civilians or military in the Middle East or on home soil, US officials told NBC News.

Donald Trump has lashed out at a Republican congressman who claimed his bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities was unconstitutional.

Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president accused Thomas Massie, a representative for Kentucky”, of “grandstanding” and failing to recognise “what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran”.

“He's a simple-minded ‘grandstander' who thinks it's good politics for Iran to have the highest level nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘Death to America' at every change they get,” he said, labelling the Republican “weak” and “ineffective”.

Mr Trump continued: “He is disrespectful to our great military, and all that they stand for, not even acknowledging the brilliance and bravery in yesterday's attack, which was a total and complete win.

“Massie should drop his fake act and start putting America First, but he doesn't know how to get there - he doesn't have a clue!”

Iranian police have arrested an alleged Israeli agent in a suburb of Tehran.

“With intelligence oversight and control in real and online platforms... police officers succeeded in identifying and arresting a mercenary of the Israeli regime in Parand,” said Colonel Ali Zanganeh, the police commander of Robat Karim district.

The United Nations is expected to hold an emergency security council meeting at 3pm EDT (8pm BST) after the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Hezbollah has condemned US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and expressed “confidence” in Iran's ability to “make America and Israel taste defeat.”

“We condemn in the strongest terms the barbaric and treacherous American aggression against Iran's peaceful nuclear facilities,” the Iran-backed Lebanese group said in a statement.

The group called the strikes “a reckless, dangerous and uncalculated escalation that threatens to expand the war and drag the region and world toward the unknown if not stopped.”

Hezbollah said the US was seeking through the “criminal aggression to achieve what Israel had failed to accomplish and compensate for its disgraceful failure in achieving its goals against Iran's painful and devastating missiles.”

It called the strikes “a violation of international and humanitarian law, the Geneva Conventions and the U.N. Charter, which prohibit targeting nuclear facilities and using force against an independent country.”

Marco Rubio has urged Iran to turn over enriched uranium which the US believes it “buried deep under the ground” at the Isfahan site.

The US secretary of state was asked about reports that Iran had removed stockpiles from the Fordow facility ahead of American air strikes last night.

“No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it because you really can't move anything right now, and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran,” Mr Rubio told CBS' “Face the Nation”.

“The minute a truck starts driving somewhere, the Israelis have seen it and they've targeted it and taken it out.  

“So our assessment is we have to assume that that's a lot of 60 percent enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there in Isfahan, and that really is the key.  

“What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over.  Multiple countries around the world will take it and down-blend it.”

Iran still has a stockpile of enriched uranium despite US strikes last night on its nuclear sites, an adviser to its supreme leader has claimed.

“Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn't over, enriched materials, indigenous knowledge, political will remain,” said Ali Shamkhani, a close ally of ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

He added that the “political and operational initiative is now with the side that plays smart, avoids blind strikes. Surprises will continue.”

Seven Revolutionary Guard members and two conscript soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes on two military centres in central Yazd province this afternoon, Iranian forces announced.

The Revolutionary Guard's Al-Ghadir unit in Yazd said the casualties resulted from “aggressions by the savage Zionist regime and its mercenaries” against the military facilities.

“Seven Revolutionary Guard personnel and two conscript soldiers achieved martyrdom, and several others were wounded, with treatment of these dear ones underway,” the unit said.

Iranian air defences are targeting Israeli aircraft over central Isfahan province, state media reported.

“Isfahan air defence operations against hostile aircraft began an hour ago,” Tasnim news agency said.

“Following the detection, identification and tracking of several hostile Israeli aircraft in Isfahan's airspace, air defences immediately activated and are destroying these targets.”

New York is on “high alert” after the US struck three nuclear sites in Iran, according to the state's governor, Kathy Hochul.

“We are not aware of any specific or credible threat to New Yorkers,” Ms Hochul said in a statement. “However, given New York's distinctive global profile, we are taking this situation extraordinarily seriously.”

The Department of Homeland Security has warned the US was facing a “heightened threat environment” and could face attacks or cyberattacks by Iran.

“The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilising to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence,” it said on Sunday.

Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz have urged Iran to return to the negotiating table following US air strikes last night.

The three leaders, from the British-French-German grouping known as the E3, said in a statement:

We have discussed the latest developments in the Middle East earlier today.We reiterate our commitment to peace and stability for all countries in the region. We affirm our support for the security of Israel.We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security. Earlier today, the United States has conducted targeted military strikes against nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Our aim continues to be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.We call upon Iran to engage in negotiations leading to an agreement that addresses all concerns associated with its nuclear programme. We stand ready to contribute to that goal in coordination with all parties.We urge Iran not to take any further action that could destabilise the region.We will continue our joint diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and ensure the conflict does not intensify and spread further.

Masoud Pezeshkian, the Iranian president, has said the US “must receive response to their aggression” following the attacks on Tehran's nuclear facilities.

Donald Trump ordered US defence secretary Pete Hegseth to strike Iran on Saturday, Fox News reported.

A US official told the broadcaster: “The president gave the final order to the secretary of defence yesterday.

“In the week leading up to the strike, the president was continuing to pursue diplomacy, mainly through special envoy [Steve] Witkoff's efforts, while the Pentagon was simultaneously preparing the operation.

“The president was briefed daily on the Israelis' efforts and the operation itself as he decided whether to move forward.”

Tom Cotton, the Republican senator, warned Iran that retaliating would result in “military force” that made Saturday night's air strikes “look like child's play”.

Mr Cotton, a foreign policy hawk who was reportedly influential in pushing Donald Trump towards military action, noted the US had troops stationed in the Middle East and that the president had “no higher priority” than the safety of Americans.

For years, successive US administrations used sanctions and threats to keep Iran in line. On Saturday night, Donald Trump launched strikes on Tehran's nuclear programme in what could be the biggest gamble of his presidency.

He has repeatedly made the case that he doesn't want foreign wars. But his intervention in the Middle East could now trigger an Iranian response with attacks on American interests – including 40,000 US troops in the region.

But the calculus clearly changed in the days after Israel launched its own strikes on Iran. Tehran launched barrage after barrage of missiles and rockets in retaliation, but the terrifying forecasts of thousands dead in Israel never materialised.

At the same time, Iran had given away some of its secrets last year when it launched its own strikes on Israel. That was a fatal mistake, according to Fred Fleitz, who served on the national security council during Mr Trump's first term.

“It gave Israel a chance to retaliate and probe Iran's defences,” he said. “It meant Israel knew Russian air defence systems, that everyone knew were protecting the nuclear facilities, didn't work very well.”

This may be Mr Trump's biggest gamble so far, but he acted only when the odds had started to turn his way.

The Iranian parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz after the US launched strikes against the country's nuclear facilities.

The strait is a key passage through which 20 per cent of global oil and gas demand flows. Major oil producers, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, rely on the waterway to access the open sea.

The closure of the shipping lane would be expected to disrupt global oil supply, causing a sharp spike in prices, and could temporarily restrict the ability of US warships to exit the Persian Gulf.

Iran's security body will now make the final decision on whether to proceed with the plan, state television reported this afternoon.

Esmail Kosari, a revolutionary guards commander, told the Young Journalist Club, a news agency in Iran, that the closure was on the agenda and “will be done whenever necessary”.

It comes after America's leading general said the US military had inflicted “extreme damage and destruction” on Iran's three most critical nuclear sites.

Unveiling details of the mission, dubbed “Midnight Hammer”, Gen Dan Caine said the US had “retained the element of surprise” throughout the operation and claimed there was not a single shot fired at its stealth bombers.

Donald Trump has claimed Republicans are unified “like we have never seen before” in his first public statement since revealing details of US strikes late on Sunday.

The US president wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Great unity in the Republican Party, perhaps unity like we have never seen before. 

“Now let's get the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill done. Our Country is doing GREAT. MAGA!”

While most Republicans have publicly backed Mr Trump over the strikes, Thomas Massie, a Kentucky congressman who has angered the president with his opposition to the “big, beautiful” tax-and-spend bill, claimed the move was unconstitutional.

Iran's Fordow nuclear facility has not been destroyed despite Donald Trump's claim that it was “totally and completely obliterated”, according to reports.

US and Israeli officials told The New York Times that the heavily-fortified site, which is located deep underground, had been severely damaged but not destroyed by the 12 “bunker-busting bombs” dropped on it by US bombers last night.

However, a US official said the facility had effectively been taken “off the table” by the attack.

In a Pentagon press conference this morning, Dan Caine, the chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, said the US had achieved the “the destruction of capabilities” at Fordow but a damage assessment was still ongoing.

The Pope has warned that “war does not solve problems” following US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities last night.

“War does not solve problems; on the contrary, it amplifies them and inflicts deep wounds on the history of peoples, which take generations to heal,” Leo XIV, who was born in Chicago, said in a statement.

“No armed victory can compensate for the pain of mothers, the fear of children, or stolen futures.

“May diplomacy silence the weapons! May nations chart their futures with works of peace, not with violence and bloodstained conflicts!”

Earlier on Sunday, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said the US “not looking for war with Iran” and warned that any retaliation would be “the worst mistake they've ever made”.

War does not solve problems; on the contrary, it amplifies them and inflicts deep wounds on the history of peoples, which take generations to heal. No armed victory can compensate for the pain of mothers, the fear of children, or stolen futures. May diplomacy silence the weapons!…

Authorities are on the alert for a terrorist attack on US soil following the strikes last night, JD Vance has said.

The vice president told NBC: “We know that a lot of people who we don't have full accounting of were let in over the last four years under the Biden administration.

“We know that some of those people were on the terrorism watch list.

“We feel very confident in our FBI and law enforcement that we're on top of the situation, but yeah, we're looking at this very closely. We're doing everything that we can to keep our people safe.”

JD Vance said the US strikes last night had “substantially delayed [Iran's] development of a nuclear weapon”.

The vice president had been asked about Donald Trump's claim that the attack had “completely and totally obliterated” Tehran's nuclear facilities on NBC's “Meet the Press”, but declined to get into “sensitive intelligence about what we've seen on the ground”.

It will be “many, many years before the Iranians are able to develop a nuclear weapon,” he continued. “But again, our goal is that they're never able to develop a nuclear weapons programme.”

JD Vance, the US vice president, has just ridden to the rescue of Mr Trump's defence secretary and other key figures. The media has been rife with rumours that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, had lost the president's confidence and were on the outs.

Mr Vance, a key conduit to a restive part of the Maga base and one of the administration's most effective communicators, says last night's actions show that to be nonsense.

Two thoughts this morning:The operation last night is an incredible testament to American pilots and other service members, from General Caine and General Kurilla on down. While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division,…

“While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team,” he posted on X. “I'm incredibly proud of them, and I know the president is, too.”

Iran will commit “economic suicide” if it blocks off the Strait of Hormuz in response to US strikes, Marco Rubio has said.

The US secretary of state, asked on Fox News if he expected Tehran to close off the strait to disrupt global oil supplies, said: “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil.

“If they do that, it will be another terrible mistake.

“It's economic suicide for them if they do it, and we retain options to deal with that, but other countries should be looking at that as well. It would hurt other countries' economies a lot more than ours.”

Mr Rubio said the move would be a “massive escalation that would have to merit a response not just by us, but from others.”

Lindsey Graham, one of Mr Trump's most hawkish senators, said the president was well within his authority to order strikes.

In the run up to Saturday's attack on Iran, constitutional scholars had pointed out that only Congress - not the president - has the power to declare war.

“He was within his Article II authority, Mr Graham told NBC's ‘Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'. “Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can't be the commander-in-chief.

“You can't have 535 commander-in-chiefs. If you don't like what the president does in terms of war, you can cut off the funding.

“But declaring war is left to the Congress. We've declared war five times in the history of America. All of these other military operations were lawful. He had all the authority he needs under the constitution. They are wrong.”

Article II is the part of the US constitution that gives that gives the president executive authority to take (some) decisions on behalf of the nation.

The US secretary of state has warned Iran that retaliation would be the “worst mistake they have ever made”.

Speaking to Fox News this morning, Marco Rubio said the US was “not looking for war in Iran” but blamed Tehran for not negotiating with Donald Trump.

Iran was “playing games with Donald Trump... the way they played every American president for the last 35 years,” he continued.

Iranian retaliation would be “the worst mistake they've ever made...we can fly in and out of Iran at will,” Mr Rubio warned.

“We're not looking for war in Iran but if they attack us then I think we have capabilities they haven't even seen yet,” he added.

Mr Rubio said Iran's nuclear programme had been “degraded” and “set back from a technical standpoint” but stopped short of saying it had been destroyed outright.

John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser, said the US strikes have left Iran “on the verge” of “regime change”.

Mr Bolton, who has been a frequent critic of his former boss, told CNN that the US president made the “right decision for America”, calling Iranian leadership “very vulnerable” and “in trouble”.

While he suggested Iran would be wary of taking on the US, he said it could seek to close the Strait of Hormuz to damage global shipping, strike US military or civilians, damage oil infrastructure, or launch terrorist attacks around the world.

In that situation, Mr Trump would have no choice but to use “brutal force against the Iranian regime”, he said.

The Iranian parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a key global oil chokepoint through which 20 per cent of global oil and gas demand flows.

Iran's top security body will now make the final decision on whether to close the shipping lane, state TV reported this afternoon.

Such a move could temporarily restrict US warship's ability to exit the Persian Gulf and lead to the disruption of global oil supply, causing a sharp spike in prices.

US strikes on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility left six craters in the ground where American bombs likely entered before hitting their target, a new picture released by Maxar Technologies shows. 

Grey dust and debris can also be seen scattered down the mountainside after US “bunker buster” bombs were dropped overnight. 

JD Vance, the vice president, said the media was to blame for “fake division” over Donald Trump's decision to attack Iran's nuclear facilities.

“While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team,” he said.

“I'm incredibly proud of them, and I know the president is, too.”

His comments come after Mr Trump suggested Tulsi Gabbard, his intelligence chief, was “wrong” to suggest Iran was not close to building a nuclear weapon.

It was the second time that Mr Trump had directly contradicted Ms Gabbard on the issue, with the US president saying on Thursday that he did not “care what she thinks”.

There has also been division amongst Mr Trump's supporters about whether the US should attack Iran. Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, two influential media personalities who supported the president's re-election bid, said it would be wrong to do so.

Two thoughts this morning:The operation last night is an incredible testament to American pilots and other service members, from General Caine and General Kurilla on down. While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division,…

Israel has launched a fresh round of strikes against Iranian targets in the centre and south of the country, according to state news. 

Two military zones were targeted in the region of Yazd, Mher reported, while strikes were also carried out in Bushehr. 

Bushehr is the location the location where another of Iran's nuclear power plants is located. It was not targeted in US strikes overnight. 

The UN's nuclear watchdog warned that striking the Bushehr plant could lead to a “very high release of radioactivity”. 

The US vice president said the White House has been clear that is not seeking a regime change in Iran.

“Well, look, that's up to the Israelis,” JD Vance told NBC's Meet the Press. “But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change. We do not want to protract this or build this out any more than it's already been built out. 

“We want to end their nuclear programme, and then we want to talk to the Iranians about a long term settlement here.”

He has said repeatedly during this interview that Iran faces a choice: if it gives up its nuclear weapons programme then it can have a relationship with Washington.

JD Vance, US vice president, said he won't be drawn into whether the president had new intelligence that necessitated a strike, but he says it would have been irresponsible not to attack Fordow.

In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, “There's, of course, an open question about whether they were weeks away, whether they were months away, but they were way too close to nuclear weapon for the comfort of the president of the United States, which is why he took this action.”

“Now there's another element here too Kristen, which is that we had a narrow window of opportunity, we might not have been able to carry out this attack six months down the road.”

Failing to strike now, might have made a future attack impossible.

“It would have been irresponsible, I think, for the president not to take the action that he did, which is why Fordow was destroyed last night,” he said.

Continuing the press briefing, Dan Caine said that the US is “unaware” of any shots being fired at US bombers on the way in and way out of Iran.

“Iran's fighters did not fly and it appears that Iran's surface to air missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission we retained the element of surprise,” he added.

US forces “employed approximately 75 precision guided weapons during this operation” and more than 125 aircraft, he said.

In the wake of the attack, he said: “Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attack, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend ourselves.”

“B-2 bombers left the US on midnight, with part of the group heading “to the west and into the Pacific as a decoy”, Dan Caine told the briefing.

Meanwhile, seven B-2 bombers “proceeded quietly to the East with minimal communications”, he continued.

“Once over the land the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex tightly timed manoeuvre… all done with minimal communications,” Gen Caine continued.

At around 5pm EST, a US submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles at Isfahan, a nuclear site, he said.

“The US employed several deception tactics including decoys as the fourth and fifth generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude, and high speed, sweeping in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface to air missile threats,” he said.

The US military inflicted “extreme damage and destruction” on Iran's three most critical nuclear sites, America's top general said.

Unveiling the details of the mission, dubbed “ Midnight Hammer”, General Dan Caine said that throughout the operation the US “retained the element of surprise” and there was not a single shot fired at its stealth bombers.

Decoy warplanes were sent West, while the real strike group headed East, before unloading the US's most devastating bombs on Iran's enrichment facilities, while submarines fired Tomahawk missiles.

“Initial assessments indicate that all three Iranian nuclear sites sustained extreme damage and destruction”,” he said, referring to the three sites targeted - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Celebrating its “overwhelming” success, Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said the US completed its mission to “destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear programme”.

Seeking to now de-escalate the situation, he said the US was seeking peace not war and warned Iran against a retaliatory attack.

Iran has vowed “everlasting consequences” in the wake of the attacks, raising fears of strikes on US bases in the Middle East.

Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the US had executed a “deliberate and precise strike against three Iranian nuclear facilities” in “Operation Midnight Hammer”.

“This was a complex and high risk mission carried out with exceptional skill and discipline by our joint force,” he said. “This operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. It was planned and executed across multiple domains and theatres… with speed and precision at the time and place of our nation's choosing.”

Gen Caine said “very few people in Washington” knew “the timing or nature of this plan.”

Donald Trump “seeks peace and Iran should take that”, Pete Hegseth continued.

He praised US Central Command, “who did a phenomenal job”, thanking “every American involved in this operation” who “performed flawlessly” along with the US' allies in the Middle East.

“This was a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we could be ready when the president of the United States called,” Mr Hegseth said. “It took a great deal of precision. It involved misdirection,” he added.

B-2 bombers “were in and out and back without the world knowing at all”.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, called the US strikes against Iran “bold and beautiful”.

He said the mission was to “destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear programme” and called it “an incredible and overwhelming success”.

“We devastated the Iranian nuclear programme. It's worth noting the operation did not target the Iranian troops or the Iranian people,” he continued.

“Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. Many presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear programme. And none could – until President Trump.”

He declared: “American deterrence is back.”

Sir Keir Starmer warned that there was a “risk of escalation” after the US strikes against Iran, both in the Middle East and “beyond the region”.

Asked on Sky News if the UK was prepared to offer military support, the Prime Minister said: “My focus is on de-escalating the situation. I accept your challenge that there is a risk of escalation. That's a risk to the region. It's a risk beyond the region.

“And that's why all our focus has been on de-escalating, getting people back around to negotiate what is a very real threat.

“In relation to the nuclear program, in relation to the UK, we were not involved in the attack. We were given due notice, as we would expect, as close allies to the US, and we have been moving assets to the region to make sure that we're in a position to protect our own interests, our personnel and our assets, and, of course, those of our allies.”

US Defence Secretary Pete Hesgeth is about to give a briefing on the US strikes on Iran. 

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps warned the US to “expect regrettable responses” to its strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites.

Iran, it said, would “use options beyond the understanding... of the aggressor front, and the aggressors of this land must expect regrettable responses”.

The Guards also said they would continue to target Israel, which has been hit by multiple waves of missile and drone attacks since it struck Iran on June 13.

Sir Keir Starmer will chair a meeting of Cobra to oversee Britain's response to the US bombing of nuclear sites in Iran.

The Prime Minister has been working in Number Ten, speaking to political leaders in the region and his ministers amid warnings that the security threat to the UK has been increased by the US operation on Sunday morning.

Sir Keir Starmer once again emphasised that the Government's focus was on de-escalation and diplomacy in response to the US strikes on Iran.

“We were not involved, we were given due notice as we would expect as close allies with the us and we have been moving assets to the region,” he told Sky News.

The Prime Minister refused to comment on what might happen next or how Nato would respond if Iran attacked US bases.

Instead, he sought to reassure the public that that “all necessary measures” to protect UK interests and military personnel had been taken.

Speaking directly to Britons in the Middle East, he said: “I urge all citizens to make contact with the Foreign Office so we can facilitate whatever support is needed.”

The Israeli army said today it had “other goals” in Iran and intended to continue its military offensive.

“We have other goals and we will continue to act until we attain them,” army spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters.

 

The threat of Iranian attacks in the UK could increase in the wake of US bombing of the country's nuclear facilities, a Cabinet minister has warned.

Donald Trump deployed B-2 bombers to strike Iran's three principal nuclear sites overnight, in what he called a “very successful attack”.

The world is bracing for Iran's retaliation after its foreign minister warned there would be “everlasting consequences”.

Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, said that Iran's disruptive spying operations in the UK were “already at a significant level”, with hardly a week going by without an Iranian cyber attack on the UK's infrastructure.

He said: “I think it would be naive to say that wouldn't potentially increase but again, there's a choice here for Iran. Do they want to continue being an agent of instability in the region and the wider world? Where has that got them? Where has it got the Iranian people?

“There is a better course of action for Iran to take here and I think they should consider that.”

In May, police uncovered an alleged terror plot to attack Israel's embassy in London by a group of Iranian nationals.

The UK has already declared Iran and any agents acting on its behalf as a security threat under new laws that force them to register their activities in the UK or face five years in jail.

Mr Reynolds also confirmed that the UK was not involved in the US bombing of Iran's nuclear sites but was told in advance by the US of the attack.

He said the US had also made no request to use the UK military in the attack, either through RAF support from Typhoon fighter jets in RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus or using Diego Garcia military base as a staging post for the bombing.

The international nuclear watchdog said the facilities struck by US bombs overnight in Iran contained little or no nuclear material.

“The facilities targeted today either contained no nuclear material or small quantities of natural or low-enriched uranium, meaning any radioactive contamination is limited to the buildings that were damaged or destroyed,” he said.

Britons in Israel have been told to book on the first Foreign Office charter flight to leave the region in the wake of the US bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities.

The Foreign Office launched a flight registration form for British nationals in Israel and the Palestinian occupied territories to log their details and interest in the flight. It has opened a booking portal and urged all UK nationals to register their presence now.

It said those with greatest need will be prioritised for flights. British nationals plus their non-British immediate family members travelling with them are eligible.

The Foreign Office said all passengers must hold a valid travel document. Non-British immediate family members will require valid visas or permission to enter the UK or remain that was granted for more than six months.

It said it would contact those who are allocated a seat on the flight directly and British Nationals should not make their way to the airport unless they are contacted.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “We are in active conversations about chartering aircraft to get people out. That's not possible at the minute from Israel, because airspace is, of course, closed.”

However, he said the Government aimed to get the first flight out in “hours, not days.”

The US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities were conducted in coordination with the Israeli military, the IDF's chief spokesman said.

During a televised briefing, Effie Defrin did not comment on how or the extent to which the two militaries worked together during the strikes.

 

Most of the highly enriched uranium at the Fordow nuclear facility was moved ahead of the attack, according to a senior Iranian official.

Reuters, citing the official, said the materials in recent days were moved to an undisclosed location in anticipation of an attack on the underground facility.

Personnel numbers were also reduced at the site, the source said.

Satellite images from Fordow on Friday and Saturday showed queues of trucks lining up at the site.

Iran's foreign minister is heading to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin tomorrow in the wake of US strikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities.

Calling Russia a “friend of Iran,” Abbas Araghchi warned that Iran “reserves all options to defend its security, its interests, its people...All options are on the table.”

Mr Araghchi said he will speak to Iran's key ally on how to proceed. “We always consult with each other,” he added in a press conference in Istanbul. 

His visit to Russia will raise significant concerns over what kind of support Moscow is willing to offer Tehran at this moment, which could include sending defence materials, getting involved directly militarily or throwing diplomatic weight behind Iran.

Overnight, Donald Trump deployed B-2 bombers to strike Iran's three principal nuclear sites, in what he called a “very successful attack” that “obliterated” Tehran's uranium enrichment sites.

The world is bracing for Iran's pledged retaliation. Mr Araghchi earlier said there would be “everlasting consequences” for the US strikes.

“We have to respond based on our legitimate right to defend ourselves,” Iran's foreign minister has just said in the wake of the US strikes.

Abbas Araghchi, speaking at a press conference, said diplomacy was no longer an option “in this case”.

He said Iran's response is “necessary”. “It was not Iran but the US who betrayed diplomacy and betrayed negotiations,” he argued.

“There is no red line that they have not crossed and the most dangerous one was last night, they crossed a very big red line by attacking nuclear facilities,” Mr Araghchi said. “It was the rule of law and international law that was bombed last night.”

Iran's foreign minister says the US is “fully responsible” for the consequences of its strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Speaking in Istanbul, Abbas Araghchi said that Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran had not only “betrayed” Tehran, but deceived his own nation.

He said attacking a nuclear facility is an “unforgivable violation” of international law and once again emphasised that Iran “reserves all options to defend its security”.

Iran's missile barrage early this morning wounded at least 86 people, including children.

Several buildings were heavily damaged in the Ramat Aviv area in Tel Aviv, with holes torn in the facades of apartment blocks.

“Houses here were hit very, very badly,” Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai told reporters at the scene. “The damage is very, very extensive, but in terms of human life, we are okay.”

Other missiles hit Haifa in the north and Ness Ziona, south of Tel Aviv, where rubble littered the roads and whole streets had their windows blown out.

The Israeli military announced that it had recovered the bodies of three hostages in Gaza more than 20 months after they were abducted by Hamas militants.

“In a special operation... the bodies of the hostages Ofra Keidar, Yonatan Samerano, and Staff Sergeant Shay Levinson were recovered from the Gaza Strip yesterday,” the military said in a statement.

Ms Keidar, 71, Mr Samerano, 22, and Mr Levinson, 19, were all killed during Hamas's attacks on southern Israel in Oct 7, 2023 and their bodies were taken to Gaza.

Ahead of Donald Trump's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, his defence chiefs would have war-gamed possible retaliation.

Washington has put its 40,000 troops deployed in the Middle East, including in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, on high alert amid escalating tensions.

Now that America has attacked key Iranian nuclear sites with what is reported to be six bunker buster munitions, US defence chiefs will be bracing for a response.

US officials told the New York Times that the strikes against the three nuclear sites were complete and that no follow-up attacks were expected. However, commanders were ready to respond if Iran did choose to retaliate.

Here are the top threats the US must consider: missiles attacks on US bases, capacity to defend, Iran's regional proxies, the possible shutting down of the Strait of Hormuz, strikes on oil infrastructure in the Gulf and large-scale cyber attacks.

The international nuclear watchdog has said it is convening an emergency meeting tomorrow.

Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the decision was taken “in light of the urgent situation in Iran”.

There are nuclear safety fears following the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, however the IARA has reported no increased radiation levels on Sunday.

“Now Khamenei must go,” the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran has urged.

“Khamenei is responsible for an unpatriotic project that, in addition to costing countless lives, has cost the Iranian people at least two trillion dollars—and now, it has all gone up in smoke,” Maryam Rajavi wrote in a statement.

“No to appeasement, no to war—yes to regime change,” she added. The NCRI, founded in 1981, is a broad coalition of Iranian organisations and individuals which aim to establish a democratic republic of Iran.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, sought to reassure Britons caught up in the Iranian conflict that the Government was “making extensive preparations for all eventualities.”

Speaking on Sky News, he suggested Iran's failure to take up a diplomatic solution was to blame for the US bombing.

“We support the prevention of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. We had proposed a diplomatic course of action, as other European countries had done. The Iranians had rejected that,” he said.

“I know people will be waking up this morning, and they'll be worried. They'll want to know what this means, and I do want to give them reassurance that whilst the British government the UK, has not been involved in these attacks, we have been making extensive preparations for all eventualities.”

He said this included “how we look after British nationals in the region and how we get them out, and the assets we have in the region to protect British infrastructure, British bases British personnel if we need to do that.”

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has backed Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran.

He said: “Reform UK stands behind the military actions of the USA overnight.”Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, the future of Israel depends on it.”

Reform UK stands behind the military actions of the USA overnight. Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, the future of Israel depends on it.

The Telegraph understands that the UK was not involved in the US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities and that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was told of the strike plans in advance.

At least 16 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles at the country following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said in a statement that it had “evacuated 16 people to hospital, including a 30-year-old man in moderate condition.”

Iran's foreign ministry has also issued a statement condemning the US strikes and vowing to defend Iran “by all force and means”.

“The war-mongering and lawless regime of the United States of America is held fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far-reaching implications of this egregious act of aggression and heinous crime,” it said.

The statement also called on the UN Security Council to convene an emergency session and for other international bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, to “take urgent and decisive action”.

“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement said.

Sir Keir Starmer has responding to the US strikes against Iran, saying the move helped alleviated the threat of Iran building a nuclear weapon.

“Iran's nuclear programme is a grave threat to international security. Iran can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and the US has taken action to alleviate that threat,” the Prime Minister said in a statement on Sunday.“The situation in the Middle East remains volatile and stability in the region is a priority. We call on Iran to return to the negotiating table and reach a diplomatic solution to end this crisis.”

An Iranian parliament member from central Qom, where the Fordow nuclear site is, located, has downplayed damage to the facility and threatened retaliation against US forces.

Qasem Ravanbakhs said: “The damage inflicted on Fordow facilities is not to the extent that American media and the criminal Trump claim.”

He added:“Trump should order mass production from coffin-making companies as soon as possible to transfer the bodies of American military personnel stationed in the region.” 

The Israeli military said it launched a fresh series of strikes this morning targeting military sites including missile launchers in western Iran.

The air force began “a series of strikes toward military targets in western Iran”, a military statement said, adding it had “struck missile launchers ready to launch toward Israeli territory, soldiers in the Iranian Armed Forces, and swiftly neutralised the launchers that launched missiles toward Israeli territory a short while ago”.

Donald Trump was elected on a promise to avoid foreign wars and international entanglements.

On Saturday night, he sent B-2 bombers into action to obliterate what was left of Iran's nuclear programme, using the sort of deep-penetrating weapons that Israel lacks.

Insiders said this was not a departure from his campaign pledge but a reminder that American power is based on the idea of “peace through strength”.

He is still a leader who puts deals ahead of military action, said one former official speaking before the strikes, but one who recognises that the best deals come when adversaries are negotiating from a weakened position.

He had sent a signal of his intent on Thursday.

“Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” was the quote read by Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary.

In fact, there was no window or deadline.

The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that it has not detected an increase in radiation levels after the US bombed three key nuclear sites.

At least 11 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said in a statement that “11 people were taken to hospital, including one in moderate condition - a 30-year-old man wounded in the upper body by shrapnel.”

Public broadcaster KAN 11 showed images of a devastated building surrounded by mounds of rubble that it said was in central Israel.

Iran's state TV announced this morning that it launched 30 missiles against Israel after the US, its closest ally, bombed several Iranian nuclear sites.

“These live images you are seeing are of a new salvo of Iranian missiles fired on the occupied territories,” said a presenter on air, referring to Israel. Citing “sources”, a presenter said that “30 missiles have been launched at Israel from Iran”.

Benny Gantz, Israel's former defence minister, praised the US for what he called a “historic decision” to make “the world, the Middle East and Israel safer places”.

“I wish to convey to President Trump and the American people my profound appreciation for their leadership, determination and their clear stand with Israel throughout this campaign and tonight particularly against the Iranian regime,” he said.

In breaking news, Iran has reportedly launched ballistic missiles targeting central and northern Israel.

Explosions have been heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Sirens are sounding and everyone is urged to take shelter immediately. 

Medics and security forces are at the scene. No injuries have been reported yet.

These are the first missiles launched in over a day and the first since the US strikes against Iran.

Hamas has issued a statement condemning “in the strongest terms” the US attacks against Iran, according to the Palestine-based Quds Press Agency.

The statement called the strikes a “flagrant violation of international law” and “a direct threat to international peace and security”.

The group also said that it has “complete confidence in Iran's ability to defend its sovereignty and the interests of its people, and to confront this aggression”.

Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has become the highest level Iranian official to speak out following the US strikes, saying that his country “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people”.   

He said that the US had “committed a grave violation of the UN Charter, international law and the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation] by attacking Iran's peaceful nuclear installations”.

“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences. Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior,” he added.

The Israel Airports Authority announced that the country had closed its airspace as an apparent precautionary measure until further notice.

The authority said that “the airspace of the State of Israel is closed to entry and exit due to recent developments”, but the land crossing with Egypt and Jordan are “operating normally”.

The Israeli Defense Force also announced that it shot down two drones from Iran a short while ago. The drones had triggered sirens in Israel's southern Arava region. 

Another drone was also intercepted around midnight over Golan Heights in the northern part of the country.

Drones take many hours to travel so these were likely sent before the US launched strikes against Iran.

Gideon Saar, Israel's foreign minister, has commended President Trump and said that he “wrote his name in letters of gold in the history books” after the US strikes against Iran.

Mr Saar also complimented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's “extraordinary leadership” in initiating the attack against Iran last week.

The B-2 bombers which struck Iran's nuclear sites flew non-stop for roughly 37 hours from their base in Missouri, a US official told The New York Times. They refuelled several times in mid-air en route to Iran.

There is “no danger” to Iranians living near the Fordow nuclear facility, Iranian authorities have said. 

The Crisis Management Headquarters in the province of Qom, where the enrichment plant is located, said in a statement that “there is no danger to the people of Qom and the surrounding area,” according to Iran's official news agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has yet to make a statement on the attacks.

The state-run Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran previously said the strikes were a “barbaric act that violated international law, especially the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty”.

Earlier, another Iranian official previously said that the Fordow had “long been evacuated and has not suffered any irreversible damage”.

Saudi Arabia's Nuclear and Radiological Regulatory Commission has also issued a statement saying that “no radioactive effects were detected in the Gulf states”.

Law enforcement is on the alert for any attacks by Iran on US soil following a series of airstrikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities.

The Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and other agencies are keeping a close eye for potential threats, an official told CNN, following warnings of Iran-backed terror cells operating in the US.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said in a social media post on Saturday: “We will work unceasingly to protect the American homeland.”

Mitch McConnell, the former Republican Senate leader and a regular critic of Donald Trump, praised the US president's decision to strike Iran.

“Seizing this opportunity is not an escalation toward war - it is a prudent response to the warmongers in Tehran,” he said.

“Iran would be foolish to misunderstand American resolve.”

Donald Trump didn't even bother to conceal his contempt of Tulsi Gabbard's assessment of Iran's nuclear ambitions.

“She's wrong,” the US president said on Friday, speaking to media en route to his Bedminster golf course in New Jersey.

Mr Trump has assembled an unusual team for his White House and Cabinet, drawing on close loyalists, Fox News presenters and veterans of Capitol Hill.

But with tensions boiling over in the Middle East he has made the unusual move of sidelining two key national security figures, relying instead on old friends and military insiders.

It means Ms Gabbard, the national intelligence director, and Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, both surprise picks who had impressed Mr Trump with lively performances on Fox News – have found themselves on the outside of discussions.

Read the full story on how Mr Hegseth and Ms Gabbard found themselves outside Mr Trump's inner circle here.

Donald Trump has said Iranian retaliation will be met with “far greater” force.

Following US strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: “ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.”

António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, said that he is “gravely alarmed by the use of force by the United States against Iran today” and that the attack was a “dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge”.

“There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control – with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region, and the world,” he said.

He called on UN member states to de-escalate and “avoid a spiral of chaos”.

Bernie Sanders announced the news of Donald Trump's strikes on Iran live at a political rally.

Mr Sanders shared footage of his Oklahoma rally on X from the moment the news of the attacks on three nuclear facilities broke.

I learned about Trump's unconstitutional attack on Iran at a large rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Here is the response: pic.twitter.com/eziVpp3Y54

Speaking on stage, Mr Sanders said: “This is a statement from Donald Trump...We have completed a very successful attack on three nuclear sites in Iran etc.”

Furious rally-goers then began chanting: “No more war.”

The Left-wing Democrat senator described the strikes as “alarming” and “grossly unconstitutional”.

Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi's political bureau, said that “Washington must bear the consequences,” in a short post on social media.

The Houthis are a close ally of Iran and have helped launch attacks against Israel since 2023. Two days after Israel first attacked Iran, the group announced that it had responded by firing several ballistic missiles at Israel.

Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management System detected abnormal thermal activity near the Fordow facility this evening.

Satellites captured the heat-generating activity around 6:59pm and 7:24pm EST – the last reported approximately 30 minutes before Donald Trump announced the strikes on social media.

This type of activity can be caused by natural events like wildfires or by a bomb.

The White House has released photos from the Situation Room as the attack on Iran unfolded.

Donald Trump, wearing a red Maga cap, appears at the head of the table, flanked by Marco Rubio and JD Vance. 

Donald Trump confirmed that B2 bombers, one of the US' top aircraft, were used in the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.

The four-engine B2, which is flown by a two-person crew, can carry conventional or nuclear weapons and has a payload of 40,000 pounds.

According to the New York Times the B2 bombers dropped at least six 30,000-pound bunker busters on Fordow, citing an anonymous US official.

The same official also said that submarines fired 30 TLAM cruise missiles at the Natanz and Isfahan facilities.

The US Air Force only has 20 B2s in its arsenal, but in 2021, the aircraft were flown to Afghanistan and more recently they were deployed to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen.

“If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes,” Donald Trump says.

The president adds a press conference with take place with Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, and Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, at 8am EDT on Sunday.

Donald Trump has threatened to launch further strikes on Iran if it does not immediately make peace.

“Future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier,” the US president said in an address to the nation following the US attack on three of the country's nuclear sites.

He added: “There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days. Remember there are many targets left.”

Earlier, Mr Trump said the US had attacked Iran's enrichment sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan.

He called the attacks a “spectacular success” and said Iran's nuclear programme had been “completely and totally obliterated”.

Donald Trump says Iran “must now make peace”.

If they do not, “future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier,” he says,

“A short time ago, the US military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime,” Donald Trump says.

The US president continues: “The strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”

Donald Trump is flanked by JD Vance, his vice president, Marco Rubio, secretary of state, and Pete Hegseth, defence secretary, as he starts his speech, warning Iran of more strikes if it does not make peace. 

In his first statement since the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated President Trump for the US' “awesome and righteous might” and said that the strikes would “change history”.

He called Israel's alliance with the US “unshakeable” and said that in bombing Iran's nuclear facilities, “America has been truly unsurpassed”.

“It has done what no other country on earth could do. History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world's most dangerous regime, the world's most weapons,” Mr Netanyahu said.

He also praised Trump's leadership as a “pivot of history” that can “lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace”.

“President Trump and I often say peace through strength. First comes strength, then comes peace and tonight President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength,” Mr Netanyahu said.

Steve Bannon has said the US' strikes in Iran tonight are “probably the biggest and boldest” move of Donald Trump's presidency.

Mr Bannon, a key voice in Mr Trump's Maga movement and a former White House chief strategist, said he doubled the US president would want to get entangled in a protracted conflict in the Middle East.

“We have now become a combatant in this war between Israel and the Persians. I guess you say it's now a broader war, although it looks like the president is trying to keep this to a very tactical strike,” he said on his “War Room” podcast.

In the US, “an overwhelming majority of the people don't want to get involved in any of this,” he said, adding: “Now, we're involved.”

Mr Bannon, who has been sceptical about the US intervening in the conflict between Israel and Iran, met Mr Trump for lunch at the White House on Thursday. The same day, the president said he would make a decision on whether to strike Iran within two weeks.

Democrat firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran is “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment”.

The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.

In a post the politician, known as AOC, said: “The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorisation is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.

“He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.

“It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.”

Donald Trump just spoke to Reuters by phone and threatened more strikes.

He said: “They should make peace immediately. They should stop immediately. Otherwise they'll get hit again. They should make peace immediately or they'll get hit again.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congresswoman, sent a reminder of Mr Trump's political jeopardy while US planes were still in Iranian airspace.

”Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” she posted before the president announced strikes. 

She added: “This is not our war.”

Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war.There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.Israel is a nuclear armed nation.This is not our fight.Peace is…

She changed her tune after Mr Trump's announcement, but she also raised fears about attacks on American soil

”Let us join together and pray for the safety of our US troops and Americans in the Middle East,” she wrote on social media.

“Let us pray that we are not attacked by terrorists on our homeland after our border was open for the past 4 years and over 2 million gotaways came in.”

Iranian state television has allegedly said that every American citizen and military personnel in the region is now a target.

Unverified footage shared on social media shows a Iranian state news television presenter with a graphic behind him of the Middle East, where red flags appear to mark possible military targets.

Addressing Donald Trump directly, the presenter allegedly said: “You started it, and we will end it,” according to unverified translations of his remarks.

The US dropped six “bunker-busting bombs”, otherwise known as GBU-47s, on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, according to Fox News.

The weapons, each of which weighs 15 tons, were carried by American B-2 stealth bombers, which were deployed to the Middle East earlier today.

John Thune, the Republican leader in the Senate, said Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran has put the country's efforts to build a nuclear weapon “out of reach”.

“The regime in Iran, which has committed itself to bringing ‘death to America' and wiping Israel off the map, has rejected all diplomatic pathways to peace. The mullahs' misguided pursuit of nuclear weapons must be stopped,” Mr Thune said in a statement.

“As we take action tonight to ensure a nuclear weapon remains out of reach for Iran, I stand with President Trump and pray for the American troops and personnel in harm's way.”

After Donald Trump approved an operation to strike Iran, US defence chiefs will now be bracing for Iranian retaliation.

The US has in recent days repositioned aircraft carriers to the Middle East in what defence secretary Pete Hegseth called a “defensively postured” manoeuvre.

The nuclear-powered USS Nimitz was redirected to the region, while USS Gerald R Ford and the USS Carl Vinson may also work as back up to deter a response from Tehran.

Any military response from the Islamic Republic is likely to come in the form of strikes through its proxies in Yemen, where Houthis have already said that the strikes represent the “beginning” of a war.

Iran also has the means to effectively shut down access to the Straits of Hormuz, tucked between the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf's western flank, potentially crippling shipping through the region, as there are no alternative routes.

Nothing hurts a government more than the price of oil, and this narrow stretch of water between Oman and Iran is vital in the global supply.

A host on Iran's state TV news declared following the US air strikes: “Mr Trump, you started it, and we will end it.”

The broadcaster displayed a graphic of US bases in the Middle East which are said to be within firing range of Iran.

A US official has said American forces in the region are prepared for a retaliation by Iran and are not planning further strikes.

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, reportedly spoke following US air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The US also alerted Israel before launching the attacks.

John Fetterman, the Democrat senator, has said US air strikes were the “correct move”.

Me Fetterman, a staunch support of Israel, said in a post on X: “As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS [Donald Trump].

“Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities.

“I'm grateful for and salute the finest military in the world.”

Iranian media has claimed the strikes struck by the US do not contain nuclear material.

“There are no materials in these three nuclear sites that cause radiation,” IRNA, the Iranian state-affiliated media channel said, quoting an official.

Iranian authorities appear to be suggesting they removed enriched uranium from the facilities in advance of the bombing raid.

Donald Trump is not planning additional US strikes on Iran and is hopeful today's attack will see Tehran return to the negotiating table, sources told US media.

Mr Trump apparently came to believe in recent days that US intervention would be needed to take out Iran's nuclear facilities.

Despite the president's hope for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, American forces in the Middle East are said to be prepared for retaliation by Iran.

The Houthis have called US strikes on Iran the “beginning of war”.

Mohamed al-Farah, a member of the Yemeni group, told Al Jazeera that Mr Trump's decision will not be the end of the conflict.

“Destroying a nuclear facility here and there is not the end of the war, but it's the beginning,” he said in a statement. “The time of hit and run is gone.”

It comes after the Houthis threatened to attack US ships in the Red Sea if America joined the conflict, in breach of a recent ceasefire agreement.

When Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, read the president's words on Iran on Thursday it seems like much of the world may have come away with the wrong message.

“Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” was the actual quote.

But headlines around the world suggested that Mr Trump had just announced a 14-day window for Iran to come to the table, glossing over the fact that his actual words suggested a decision could still be made sooner than that. There was no two-week deadline.

Concerned officials in the West Wing quietly started briefing out that anything could still happen any time.

Mr Trump himself clarified the position on Friday when asked when he might take action: “I'm giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum.”

Saturday night's events show how true that was.

Mike Johnson, the US House speaker, has said that the US's strikes against Iran serve “as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that president Trump means what he says”.

“The president gave Iran's leader every opportunity to make a deal, but Iran refused to commit to a nuclear disarmament agreement,” Mr Johnson wrote on X.

He added that the decision to launch an attack on Iran was “America First policy in action”, seeking to quell dissent among isolationists within Mr Trump's Maga base.

Donald Trump will meet with his National Security Council tomorrow, CNN reported.

In a post on X, the network's chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins said: “President Trump returns to the White House tomorrow and has a national security meeting on his schedule at 6pm in the Oval Office.”

The US may send B-2 stealth bombers back to Iran if the Fordow nuclear site remains in action, according to reports.

White House sources told Andrew Neil, the former editor of The Sunday Times, that the stealth jets “will be back” if the bunker buster munitions have not destroyed Iran's nuclear bunkers.

“Getting indications from the White House that if the bomb assessment damage concludes the bunker busters have not quite done their job in Iran then the B2's will be back, especially to hit Fordow again,” Mr Beil wrote on X.

Iran has not launched any missile attacks on Israel so far tonight, marking a rare quiet period since hostilities first broke out a week ago. 

Simone Ledeen, the former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East in Mr Trump's first administration, said: “It's a really powerful message to China and Russia and whoever else thinks that the US has gone weak and that Trump is just about making deals.”

She also pointed out that Mr Trump had not given Iran 14 days of breathing space. He had said he would make his decision “within two weeks.”

“Obviously people could read into that that he was saying there was more time than there was. But the reality is that he already given Iran 60 days to reach a deal. And he clearly meant it,” she said.

Democrats and Republicans have been left divided over Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran.

Dan Crenshaw, a Republican congressman, posted on X: “support the president.”

He added that it is “wrong” to think a US attack will lead to soldiers deploying.

The president's decision was also supported by John Fetterman, a Democratic senator, who said “Iran is the world leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities”.

Meanwhile, Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who is tipped as a future leader of the party, called for Congress call a vote to “prevent America To another endless Middle East war”.

Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defence minister, has said Donald Trump took a “bold decision”.

In a post on X he said: “President Trump took a bold decision for the United States, for Israel, for all of humanity.

“The world is now a safer place.”

Mr Trump had spent Friday night and much of Saturday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

But in a sign of a fast developing situation, he flew back to the White House just before 10pm UK time (5pm EST) .

He didn't speak to his travelling press pool at any point.

He then went directly to the West Wing where he was meeting with his top security officials.

His announcement that strikes had been conducted arrived three hours later.

Gabriel Noronha, a state department Iran adviser during Mr Trump's first term, said the president had gone way beyond simply focusing on the key site of Fordow.

“I think what Trump is doing by hitting three sites is he's going all in,” he told the Telegraph.

“It's not just a pin prick, but he is saying... he is putting the finishing blow to the Iran nuclear program, and he is owning that, and he is embracing that, and he's going to want the credit for that as well, and he deserves it.”

Donald Trump will address the nation at 3am UK time (10pm EST) after the US launched strikes on Iran.

The Fordow plant, 20 miles from the central city of Qom, is considered so naturally protected that there is just one weapon in the world able to blow it up.

The US's 30,000lb GBU-57F/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or “Mop”, can penetrate around 60 metres underground before exploding.

With weapons-grade uranium suspected of being manufactured at the site and hazardous raw materials, experts warned a strike could have severe effects.

The Mop is thought to be able to penetrate through 61 metres of concrete and is considered the only weapon able to directly threaten the site itself.

It can only be dropped by a B2 stealth bomber, which can carry two at a time. The bomb is designed to penetrate and detonate at the maximum possible depth to neutralise interred threats such as bunkers.

Donald Trump has reposted the message “Fordow is gone” on his site Truth Social.

He shared a post from a page called Open Source Intel that said: “Fordow is gone.”

The US president earlier said America had completed “our very successful strikes” on three nuclear bases.

Mr Trump said Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan had been hit.

The decision to bomb Iran comes after the US moved four B-2 stealth jets to its military base in Guam on Saturday morning.

The B-2 is designed for long-range missions and is the only aircraft capable of delivering the 30,000-lb “Massive Ordnance Penetrator” (Mop) precision-guided bunker busters that could be used to destroy Iran's underground nuclear plant at Fordow.

It is not yet clear which munitions the US has used to strike Iran's three nuclear sites.

Iran has pledged to retaliate if it joined the Israeli assault and the US has already begun removing key personnel from Embassy in anticipation of a strike.

Aside from the threat from Iran, the conflict is incredibly risky for the president, who won the White House on the promise of keeping America out of costly foreign conflicts and scoffed at the value of American interventionism.

 

Trump's decision to enter the conflict comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran.

The strikes have moved to systematically eradicate the country's air defences and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. 

US and Israeli officials have maintained that American stealth bombers and a 30,000-lb. bunker buster bomb  offered the best chance of destroying heavily-fortified sites connect Ed to the Iranian nuclear program buried deep underground.

Donald Trump said the US has completed a “very successful” attack on Friday.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said the Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites were targeted.

“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and [Isfahan],” he wrote.

“All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home.

“Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

The US has launched strikes on Iran, bombing three of its nuclear sites, Donald Trump has announced.

MOSCOW, June 23. /TASS/. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will hold a series of talks in Moscow, including a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

As Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to TASS, the top Iranian diplomat arrived in Moscow on Sunday night "to hold several talks." Iran's IRNA has reported that the Iranian foreign minister is going to consult with the Russian leader and high-ranking officials on the issues of the regional and international agenda due to the US and Israel's strikes on Iran.

Earlier, Araghchi himself said that he has a meeting with Putin slated for Monday.

Coastal Carolina head coach Kevin Schnall slammed umpires at the Men's College World Series on Sunday following the Chanticleers' loss to the LSU Tigers.

Schnall was ejected in the first inning after an argument with home plate umpire Angel Campos. He said his ejection wasn't justified and he was wrongly accused of bumping an umpire who appeared to trip and fall to the ground when he came over to break up the commotion.

"If you guys watch the video, there was a guy who came in extremely aggressively, tripped over Campos' foot, embarrassed in front of 25,000, and goes, ‘Two-game suspension' and says, ‘Bumping the umpire,'" Schnall said. "There was no bump. I shouldn't be held accountable for a grown man's athleticism. Now it's excessive because I was trying to say I didn't bump him.

"It is what it is. If that warranted an ejection, there would be a lot of ejections. As umpires, it's your job to manage the game with some poise and calmness and a little bit of tolerance."

The NCAA said Schnall was arguing balls and strikes, which was heard on the broadcast. The NCAA added that the head coach was given a warning.

Since LSU won Game 2 and the College World Series, Schnall's suspension would start in the 2026 season. The NCAA said Schnall and first-base coach Matt Schilling engaged in "prolonged arguing," which triggers a two-game suspension. Schilling is likely to be suspended for three games — one for the ejection and two for "prolonged arguing."

Schnall said he couldn't hear Campos' initial warning when he was arguing balls and strikes. He added that he wasn't "sorry" for what transpired.

"As a head coach, it's your right to get an explanation for why we got warned," Schnall said. "I'm 48 years old, and I shouldn't get shooed by another grown man. When I came out, I got told it was a warning issued for arguing balls and strikes, and I said it was because you missed three. At that point, ejected. If that warrants an ejection, I'm the first one to stand here like a man and apologize."

Coastal Carolina athletic director Chance Miller said Sunday night the ejections "altered the trajectory of a must-win game for our team."

"These decisions were made with an alarming level of haste, without an attempt at de-escalation, and deprived our student-athletes of the leadership they have relied on throughout a historic postseason run," Miller said.

"This is not about a single call — it's about process and professionalism. In the biggest moment of the college baseball season, our program and its student-athletes deserved better."

Miller implored the NCAA to re-evaluate its training methods and how it assigns and reviews umpires in championship settings.

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) — Divers searched a section of Lake Tahoe on Monday for one person still missing after seven others were killed when a boat capsized during a powerful weekend thunderstorm that whipped up high waves, authorities said.

Ten people were on board the 27-foot (8-meter) gold Chris-Craft vessel when it flipped Saturday afternoon near D.L. Bliss State Park on the lake's southwest edge, U.S. Coast Guard officials said.

Two people were rescued immediately and taken to a hospital in unknown condition. Six bodies were recovered later Saturday and a seventh body was found Sunday evening, according to the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office. Their names won't be released until family members are notified, Sgt. Kyle Parker said.

The intensity of the thunderstorm surprised even forecasters, who had predicted some rain but nothing like the sudden squall that lashed the southern part of the lake around 3 p.m., said meteorologist Matthew Chyba with the National Weather Service office in Reno, Nevada. Winds topped 35 mph (56 kph) and waves swelled more than 8 feet (2.5 meters).

“We weren't expecting it to be so strong,” Chyba said Monday. He said temperatures in the area were 15 to 25 degrees below normal for this time of year, which could have contributed to the unstable air mass.

Eight-foot waves on Tahoe is “pretty significant,” Chyba said. “They were really rocking the lake.”




Lake Tahoe is a popular summer recreation destination for boaters, kayakers and paddleboarders. The pristine lake with very cold water straddles California and Nevada and is one of the deepest in the country, second only to Oregon's Crater Lake.

Rescue crews and divers scoured the area Saturday evening for the remaining victims and resumed efforts Sunday morning before the Coast Guard eventually called off its search. El Dorado County sheriff's deputies continued searching Monday with help from other agencies from California and neighboring Nevada, Parker said.

The storm Saturday cleared out within about two hours.

Chris Williams, a party boat operator with Tahoe Sports, was one of four company captains on the lake Saturday when the weather turned. He was stunned by the force of the storm and the size of the swells.

“We braved the weather and came back during some severe wave heights that have never been seen on Lake Tahoe,” Williams told the San Francisco Chronicle. “We were pushing the vessels to their maximum capabilities while making sure to keep all clients safely aboard.”

While all guests from Tahoe Sports charters returned safely, Williams said two boats from the company's Tahoe Keys location broke from the pier and washed ashore.

Video obtained by KCRA-TV showed moored boats at a nearby marina crashing into one another amid strong gusts.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's strike on Iran, the pushback from both lawmakers and Trump's call for a regime change.

The War on Terror led to regime change in Iraq and a briefly democratic Afghanistan — at least until former President Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal. More recently, a separate conflict between Israel and Iran saw the U.S. step in to help destroy nuclear facilities — but observers should pause before making any apples-to-apples comparisons between the two eras.

The image of then-White House chief of staff Andrew Card whispering in President George W. Bush's ear during an elementary school reading event that the Twin Towers had been hit by terrorists began a continuing three decades of U.S. involvement in the Middle East.

The Middle East and the world writ-large was a different place back then, Heritage Foundation senior China and National Security Policy studies fellow Steve Yates told Fox News Digital.

Yates previously served in the Bush administration as a top national security affairs adviser to then-Vice President Dick Cheney. More recently, he co-chaired the 2016 RNC's platform subcommittee on national security.

"The world has changed an awful lot in 20 years," Yates said, when asked to compare the two administrations.

"And I think that my perceptions of things have changed a great deal, in no small part, because I've had as a primary focus, among all other things in the world, what's happening with China."

During the Bush years, the Chinese Communist Party was led by Hu Jintao, who Yates quipped was the "definition of boredom" compared to the feistier Xi Jinping.

The differences there and in the Mideast have presented challenges to the U.S., Yates said.

President Donald Trump leads essentially the first "post-globalist" presidency as the world "awaken[ed] from" its "globalist moment" since the 1990s.

"None of those things were factors in the early 2000s. And I think that context is vital to try to see how things are handled now," he said.

"Frankly, I am a supporter of President Trump and what he's been trying to do. I think he's very clear that he's willing to use decisive force when he judges it to be necessary."

US MILITARY TROOPS IN MIDDLE EAST COULD FACE INCREASED THREATS AMID IRAN CONFLICT

In the Middle East, American intervention during the War on Terror led to dictator Saddam Hussein being deposed, and a decades-long ground war ensued.

Iran, at the time, was led by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — a more prominent president. Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei has become the more prominent global figure as of late, over current President Masoud Pezeshkian.

And, while the War on Terror led to boots on the ground, Yates noted Trump has been clear that he wants Mideast allies and their Western-friendly neighbors to carry their "fair share" of risk and responsibility for what happens in the region — which has been marked by conflicts since the time of Jesus Christ.

"In that, Israel has been very clear. They haven't asked for American boots on the ground. To my knowledge to this point they haven't asked for much of anything other than rhetorical support," he said, prior to the U.S. dropping MOP bombs from B-2s on Saturday night.

Yates foreshadowed that Trump has made clear he is ready to use "decisive American force" if necessary to prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation.

"That is a definable objective… That is not a war of occupation or trying to ‘remake Iran in our image' as some [have] characterized Iraq, whether fairly or unfairly."

"So I think that the president has navigated this with deeper logic than most people give credit."

The question at this time in history is more whether "the Old World" will act on their shared interest in supporting a non-nuclear Iran or similar outcome in a meaningful way.

He referenced the "EU-3" — Germany, Great Britain and France, the three largest European economic powers — and said they had previously been a "moderating force" in negotiations that allowed Tehran to "mitigate sanctions" and go back on promises made.

But the EU-3's model failed to solve the problem, revealing that the early 21st century style of diplomacy — which often pulled the U.S. into conflicts — may no longer be effective. Israel's decisive response to October 7 only underscored that point.

"I still have a lot of gratitude and respect for my colleagues back in the Bush administration. I just see us as a world in a fundamentally different place," he said.

"And I would give President Trump pretty high marks on how he's balanced equities — keeping true to his definition of what America First means, but also true to standing by allies in times of need."

The president is being unpredictable on Iran. Here's how to think about what's next. 

Over the weekend, the United States bombed three nuclear facilities in Iran. Iran has been considered a political risk to America since the 1979 revolution, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that it cannot be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. The strikes mark yet another attempt in a long-running US strategy to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions.

But whether Trump's strikes will achieve his stated aim of destroying Iran's nuclear program is unclear. It doesn't help that his plan around the attacks has felt haphazard. Trump said Iran had a two-week deadline before he would authorize a strike — then attacked only two days later. Even just before the bombs were dropped Trump was telling the press that targeting nuclear facilities may not even be an option, saying “I may or I may not do it.” Trump stated in his 2024 election victory speech that he was “not going to start a war,” yet he has now hinted on social media that regime change could be next.

Trump could be accused of simply being chaotic here. But this is a deliberate strategy. Trump has a history of being intentionally unpredictable when it comes to foreign policy, known as the unpredictability doctrine. Drawing from his experiences in his previous career in business, Trump says being predictable is bad. When the other side doesn't know what you are going to do, you are in control. His plan is also about creating uncertainty. You make your opponent unsure of what they are facing and unable to make decisions in response, leaving you to take the advantage.

But foreign policy is not business, and a strategy that works with corporations may backfire on the world stage. While nobody knows exactly what will happen next, what can we work out about the implications of Trump's actions now given what has worked (or hasn't) before in terms of nuclear arms control? 

Countries may consider military strikes on nuclear facilities when they feel that the other side won't cooperate in negotiations. For example, Israel, believing that Iraq would never be serious about a diplomatic solution, bombed an Iraqi enrichment facility at Osirak in 1981 to stymie the nuclear program. The preventive attack did serious damage to the facility, and Israel claimed they had disrupted Iraq's ability to produce a nuclear weapon by destroying the facility before it became functional. A similar aim was likely a factor in Trump's thinking on targeting Iran.

Yet military strikes are rarely as clear-cut as they look on paper. They may seem like a simple solution to a dangerous problem by stopping a nuclear program in its tracks. They also deliver results faster than diplomatic options, which can take a lot of time and do not come with any guarantee of a solution.

But while Trump may like to think that a few strikes will do the job, using bombs now could create problems for any future US strategy toward Iran — whatever that strategy turns out to be.

The first problem is that we do not yet know whether the strikes were entirely successful in taking out the targets. To work properly, a military attack should completely destroy the target facilities to ensure they cannot work. If a facility is even partially functioning after a strike, that state can still run a nuclear program, albeit a reduced one. While Iraq did not go on to develop nuclear weapons after Osirak, it still had sufficient resources to maintain a plan. In fact, some experts argue that the attack only encouraged Iraq to pursue this.

While there is evidence of physical damage after Trump's strikes, whether this is enough damage to undermine Iran's nuclear capability remains uncertain. Trump is saying that the three targeted facilities in Iran were “obliterated.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also reported that the attacks have “devastated the Iranian nuclear program.” Iran, however, has downplayed the extent of the destruction. The fact that Trump's former aide, Steve Bannon, can't even pronounce the name of one of the facilities, Fordow, properly doesn't exactly build confidence in the administration's assessment.

It's also unclear how many nuclear facilities are left outside of the three that were bombed. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently cautioned that there could be clandestine facilities that we just do not know about. Trump himself has claimed there are “many targets left,” which indicates that Iran still has at least part of an operational program. 

And now, any future efforts by Iran would also likely be even more secretive and underground, making it more difficult to detect and target in potential future strikes.

Even if the US has destabilized the nuclear plan, Iran can still rebuild. In 2010, America tried to disrupt the Iranian program in a cyberattack using a computer worm called Stuxnet against the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. The virus caused the reactors there to slow down and crash. The attack did a lot of damage but — as the current situation shows — Iran was able to continue the program. 

So it's possible that the recent bombings could slow down Iran's progress, but it won't eliminate the overall and long-term risks. It also will not affect Iran's ability to retaliate with conventional weapons.

A second problem is that the bombings could now attract such a retaliation. Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has already said that the US “must receive a response to their aggression.” Iran has also publicly stated that it is considering a “proportionate” responses. This could potentially look like a repeat of Iran's response to the 2020 assassination of General Qasem Soleimani in which Trump ordered a drone strike against the Iranian leader. Trump said the killing was to prevent a terrorist attack against a US embassy. Responding to Soleimani's death, Iran launched a retaliatory attack against two US air bases in Iraq.

The incentive for Iran to retaliate is even greater this time. The US has not just taken out a key leadership figure but directly threatened the state itself and its nuclear program at a time of intense conflict with Israel — and the US, where Trump is seen as having entered the war as a result of the weekend strikes. There is now an even higher chance that Iran will fight back this time because it is already fighting, and it could use that war as an opportunity to target the US.

Upping the game by using bombs will also encourage escalation by the US. This may be exactly what Trump wants. Yet it is also the case that the situation makes it difficult for him to do anything else. If Iran doesn't show signs of giving in and continues its nuclear ambitions, Trump may be forced to take further action. If he doesn't, it would look like Iran has won, even with three facilities destroyed.

So what's next?

While suggesting that regime change could be in the cards, Trump has also talked about a diplomatic solution, and this is what many other states would prefer. Using diplomatic negotiations instead of bombs has proven effective — at least partially — in the past, as seen by international agreements to control the global proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Negotiations have also convinced countries, such as Ukraine, to give up their nuclear arsenals. Trump has even relied on diplomacy with states that he has tense relationships with, like North Korea, although some analysts question how effective this has been, not least given that North Korea still has nuclear weapons. 

If Trump is serious about diplomacy, then the bombing will make this difficult at best, impossible at worst. Trump was clearly hoping that the attacks might soften Iran up for negotiations if he decided to go down that road. He said the attacks should be taken as a sign for Iran to “make peace” or face “far greater” attacks in the future. This strategy isn't working so far.

When Trump initially threatened strikes, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that such a move would “undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage” to US-Iran relations. Iran has now repeated this line, saying the impact of the strikes will have “everlasting consequences.” There's no evidence that Iran would allow itself to be forced into negotiating through threats alone. The solution in Ukraine worked because it was based on a peaceful and collaborative process, not because it was done under duress.

It is also worth remembering — as Iran certainly will — that Trump is the one responsible for the failure of a previous diplomatic solution. He was the one who walked away from a nuclear deal called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This agreement — between Iran and the US, China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and Germany — aimed to restrict Iran's nuclear ambitions through demands, such as getting rid of its medium-enriched uranium and not build heavy-water reactors. In return, these countries would reduce their economic sanctions on Iran. 

Trump said this was a “one-sided deal” that “didn't bring peace, and it never will” and pulled out in 2018. Whatever misgivings he had about the deal, it means the US will find it hard to introduce new diplomatic measures now. Trump's perceived lack of commitment reduces the chance that Iran would be willing to talk cooperatively with the US and its allies. While Iran was clearly willing to work diplomatically before, why would it now sit down with someone it feels can't be trusted to stick to an agreed solution? This is especially the case when that someone has just bombed them and is now talking about regime change.

Whatever Trump has planned next, his decision to carry out strikes has radically limited both his options and the chances of de-escalation. Based on what we've seen in previous attempts at arms control and conflict resolution, Trump may have unnecessarily inflamed the conflict, left the US open to Iranian retaliation, ruined the option of future diplomacy, and provoked Iran into developing a nuclear weapon. This is a strategy that has a high chance of exploding at some point — if not now in terms of an Iranian escalation, then in the future in the form of a revitalized nuclear program.

• Iran's operation against US base: Iran has begun an operation against a US base in Qatar, Iran state TV reports. The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter. 



• Response to US strikes: Iranian military officials and members of parliament have vowed that the US will pay a price for its strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump alluded to the possibility of regime change in Iran in a social media post Sunday. There has been no word yet from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
    


            • Damage assessment: The US bombing likely caused “very significant damage” to the underground parts of Iran's Fordow nuclear site, the UN's nuclear watchdog said Monday.
    


            • Iran-Israel conflict enters 11th day: Both countries have continued to trade strikes. Israel said it launched an attack at “the heart of Tehran,” including Iran's notorious Evin prison and access routes to the Fordow nuclear facility, while several waves of Iranian missile attacks were reported in Israel.
    


            A Doha resident and father of two told CNN that loud explosions rocked the city, but Qatari authorities did not give any warning to citizens to take shelter.
    


                    “Our kids were totally taken by surprise and didn't know what to do when we scrambled them to shelter. There was no warning from Qatar authorities to take shelter. There appear to be a lot of outgoing fire and intercepts,” he said.
                





            Qatar's defense ministry said its air defenses “successfully” intercepted a missile attack targeting the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, adding that the attack did not results in any deaths or injuries.
    


            Iran has launched a “powerful and destructive missile attack” on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in response to the US striking its nuclear facilities, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement.
    


            “The Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on Almighty God and the faithful, proud people of Iran, will never leave any aggression against its territorial integrity, sovereignty, or national security unanswered,” the statement read.
    


            US personnel at the embassies in Qatar and Bahrain are in “duck and cover” positions as Iran launches retaliatory missiles toward Qatar and Iraq, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The protective measure is taken when there is notification of imminent danger, sources said.
    


            The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine are in the Situation Room, according to a White House official.
    


            A senior official said earlier that White House and Defense Department officials were monitoring potential attacks threats to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. President Donald Trump toured the base last month, the first commander in chief to visit since 2003. It is the largest US military installation in the Middle East.
    


            “No visit in the Gulf would be complete without stopping to salute the people who keep America safe, strong and free,” Trump told the troops at the base on May 17.
    


            Iran has begun an operation against a US base in Qatar, Iran state TV has reported.
    


            An official briefed on the matter also said missiles have been launched by Iran on the US-run Al Udeid Air Base.
    


            American officials have been preparing for the likelihood that Iran could target US facilities in the wake of this weekend's strikes.
    


            France's foreign minister condemned Israel's strike on Iran's notorious Evin prison, known for housing political prisoners including two French nationals.
    


                    “The strike aimed at Evin Prison in Tehran put in danger two of our nationals, Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, hostages for the past three years. It's inacceptable,” Jean-Noël Barrot said in a post on X.
                





            Kohler, a 40-year-old teacher, was on holiday in Iran with her partner, Jacques Paris, in May 2022 when they were stopped by authorities and arrested on suspicion of espionage. In October 2022, Iranian state television broadcast a forced confession from the pair that saw Kohler unveil herself as an agent working for France's intelligence services, the DGES.
    


            French authorities and nongovernmental organizations including Amnesty International have repeatedly said the pair were coerced into making false confessions and have called for their immediate liberation.
    


            Barrot said in his social media post Monday he had demanded an update on their safety and called for “consular access as soon as possible.”
    


            Moscow's partnership with Tehran is “unbreakable,” Russian's deputy foreign minister said Monday, adding that Iran has the right to self-defense.
    


            Iran “is acting within the framework of the implementation of the right to self-defense, this is an absolutely legitimate and correct presentation,” Sergei Ryabkov told reporters, Russian state news agency TASS reported.
    


            “We interact with Iran in many areas,” the senior diplomat said, answering a question about whether Iran had requested military assistance from Russia.
    


                    “It is clear that it would be irresponsible on my part to disclose the content of those contacts that are ongoing, including today, taking into account all the circumstances,” he added. “I want to emphasize that our strategic partnership with Iran is unbreakable,” he said, according to TASS.
                





            Ryabko's comments come after Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored the Kremlin's support for Tehran earlier in the day during a meeting with Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Moscow.
    


            Taking a swipe at the United States' actions, he said: “We see that they are trying to deal with Iran, they are trying, at least, in the language of ultimatums. But this language is not being accepted: neither in Tehran, nor in other capitals.”
    


            “We need to stop the escalatory actions and we need to change the rhetoric, then there will be a greater chance of some kind of political solution,” the deputy minister added.
    


            Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran did not start or want war but would not leave what he called “aggression” against the country unanswered.
    


            “We will stand by the security of this beloved nation and respond to every wound on Iran's body with faith, wisdom and determination,” he said on X.
    


            The US has seen indications that Iran is making preparations to attack US military installations in the Middle East, including the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, according to two officials familiar with the matter.
    


            American officials have been preparing for the likelihood that Iran could target US facilities in the wake of this weekend's strikes.
    


            Iran launched several waves of missiles that were reported in Israel.
    


            Dashcam video captured today shows the moment when a missile hit near the city of Ashdod, Israel. Emergency service crews have been dispatched to areas that have been reported to have been impacted by strikes.

            Qatar decided to temporarily suspend air traffic in the country today as “precautionary measures” due to regional security concerns.
    


                    “In line with the State of Qatar's commitment to the safety of citizens, residents, and visitors, the competent authorities announce the temporary suspension of air traffic in the country's airspace,” the Qatari Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “This is part of a set of precautionary measures taken based on developments in the region,” it said.
                





            Authorities “are closely and continuously monitoring the situation, assessing developments in coordination with regional and international partners,” the statement added.
    


            Qatar's airspace shutdown coincides with Iran's threats to retaliate against the United States, following US strikes on its nuclear facilities over the weekend.
    


            Earlier, the US embassy in Qatar issued a warning to Americans in the Gulf country to “shelter in place until further notice” as tensions in the region spiral.
    


            The British government has followed the US in advising its citizens to shelter in place in Qatar.
    


            Citing the US warning earlier Monday, the UK government said in a statement:”Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that British nationals in Qatar shelter in place until further notice,” adding they provide further updates “as the situation develops.”
    


CNN's Andrew Potter and Kara Fox contributed reporting to this post. 



            Iran's air defense systems were activated to intercept “hostile targets” in Ahvaz city, in the southwest region of the country, state-affiliated Fars News Agency reported today.
    


                    “An explosion was heard in western Ahvaz, outside the urban area, and simultaneously, air defense systems were activated against hostile targets,” Fars said.
                





            The state-run IRIB network also reported that Ahvaz's air defenses had been activated, without providing more details.
    


            Israel launched a fresh new wave of attacks at the “heart of Tehran” and hit Iran's notorious Evin prison earlier today.
    


More on the prison: Security forces at the Evin detention center are known for their long record of human rights abuses. Political activists, journalists and musicians are among those who have been incarcerated at the facility.
    


            Watch the moment when Israeli strikes hit the prison:
    

The Israeli military attacked Iran's notorious Evin prison on Monday, according to Israel's defense minister and Iranian state news. Iran's state broadcaster IRIB published video of the entrance to the prison which has been geolocated by CNN.


            French national carrier Air France has suspended all scheduled flights to Tel Aviv until July 14, citing the security situation as Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks.
    


            After carrying out an assessment of the “situation on the ground,” the carrier made the decision to cancel all flights from Paris to Tel Aviv until July 14, the company said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday.
    


            Multiple other flights to destinations in the Middle East have been canceled over the past two days. Today, Air France flights to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia from Paris were both canceled.
    


            Air France said affected customers will be offered the option to postpone their flights or receive a reimbursement.
    


            The company stressed it has been “constantly monitoring developments in the geopolitical situation of the territories served and overflown by its aircraft, to ensure the highest level of flight safety and security.”
    


            Oil prices turned solidly negative today as energy markets shrug off the risk that the US strikes on Iran lead to even more instability in the region.
    


            US oil spiked as much as 6.2% yesterday, briefly touching $78.40 a barrel.
    


            However, that rally proved short-lived as oil futures have since gone into the red. As of 10:40 a.m. ET, US crude was down about 1% to $73.15 a barrel.
    


            Brent, the world benchmark, also fell about 1% after having surged Sunday night.
    


            The White House is closely monitoring the situation in the oil market.
    


            “EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post as US markets opened on Monday. “I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!”
    


Keep in mind: The fear is that Iran retaliates by trying to close the Strait of Hormuz, the most critical oil chokepoint on the planet. Each day about 20 million barrels of oil flow through the narrow waterway.
    


            Oil markets are waiting for evidence of an actual disruption, Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, told CNN.
    


            “Traders have seen a lot of false alarms when it comes to geopolitical disruption risk in the oil market,” he said. “Unless there's a material interruption in gulf energy, production, or flows, I think any further spikes will be contained.”
    


            President Donald Trump has spent the last 24 hours closely tracking the developments — and the reaction — following US strikes on Iran Saturday night, according to multiple US officials.
    


            He has held regular meetings with his senior staff as he's been updated, the officials said. He still plans to attend the NATO summit in The Hague this week, though two officials cautioned that his travel plans could change if something major arises.
    


            Trump also warned “everyone” today to keep oil prices down. He told the US Energy Department to “Drill, Baby, drill.”
    


                    “EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” he posted on Truth Social Monday morning.
                





            “To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!!  And I mean NOW!!!” he said in a second post.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier Monday warned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz — a move that could have disastrous consequences for global oil markets.
    


            A 95-year-old Holocaust survivor was killed in an Iranian missile attack in central Israel earlier this month, local officials reported today.
    


            Yvette Shmilovitz was killed in an attack on the Israeli city of Petah Tikva on June 16, the authorities said in a statement. Three other people were also killed.
    


            She is survived by her three granddaughters and four great-grandchildren, authorities said.
    


            As of Monday, at least 24 people have been killed in Israel, according to the country's government office.
    


                    “On behalf of the residents of the city, I send a heartfelt embrace to the family and offer strength during this difficult time,” the municipality statement read. “We bow our heads and mourn the murder of four residents of our city.”
                





            The Israeli military said it has thwarted “dozens” of Iranian drones in recent days using “advanced electronic warfare systems.”
    


                    “The UAVs arrive from Iranian territory into Israel and we help intercept them on an ongoing basis,” the Commander of the 5114th Battalion at the Spectrum Warfare Center, identified as “LTC B,” was cited as saying in a statement by the military.
                





            The Iranian government wants the United States to “directly pay for the war, rather than standing behind Israel and pursue its project without having to pay the cost,” a senior Iranian official told CNN on Monday.
    


            The decision by US President Donald Trump to order strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday sparked a wave of anti-US sentiment in Iran, with many calling for retaliation.
    


            A large anti-US and anti-Israel protest took place in Tehran on Sunday evening, with many in the crowd demanding revenge. Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran 11 days ago and the two countries have been striking each other daily since, leaving hundreds of people dead.
    


                    “Morale is high and the immense demand by the Iranian people to strike Israel is unprecedented,” the official told CNN, adding that calls by the Iranian public to strike Israel are “an element in intensifying Iran's battle plans.”
                





            The official told CNN that Iran believed that calls for a temporary pause to the war were a “deception in order to assess Iran's preparedness for continuing the war.”
    


            They added that Iran estimated the war could last up to two years and that Iran was prepared for that.

Nick Wright reacts to the scuffle involving Caitlin Clark in the Indiana Fever vs. Connecticut Sun game. He breaks down whether Clark's rising stardom is making her a target on the court and what it means for her future in the WNBA.

An awkward on-air silence occurred during ESPN's broadcast of the Indiana Fever-Las Vegas Aces game on Sunday after analyst Rebecca Lobo said, "That's what makes America great."

Lobo's comment was in reference to saying she disagreed with officials making a foul call in the final minute of the Aces' 89-81 win over the Fever. 

"They disagree with you," play-by-play announcer Pam Ward said to her partner Lobo.

"They do, and I disagree with them," Lobo responded. "And that's fine. That's what makes America great, right Pam Ward?"

After asking that question, there was a long silence between the two before Lobo said, "I should rephrase that," to which Ward responded, "Yes."

Ward, then, suggested Lobo say "difference of opinion," which she agreed. She even said "sorry about that" before continuing to call the game. 

CAITLIN CLARK'S SHOCKING COLD STREAK CONTINUES AS FEVER CRUMBLE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO ACES

The Caitlin Clark-led Fever were down for the second straight game, as the reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year struggled shooting from the three-point line yet again.

After going 0-for-7 in the loss to the Golden State Valkyries last Thursday, Clark was just 1-for-10 in Las Vegas. While she could not find the stroke from long range, the Aces came back in the fourth quarter to beat the Fever, who led through the first three periods of the game.

Clark went 7-of-20 from the field with four made free throws for a total of 19 points. 

Meanwhile, three-time league MVP A'ja Wilson and her 24 points for the game started taking over on their home court in crunch time. 

Teamed up with Jackie Young (19 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals) and Chelsea Gray (18 points, three rebounds, three assists), Wilson and the Aces outscored the Fever 31-20 in the fourth quarter to run away with the victory. 

While Clark was struggling with her jumper in this game, the Fever were seeing great contributions from the game's leading scorer, Aliyah Boston, who had 26 points on 12-of-19 shooting, and Kelsey Mitchell, who had a big chunk of her 20 points in the fourth quarter to keep Indiana in the game.

However, after Mitchell's three-pointer tied things at 69 apiece with five minutes to play, the Aces strapped in and started to pull away, thanks to some key baskets from Young, Wilson and Gray. 

The West Coast schedule continues for the Fever with a final game against the Seattle Storm on Tuesday before heading back home.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's strike on Iran, the pushback from both lawmakers and Trump's call for a regime change.

The impact of the border crisis under the Biden administration likely added fuel to the fire of an Iranian sleeper cell threat domestically, according to a former top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who briefly led Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Following the strike on Iranian nuclear sites by the U.S. on Saturday, DHS issued a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning about the risk of domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed or inspired perpetrators.

"Definitely," former acting ICE director and Fox News contributor Jonathan Fahey said when asked if the Biden border crisis likely made matters worse domestically.

"I think one thing that's really concerning about that: One, they weren't doing any really meaningful vetting in the last administration. The second part of it is, you know, we have probably 2 million known gotaways come through the last administration, and the people that went through the non-ports of entry, we knew they went through but nobody caught them, so we have no idea who went through," he added.

Fahey noted that other countries were likely paying close attention to the heavy flow of people crossing into the country illegally. He briefly led ICE toward the end of Trump's first term and was the former deputy assistant secretary at the DHS.

"But the thing that's concerning is all of our adversaries knew at the time that we basically, in all intents and purposes, had an open border. So, to the extent they wanted to send people in to spy, to collect intelligence, to do us harm, to plan to do us harm in the future, they had carte blanche to get anyone in that they wanted to with really little or no resistance," Fahey said.

"That's what makes what Biden, the Biden-Mayorkas open border just so unconscionable," he said.

Fox News reported that roughly half of the 1,500 Iranian nationals who came through illegally during the Biden administration were let go into the U.S.

"The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the Homeland," the DHS bulletin stated.

"Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks," it continued.

Other national security experts also doubled down that the releases and gotaways during the Biden administration continued to pose a risk.

"We don't know where those thousand Iranians are and who knows how many others got across the border. We missed an opportunity when they caught and released those thousand. We missed the opportunity to gather intel by interviewing them and thoroughly vetting them. We just simply let them go, which is gross negligence on the part of the Biden administration," former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker told Fox News Digital.

Border czar Tom Homan also sounded the alarm about gotaways on "Sunday Morning Futures" right after the Iran strikes.

"We don't know who they are, where they came from, because they got away because border patrol is so overwhelmed with the humanitarian crisis that Biden created. Over two million people crossed the border and got away. That is my biggest concern. And that's what created the biggest national security vulnerability this country's ever seen," Homan said. 

When it comes to known releases, the Trump administration released nobody in May, compared with roughly 62,000 releases under the Biden administration last May, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.

Chris Broussard joins Colin Cowherd to discuss the NBA Finals, the sale of the Los Angeles Lakers, and trade destinations for Kevin Durant. 

While the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated the team's first NBA title since relocating in 2008, the Indiana Pacers were reeling from Game 7's loss in the NBA Finals. 

It came down to one final game after a grueling battle throughout the regular season and postseason for both teams, but one was always going to come out victorious over the other. It was the home Thunder who ran away with it in the second half, and the emotions of the loss were hard for some Pacers players, including veteran guard T.J. McConnell. 

McConnell, who poured in 16 points after Indiana lost Tyrese Haliburton for the game with a right Achilles injury, was clearly emotional as he left the court following the 103-91 loss.

The devastation of falling just short was still setting in as he walked through the visitor's tunnel accompanied by Karen Atkeson, the Pacers' vice president of Player Relations. 

The two embraced as they walked toward the locker room, and McConnell stopped to lean on Atkeson's shoulder to presumably let out all of his emotions. 

THUNDER BLOW OUT PACERS IN GAME 7 TO WIN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP

An ESPN camera was capturing the moment, and Atkeson did not appreciate it, shooing away the cameraman while comforting McConnell. 

"Stop, stop," Atkeson was heard saying while waving the camera away from her and McConnell.

McConnell was also spotted sharing a hug with Pacers great Reggie Miller, who was in the Paycom Center supporting his former team in Game 7. Miller, in the back hallways leading to the locker room, consoled McConnell, who remained emotional after the game. 

The Pacers and Thunder were trading blows on the offensive end once the game began, but Haliburton's Achilles injury put a damper on what could have been a fantastic end for him after hitting all but one of his four three-point attempts in the first quarter. 

McConnell and the other Pacers were tasked with picking up the slack, and though the 10-year veteran did his part, Indiana had trouble with turnovers and the Thunder capitalized. 

McConnell completed his sixth NBA season with the Pacers after beginning his career with the Philadelphia 76ers.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against President Donald Trump bombing the nation's three nuclear sites.

“I can assure you the administration is actively and closely monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz and the Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision,” Leavitt told reporters during a gaggle Monday morning. 

IRAN MAY CLOSE STRAIT OF HORMUZ AMID ISRAEL CONFLICT. HOW DOES IT AFFECT THE WORLD'S OIL

The Strait of Hormuz is a key water route for oil and gas, with any disruption likely leading to higher gas prices in the U.S. A quarter of the world's oil passes through the strait, which is roughly 100 miles long and 21 miles wide.

The press secretary's comments mirror Secretary of State Marco Rubio‘s statements, also warning Iran against closing the strait.

“It would be a suicidal move on their part because the whole world would come against them if they did that,” Rubio said on CBS News's Face the Nation on Sunday. 

The president floated the possibility of “regime change” in Iran after other U.S. leaders, including Vice President JD Vance, claimed the attacks against the Middle Eastern nation were not an effort to topple its leaders. 

“It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday. 

Leavitt further explained that Trump was raising questions about the future of Iran if it continues on its quest for nuclear weapons. 

“The President was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking,” Leavitt explained. “If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks — we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know — but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night.”

Rep. Mike Haridopolos joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss an upcoming House vote on codifying DOGE spending cuts and the Senate working through President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.'

EXCLUSIVE: The Senate's DOGE leader is hoping to give the U.S. Treasury another boost in cutting the $36 trillion national debt, this time by selling off some major real estate in Washington, D.C., currently home to several prominent cabinet agencies.

The headquarters of the Departments of Energy, Housing & Urban Development, along with ancillary buildings home to other top agencies, would be sold off but without attrition or layoffs, as the employees therein would be relocated elsewhere, according to Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the caucus' chairwoman.

The "For Sale Act" would put the James Forrestal Federal Building on the market, one of six properties identified by the Senate DOGE Caucus as ripe for removal from the federal government's portfolio.

The imposing modernist structure, which hovers across L'Enfant Plaza as a cross between an office building and a pedestrian bridge, was once known as the "Little Pentagon" and home to overflow Department of Defense personnel during the Vietnam War.

The Department of Energy moved in after then-President Jimmy Carter created the agency in 1977.

Several other buildings along Independence Avenue in the Federal Center section of Washington – so named for its panoply of federal offices – would hit the market as well.

Directly west of the Forrestal, one of the Agriculture Department's outbuildings on Independence is on DOGE's list for mandatory sale.

That building is at about one-quarter capacity and is in need of nearly $2 billion in upgrades or maintenance, Republicans said.

Ernst quipped the Agriculture building is the perfect "fixer-upper" to be on the market.

The Hubert H. Humphrey Jr. building – named for former President Lyndon Johnson's vice president – can be seen by traffic glancing right as they exit Interstate 395's Third Street Tunnel near the U.S. Capitol.

It houses the Department of Health and Human Services and would also be required to be put on the market within 18 months of the For Sale Act's passage.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development's headquarters is also on the list, as the curved X-shaped granite building, officially called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is "underutilized," according to DOGE's rubric.

The Theodore Roosevelt Building, at the foot of Interstate 66 just west of the White House, along with the Frances Perkins Federal Building on the other side of the city, rounds out the list.

The legislation would also have safeguards against foreign entities buying up the buildings – as China and other rivals have purchased land by proxy very close to sensitive installations like a major Air Force base in North Dakota.

Additionally, any entity in which a foreign national is a "beneficial owner" would be prohibited from participating in any federal real estate sales.

Taxpayers shell out about $81 million to maintain underutilized or unutilized federal offices, according to a Biden-era report to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget.

About 7,700 federal office spaces are vacant and 2,200 are majority-empty, according to a Congressional Research Service report.

Annual maintenance on 277,000 federal buildings tops $10 billion per year, according to an April Government Accountability Office report.

Ernst and DOGE previously successfully mandated the sale of the aging Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building in Federal Center. Within its 1.2 million square feet, only 72 people were working there as of 2024. 

It formerly housed offices for Voice of America and the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors.

LEVELLAND, Texas (AP) — Dozens of researchers are chasing, driving and running into storms to collect fresh hail, getting their car bodies and their own bodies dented in the name of science. They hope these hailstones will reveal secrets about storms, damage and maybe the air itself.

But what do you do with nearly 4,000 melting iceballs?

A lot.

Researchers in the first-of-its-kind Project ICECHIP to study hail are measuring the hailstones, weighing them, slicing them, crushing them, chilling them, driving them across several states, seeing what's inside of them and in some cases — which frankly is more about fun and curiosity — eating them.

The whole idea is to be “learning information about what the hailstone was doing when it was in the storm,” said Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini, one of the team's lead scientists.

It's peak hail season across the Great Plains, and dozens of researchers studying the extreme weather are chasing, driving and running into storms to collect fresh hail. Here's what happens to them after they've been collected.

It's pushing midnight on a Friday in a Texas Walmart parking lot, and at least 10 vans full of students and full-time scientists are gathering after several hours of rigorous storm chasing. Hailstones are in coolers in most of these vehicles, and now it's time to put them to the test.

Researchers use calipers to measure the width, in millimeters, of the hailstones, which are then weighed. So far after more than 13 storms, the biggest they found is 139 millimeters (5.5 inches), the size of a DVD. But on this night they are smaller than golf balls.




Once the measurements are recorded in a laptop, the fun starts in the back of a van with a shark-festooned beach blanket protecting the floor.

The hail is put on a vertical device's white holder. Jake Sorber, a meteorologist at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, squeezes a hand grip about a foot above it and another white block comes crashing down, crushing the ice to smithereens. In the front of the van, Ian Giammanco, another IBHS meteorologist, records how much force it took to cause the destruction.

“That tells us about its strength,” Giammanco said.

Different teams do this over and over, with the debris littering vans. It's all about trying to get good statistics on how strong the typical hailstone is. On this night, Gaimmanco and colleagues are finding the day's hail is unusually soft. It's surprising, but there's a good theory on what's happening.

“In hailstones we have layers. So we start off with an embryo, and then you've got different growth layers,” said Central Michigan University scientist John Allen. “That white growth is what's called dry growth. So basically it's so cold that it's like super cold liquid water freezing on surface. ... All the gas gets trapped inside. So there's lots of air bubbles. They tend to make a weak stone.”

But don't get used to it. Less cold air from climate change could conceivably mean harder hail in the future, but more research is needed to see if that's the case, Giammanco said.

“Damage from a hailstone is not just dependent on how fast and the exact amount of energy it has. It's how strong are these hailstones,″ Giammanco said. ”So a really soft one is not actually going to damage your roof very much, especially an asphalt shingle roof. But a really strong one may crack and tear that asphalt shingle pretty easily.”

Mostly researchers grab hail to test after it falls, wearing gloves so as not to warm or taint the ice balls too much.

But to collect pristine hail and get it cold as soon as possible, there's SUMHO, a Super Mobile Hail Observatory. It's a chest-high metal funnel that catches hail and slides it directly down into a cooler. No contamination, no warming.

Most of these pristine hailstones go directly to a cold lab in Colorado, where they are sliced with a hot wire band saw. The different layers — like a tree's rings — will help scientists learn about the short but rapid growth of the ice in the storm, Gensini said.

Scientists will also figure out what's in the hail besides water. Past research has found fungi, bacteria, peat moss and microplastics, all of which helps researchers know a bit more about what's in the air that we don't see.

After weeks of collecting these ice balls, Central Michigan student Sam Baron sampled the fruit of his labors.

“It tastes like an ice cube,” Baron said. “It's like the good ice that they serve at restaurants.”

Videos reveal the hidden lives of animals in the borderlands and how the wall affects them.

The border wall between the US and Mexico is, of course, a barrier meant to prevent human migrants from crossing into America as they seek work, family, or refuge from violence. 

It's also a significant barrier to ranging wildlife. 

The border wall, a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's agenda, cuts through a rugged, unique ecosystem home to hundreds of native species, from jaguars and pumas to black bears and deer. These animals often need to move to survive, whether to find a source of water or a mate. 

We know the wall is impassable for many species, potentially lowering their chance of survival. How exactly the border affects this rich ecosystem, however, has largely been a mystery. 

A new study, among the first of its kind, finally offers some answers — by essentially spying on animals near the border. For the research, ecologist and lead author Ganesh Marín, then a doctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, set up 85 motion-sensing cameras in northeastern Sonora, Mexico, along and south of the US border in Arizona and New Mexico. Throughout the course of the research, when animals walked by, the cameras began recording. 

Over roughly two years, from 2020 to 2022, the cameras captured hundreds of hours of footage, including more than 21,000 clips with mammals, said Marín, a National Geographic Explorer and postdoctoral scientist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Partners. 

“This place is so special because you see these tropical species, like ocelots and jaguars, at the same time as beavers and black bears,” Marín told me earlier this year when I was reporting on borderland jaguars. 

Some of the recordings are pretty incredible. In this clip, for example, a young puma, or mountain lion, makes a chirping sound, likely calling for its mother. 

Or check out this jaguar approaching the camera. This particular cat is known as Bonito. Scientists first detected this cat in 2020 and can identify him by his markings. 

Marín's cameras detected another jaguar, as well, called Valerio. He was seen by cameras multiple times in a protected area known as Cuenca Los Ojos just south of the border in Sonora. 

The camera traps caught black bears and their cubs… 

…bobcats and coyotes… 

…and even an ocelot, an elusive predatory cat. 

Analyzing the videos ultimately revealed several important details about wildlife in the borderlands. Marín found that large mammals, such as black bears and deer, as well as some smaller herbivores, spend less time near the border than in other, more remote stretches of his study region. That suggests these animals avoid border infrastructure. 

Other species, like the pronghorn, which have been seen on the US side of the border, didn't appear in his cameras at all. That may be because they have trouble crossing a highway that runs roughly parallel to the border in Sonora, according to Marín and his co-author, John L. Koprowski, a biologist at the University of Wyoming.

Meanwhile, smaller common predators like coyotes and bobcats appeared more tolerant to human activity: They were more likely to use habitats with cattle, cars, and dirt roads, according to the footage. 

The study adds to a growing body of research showing that the border and infrastructure around it is disrupting wild animal communities.

“Amazing wildlife is present in the borderlands due to the binational efforts to protect and restore the flow of life between both countries,” Marín said in an email. “We should not define this beautiful region and the creatures that roam by the existence of an imposed division.”

Americans' support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that U.S. adults' support for tax credits for electric vehicles and solar panels has weakened, as well as their enthusiasm for offshore wind farm expansion. While Democrats remain the strongest supporters of these initiatives, the poll reveals signs of growing cynicism within their ranks.

The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies. 

The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating.




About 6 in 10 Democrats, 58%, favor tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, down from about 7 in 10 in 2022. Among independents, support declined from 49% in 2022 to 28%. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn't changed measurably. 

“As far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit.




The decline in favoring solar panel tax credits was across the board rather than being concentrated among Democrats.

“For solar panels, in all honesty, I don't think they're that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I'd rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. I may be wrong on that, but that's just my thought.” 

Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump's executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects. 

Fewer than half of U.S. adults, 44%, now say that offshore wind farms should be expanded in the U.S., down from 59% in 2022. About half favor expanding solar panel farms, while about two-thirds were in support in 2022.

When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll.

“I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said.

Trump has championed the expansion of offshore oil drilling, as well as domestic coal production. 

Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining.

In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources.

Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support.

The Energy Star program that certifies appliances, such as dishwashers and refrigerators, as energy efficient recently appeared in headlines when the EPA made plans to scrap the program. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently. 

The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans.

Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can't afford new ones,” he said.

The poll found only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults are “extremely” or “very” confident in the federal government's ability to ensure the safety of their drinking water, the air they breathe and the meat, poultry, fruits and vegetables they buy in grocery stores. 

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults are “somewhat” confident in the federal government's ability to ensure the safety of each of these, and about 4 in 10 are “not very” or “not at all” confident.

The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California's efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The federal government has also cut staff at the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with protecting public health and ensuring food supply safety.

Nick Wright reacts to the scuffle involving Caitlin Clark in the Indiana Fever vs. Connecticut Sun game. He breaks down whether Clark's rising stardom is making her a target on the court and what it means for her future in the WNBA.

Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham is gelling quite nicely with her new teammates this season, and her pre-game outfit before Sunday's matchup against the Las Vegas Aces proves that point. 

Her shirt, in particular, had quite the cheeky message of just how tight she is with a certain duo. 

Cunningham, who has recently seen her popularity in the WNBA grow after defending Caitlin Clark on the court against the Connecticut Sun, donned a shirt with herself, Clark and fellow guard Lexie Hull on it with the words "Tres Leches" printed as well.

"Tres Leches" translates from Spanish to "Three Milks" – as we said, quite the cheeky message from Cunningham. 

However, in the spirit of athletes showcasing their support and bond with teammates, Cunningham leaves no reason to doubt how much she loves her women in the locker room on and off the court. 

She was also doing it with her words recently, as she spoke in fiery fashion to reporters about having to physically defend Clark this past Tuesday against Sun players. She called out the WNBA and its referees for "not protecting" Clark.

She got into a physical altercation with Jacy Sheldon after the latter poked Clark in the eye, which quickly led to a skirmish when Marina Mabrey shoved the reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year onto the hardwood. 

Cunningham, Sheldon and Sun guard Lindsay Allen were ejected from the game with about 40 seconds left after Cunningham fouled Sheldon hard underneath the basket on a fast break. 

"During that, it was just part of the game," Cunningham told reporters. "I think the refs had a lot to do with that. It was a build-up for a couple years now of them just not protecting the star player of the WNBA. At the end of the day, I'm going to protect my teammates. That's what I do."

Last season, while Clark was breaking rookie and league records, there was a lot of debate about whether the league was protecting her on the court, as teams got very physical with her to potentially disrupt her game.

Since Cunningham joined the Fever this season, she has been vocal even on the sidelines when Clark or any of her teammates are getting roughed up. Additionally, when she has checked into the game, Cunningham is sure to step between anyone who is messing with her teammates, as evident during the incidents with Clark. 

As a result of being a good teammate to one of the league's faces, Cunningham's popularity has skyrocketed, and that shows in her social media following. She had fewer than 400,000 followers on TikTok prior to last Tuesday's game against the Sun. She now has 1.3 million and counting on that platform. 

On Instagram, the number was more than 300,000, and it now stands at more than 839,000.

If Cunningham was not already showing herself as the Fever's "enforcer" enough, she has the credentials to back it up, as she is a black belt in Taekwondo. 

Cunningham and the Fever, though, want to win games as well as make a physical statement when needed. They have dropped back-to-back games now after losing to the Aces on Sunday, when she had nine points, six rebounds and one assist over 24 minutes.

Terron Armstead retired from the NFL after 12 seasons with the New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins, and he has not spared any details when explaining why now is the right time to step away from the game. 

It is the first time since he was 5 years old, a total of 28 years, that he will not be playing for a football team this fall. However, Armstead shared some grueling injury stories that led the offensive tackle to hang up his cleats. 

Why did the 33-year-old share his personal injury journey? Now on the outside looking in, he wants to be the voice for players going through similar situations in the NFL today.

"Now that I'm done, I would like to start sharing more of my stories because there's players that are actively playing who are dealing with similar situations," he told Fox News Digital at Fanatics Fest on Friday. 

"So, I want to be a voice for them and allow the fans to know that they can't necessarily speak on their injury. Because you never want to have those built-in excuses before a game, like, ‘I lost on this play because of my knee.' You know what I mean? Never want to have that."

For NFL fans, it sometimes gets lost in the heat of competition and highlight-reel plays how much of a toll the 17-game-plus season can take on a player's body, especially a lineman like Armstead. Years of training and competing on the gridiron takes its toll, and Armstead said his ailment was a knee injury he constantly had to battle through since his third year in the league. 

"I didn't see a practice field at all, and not because I didn't want to or the Dolphins just wanted me to rest. It's like I literally couldn't walk," he said during an appearance on the "Nightcap Show."

"After a game on Sunday, I wouldn't be able to walk on my own, under my own power, until Wednesday, Thursday. So, I was only able to play under the pain meds. I couldn't put any pressure on my knee, so it was like, I can't keep doing that to myself."

So, no, Armstead is not going to be one of those retirees who will get the urge to get back on the field come Week 1. 

"I think I'm done, I'm at peace with it. I'm excited to be on this side to talk about the game, share my knowledge and experience.

"After being in the game for so long, and playing football for so long since five years old, it's definitely bittersweet. It's my first year without it after 28 years, so I'll see what this life is going to be like without football. I'm so grateful and appreciative for it, but I'm excited for my future."

While he may be off the sidelines, Armstead still wants to make an impact on the game he loves dearly, especially for those players who continue to put their bodies on the line each year to hunt for a Super Bowl title alongside their teammates.

NATO members are bending over backward to get in President Donald Trump‘s good graces ahead of a summit that will invite questions about how much they contribute to their own self-defense.

Member nations, anticipating Trump's complaints about their defense spending, are poised to announce plans to commit 5% of their gross domestic product to defense as they meet in the Netherlands on Tuesday and Wednesday at The Hague.

But after Trump's abrupt departure from last week's G7 summit in Canada, new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, is not relying on defense targets alone to please the president.

Rutte, for example, has implemented Department of Government Efficiency-like spending cuts at NATO that echo the Pentagon‘s own efforts to streamline operations.

Although most NATO secretary generals try to introduce reforms, there is “definitely” a sense of urgency this year because of Trump, according to Kathleen McInnis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“It's safe to say that the NATO headquarters is taking a hard look at efficiencies because they want to make sure, be able to make the case to not just President Trump, but other heads of state and government, that they are being wise and efficient with the allocation of resources for NATO common budgets, and the headquarters, and things like that,” McInnis told the Washington Examiner. 

NATO also announced last week that the summit would be truncated to minimize the chances of Trump leaving The Hague early. The concluding communique, too, is expected to be similarly short at only five paragraphs and will emphasize defense spending and Russia as a “direct threat,” but not a pathway to membership for Ukraine.

NATO leaders, more broadly, have a strong sense of how the summit will go under Trump, given this will be his fifth as president.

“This will be the fifth time we have watched this movie,” said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, so “there's some understanding about what his priorities are.”

“Allies know that they show up, they remain focused on the things that keep the U.S. engaged rather than enraged, they shake hands, and they go home,” Rizzo told reporters during her think tank's pre-summit press briefing.

“To me, that's fine because, in my opinion, you know, joint communiques, they're important, but they are largely symbolic,” she added. “The real work happens when you leave, and you go back to your various capitals and you go back to NATO headquarters, and you start to implement the actual agreements that were agreed upon.”

There will be practical consequences for Ukraine after Trump did not meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky last week during the G7. Zelensky's presence at this year's NATO summit will be purposefully understated as well because of Trump, with the leader attending a pre-meeting dinner with Dutch King Willem-Alexander but having no sitdown confirmed with Trump.

Just last year, then-President Joe Biden made a public show of support for Ukraine with the summit in Washington, D.C., resulting in a new Ukraine mission, the NATO Support for Training and Assistance in Ukraine command, and a directive to draft a Russia strategy. That directive has since been delayed because of disagreements over how to deal with the Kremlin.

On the conflict with Russia and Ukraine's aspirations of joining NATO, Rizzo conceded: “Looking back at last year's summit, where the statement was that Ukraine's bridge to NATO is going to be short and well lit — well, it seems like that bridge is actually very long and dimly lit.”

Max Bergmann, the director for CSIS's Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program, downplayed concerns about Trump's commitment to NATO and multilateralism after his early departure last week from the G7, arguing “Europeans were already rattled” following statements from the administration on its desire to deprioritize Europe and NATO from the likes of Vice President JD Vance.

“Trump's departure from the G7 was sort of seen as perhaps necessary, given the events in Iran, but also a sign of Trump not caring that much,” Bergmann told the Washington Examiner during a briefing call with his think tank.

“I think where Europeans tend to come down is they are merely hoping to get through these summits with a sort of commitment to have another summit next year or in the future,” he added. “And they're just sort of hoping to kind of get through these events without sort of a broader rupture in the alliance.”

At the same time, there are hopes that Trump's expressions of frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead him to drive a harder line with the Kremlin, particularly as momentum builds in the Senate for sanctions on Moscow.

“The fact is, unless Putin can pull off a miracle and prove to Trump that he can give the Americans everything they want out of Iran without going to war, Trump will still be pulled back along with the American Senate and others into a confrontational relationship with Vladimir Putin,” said Benjamin Jensen, director of the CSIS Futures Lab.

“I know that Trump left the G7 early. I know his administration says disparaging things,” he added. “But I think it's better to really look at those larger structural conditions and the fact that even a smaller U.S. presence with intelligence support, long-range fires, and logistics still will help — with the new defense plans that were developed — Europe defend itself against an emboldened Russia.”

The summit's single, two-and-a-half-hour leaders meeting will underscore the 5% defense spending pledge, alongside discussions about the NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion framework.

Under that framework, NATO member states are working together to build their domestic industrial bases, encourage coproduction, and share best practices to spend 3.5% on hard defense capabilities, with the remaining 1.5% to be spent on other security-related needs and so-called “resilience” costs. 

Examples related to infrastructure are constructing bridges that can withstand the weight of tanks, cybersecurity, and space.

While Estonia, Greece, Poland, Turkey, and the U.S. are already close to spending 3.5% of their GDP on hard defense capabilities, Spain has undermined the 3.5% proposal, with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez advising his counterparts last week that his country “cannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP.” 

When asked about NATO's 5% defense spending pledge, Trump told reporters that the U.S. should not have to make the same commitment because it has been “paying almost 100% of the cost” for most of the alliance's history.

“NATO is going to have to deal with Spain,” he said Friday in New Jersey before a fundraiser. “Spain has been notorious for low pay. You know who else was a low payer? Just about the lowest. A place called Canada, because Canada said, ‘Why should we pay when the United States will protect us free?'”

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official described the defense spending pledge as “historic” because it will “strengthen the alliance's combined military capabilities and ensure greater stability in Europe and the world.” 

“This effort builds on the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending increases already achieved across the alliance since 2017 thanks to President Trump's diplomacy in his first term,” the administration official told reporters during a press call.

“The president will urge allies to revitalize their industrial capacities in order to create Western supply chains capable of producing the critical minerals, infrastructure, weapons, and other products necessary for the security of America and her allies,” the official added.

The problem with pancreata.

Below is a graph showing a trend that exploded during the 2020s:

What is this depicting? Compute use for AI? Crispr gene edits per year?

No, this is another, much less-known example of massive growth these past several years. This is a chart of the number of pancreases (or, to use the correct plural, “pancreata”) collected each year from dead bodies in the US for research purposes:

How this happened is no mystery. The surge is, by all accounts, due to a regulation that took effect in 2021 focused on groups called organ procurement organizations (OPOs).

You probably haven't heard of OPOs, but if you or anyone you know has ever received an organ transplant, they're the ones who procured it. OPOs are nonprofit, nongovernmental bodies to which the US outsources the job of collecting organs from deceased organ donors. Each OPO has a monopoly on recovery of all organs in a particular geographic area; there are 55 groups, some of which only cover part of a state and some of which cover multiple states.

For some time now, critics have argued that OPOs are massively underusing deceased donor organs. One report from 2019 estimated that every year 28,000 usable organs (mostly badly needed kidneys but also pancreata, hearts, livers, etc.) are removed from deceased donors but never used; another put the number at 75,000. This, when the national waitlist for organs is more than 100,000 people long.

OPOs are not paid to collect these organs per se: They are entitled to 100 percent reimbursement of costs they report related to retrieving, preserving, and delivering organs, with ultimate payment coming from Medicare or transplant centers (which in turn charge Medicare and other insurers). This system, critics have long charged, does not provide enough incentive to procure harder-to-retrieve organs from patients who may be older or have certain medical conditions.

To get OPOs to collect more organs, the Trump administration in 2019 issued an executive order calling for new rules governing how the organizations are certified by the federal government, rules that were finalized two years later. This was high stakes: If an OPO loses certification, it has to shut down, and another OPO gets its territory. The rules were meant to more strictly grade OPOs on the share of organs they eventually transplant than the earlier, laxer rules did.

But there was a catch. In addition to organs recovered from deceased donors and transplanted, pancreata recovered and used for research would count toward recertification as well. Not any other organs for research — just pancreata.

What happened next can be see in the chart above: a massive, sudden surge in the number of research pancreata being recovered by OPOs, beginning in 2022, the precise year the new evaluation system took effect.

I've long been fascinated by this trend, which OPO critics call the “pancreas loophole” and OPO defenders describe as a perfectly legal response to overly onerous regulations. The numbers represent thousands of real, physical human pancreata, taken from real, recently deceased donors, that wouldn't have been taken from those bodies without this regulation.

I've tried in recent months to make sense of how this happened, and what it means. I'm not the only one; the Senate Finance Committee has been investigating, and released a report in early June on the problem.

There is still plenty that remains unknown about the fate of these pancreata (if you work at an OPO or research center and know more details, please email me). But what is clear is that they represent an approach by the federal government toward increasing organ supply that absolutely no one is happy with. If the point of the regulations is to help people in need — including the millions of Americans with diabetes, a disease of the pancreas — evaluating OPOs based on the number of pancreata they donate to researchers simply doesn't make any sense. 

But to understand how we started judging them this way regardless, you have to go all the way back to an obscure law passed in George W. Bush's first term.

Everyone knows, in broad strokes, what the heart or the lungs do. But the pancreas doesn't have the same level of fame. Its basic purpose is to excrete enzymes, hormones, and other compounds to both 1) help the body digest food and 2) regulate blood sugar levels.

The latter function is performed by the islets of Langerhans, cells in the pancreas (named after their discoverer, 19th-century German researcher Paul Langerhans) that secrete two different hormones: insulin (to lower blood sugar) and glucagon (to raise it).

In Type 1 diabetes, the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin is impaired and thus blood sugar levels are dangerously elevated; in some kinds of Type 2 diabetes, the body develops resistance to insulin's effects. Typically, people with diabetes deal with this through injecting insulin directly, a process that has become much more sophisticated in recent decades as finger pricks and needles have given way to insulin pumps that can directly measure and adjust blood sugar levels.

But even with advanced care, diabetes carries lifelong medical consequences, so researchers have long sought a more permanent fix: What if you could replace or supplement the faulty islet cells in patients with diabetes with healthy islet cells? Could you, then, cure diabetes at the source and avoid the need for insulin injections and the risk of long-term health effects altogether?

In the most extreme version of this approach, a complete new pancreas is transplanted into a patient with diabetes, like swapping out a faulty part. This is a proven treatment (915 occurred in 2023) and when done it works well, essentially curing the recipient's diabetes. 

But there are major downsides: you have to undertake major abdominal surgery with a small but real chance of failure, and if that succeeds, you have to remain on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of your life to prevent organ rejection. 

For that reason, physicians generally rule that the costs of a pancreas transplant outweigh the benefits for most people with diabetes. Living with an insulin pump is better than risking surgery and having a permanently compromised immune system. Very few of the 38 million Americans living with diabetes, then, are going to be candidates for a pancreas transplant.

This math changes, however, if the patient in question also needs a kidney transplant. Diabetes accounts for nearly half of all new cases of kidney failure, so a higher share of people with diabetes than people without find themselves in this situation. In these cases, since the patient is already going to have surgery and be on immunosuppressants, throwing in a new pancreas to the surgery and curing their diabetes in the same operation that cures their kidney failure begins to look like an attractive option. That's why almost no one gets a pancreas transplant in the US without getting a kidney transplant too.

For decades, researchers searching for effective diabetes treatments have experimented with an approach called islet cell transplantation.

Rather than transplant the whole pancreas, the procedure merely transplants insulin- and glucagon-producing islet cells into the recipient's liver. It's far less invasive, and can be done with local anesthesia and without an overnight hospital stay (though, skeptics argue, often less effective than whole pancreas transplantation too). If the islet cells come from a deceased donor, it does mean a lifetime of immunosuppression, but in “autograft” procedures, which use a subset of still-healthy islets from one's own impaired pancreas, immunosuppression isn't necessary.

Islet cell transplantation, though, remains little-used and mostly experimental in the US. Part of the reason why is regulatory: While pancreases are legally “organs,” and therefore excluded from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA has asserted its authority to also regulate islet cells as human tissues and to require premarket approval before they can be transplanted into a patient, just like a drug would. 

To gain such approval, it would be necessary to conduct clinical studies to demonstrate that the islet cells are “safe and effective”; once approved they would need to be produced in compliance with “good manufacturing practices.” To receive islet cells not approved by FDA, a patient would need to join a clinical study (if one is being conducted) or go to a country (including Canada, Australia, and several EU and Asian countries) with different regulations.

FDA's requirements have unsurprisingly slowed the islet cell transplant field down. The most recent data comes from 2021, when only 10 such procedures were performed in the US. In 2012, 111 were performed, but the number has steadily fallen ever since. It's orders of magnitude rarer than a whole-pancreas transplant.

But islet cell transplants have some champions, including politicians. In 2004, Congress passed, and George W. Bush signed, the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act. It was sponsored by Rep. George Nethercutt Jr. (R-WA), who said he was driven by his daughter's diabetes to try to expand access to islet cell transplants so patients could “live without being dependent on insulin injections.”

Nethercutt's bill sought to speed up research progress by, among other measures, ensuring adequate supply of pancreata for scientists. The law includes a provision stating, “Pancreata procured by an organ procurement organization and used for islet cell transplantation or research shall be counted for purposes of certification or recertification.”

That meant that when regulators in 2019 were reconfiguring certification rules for OPOs to encourage them to effect more transplants, they had to include a carve-out for pancreata used for islet cell research. The carve-out existed from the very first draft proposal that Trump's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released, and stayed into the final rule in 2021.

That rule's changes applied for evaluations of organ procurement organizations starting in August 2022. In the years 2018 through 2021, OPOs collected around 500–600 pancreata for research each year. In 2022, that figure was 1,432, a three-fold increase. In 2024, the number hit 2,053. The effect of the new regulation was clear.

It's important to note that there are no indications that the pancreata being collected by OPOs for research are cutting into the supply of pancreata for donation. The share of dead people whose pancreata are suitable for transplant is incredibly low, because of the exacting standards for donor age and health.

“Only a certain number of donors are going to be young enough (probably less than 50, maybe less than 45) and lean enough (maybe less than 30 BMI, probably less than 27 or 28),” Jonathan Fridell, a transplant surgeon and director of the pancreas transplant program at IU Health in Indianapolis, told me. “We're still going to look at the people that are older, still look at the people that are heavier, but the likelihood that they're going to have a transplantable pancreas is lower.” There are thus plenty of non-transplantable pancreata left over that could be used for research once the prime ones are taken away for surgery.

The problem with the surge in research pancreata, then, isn't that it's taking pancreata away from recipients who need them. It's subtler than that. By racking up large numbers of pancreata for research, OPOs are improving the grades they receive from federal regulators, and avoiding the risk of losing certification and having to turn over territory to another OPO. This grading and decertification process was meant to incentivize OPOs to collect more organs for transplant, especially kidneys, which are both easier to transplant than pancreata and more desperately needed. But the research pancreata provide a way around that incentive.

Calculate the grades that OPOs would get without these pancreata versus the ones they are getting now, and you'll find the results are radically different. 

CMS classifies OPOs into three tiers: 1, 2, and 3, with tier 3 OPOs facing decertification. Using data obtained from the organ procurement transplant network, we are able to calculate which tier each OPO would be in with and without their research pancreata based on their performance in 2023. The year that is actually binding for OPOs and determines whether they will be decertification is 2024, for which data does not yet exist, but the 2023 data gives us some indication of which OPOs are using pancreata to save themselves.

For two OPOs, including research pancreata meant they went from tier 3, which would result in decertification, to tier 2: Donor Network of Arizona, which covers that whole state; and OneLegacy, which includes most of Southern California including Los Angeles and Orange counties. Another, Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates, went from tier 2, where it could face pressure to improve performance, to tier 1, suggesting it excels.

These are not small institutions. OneLegacy is by far the largest OPO in the country by volume of organs collected and population covered. Its CEO, Prasad Garimella, earned $1.1 million in total compensation in 2023, the last year for which public IRS filings are available. It stood a real chance of being decertified if it did not meet the new organ collection standards. And it went from reporting 83 pancreata collected for research in 2021 to 441 in 2022 and 492 in 2023. An over fivefold increase, in one year — and no wonder, given its existence was at stake.

(In response to a request for comment, OneLegacy stated, “When recovering organs for transplant, OneLegacy will allocate pancreata to reputable islet cell research agencies only if they are not viable for transplant into patients. Over 99.6% of pancreata recovered by OneLegacy for research between 2018-2022 were allocated to two National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK) laboratories.”)

Again, the 2023 data is not binding. The 2024 data will be. But unless something changes with the way the government evaluates these pancreata, some major OPOs will avoid dire consequences for the sole reason that they started collecting hundreds of pancreata for research.

The increase is so obviously a result of the new rules that OPOs don't even bother to deny it. Responding to the Senate report earlier this month, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, which lobbies for the groups and against the CMS's stricter rules, said simply, “Today, pancreata recovered for research remain part of the performance evaluation metrics, and OPOs have operated in accordance with the rule.” In other words: yeah, we found a loophole. And what are you going to do about it?

It's an attitude that has pervaded the industry since the loophole came to light. In a listserv thread discussing the new rules, leaked to the Senate Finance Committee, an OPO employee wrote, “If you have a donor with only a pancreas for research, that is an organ donor for the Donor Rate. Otherwise, a donor is any donor with at least 1 organ transplanted. Savvy (or cynical?) OPOs ought to start a pancreas for research program immediately.”

But there's a question that remains unanswered: Where did all these thousands of pancreata go?

It is clear that the vast majority of research pancreata did not go into islet transplants. We are talking about thousands of organs, not the few dozen that plausibly could have been transplanted as part of islet procedures in the past couple of years.

Indeed, OPOs have admitted as much. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asks OPOs for data on organs recovered every year, and in August 2024 clarified that it would only count pancreata as “‘used' for research if they are accepted for use in bona fide islet cell research conducted by a qualified researcher, such as research approved by the National Institutes of Health.” It then asked OPOs to resubmit their data, clarifying which organs were for islet cell research specifically.

Once they did, the number of reported pancreata fell dramatically:

In 2023, the total went from 3,338 pancreata before the guidance, to 1,812 after, a drop of 46 percent. Some OPOs, like Legacy of Hope in Alabama, now reported zero pancreata for research; before the guidance narrowed qualifying purposes, Legacy of Hope had claimed 226 pancreata.

But even after the change in guidance, we're left with smaller numbers that are still much too big to be explained by bona fide islet cell transplants. There simply were not 1,812 islet cell transplants in the US in 2023, but there were 1,812 pancreata credited as donated for islet cell research. And that number is still over triple the number claimed in 2021, meaning the increase sparked by the new OPO rules largely remains even after the government's clarification. Research by David Goldberg, Erin Tewksbury, and Matthew Wadsworth has shown that the number of pancreata reported as recovered by OPOs also swamps the number that the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP), a consortium that collects and extracts islet cells from pancreata, reports receiving from these OPOs.

One of the points of the Senate investigation was to determine where exactly these pancreata went. The Senate Finance Committee, with the benefit of subpoena power, went about asking major OPOs for what actual purpose the research pancreata were used. The main answer they received was “we don't know.”

“Many of the OPOs stated that it is the responsibility of the research facilities or institutions receiving the pancreata to inform the OPOs on the purpose, methods, and efficacy of the research being conducted on the pancreata and other organs that OPOs supply,” the report states. In other words, OPOs themselves don't keep track. “Many of these OPOs,” the report continues, “have sent pancreata to biobanks and other institutions or facilities that hold pancreata for an unknown period to be used for purposes that may be undefined or nonexistent.”

Put another way: These pancreata could, for all the OPOs or the Senate knows, be sitting on a freezer somewhere, not transplanted into anyone. Or maybe not even sitting there at all. Greg Segal, an activist advocating for reform to the pancreas loophole, testified before a House committee that staff at one OPO, joked “that they're conducting research on the efficacy of garbage disposal A versus garbage disposal B” when disposing of pancreata.

Throughout all this, OPOs have had one consistent message: They've complied with the law, as they see it.

“Pancreata recovered for research remain part of the performance evaluation metrics, and OPOs have operated in accordance with the rule,” the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, the groups' lobbying shop in Washington, said in its statement after the Senate investigation was released. “When CMS issued clarifying guidance in 2024 limiting this metric to pancreata used for islet cell research, OPOs responded immediately and worked with the agency to validate data and ensure compliance.”

Jedd Lewis, CEO of the Organ Preservation Alliance and a decades-long veteran of the transplant field, notes that CMS's rule neglected to define what it means to use a pancreas for research, despite many OPOs and industry experts specifically flagging the problem for CMS before that rule took effect. And CMS's new guidance last year did little to solve the problem, he argues.

“Last years' memos simply identified the scope of pancreas donations that OPOs would be judged on as those for ‘islet cell research.' But CMS didn't define what that actually means …and on its face it's a huge scope of research,” Lewis wrote in an email. “There are so many … ways that researchers are looking at how those cells function: studying the pancreas whole, slicing it into thin sections, isolating the individual islet cells, even breaking the cells into the component parts.” That's all valuable research, he argues, and clearly relates to islet cells, even if the pancreata are never actually used in islet cell transplants.

Wadsworth, a coauthor on the study finding a surge in research pancreata and CEO of the LifeConnection OPO in northwest Ohio, concedes that counting pancreata that did not produce islet cells for transplant may technically be legal. But he still thinks it's wrong. 

“I worked with this surgeon early on in my career who said ‘just because you can do something doesn't mean you should,' Wadsworth noted. “Based on what's written, maybe they didn't do anything wrong, but you don't have to look far back in history to find examples where something wasn't illegal, but it definitely wasn't right either.”

LifeConnection, Wadsworth says, was able to comply with the spirit of the CMS regulations by finding counties in its jurisdiction where low numbers of organs were being procured, and working on fixing the problem hospital-by-hospital. It's harder than just harvesting pancreata, but it means organs get transplanted to people who need them.

One irony of the controversy is that most OPOs, and their representatives, don't believe that research pancreata should count for their evaluations. “AOPO has concerns about including pancreata utilized for research in the data used to calculate the numerator of either proposed measure,” the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations wrote in an early 2020 comment as the regulations were being developed. “The utilization of pancreata for research is driven by demand of local researchers. Inclusion of pancreata for research in the data utilized for the numerator may skew comparisons of OPOs in that category and potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.”

But both the OPOs and their regulator, CMS, were bound by the 2004 law requiring that research pancreata, at least that for islet cell research, must count for these evaluations.

We are running out of time to fix this problem. If nothing changes, OPOs will be evaluated on the basis of data they've submitted now, including hundreds of pancreata that were never used for islet cell transplants. Whether you think that reflects OPOs complying in good faith, or subverting the system, it's not a policy anyone should think makes much sense.

CMS has some ability to act here — but perhaps the best fix would come from Congress in the form of a legal provision clarifying the 2004 act. Simply repealing the provision restricting how OPOs can be evaluated would be simplest — but even better would be pairing it with a legal change that could help islet transplantation research far more than the 2004 has to date.

Recall that islet transplants currently don't count as organ transplants in the US. They count as treatments with biological tissue ““If islet cells are solely organs, because they are a subpart of the pancreas, which is an organ under transplant law, then the FDA should not have jurisdiction,” Gail Javitt, a veteran lawyer working on FDA regulatory issues at the firm Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, told me. “However, FDA has taken a different position, that islet cells are a cellular therapy and must undergo premarket approval just like a drug would.” If you want to use it for treatment of a patient, you have to go through them. That has had the practical impact of slowing down the availability of islet cells for transplantation in this country.”

Legally clarifying that islet cells are organs, not cellular therapies, and that they are excluded from FDA oversight then, could go a long way to promoting the treatment. Last Congress, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Matthew Rosendale (R-MT) each introduced bills making this change, with exclusively Republican co-sponsors.

But this need not be a partisan issue at all, and if you paired this provision with a repeal of the 2004 law permitting OPOs to count pancreata for research as part of its transplant metrics, you could arrive at a close to ideal system. OPOs would be evaluated on their ability to transplant islet cells, because they'd be organs like any other. They would not be able to get higher ratings by recovering pancreata for research that might just languish on a shelf.

This does require Congress to make a small change. But it's a small change that should be basically uncontroversial. There's nothing for most OPOs or for advocates trying to maximize donations to dislike here, and there's lots for islet cell researchers to love. It's a small fix that could go a very long way.

Congressional Democrats and some Republicans have cried foul over President Donald Trump's ordered bombing of Iran‘s nuclear facilities on Saturday. Critics of the military operation claim that Trump did not have the constitutional authority to order the bombings and that it was a violation of power. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) argued to the contrary, specifically citing that Article II of the Constitution granted Trump the authority to do so.

Graham justified his decision Sunday in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's Meet the Press. Welker asked the Republican senator if he believed Trump should have received congressional authority before the bombing. Graham responded that Trump is in charge and that the country can't have “535 commander in chiefs.”

“What do you say to your fellow members of Congress who say that President Trump should have gotten congressional approval before taking this action?” Welker asked. “Did the president violate the Constitution by acting unilaterally?”

“No, he was within his Article II authority,” Graham replied. “Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can't be the commander in chief. You can't have 535 commander in chiefs.”

Graham said Congress could vote to eliminate funding for the president's actions but noted that it is the president's discretion to make such a decision. He also highlighted that other presidents made similar decisions regarding bombings and that when it comes to military actions, Congress is responsible for declaring war. Anyone arguing otherwise is wrong, according to Graham.

“If you don't like what the president does in terms of war, you can cut off the funding,” Graham said. “But declaring war is left to the Congress. We've declared war five times in the history of America. All of these other military operations were lawful. He had all the authority he needs under the Constitution. They are wrong.”

Welker referenced previous military conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, when presidents sought congressional authority. Graham rationalized that those were different and referenced recent times in which the president authorized military strikes without asking for congressional authority.

“Well, there's a lot of actions where the president didn't go to Congress,” Graham told Welker. “This was something that had to be done quietly. Last thing you want to do is come to Congress with an attack this sensitive.”

Much of the concern over the United States launching strikes on Iran is that it will eventually lead to deploying troops to fight another war in the Middle East. When asked about “boots on the ground,” Graham dismissed such a thought and said he believed it would not come to that. Instead, he predicted that Israel would no longer tolerate a rogue Iranian regime that is dedicated to its destruction. Rather than the U.S. deploying its own troops, Graham predicted a persistent Israeli military offensive.

“I don't think I see boots on the ground in our future, but I do see Israel not stopping,” Graham said. “Israel is not going to live this way anymore. They're not going to be subject to missile attack every day and every night, living in bunkers. They're going to go after the heart of this regime. They're going to take it down one of two ways: make it change or replace it.”

            President Donald Trump's order to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities presents a new test of the Constitution and the extent of presidential powers to conduct war despite a lack of congressional approval.
    


            The administration is relying on the president's authority under Article II of the Constitution, two senior administration officials told CNN, which says he has power to direct US military forces in engagements necessary to advance American national interests abroad. The White House counsel's office and the Justice Department were both involved in the legal analysis for the strikes. The administration relied, in part, on memos about war powers written by the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel under previous administrations of both parties.
    


            “The president is clearly well within his Article II powers here,” one former senior US official told CNN. “End of story.”
    


            But that's not a view held by many legal experts or universally endorsed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who point to the Constitution's unambiguous statement that only Congress can declare war, the absence of a law akin to the Iraq War-era Authorization for Use of Military Force and — critically — a lack of an imminent threat to the United States.

            In 1973, responding to the disastrous war in Vietnam, Congress overrode President Richard Nixon's veto to pass an important piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution, that sought to rein in presidents regarding the use of military force.
    


            “This is a large enough scale action that I think it's likely that it should be considered a war, and not merely a small, severely limited strike. Therefore, it requires congressional authorization,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and a scholar at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
    


            “The War Powers Act requires advance consultation with Congress, ‘whenever possible,' before entering US troops into hostilities,” Somin added. “Here, I think it pretty obviously was possible, and it also pretty obviously wasn't done.”
    


            The Supreme Court has been generous in approving Trump's expansive use of power, most notably its immunity ruling last year. That view has also contributed to the analysis, a senior White House official said.
    


            “This isn't some technical rulemaking,” said Chris Anders, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “It literally is one of the enumerated powers” of the Constitution.
    


            In the Federalist Papers, James Madison argued for an exception that's been hotly discussed since — that the president can use force if needed to “repel a sudden attack on the United States.”
    


            “If applied to Iran,” Anders said, it wouldn't meet that test. “The use of bombing runs against facilities that have been standing there for years, perhaps decades, and were not about to be part of a sudden attack on the United States.”
    


            A senior Justice Department official said if this conflict continues for an extended period, the administration may have to go to Congress for approval, but maintained that “bombing three nuclear sites” does not rise to the level of needing congressional approval. The official also noted the Trump administration has the support of senior House and Senate leaders.
    


            Democratic and Republican presidents have sidestepped Congress for strikes or military action for decades.
    


            Over the past 40 years, the Article II powers have been used for President George H.W. Bush's use of force against Panama to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega, President Barack Obama's use of air strikes in Libya and Trump's actions in his first term against Syria and Iran.
    


            “The commander in chief can take actions to protect American interests around the world,” John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, told CNN.
    


            “We've seen Iran sponsor terrorism in Lebanon in 1983, we've seen it help arm militias in Iraq that have killed Americans with RPGs made in Iran,” Bolton said. “They've been threatening our forces in the region for years.”

            Presidents have relied on a collection of legal experts from a variety of agencies to review their actions. Lawyers from the White House used the group, which included top national security legal experts from the Defense and State departments, the CIA, and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and National Security Division, to offer advice to the president before making a major national security decision.
    


            The Trump White House has relied less on those experts than previous administrations, current and former US officials say. His Justice Department has previously broadly embraced the idea of wide presidential power.
    


            “While the United States is not the world's policeman, as its power has grown, the breadth of its regional interests has expanded and threats to national interests posed by foreign disorder have increased,” the Office of Legal Counsel wrote in 2018 regarding air strikes against Syria.
    


            “He's basically repeating the abuses of a number of previous administrations, most notably Obama, with the 2011 Libya war,” Somin said. “But the bottom line is that this is a kind of abuse that's not unprecedented, albeit that doesn't make it right.”
    


            Enforcing anything against Trump may be impossible through the legal system, as courts have been skeptical of who has the right to sue him and whether such debates should be left for the political branches to address.
    


            The full House or Senate could in theory challenge Trump in court, as the then-Democratic-led House did during his first term regarding the border wall. But while a top federal appeals court backed the lawsuit based on a dispute over appropriations, it was later vacated as moot.
    


            “This is the basic question of constitutional authority. If they were to bring a lawsuit, the courts would not intervene,” Bolton said. “This is a fight between the two branches.”
    


            Bipartisan concerns, however, won't move the needle on their own without help from leadership, which is unlikely based on Saturday's comments from House Speaker Mike Johnson.
    


            “The President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight's necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,” Johnson said in a social media post.
    


            Republican Rep. Thomas Massie was taken aback.
    


            “There was no imminent threat to the United States, which was what would authorize that. And I think that's peculiar to hear that from the speaker of the House,” the Kentucky congressman said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” “Look, Congress was on vacation last week when all this was happening. We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back.”
    


            Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are seeking to reassert Congress' authority over military action with a co-sponsored war powers resolution. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said on “Fox News Sunday” that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing for a vote “as soon as possible” on a resolution so “all members of the Senate have to declare whether or not the US should be at war with Iran.”
    


            US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s were “at least” debated in Congress at the time with requests from then-President George W. Bush, Massie noted.
    


            “It should have been declarations of war, but at least they did an Authorization of Use of Military Force,” Massie said. “We haven't had that. This has been turned upside down.”

            Some lawmakers and legal experts are looking at the second Iraq War as precedent for congressional action — and also a warning to review the intelligence.
    


            “We are in yellowcake uranium-land,” a former national security official said, referring to botched intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. “Congress should be asking questions about what intelligence and what legal findings they did before taking this escalatory action.”
    


            Democratic and Republican administrations have repeatedly stretched the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the Iraq War, as legal authority for military action in locations outside of Iraq. An earlier AUMF that authorized action against al Qaeda and associated groups also has been used beyond what was conceived in the post-9/11 era.
    


            “The problem is that, historically, the only meaningful check on presidential abuses of the war powers has been pushback from Congress,” said Stephen Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. “But that was when Congress took its constitutional and institutional responsibilities seriously.”
    


            The ACLU's Anders says there's still time for Congress to act on a bipartisan basis, suggesting public hearings to air the Trump administration's military and legal justifications. Congress could also look at restricting funds for such actions without its buy-in.
    


            It's also a chance for a true national debate.
    


            “One advantage that comes to the executive branch when it goes to Congress and asks for authorization that there's a clear examination of what the United States is getting into, so there's much more of a national buy-in,” Anders said.
    


            “That is part of the genius of the way the Constitution was set up.”

A suicide bombing on Sunday at a church in Damascus, Syria, reportedly left 22 people dead and 63 injured.

The attack occurred at the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church in the Dweil'a neighborhood of Damascus. As people were praying during the service, the suspected Islamic State group attacker entered the church, wearing a mask to cover his face, and opened fire on the Christians. When a crowd rushed at the gunman to try to stop him from shooting, he then detonated his explosive device, killing himself and others at the church while wounding dozens more, according to the Associated Press.

No group or organization has claimed responsibility for the attack as of Sunday. However, Syria's interior and foreign ministries blamed the suicide bombing on the Islamic State group.

“A suicide attacker affiliated with the Daesh (IS) terrorist group entered the Saint Elias church in the Dweila area of the capital Damascus where he opened fire, then blew himself up with an explosive belt,” according to a statement from Syria's interior ministry.

Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa called the attack cowardly and said that it ran counter to the virtues that bring people together.

“This cowardly act goes against the civic values that brings us together,” Mostafa said. “We will not back down from our commitment to equal citizenship … and we also affirm the state's pledge to exert all its efforts to combat criminal organizations and to protect society from all attacks threatening its safety.”

The suicide bomber did not act alone. According to eyewitnesses of the attack, at least two other people were involved. A church priest claimed there was a second gunman involved in the attack who was firing at the church before the suicide bomber detonated his device, the Times of Israel reported.

Another witness, who identified himself as Rawad, described his recollection of the attack to the Associated Press.

“He was shooting at the church … he then went inside the church and blew himself up,” Rawad said.

The attack drew widespread international condemnation.

“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said. “We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”

“On behalf of @POTUS and the American people, we would like to express our condolences to the victims, families, and individuals impacted by the terrorist attack today at Mar Elias church in al-Duwaileh,” said Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, in a social media post on X.

“These terrible acts of cowardice have no place in the new tapestry of integrated tolerance and inclusion that Syrians are weaving,” he added. “We continue to support the Syrian government as it fights against those who are seeking to create instability and fear in their country and the broader region.”

Geir O. Pedersen, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, expressed “outrage at this heinous crime” and categorized it as a terrorist attack on the church. He also attributed the attack to the Islamic State group and called for “a full investigation and action by the authorities.”

MIRED IN INFIGHTING, WITH TRUMP FULL SPEED AHEAD, DEMOCRATS CAN'T FIND THEIR WAY. This newsletter is about the current dreadful state of the Democratic Party. But begin with this extraordinary fact: At this time eight years ago, in the first year of Donald Trump‘s first term as president, the Russia special counsel, Robert Mueller, had already been appointed and had been investigating Trump for a month. What Trump calls the Russia hoax dominated media coverage. Commentators slandered Trump on a daily basis. Trump's job approval rating fell into the high 30s in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. In the White House, the new president was distracted and on the defensive, knocked back on his feet from his first moments in office.

On the other side, the Democratic strategy was attack, attack, attack. They had a lot of help; major news organizations and a host of cable news producers gave them an opportunity to speculate about Trump-Russia every hour of every day. The big-picture plan was for Mueller to serve as the investigative arm for a hoped-for impeachment of Trump. In the meantime, RussiaRussiaRussia dominated politics in 2017, 2018, and much of 2019. Trump lost a lot of what could have been his most productive time as president.

The point of bringing this up is to contrast the situation then with the situation today. Now it is the Democrats who are distracted and back on their feet, with the party engaged in bitter infighting and struggling to come up with a unified strategy to oppose Trump. Meanwhile, Trump is pushing forward on all fronts, setting the agenda — just look at the recent bombing of nuclear sites in Iran — and putting together one of the most consequential presidencies in years.

Part of the problem is that Democrats are still in a state of shock. Go back to last summer, when an internal coup resulted in President Joe Biden's departure from the reelection race. Then go to November, when the party was stunned to lose to Trump. Then go to January-February-March of this year when they were overwhelmed by Trump's audacious use of executive authority in his first months in office. Democrats are still playing catch-up.

Perhaps their biggest problem is that they don't have a big, unifying cause, like the Russia narrative, to use as a cudgel against the Trump administration. It is hard to overstate the daily damage the Russia affair did to Trump in 2017, and its absence today has left Democrats in a far weaker position than they were back then.

Of course Democrats are trying. Some have adapted the lawfare they perfected during Trump's time out of office; just this year, Democratic proxies have sued Trump or his administration around 300 times. The idea is to find a friendly judge — not too hard to do — to issue a nationwide injunction to stop Trump from doing whatever it is that Democrats oppose. The party has had a good deal of success so far, but it's a short-term strategy, especially when they file preposterous cases that will lose in the appeals courts.

Recently, we've seen a number of Democrats pursue a new effort to use 1960s-style civil disobedience to get themselves detained, arrested, handcuffed, or otherwise in trouble while bringing attention to what they say are the administration's lawless ways. LaMonica McIver, Ras Baraka, Brad Lander, Alex Padilla, and others have tried it — so many that the Washington Post recently published a story headlined, “For Democrats, handcuffs are the latest symbol of resistance to Trump.”

It's kind of funny, but not really — it's more an indicator of the Democratic Party's impotence in the face of the Trump presidency. And behind the embarrassing stories, Democrats have substantial problems that could render the party ineffective for quite a while.

First, it has fallen behind in the money race — according to recent reports, the Democratic National Committee has $18 million in cash-on-hand compared to $67.4 million for the Republican National Committee. A top finance official with the Kamala Harris campaign recently told the New York Times that the party's donors are seeing “headline after headline of incompetence and infighting, and I think that is a real problem not just for the DNC but for the larger Democratic brand.”

Another source close to the DNC told the New York Post, “We are six months in and we're drowning. We have no clear path or plan. The midterms are going to come before we know it, and then we're going to be really f***ed.”

Many of the problems — and the bad headlines — concern the leadership of new DNC Chairman Ken Martin. A longtime head of the party in Minnesota, Martin seemed qualified enough, but his early months have been marked, according to critics, by too much squabbling and putting money in the wrong places.

Martin got into a fight with David Hogg, the young progressive firebrand, and ended up complaining bitterly about Hogg's treatment of him. “You essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to,” Martin, his voice choking up, told Hogg on a party Zoom call in May. “The other night I said to myself for the first time, I don't know if I want to do this any more.” 

Once that became public, many Democrats must have wondered about Martin: This is the guy we chose to lead us in the incredibly tough battle against Donald Trump, and he's getting weepy because David Hogg said mean things about him? No wonder one DNC member told Politico that Martin seemed “weak and whiny.” To make things worse, two big-money union heavyweights, Randi Weingarten of the teachers union and Lee Saunders of the public employees union, have both left their positions in the party.

Finally, Democrats are still on the wrong side of a number of issues, like immigration, wokeism, and national security. At any moment, they seem in danger of taking another turn in the wrong direction. Take Tuesday's Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. Politico recently reported that “Centrist Democrats are sounding the alarm that a surging democratic socialist mayoral candidate … could further set back the party's already beleaguered national brand.” That candidate, Zohran Mamdani, who is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, is a walking nightmare for Democrats who hope to win back voter support nationally.

Back in 2017, in Trump's first months in office, Democrats, even though they had just suffered a devastating defeat in the 2016 presidential election, didn't spend as much time worrying about their brand. They had RussiaRussiaRussia to use against the new president, and a willing press to megaphone every wild accusation they could find. Of course, in the most fundamental sense, the Mueller investigation went nowhere when the special counsel could not establish that collusion ever occurred, much less that it involved any top Trump campaign officials. But that didn't happen until 2019, giving Democrats and their media allies ample time to cripple Trump's new presidency. Now, Democrats have lost again to Trump, but this time they are still searching for the magic issue to use against him.

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — At 4-foot-11, Kristin Chenoweth always wanted to play basketball. It never happened, but she still made it to the NBA Finals.

The award-winning actress, singer, Oklahoma native, Oklahoma Hall of Fame inductee and unabashed Thunder fan sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before Game 7 of the title series between the Thunder and the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night.

Chenoweth's performance aired live on ABC shortly before tipoff of the season's final game.

She has performed on some of the biggest stages in the world — but doing the anthem for a Thunder game gives her butterflies.

“Let me just say, if they had anxiety medication for Thunder fans, I'd be taking it,” Chenoweth, dressed in a Thunder sweatshirt, told The Associated Press after her soundcheck at the arena on Sunday.

Chenoweth's Thunder fandom has been no secret since the franchise's early years, though she also has professed at times to liking the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks as well. That said, the Thunder are clearly her top choice — so much so that she once told the Tulsa World she spent three hours bedazzling a Thunder hat. She went to Oklahoma City University after growing up in Broken Arrow, about 115 miles northeast of where the Thunder play.

And her 8-year-old dog's name is Thunder. She even dressed the pup up once in a Thunder outfit.

“I never miss a game unless I'm on stage,” Chenoweth said. “I was a cheerleader in high school in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and I loved football, but my favorite was basketball. I like how much of a team player you've got to be. ... And this is my team.”




Chenoweth has sung the anthem at a few Thunder games in the past, sometimes alone and at least once with children from her Chenoweth Broadway Bootcamp. That camp is part of the arts and education fund that she founded to cultivate “young artistic expression by enriching children's lives through the power of education, entertainment and experience.”

“I've had some pretty big moments in my life in the entertainment field, but this one, I don't know why, makes me nervous,” Chenoweth said. “I just am very honored that they asked. And I'm proud of these kids. I mean, we have come so far. Of course I want us to win. When the NFL has hired me for the anthem, you remain neutral. But the NBA didn't hire me for this, so I'm Thundering it up.”

And the anthem — which the soprano finished with her own flair — is a tough song to perform, she said. Singing the words written by Francis Scott Key about the defense of Fort McHenry is a duty she takes seriously.

“Actually thinking about what he saw, it's really important for me to remember the words and talk about what they meant then and what they mean to us now,” Chenoweth said.

Chenoweth won a Tony Award in 1999 for best featured actress in a musical for her role in “You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.” She received two Tony nominations for best leading actress in a musical, one in 2004 for playing Glinda in “Wicked” — she lost to co-star Idina Menzel — and the other in 2015 for playing 1930s Hollywood diva Lily Garland in “On the Twentieth Century.”

And in 2009, she won an Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy series for her work on ABC's “Pushing Daisies.” She returns to Broadway this fall, playing Jackie Siegel in ”The Queen of Versailles.”

“I still have the desire,” Chenoweth said. “I think really what inspires me lately is young talent. I'm seeing and watching and learning from them. Hopefully they're learning from me. And there's nothing better than watching a budding talent whether it's basketball or a singer, an artist, it's my jam. What keeps me going right now is other people inspiring me to do what I love.”

U.S. President Donald Trump warned that he will not hesitate to strike other targets in Iran if peace does not come quickly in the Middle East. Trump said that while the nuclear facilities struck by the U.S. on Saturday were the most “lethal,” “there are many targets left.”

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — One of Layton Tallwhiteman's earliest memories was watching the news at his uncle's house in Montana in 2003 and seeing the U.S. bomb Baghdad to launch the war in Iraq.

Recollections of that war — waged in part to find weapons of mass destruction that did not exist – flooded back for Tallwhiteman after President Donald Trump ordered weekend bombing strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities amid its escalating conflict with Israel.

The administration has indicated it wants to avoid getting pulled into all-out war. Tallwhiteman, who grew up on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation southeast of Billings, is skeptical.

“Their idea is to eliminate the threat. Like Bush said in Iraq, ‘We're going to eliminate the threat. We're going to find weapons of mass destruction and eliminate them.' Did that work the way he planned? No, obviously it didn't,” said Tallwhiteman. The 30-year-old driver for a food distribution company said he usually votes Libertarian, but backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump last year.

Across the U.S. on Sunday, Americans expressed a mixture of support, apprehension and anxiety over the bombings, which officials said caused severe damage to Iran's nuclear sites. Administration officials said the strikes left room for Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear program. Yet if the conflict spirals, it could test Trump's foreign diplomacy skills and also his support at home.

B-2 bombers that participated in the weekend strikes returned home to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on Sunday. Nearby, retired Air Force veteran Ken Slabaugh said he was “100% supportive” of Trump's decision and the military personnel who carried it out.

Slabaugh said Iran has showed resistance to negotiations over its nuclear program for decades, a problem that he said Trump inherited. Iran can't be trusted, Slabaugh said, nor allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

“It simply had to be done,” he said of the strikes, adding that he's now concerned for members of the military around the world.

“I'm proud of the guys and the gals that are doing the work out there. Nobody in the world does this like we do, and we have the freedom and liberty we enjoy because of that,” Slabaugh said.

Hundreds of people gathered in New York's Times Square on Sunday to protest the bombings, waving signs that said “STOP THE WAR ON IRAN” and “TRUMP IS A WAR CRIMINAL.” Among them was Dana Cote, who was in the city when the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred. Cote worried that bombing Iran would “open a can of worms that we're not going to be able to close” and prompt extremists to again attack the U.S.

A much smaller group of pro-Trump supporters gathered nearby. They held up flags for Israel and Trump, and used air horns to try to drown out the demonstrators.

“I think it's the best thing that Trump could have done. It should have been done 40 years ago,” said Nancy Myer of New York.

In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Andrew Williams, 18, said he was surprised by the timing of the attack, given that many Republicans had expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war. Still, he thought it was necessary if Iran was building nuclear weapons.

“If we are able to get rid of that, that is something we should do,” Williams said.

Robert Wallette of Billings said Trump had “good reason” to conduct the bombing as a demonstration of American support for Israel.

“Iran's evil, evil people. They hate Americans,” he said.

Wallette, 69, a retired contract specialist at the federal Indian Health Service, said he hated Trump when the Republican was first elected because of his arrogant style.

His perspective started to shift after Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In 2024, Wallette voted for Trump based on his promises to curb illegal immigration, putting him among the 60% of voters backing Trump last year in Yellowstone County, which includes Billings.

Notwithstanding his support, Wallette was unsure if Trump can avoid the U.S. getting drawn into a deeper conflict with Iran.

“Other countries are getting involved and this may be out of his control,” he said.

Kent Berame, 32, of Davie, Florida, said it was a little outrageous for Trump to go rogue and approve the attack without explicit support from Congress. He said he doesn't agree with the United States supporting Israel's recent attacks on Iran.

“There's concern that we're putting troops in danger,” said Berame, a Democrat who owns his own marketing company. “And obviously there's a retaliatory response toward all of our bases over there.”

Berame said it's frustrating that the U.S. might be increasing hostilities with Iran just a few years after finally ending the war in Afghanistan.

“I don't want to see any U.S. soldiers in harm's way or in danger,” he said.

Back in Billings, Trump voter Patty Ellman said she worries about the U.S. getting sucked into another extended conflict. 

“We have enough going on in America to get into other countries' wars. Let's just take care of us right now,” she said.

Ellman, a 61-year-old who stepped in as caregiver for her ex-husband after he suffered a stroke, said the U.S. should retaliate if attacked, but otherwise stay out of Iran's conflict with other countries.

“That's their business,” she said. “We need to worry about Americans and how we're going to survive and are we going to have Social Security.”

This is CNBC'S live blog about the conflict in the Middle East.

President Donald Trump has thanked Iran for giving the United States advance notice of the coming missile strike on America's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

The notice, he wrote on social media, "made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured."

That finding helped inform the U.S. Embassy in Doha's decision to lift a shelter-in-place order issued ahead of the attack.

U.S. stock market indexes closed higher Monday on optimism that Iran's retaliation for U.S. bombings of its nuclear facilities would be limited to the missile attack.

Likewise, oil prices fell as traders breathed a sigh of relief after days of concerns that a broader conflict could force tankers to avoid vital shipping lanes like the Strait of Hormuz.

Iran's armed forces boasted via state media earlier today that a "powerful and destructive missile strike" had hit the base, which houses around 10,000 troops.

The open conflict in the Middle East dramatically escalated two days ago, when the U.S. joined Israel's military campaign to cripple Iran's nuclear programs and hobble its regime.

CNBC reporters are covering the Middle East conflict on air and online, reporting from Washington, D.C., London, Dubai, San Francisco and Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

Trump congratulated the world and said "it's time for peace!," in an all-caps Truth Social post following Iran's missile strike.

In a separate Truth Social post minutes prior, Trump thanked the "highly respected emir of Qatar for all that he has done in seeking peace for the region."

Trump also celebrated that the Iranian strikes resulted in no American or Qatari casualties.

Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says that his country "will not submit to anyone's harassment" after Iran launched retaliatory missiles at U.S. bases in the Middle East.

"We didn't harm anyone," Khamenei said on X, according to a Google translation.

"And we will not accept any harassment from anyone under any circumstances. And we will not submit to anyone's harassment," he wrote.

"This is the logic of the Iranian nation."

There are approximately 45,000 American service members stationed in the Middle East, according to a recent Reuters analysis.

This number is in constant flux, however, and it reflects estimates of personnel at several bases where troop numbers are not publicly acknowledged, due to national security concerns.

The United States' Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar is the biggest American base in the region, with around 10,000 servicemembers stationed there.

Iraq hosts the Al Asad air base, where another 2,500 Americans are posted.

In Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, around 9,000 seamen are stationed at any given time.

South of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates is the Al Dhafra Airbase, which is shared between the United States and the UAE Air Force.

Saudi Arabia hosts both American soldiers and large-scale U.S. missile batteries at Prince Sultan Air Base, south of the capital Riyadh. U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia numbered 2,321 in 2024, according to a letter released by the White House.

The Muwaffaq al Salti Air Base in Jordan hosts the U.S. Air Force Central's 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing, according to a 2024 congressional report cited by Reuters.

Trump said Iran gave the U.S. "early notice" of its missile attack on an American military base in Qatar, "which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured."

Trump thanked Iran for that heads up, but nevertheless called the retaliatory strike a "very weak response" that was "very effectively countered" by the U.S.

"Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their "system," and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered. There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was "set free," because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction. I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their "system," and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE. I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Dubai airports have resumed "full operations" following a brief pause following the attack, per a statement.

"While Dubai Airports works with airlines to ensure flights operate according to approved schedules, some flights may experience delays or cancellations," the statement from the Dubai Media Office said.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said that "this is the retaliation that was expected," after Iran said it launched missile strikes on U.S. military bases in Qatar and Iraq.

"So far, so good, no casualties, so far as we know," he told reporters.

He also said that it is not an "appropriate time" for a war powers resolution, and he doesn't think it's "necessary."

"Listen, for 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same commander in chief authority under Article II," Johnson said, referring to the article that designates the president as "commander in chief" of the military.

Johnson said that he received a classified briefing Monday morning on the conflict with Iran.

"I know that the national security team is in the Situation Room, even as we speak, and they're monitoring this," he said.

U.S. crude oil futures sold off steeply, on hopes the Middle East conflict will de-escalate after Iran's retaliatory strike on a U.S. base left no reported casualties.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell $5.33, or 7.22%, to close at $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed $5.53, or 7.18%, to settle at $71.48 per barrel.

The oil market appears to have avoided its worst-case scenario, for now, in which Iran attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz. Some 20 million barrels per day of crude, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration.

U.S. crude has given up most of its gains since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. Brent is up more than 2% since the conflict began.

The United Arab Emirates "has condemned in the strongest terms," the attack on the Al Udeid Air Base, per a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

"The UAE underscored its categorical rejection of any attack that threatens the security and safety of the State of Qatar, stressing that such actions undermine regional security and stability," the statement said. 

The UAE also fully supports any measures by Qatar "aimed at safeguarding the security and safety of its citizens and residents."

"The UAE reaffirmed the urgent need to halt military escalation, and warned against continued acts of provocation that threaten to destabilize regional security and risk dragging the region into dangerous paths with catastrophic repercussions for international peace and security," the statement said. 

— Erin Doherty 

Saudi Arabia condemned and denounced the attack "in the strongest terms possible," according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The attacks constitute "a flagrant violation of international law and the principles of good neighborliness, and an entirely unacceptable act that cannot be justified under any circumstances," per the statement.

"The Kingdom affirms its full solidarity with and unwavering support for the State of Qatar and places all its capabilities at Qatar's disposal in support of any measures it may take," the statement continues.

— Erin Doherty

Abdullah Almulla, who was in Doha during the attack, described hearing "bangs in the sky," while he was on his way home from work, during an interview on CNBC's 'The Exchange.'

He said that he did not have any indication that any of the strikes impacted any residential or urban areas in Doha.

"It is scary, it's not something I ever heard in my life or ever experienced, so ... it's a bit worrisome, I'm worried for my friends and family and I just want them to be safe," said Almulla, who is from Qatar and works with Qatar News Agency.  

He said that his friends and family appear to be safe from the attack.

— Erin Doherty

Iran gave Qatar advanced notice that it was launching an attack on the U.S. base near Doha, three Iranian officials familiar with the plans told The New York Times.

Iran's retaliatory strike was meant to be symbolic, while leaving an exit ramp open for all sides, the Times reported.

In its statement confirming the attack on the Al Udeid Air Base, Iran's national security council said its action "posed no threat whatsoever to our friendly and brotherly nation, Qatar, or its honorable people."

Qatar has condemned the strike.

Amid escalating nuclear tensions between the U.S. and Iran, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social praising the U.S.'s Saturday attacks on nuclear sites in the Middle Eastern country.

"The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it," he wrote.

Trump blamed "the Fake News" for allegedly trying to "demean" the impact of the sites that were hit, calling out "NBC Fake News" by name.

"It never ends with the sleazebags in the Media, and that's why their Ratings are at an ALL TIME LOW — ZERO CREDIBILITY!" he added.

Iran claims that the number of missiles used in the operation was the same as the number of bombs the United States used in its strike on Iran over the weekend, CNBC's Megan Cassella reports, based on a statement from Iran's Supreme National Security Council.

The base was located away from urban infrastructure and residential areas in Qatar, the statement said.

Kuwait Airways is suspending all departing flights from the country due to regional tensions until further notice, the airline posted on X.

The suspension will remain in effect "until further notice."

EgyptAir announced in a social media post that all Egypt flights to and from cities in the Persian Gulf have also been canceled "until the situation stabilizes in the region."

The flight suspensions follow Qatar closing its airspace to commercial flights just before Iran launched missiles attacking the U.S. base in Qatar. Bahrain also temporarily suspended air traffic, according to NBC News.

Iran did not move nuclear material out of its Fordo facility before the U.S. strike on Saturday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday morning, citing U.S. intelligence.

A New York Times report published Sunday cited two unnamed Israeli officials who said Iran appeared to have moved nuclear material and equipment from Fordo before the U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites.

"Our intelligence report says they didn't," the Republican senator said.

"In fact, we actually believe they stored more of it in Fordo because they believe Fordo was impenetrable," Mullin said. "They thought it was a safe place to be."

Airlines diverted more flights in the Middle East as Qatar's airspace closed and areas above other Persian Gulf nations were reportedly also off limits after Iran said it attacked a U.S. military base in Qatar.

At least six commercial aircraft turned around near the United Arab Emirates' airspace, according to flight-tracking platform Flightradar24, which also reported that the UAE airspace was closed.

Several major international airlines have also scaled back service to major hubs like Doha, Qatar, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, or have offered travelers vouchers to travel at a later date because of the conflict.

No deaths or injuries have been reported in the missile attack on Al-Udeid military base, CNBC's Megan Cassella reports, citing a statement from Qatar's ministry of defense.

— Megan Cassella

Qatar "strongly condemns" the attack at the Al-Udeid air base and considers it "a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law and the United Nations Charter," Majed Al Ansari, the official spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote on X.

"We reassure that Qatar's air defenses successfully thwarted the attack and intercepted the Iranian missiles," he wrote. 

He said that the base had been evacuated prior to the attack, "given the tensions in the region." 

"We confirm that no injuries or human casualties resulted from the attack," he continued. 

"We affirm that Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this brazen aggression, in line with international law," he said.

Stock indexes are positive so far this afternoon despite the Iranian attacks on U.S. bases, as investors view the missile fire as a relatively limited response to the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities. 

The alternative, and a much more costly scenario for traders, would have been if Iran had targeted oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, for example, or Gulf state oil production sites. 

Oil prices also fell this afternoon after briefly jumping, moved lower by the same working assumptions about Iran's retaliation.

Trump is meeting with his national security team this afternoon.

A White House official told NBC News the national security team was already meeting in the Situation Room when Iranian missiles were fired at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Qatar.

Trump is joined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and other top officials.

This is CNBC'S live blog about the conflict in the Middle East.

President Donald Trump thanked Iran for giving the United States advance notice of the coming missile strike on a U.S. base in Qatar. 

The notice, he wrote on social media, "made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured."

The finding helped inform the U.S. Embassy in Doha's decision to lift a shelter-in-place order issued ahead of the attack. 

The strike on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar was in retaliation for U.S. bombings against key Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend.

Iran's armed forces boasted via state media earlier today that a "powerful and destructive missile strike" had hit the base, which houses around 10,000 troops.

The open conflict in the Middle East had already dramatically escalated two days earlier, when the U.S. joined Israel's military campaign to cripple Iran's nuclear programs and hobble its regime.

CNBC reporters are covering the conflict on air and online, reporting from Washington, D.C., London, Dubai, San Francisco and Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says that his country "will not submit to anyone's harassment" after Iran launched retaliatory missiles at U.S. bases in the Middle East.

"We didn't harm anyone," Khamenei said on X, according to a Google translation.

"And we will not accept any harassment from anyone under any circumstances. And we will not submit to anyone's harassment," he wrote.

"This is the logic of the Iranian nation."

There are approximately 45,000 American service members stationed in the Middle East, according to a recent Reuters analysis.

This number is in constant flux, however, and it reflects estimates of personnel at several bases where troop numbers are not publicly acknowledged, due to national security concerns.

The United States' Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar is the biggest American base in the region, with around 10,000 servicemembers stationed there.

Iraq hosts the Al Asad air base, where another 2,500 Americans are posted.

In Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, around 9,000 seamen are stationed at any given time.

South of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates is the Al Dhafra Airbase, which is shared between the United States and the UAE Air Force.

Saudi Arabia hosts both American soldiers and large-scale U.S. missile batteries at Prince Sultan Air Base, south of the capital Riyadh. U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia numbered 2,321 in 2024, according to a letter released by the White House.

The Muwaffaq al Salti Air Base in Jordan hosts the U.S. Air Force Central's 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing, according to a 2024 congressional report cited by Reuters.

Trump said Iran gave the U.S. "early notice" of its missile attack on an American military base in Qatar, "which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured."

Trump thanked Iran for that heads up, but nevertheless called the retaliatory strike a "very weak response" that was "very effectively countered" by the U.S.

"Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their "system," and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered. There have been 14 missiles fired — 13 were knocked down, and 1 was "set free," because it was headed in a nonthreatening direction. I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done. Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their "system," and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE. I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. Thank you for your attention to this matter!DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Dubai airports have resumed "full operations" following a brief pause following the attack, per a statement.

"While Dubai Airports works with airlines to ensure flights operate according to approved schedules, some flights may experience delays or cancellations," the statement from the Dubai Media Office said.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said that "this is the retaliation that was expected," after Iran said it launched missile strikes on U.S. military bases in Qatar and Iraq.

"So far, so good, no casualties, so far as we know," he told reporters.

He also said that it is not an "appropriate time" for a war powers resolution, and he doesn't think it's "necessary."

"Listen, for 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same commander in chief authority under Article II," Johnson said, referring to the article that designates the president as "commander in chief" of the military.

Johnson said that he received a classified briefing Monday morning on the conflict with Iran.

"I know that the national security team is in the Situation Room, even as we speak, and they're monitoring this," he said.

U.S. crude oil futures sold off steeply, on hopes the Middle East conflict will de-escalate after Iran's retaliatory strike on a U.S. base left no reported casualties.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell $5.33, or 7.22%, to close at $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent shed $5.53, or 7.18%, to settle at $71.48 per barrel.

The oil market appears to have avoided its worst-case scenario, for now, in which Iran attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz. Some 20 million barrels per day of crude, or 20% of global consumption, flowed through the strait in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration.

U.S. crude has given up most of its gains since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. Brent is up more than 2% since the conflict began.

The United Arab Emirates "has condemned in the strongest terms," the attack on the Al Udeid Air Base, per a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

"The UAE underscored its categorical rejection of any attack that threatens the security and safety of the State of Qatar, stressing that such actions undermine regional security and stability," the statement said. 

The UAE also fully supports any measures by Qatar "aimed at safeguarding the security and safety of its citizens and residents."

"The UAE reaffirmed the urgent need to halt military escalation, and warned against continued acts of provocation that threaten to destabilize regional security and risk dragging the region into dangerous paths with catastrophic repercussions for international peace and security," the statement said. 

— Erin Doherty 

Saudi Arabia condemned and denounced the attack "in the strongest terms possible," according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The attacks constitute "a flagrant violation of international law and the principles of good neighborliness, and an entirely unacceptable act that cannot be justified under any circumstances," per the statement.

"The Kingdom affirms its full solidarity with and unwavering support for the State of Qatar and places all its capabilities at Qatar's disposal in support of any measures it may take," the statement continues.

— Erin Doherty

Abdullah Almulla, who was in Doha during the attack, described hearing "bangs in the sky," while he was on his way home from work, during an interview on CNBC's 'The Exchange.'

He said that he did not have any indication that any of the strikes impacted any residential or urban areas in Doha.

"It is scary, it's not something I ever heard in my life or ever experienced, so ... it's a bit worrisome, I'm worried for my friends and family and I just want them to be safe," said Almulla, who is from Qatar and works with Qatar News Agency.  

He said that his friends and family appear to be safe from the attack.

Iran gave Qatar advanced notice that it was launching an attack on the U.S. base near Doha, three Iranian officials familiar with the plans told The New York Times.

Iran's retaliatory strike was meant to be symbolic, while leaving an exit ramp open for all sides, the Times reported.

In its statement confirming the attack on the Al Udeid Air Base, Iran's national security council said its action "posed no threat whatsoever to our friendly and brotherly nation, Qatar, or its honorable people."

Qatar has condemned the strike.

Amid escalating nuclear tensions between the U.S. and Iran, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social praising the U.S.'s Saturday attacks on nuclear sites in the Middle Eastern country.

"The sites that we hit in Iran were totally destroyed, and everyone knows it," he wrote.

Trump blamed "the Fake News" for allegedly trying to "demean" the impact of the sites that were hit, calling out "NBC Fake News" by name.

"It never ends with the sleazebags in the Media, and that's why their Ratings are at an ALL TIME LOW — ZERO CREDIBILITY!" he added.

Iran claims that the number of missiles used in the operation was the same as the number of bombs the United States used in its strike on Iran over the weekend, CNBC's Megan Cassella reports, based on a statement from Iran's Supreme National Security Council.

The base was located away from urban infrastructure and residential areas in Qatar, the statement said.

Kuwait Airways is suspending all departing flights from the country due to regional tensions until further notice, the airline posted on X.

The suspension will remain in effect "until further notice."

EgyptAir announced in a social media post that all Egypt flights to and from cities in the Persian Gulf have also been canceled "until the situation stabilizes in the region."

The flight suspensions follow Qatar closing its airspace to commercial flights just before Iran launched missiles attacking the U.S. base in Qatar. Bahrain also temporarily suspended air traffic, according to NBC News.

Iran did not move nuclear material out of its Fordo facility before the U.S. strike on Saturday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday morning, citing U.S. intelligence.

A New York Times report published Sunday cited two unnamed Israeli officials who said Iran appeared to have moved nuclear material and equipment from Fordo before the U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites.

"Our intelligence report says they didn't," the Republican senator said.

"In fact, we actually believe they stored more of it in Fordo because they believe Fordo was impenetrable," Mullin said. "They thought it was a safe place to be."

Airlines diverted more flights in the Middle East as Qatar's airspace closed and areas above other Persian Gulf nations were reportedly also off limits after Iran said it attacked a U.S. military base in Qatar.

At least six commercial aircraft turned around near the United Arab Emirates' airspace, according to flight-tracking platform Flightradar24, which also reported that the UAE airspace was closed.

Several major international airlines have also scaled back service to major hubs like Doha, Qatar, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, or have offered travelers vouchers to travel at a later date because of the conflict.

No deaths or injuries have been reported in the missile attack on Al-Udeid military base, CNBC's Megan Cassella reports, citing a statement from Qatar's ministry of defense.

Qatar "strongly condemns" the attack at the Al-Udeid air base and considers it "a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law and the United Nations Charter," Majed Al Ansari, the official spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote on X.

"We reassure that Qatar's air defenses successfully thwarted the attack and intercepted the Iranian missiles," he wrote. 

He said that the base had been evacuated prior to the attack, "given the tensions in the region." 

"We confirm that no injuries or human casualties resulted from the attack," he continued. 

"We affirm that Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this brazen aggression, in line with international law," he said.

Stock indexes are positive so far this afternoon despite the Iranian attacks on U.S. bases, as investors view the missile fire as a relatively limited response to the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities. 

The alternative, and a much more costly scenario for traders, would have been if Iran had targeted oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, for example, or Gulf state oil production sites. 

Oil prices also fell this afternoon after briefly jumping, moved lower by the same working assumptions about Iran's retaliation.

Trump is meeting with his national security team this afternoon.

A White House official told NBC News the national security team was already meeting in the Situation Room when Iranian missiles were fired at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Qatar.

Trump is joined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and other top officials.

President Donald Trump on Monday lashed out at former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for claiming that multiple countries are "ready to directly supply" Iran with nuclear warheads as a result of the U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites.

"Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination?" Trump said of Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's security council. "If he did say that, and, if confirmed, please let me know, IMMEDIATELY," he wrote on Truth Social.

Trump chided Medvedev that the "N word" — which he specified stood for "Nuclear" — "should not be treated so casually." But his response included a similar bout of nuclear saber-rattling, suggesting that the president feels emboldened after ordering the bomb attacks against Iran late Saturday Eastern time.

"By the way, if anyone thinks our 'hardware' was great over the weekend, far and away the strongest and best equipment we have, 20 years advanced over the pack, is our Nuclear Submarines," Trump wrote, calling them "the most powerful and lethal weapons ever built."

Trump added, "I guess that's why Putin's 'THE BOSS.'"

The post came in response to Medvedev, who preceded Vladimir Putin as president, criticizing the U.S. strikes on social media while downplaying their impact on Iran, a Russian ally.

While Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted that the attacks had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear ambitions, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Sunday morning London time that it detected "no increase in off-site radiation levels has been reported as of this time."

Vice President JD Vance in a Sunday interview declined to say that the U.S. is certain that Iran's nuclear sites were destroyed, though he said he believes "we have really pushed their program back by a very long time."

But Medvedev wrote early Sunday morning ET on X that Iranian nuclear infrastructure appears to have sustained only minor damage, and asserted that the "future production of nuclear weapons" will continue.

He added that, "A number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear warheads" following the U.S. strikes.

Medvedev also mocked Trump for having "pushed the US into another war" that most countries oppose.

"At this rate, Trump can forget about the Nobel Peace Prize — not even with how rigged it has become. What a way to kick things off, Mr. President. Congratulations!"

Russia's current president, Putin, on Monday condemned the U.S. military action as "absolutely unprovoked aggression" and claimed that Moscow is making efforts to aid the Iranian people.

Medvedev responded to Trump's critique in a new post, writing, "Russia has no intention of supplying nuclear weapons to Iran." "But other countries might — that's what was said," he added.

Tesla:

A Tesla Inc. robotaxi on Oltorf Street in Austin, Texas, June 22.

Tesla Inc.'s self-driving taxis appeared to violate traffic laws during the company's first day offering paid rides, with one customer capturing footage of a left turn gone wrong and others traveling in cars that exceeded posted speed limits.

In a video taken by Rob Maurer, an investor who used to host a Tesla podcast, the Model Y he's riding in enters an Austin intersection in a left-turn-only lane. The Tesla hesitates to make the turn, swerves right and proceeds into an unoccupied lane meant for traffic moving in the opposite direction.

Israel-Iran War:

The al-Udeid Air Base, which is also the regional headquarters for US Central Command, in Doha in 2021.

Qatar suspended air traffic on Monday after the US and UK governments told citizens based in the Gulf state to shelter in place, amid fears that Iran will target US military assets in retaliation for strikes on its nuclear facilities.

Qatar's foreign affairs ministry described the move as a precautionary measure to protect residents, citizens and visitors. It wasn't immediately clear if there was a specific threat from Iran. Qatar hosts thousands of American servicemembers at the Al Udeid Air base.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

Europe's Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed 0.25% lower on Monday, though sector performances diverged. 

Banks, chemicals and insurance were the biggest losers, each down around 1%, while utilities and technology gained 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively. 

France's CAC 40 index closed 0.7% lower, Germany's DAX 0.3% lower and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 0.2% lower.

Despite the huge spike in Middle East tensions over the weekend, with knock-on effects impacting shipping routes and oil prices, moves in financial markets have been relatively muted on Monday.

That's because corporations are much better prepared for high-risk events than they once were, Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing told CNBC's Annette Weisbach at Germany's Day of Industry 2025 event in Berlin this afternoon.

"It's obviously another crisis situation, but you see actually that overall, the capital markets remain calm," Sewing said.

"Companies and corporates and the whole industry actually had the time and have prepared themselves for these kind of escalations. That doesn't mean that we don't take them seriously. We have to take them very seriously. But each and every participant in the industry is better prepared for those situations than any time before, and therefore we see overall, a calm reaction."

A lot still rests on whether there is further escalation, he noted, but for years boards have been improving their risk management and now pay closer attention during periods of uncertainty.

Shares of London-listed Spectris are topping the Stoxx 600 this afternoon, up nearly 16%, after the maker of industrial equipment announced it had agreed to be acquired for £3.8 billion ($5.13 billion) by U.S. private equity firm Advent International.

Spectris investors will receive £37.63 cash per share under the deal recommended by both boards, an 83% premium to the volume-weighted average price in the month to June 6.

"Since 2019, we have repositioned Spectris as a focused, high quality, compound growth business with advantaged positions in attractive end markets," Spectris CEO Andrew Heath said in a statement.

"Advent's offer recognises the quality of Spectris, our talented people, and our strong growth prospects. In light of a strong set of intentions set out today, the Board have confidence that Advent is committed to supporting Spectris with investment that will drive growth and accelerate delivery of our strategic objectives."

Europe's Stoxx 600 index remains 0.48% lower, but action over on Wall Street is more subdued despite the spike in Middle East tensions over the weekend, with the main indexes near the flatline. 

Shortly after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 45 points, or 0.1%. The S&P 500 hovered around breakeven, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2%.

Some investors appear to believe there will be a limit to further escalation in conflict between the U.S. and Iran from here, while steadier oil price movements are also calming market jitters. ICE Brent Crude futures were 0.3% higher at $77.32 a barrel at 2:40 p.m. in London.

Novo Nordisk has reportedly ended its partnership to provide its weight-loss drug Wegovy through telehealth provider Hims & Hers, knocking down the share price of the Californian firm.

Reuters news first reported, citing a statement from Novo, that the deal signed two months ago in April was being terminated. Hims & Hers' shares have sunk more than 16% in premarket trading.

In April, the two companies said they had agreed to a "long-term" partnership to bring "more accessible, more affordable" weight-loss drugs to Americans at a reduced price of $599 per month. That deal came after the Danish company came under criticism from some U.S. lawmakers for the high cost of its drugs.

Novo Nordisk and Hims and Hers did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries.

The sell-off in European defense stocks has gathered pace late morning.

German defense contractors RENK Group, Hensoldt, Rheinmetall, Sweden's Saab, Italy's Leonardo and  France's Thales are among the biggest decliners in the Stoxx Europe 600 index.

It contrasts with the shares in U.S. defense companies gaining ground premarket. RTX Corp and Northrop Grumman shares are up 0.9%. Other aerospace and defense stocks in the S&P 500 moving higher are L3Harris and General Dynamics, up by 0.8%  and 0.5%, respectively.

Shares of diversified Boeing and General Electric are the only two major defense contractors in the red. Lockheed Martin shares are 0.3% in the black.

The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, the bombs dropped on Iran, were developed by Boeing and were carried on B-2 bomber aircraft developed by Northrop.

Iran may be threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, but experts told CNBC that it's also the one with the most to lose.

In major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country's parliament on Sunday reportedly approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, risking alienating its neighbors and trade partners.

Regional defense stocks were lower on Monday as investors assessed the fallout of the U.S. joining Israel's strikes on Iran.

The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index was last seen around 0.5% lower, starting the week on a negative note after gaining 1.1% over the course of last week.

German defense giant Rheinmetall was 1.7% lower during early trade, paring earlier losses, while Sweden's Saab shed 1.3% and France's Thales was down by around 0.8%.

Bucking the trend was Polish defense equipment manufacturer Lubawa, which jumped 3.5% during early trade.

As markets digest the U.S. strikes on Iran over the weekend, the dollar is on the rise, while other currencies typically seen as safe havens have lost momentum.

The U.S. dollar index — which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals — was 0.3% higher by 8:25 a.m. in London. So far this year, the dollar index has shed around 8.8%.

The safe haven Swiss franc was flat against the dollar during early European trade, paring gains seen ahead of the regional open.

Meanwhile, the Japanese yen — also typically seen as a safe haven during times of geopolitical or macroeconomic uncertainty — lost ground. The Japanese currency shed 0.7% against the dollar on Monday morning, 0.5% against the euro and 0.7% against the British pound.

Market watchers noted on Monday that the yen would come under pressure if the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway crucial to the transit of oil, is closed.

"Eyes are on how Iran would retaliate — a potential withdrawal from its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and abandon the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," analysts at Maybank said in a Monday morning note. "Risk sensitive (AUD, NZD, CAD) and net oil importers (KRW, JPY, TWD, PHP, INR) could continue to remain under pressure."

"We think USD/JPY works as a hedge against an escalation in geopolitical tension in the Middle East with positive carry," analysts at Bank of America said in a Friday note.

"The US is largely energy-independent. Japan imports almost all of petroleum it needs and more than 90% of its petroleum imports come from the Middle East, the highest dependency among G10 economies. USD/JPY can reprice higher if the oil price remains elevated."

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis fell nearly 6% shortly after the opening bell, before swiftly paring some of its losses after a brief trading suspension. The stock was last seen trading down 2.1%.

That comes shortly after new CEO Antonio Filosa announced the firm's new management team on his first day in the job.

"It is my great privilege to take the lead of Stellantis, a global company with deep regional roots," Filosa said in a statement.

Alongside taking the reins, the company said, Filosa will retain his role as head of North America and American brands.

Stellantis chief financial officer Doug Ostermann will take on responsibility for mergers and acquisitions and joint ventures, while Jean-Philippe Imparato continues in his role as head of enlarged Europe and European brands, which will now also include the struggling luxury Maserati unit.

We're 10 minutes into Monday's trading session, and European shares are trading lower as the Middle East conflict — and America's involvement in it — remains in focus.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen 0.4% lower, with every sector barring oil and gas in negative territory. All major bourses are in the red, with France's CAC 40, down 0.7%, leading losses.

The U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran might seem like a geopolitical flashpoint that would send markets tumbling. Instead, investors are largely shrugging off the escalation, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained — and even bullish for some risk assets.

Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a choppy start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 0.3% lower at 8,747, Germany's DAX down 0.4% 23,222, France's CAC 40 0.5% lower at 7,536 and Italy's FTSE MIB 0.6% lower.

Global market sentiment could plummet further this week after the United States entered Israel's war against Iran over the weekend, launching strikes against three nuclear sites in Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz. The move by U.S. President Donald Trump surprised investors because he had said last Friday that he would make a decision to attack Iran "within the next two weeks," according to the White House.

The latest attacks caused oil prices to rise further and have stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East. Asia-Pacific markets declined overnight, while U.S. stock futures fell ahead of Monday's session.

Global markets will be on edge, given the escalation in the Middle East over the weekend, as a further spike in oil prices could be on the cards.

In Europe, flash purchasing managers' index data, showing business activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, is due Monday morning.

There are no other major earnings or data releases.

Tesla's Model Y robotaxi finally hit the road this weekend, sending shares of the electric vehicle maker up 10% on Monday.

The EV giant debuted autonomous rides in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, opening the service to a limited number of riders by invitation only.

Those invited included longtime Tesla fans, promoters and shareholders, many of whom generate income from posting Tesla- and Musk-related social media content on platforms including X and YouTube.

CEO Elon Musk said in a post on his social network X that customers were charged a flat fee of $4.20 per ride.

"Super congratulations to the @Tesla_AI software & chip design teams on a successful @Robotaxi launch!! Culmination of a decade of hard work. Both the AI chip and software teams were built from scratch within Tesla," he said in a post.

One passenger in Tesla's early access program for the Model Y robotaxis wrote on X that they did 11 rides with the service with "zero issues." Musk reposted numerous firsthand encounters with the services.

Other road users and researchers observed the robotaxis appearing to violate traffic rules in Austin.

The Verge reported a Tesla Model Y robotaxi briefly traveled the wrong way down a road in Austin. Tesla-critical author Ed Niedermeyer shared a video from Austin showing a Tesla robotaxi braking hard in the middle of traffic in response to "stationary police vehicles outside its driving path."

Musk has long promised a Tesla robotaxi fleet to investors, amping up the pressure to deliver in recent months.

Once considered a pioneer, Tesla is now trying to catch up to Alphabet's Waymo in the West, and Chinese competitors including Baidu's Apollo Go, WeRide and Pony.ai. Waymo has reported that it is now delivering more than 250,000 commercial driverless rides per week and surpassed 10 million trips last month. Apollo Go reported that it has surpassed 11 million trips.

Musk told CNBC's David Faber last month that Tesla aims to have "hundreds of thousands, if not over a million" self-driving cars in the U.S. by the end of next year. In May, Musk first announced plans to launch the service in Austin, with later debuts set for Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Heading into the launch, Tesla faced pushback from a group of Democratic lawmakers in Texas and public safety advocates who urged the company to delay the debut.

The company has not yet released the systems being tested on Texas streets, known as FSD Unsupervised, to general Tesla owners.

Tesla sells its new EVs with partially automated driving systems marketed as the standard Autopilot, and premium FSD Supervised systems. These include features such as automatic lane-keeping and navigation, and have been linked to accidents, including fatalities, according to data tracked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

President Donald Trump on Monday demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down or they would play "into the hands of the enemy," as the conflict in the Middle East escalates following U.S. strikes on Iran.

"EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!," the president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

U.S. crude oil was down 75 cents, or 1.02%, to $73.09 per barrel in the wake of Trump's post. Global benchmark Brent fell 73 cents, or 0.95%, to $76.28 per barrel.

Trump's message comes after the U.S. bombed Iran's key nuclear sites over the weekend, putting the world on edge that the Islamic Republic might target energy supplies in the Middle East and cause a spike in global oil prices.

It wasn't clear who specifically Trump was speaking to in his post, though he seemed to be addressing the U.S. oil industry. Some oil companies had warned earlier in the year that they might have to cut production after prices tumbled to multiyear lows on Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ boosting supply.

"To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!," Trump said in a subsequent post on Monday. Oil production decisions in the U.S. are made by private companies in response to market dynamics. The Energy Department does not drill for oil.

"As the President said, producers must keep oil prices down or risk playing into the hands of the enemy," White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said when asked who Trump was addressing.

The oil market has been largely unfazed by the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, with futures trading largely flat through much of Monday morning. Brent had jumped more than 5% on Sunday evening to crack $81 before easing. WTI also reached its highest levels since January before pulling back.

Weight-Loss Drugs:

Novo Nordisk A/S scrapped a partnership with Hims & Hers Health Inc. after less than two months, saying the US company is using “deceptive marketing” to sell copycat versions of its obesity blockbuster Wegovy. 

Hims, a telehealth platform, wasn't stepping back enough from its practice of mass marketing off-brand imitations of the weight-loss medicine, Novo executives said.

Vultr, a provider of cloud infrastructure, said on Monday that it has raised $329 million in new debt from some of the largest Wall Street banks as it aims to expand its ability to host and run artificial intelligence models.

Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, KeyBank and Wells Fargo participated in the syndicated credit facility, according to a statement. The company didn't provide an exact rate that it's paying for the debt, but did say that it's down dramatically from prior debt raises in the industry, a sign that banks are getting more comfortable with the asset class.

CoreWeave, the AI infrastructure provider that went public earlier this year, said last month that it had raised $2 billion in fresh debt at a 9.25% annual interest rate. That's down from a rate of over 14% in 2023 and 11% in 2024.

Vultr CEO J.J. Kardwell told CNBC that his company's new debt is "hundreds of basis points below" what CoreWeave is paying in its latest offering. In 2021 Vultr raised $150 million in debt from Bank of America and JPMorgan.

Major cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft are shelling out tens of billions of dollars a year to set up data centers to meet growing demand, particularly for AI. While the megacap tech companies have hefty cash balances, many of the smaller cloud players have to tap outside sources of capital.

Vultr is still privately held, but the company says it's profitable. CoreWeave, for its part, reported a $314.6 million net loss in the first quarter on about $982 million in revenue. As of March, CoreWeave had $8.7 billion in debt, according to its latest financial results.

Founded in 2014 and based in West Palm Beach, Florida, Vultr has built up a base of over 1.5 million customers, many of them paying a few dollars per month. The company operates 32 regions of data centers, mostly outside the U.S.

Competitors include Akamai's Linode and DigitalOcean. In AI, Vultr competes more closely with companies like CoreWeave.

In December Vultr said chipmaker AMD joined in a $333 million funding round, valuing the startup at $3.5 billion, while Nvidia-backed CoreWeave has a market cap of $88 billion, up more than fourfold from its IPO. Vultr rents out AI chips from AMD as well as market leader Nvidia.

Kardwell said Vultr is always evaluating its options regarding a possible IPO, but hasn't made a decision on its plans.

More tankers are reversing course away from the Strait of Hormuz as concerns rise on the possible closure of the vital choke point of trade.

Yui Torikata, senior liquid market analyst at industry data firm Kpler, said the situation is fluid.

The firm's data is showing a notable event occurred between early Sunday and early Monday, when at least six vessels — two very large crude carriers, three chemical tankers, and one refined products carrier—diverted their courses away from the Strait of Hormuz.

The specific vessels identified are:

All vessels are in ballast, meaning they either are empty or carrying light loads.

"However, the situation has already evolved," Torikata said. "As of this morning, three of those six vessels —the South Loyalty, Coswisdom Lake, and Damsgaard — have again changed direction and are now heading back towards the Strait of Hormuz. The other three vessels are currently idling off the coasts of Khor Fakkan and Muscat."

"This specific weekend event should be seen in a broader context," Torikata said. "In the immediate wake of the Israel-Iran conflict, the number of available empty [ballast] crude carriers within the Middle East Gulf zone fell to a record low, indicating significant reluctance from shipowners to enter the area. However, that trend has since reversed."

"The count of available tankers recovered toward the weekend, and the number of crude carriers in the Gulf of Oman signaling their intent to enter the Mideast Gulf has also recovered from the low seen on June 16," she added. "This suggests that, for now, the overall flow of vessels into the region is being sustained despite the recent, specific diversion event."

The moves follow a U.S. attack Saturday on what have been identified as three major nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran.

Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said the reports by the UK Maritime Trade Operations on widespread electronic interference and GPS jamming and location spoofing are adding to vessel owners' worries.

Frontline tanker Front Eagle and dark fleet tanker Adalynn collided last week near the Strait of Hormuz. Following the collision, a fire on the deck of the Front Eagle erupted and was extinguished.

"Combined with increasing insurance costs, some owners will simply avoid the area — like Frontline," Lipow said.

The tanker company recently said it would stop accepting new contracts to sail through the Strait of Hormuz.

"Other companies are likely to follow its lead," shipping publication Lloyd's List wrote in a recent report on the Frontline decision.

"This causes a de facto partial supply disruption if there is a lack of tankers to carry the oil that needs to be exported," Lipow said.

"Some tanker owners may feel that China, who buys 90% of Iranian crude oil along with significant quantities of oil from the Middle East, is pressuring Iran not to disrupt shipping," Lipow added. "While oil exports are Iran's economic lifeline and it would not be in Iran's interest to halt its own exports, if cornered, Iran might decide to inflict as much economic pain as it can on the rest of the world."

Iran's parliament voted on Sunday to block the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report from Iran's state-owned Press TV that CNBC could not independently verify. A final decision rests with the country's national security council.

British maritime security firm Ambrey issued an alert that five U.S.-affiliated merchant ships departed the Arabian/Persian Gulf since the U.S. military operations, and no ships publicly affiliated with the U.S. appear to have entered the area since the U.S. strikes. "Ambrey is aware of at least five merchant ships that were destined to enter the Arabian/Persian Gulf but about-turned or chose to wait," it wrote. 

Ambrey added that at least two of these ships did not have a public U.S.-affiliation, indicating broader concern in the market. Meanwhile, it noted several U.S.-flagged merchant ships that have gathered in UAE territorial seas. Ambrey's view of the situation is that Iran is "almost certain to respond militarily to the U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities. This is likely to include attacks or seizures of US-affiliated shipping," it wrote.

Lipow said the conflict could spark additional geopolitical instability.

"While China has condemned the United States attack on Iran, we have not seen China provide Iran with any kind of support other than words," Lipow said. "Russian attacks Ukraine, the United States attacks Iran, now China may feel emboldened to attack Taiwan."

Jakob Larsen, head of security at Bimco, the world's largest direct-membership organization for shipowners, charterers, shipbrokers and agents, warned Iran could attempt a wider disruption of commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz through attacks on merchant ships. Anti-ship missiles or drones of both airborne and surface types could be used in these attacks, he said.

"The laying of sea mines would constitute another dangerous development, but Iran's intent to do so is questionable due to the risk to Iran-affiliated commercial ships and the risk of environmental disaster in case a ship is damaged," Larsen said.

The Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points. The inability of oil to traverse through, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays.

In 2023, oil flows through the waterway averaged 20.9 million barrels per day, accounting for about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Hormuz handles less than 4% of global container trade, but the ports of Jebel Ali and Khor Fakkan in the UAE are critical intermediary points for global shipping networks in the region.

The majority of cargo volumes from those ports are destined for Dubai, which has become a hub for the movement of freight with feeder services in the Persian Gulf, South Asia and East Africa.

In this article

Novo Nordisk on Monday said it is ending its collaboration with Hims & Hers due to concerns about the telehealth company's sales and promotion of cheaper knock-offs of the weight loss drug Wegovy. 

Shares of Hims & Hers fell roughly 28% on Monday, while Novo Nordisk's stock fell more than 6%.

Novo Nordisk in April said it would offer Wegovy through several telehealth companies such as Hims & Hers to expand access to the blockbuster injection now that it is no longer in short supply in the U.S. 

The end of the Wegovy shortage meant compounding pharmacies were legally restricted from making and selling cheaper, unapproved versions of the drug by May 22 – with rare exceptions. Telehealth companies have said patients may still need personalized compounded versions of Wegovy in situations where it's medically necessary.

But Novo Nordisk on Monday said Hims & Hers has "failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs" under the "false guise" of personalization. The drugmaker also accused Hims & Hers of "deceptive" marketing that is putting patient safety at risk.

"We expected that the efforts towards compounding personalization would diminish over time. When we didn't see that, we had to make a choice on behalf of patients," Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, told CNBC. "We've been firm all along that patient safety is our primary focus."

"Our expectation was that [Hims & Hers'] business focus would transfer toward real, safe, approved medications," he said. Moore said Novo Nordisk will not incur any fees from terminating the collaboration, as it was established through a third-party that manages the drugmaker's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy

In a statement on X, Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said the company is "disappointed to see Novo Nordisk management misleading the public."

Dudum said in recent weeks, Novo Nordisk's commercial team has "increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients." He added Hims & Hers plays a role in protecting the ability of providers and patients to control individual treatment decisions, and "will not compromise the integrity of our platform to appease a third party or preserve a collaboration."

He said Hims & Hers will continue to offer several treatments, including Wegovy, to allow providers to meet the individual needs of patients.

In a note on Monday, Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight said the end of the collaboration increases Hims & Hers' legal risk "substantially." He added that he was surprised the partnership, when initially announced, did not include any efforts to curb the telehealth company's compounding efforts.

During Food and Drug Administration-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. They can also be produced on a case-by-case basis when it's medically necessary for a patient, such as when they can't swallow a pill or are allergic to a specific ingredient in a branded drug. 

But drugmakers and some health experts have pushed back against the practice, largely because the FDA does not approve compounded drugs.

Novo Nordisk said it will continue offering the branded version of Wegovy through telehealth organizations that "share our commitment to safe and effective medical treatment for patients living with chronic diseases."

Moore said Novo Nordisk has seen several other mass compounding pharmacies reduce or stop making and selling Wegovy knock-offs. He added that the company will "engage on the legal front" and with the FDA to ensure that illegal compounding diminishes.

In a release on Monday, Novo Nordisk said it conducted an investigation that found the active ingredients used in Wegovy knock-offs sold by telehealth companies and compounded pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China. The drugmaker also cited a report from the Brookings Institution in April, which found that a large share of those Chinese suppliers were never inspected by the FDA, and many that were inspected had drug quality assurance violations. 

"These medicines that are coming into our country from sources around the world are not even approved in those countries that they originated, and it's a problem," Moore said.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

The race to create publicly traded bitcoin treasuries is accelerating — and so is the capital pouring in.

ProCap Financial, the latest entrant, has raised more than $750 million and is going public through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I, according to an announcement Monday.

Led by investor and podcast host Anthony Pompliano, ProCap raised more than $750 million in its funding round, including $235 million in convertible debt, with equity making up the rest. The new firm aims to hold up to $1 billion in bitcoin on its balance sheet and generate revenue through a full-stack, bitcoin-denominated financial services platform.

The rush into bitcoin treasuries — inflated by cheap capital, yield promises, and brand name endorsements — is starting to resemble a bubble.

"There's an old George Soros quote that goes, 'When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire,'" Pompliano said. "There's a reason the bubble forms — because the trend works."

ProCap joins a growing cohort of bitcoin-heavy ventures using reverse mergers and blank-check vehicles to tap into public markets.

From Trump Media's $2.5 billion bitcoin treasury plan to Jack Mallers' Twenty-One and the Nakamoto fund, a growing number of firms are racing to offer stock market exposure to bitcoin.

Some, like Tron founder Justin Sun, are using reverse mergers to take crypto businesses public — in Sun's case, folding his blockchain platform into a Nasdaq-listed toy manufacturer. Others, like Mallers, are launching purpose-built bitcoin holding firms backed by heavyweight investors including Tether and SoftBank.

While Trump Media isn't a crypto-native firm, it has embraced the playbook of raising money to buy bitcoin and promoting the asset through affiliated ventures.

All are following a path blazed by Strategy's Michael Saylor: Turning public companies into bitcoin proxies.

But ProCap says it's pushing beyond that model, aiming not just to hold bitcoin but to build a financial services platform on top of it.

"Most other firms raised capital that's just sitting in cash while they wait for deals to close," Pompliano told CNBC. "We're buying bitcoin immediately."

He added that ProCap's equity investors are getting direct exposure from day one.

The structure gives ProCap a rare first-mover edge in a space where many deals are still weeks or months from closing, with some yet to even file their S-4s — the regulatory documents required to complete a merger. It also sets the stage for a new phase of the bitcoin proxy trade: not just holding bitcoin, but generating yield from it.

"We want to build the leading bitcoin-native financial services company," Pompliano said. "Like a traditional Wall Street firm, but on top of a bitcoin balance sheet instead of dollars."

ProCap plans to offer services like lending, trading, and capital markets — all denominated in bitcoin. The goal is to recreate the architecture of a Goldman Sachs or Cantor Fitzgerald, rebuilt from the ground up in crypto.

"The goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution," he added. "That resonates very differently with capital allocators."

ProCap's pitch to investors is that it's not just chasing momentum. It's building the infrastructure for what Pompliano calls a new financial system — one that runs on bitcoin, but looks and feels familiar to the institutions still sitting on the sidelines.

"Many companies don't care about the cost of capital. We do," he added. "We're traditional capital allocators — we care about building a sustainable business that generates cash flow."

Global investors are on alert about a 90-mile sea passage in the Middle East, fearing that any block of the Strait of Hormuz could derail global shipping and oil.

Tensions in the Middle East escalated sharply after the US struck Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday, prompting fears of retaliation from Tehran. Beyond concerns about defense and security, markets are concerned about the fallout for oil prices and the global economy should Iran block shipping in the Strait of Hormuz — a threat Tehran has repeated for years.

"If Iran chooses to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, it'd be categorically negative," Kyle Rodda, a senior financial markets analyst at Capital.com, told Business Insider.

"In the worst-case scenario, it would be incredibly impactful: higher fuel prices, higher inflation, slower growth, and interest rates higher than where they'd otherwise be," Rodda said.

One of the most geopolitically sensitive maritime routes, the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles across at its narrowest point. It connects the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, with Iran to its north and the United Arab Emirates and Oman to its south.

According to the US's Energy Information Administration, the Hormuz is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, carrying about 20 million barrels of oil a day.

Most energy shipments through the Strait of Hormuz have no other means of exiting the Persian Gulf, the starting sea point for major oil producers like Saudi Arabia to export their energy to the rest of the world.

About a quarter of seaborne oil and a fifth of global liquified natural gas trade moves through the Hormuz, so any disruption to shipping would hit the energy markets hard.

"The bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities by the US over the weekend increased supply risks significantly for the oil and LNG market," wrote Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy at ING, on Monday.

Iran doesn't have the legal authority to shut down marine traffic in the Hormuz. But it could disrupt the movement of vessels by other means, for example by damaging oil and shipping infrastructure.

On Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against the US's action. The final decision still lies with the country's top security officials, according to Iran's state-owned Press TV.

Analysts said they think an Iranian blockade is probably more about political posturing than real action.

"While the headlines sound dramatic, the reality is that Iran's parliament holds no executive power over military or strategic decisions, particularly not ones with such far-reaching geopolitical and economic consequences," Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, told BI.

"Iran is well aware that any direct disruption to global oil flows through the Strait would likely trigger a significant military and economic response, possibly escalating the conflict beyond its control," she added.

The US is an energy giant and has become a net energy exporter since 2019, so it's less prone to physical supply shock from a blockade of the Hormuz.

However, the US could still be hit by the fallout from worsening global economic conditions.

"Any negative impact would be through deteriorating financial conditions or through higher for longer rates as the Fed has another reason to delay cuts," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a Monday note.

Asian countries would be the most affected by a blockade of the Hormuz, said Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova.

In 2024, over 80% of crude oil, condensates, and LNG that moved through the Hormuz headed to Asia, according to the EIA.

"Asia, which consumes the lion's share of Middle Eastern oil, would be most vulnerable, with India, Japan, South Korea, and China facing logistical uncertainties and costlier re-routing," said Sachdeva.

In 2023, a third of the oil that passed through the Hormuz headed to China, Bloomberg calculated.

South European countries dependent on Gulf oil could also face higher import costs, although Saudi Arabia and the UAE can reroute significant volumes of such exports via pipelines and via a pipeline and the UAE port of Fujairah.

Energy is a key input cost, so any gains in oil prices are likely to drive up inflation broadly.

The US's strike on Iran sent oil futures up to a five-month high late on Sunday. Oil prices are now up about 10% since Israel's strikes on Iran in June.

These developments are taking place amid the summer driving season, when US gas demand peaks. Should the gains in oil prices be sustained, pump prices are likely to rise in the weeks ahead.

According to the EIA, the price of gas typically rises by 2.4 cents per gallon when crude oil prices rise by $1. This translates into a gain of about 20 cents per gallon at current levels for oil futures.

Health plans under major U.S. insurers said Monday they have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations – a process that is often a major pain point for patients and providers when getting and administering care.

Prior authorization makes providers obtain approval from a patient's insurance company before they carry out specific services or treatments. Insurers say the process ensures patients receive medically necessary care and allows them to control costs. But patients and providers have slammed prior authorizations for, in some cases, leading to care delays or denials and physician burnout.

Dozens of plans under large insurers such as CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Humana, Elevance Health and Blue Cross Blue Shield committed to a series of actions that aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers, according to a release from AHIP, a trade group representing health plans. Though the companies cheered the changes, they could cut into profits if they lead to patients using care more often.

"The American health care system must work better for people, and we will improve it in distinctive ways that truly matter," said Steve Nelson, president of CVS' insurer, Aetna, in a statement. "We support the industry's commitments to streamline, simplify and reduce prior authorization."

Insurers will implement the changes across markets, including commercial coverage and certain Medicare and Medicaid plans. The group said the tweaks will benefit 257 million Americans.

The move comes months after the U.S. health insurance industry faced a torrent of public backlash following the murder of UnitedHealthcare's top executive, Brian Thompson. It builds on the work several companies have already done to simplify their prior authorization processes. 

Among the efforts is establishing a common standard for submitting electronic prior authorization requests by the start of 2027. By then, at least 80% of electronic prior authorization approvals with all necessary clinical documents will be answered in real time, the release said. 

That aims to streamline the process and ease the workload of doctors and hospitals, many of whom still submit requests manually on paper rather than electronically. 

Individual plans will reduce the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. 

"We look forward to collaborating with payers to ensure these efforts lead to meaningful and lasting improvements in patient care," said Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, in the release. 

UnitedHealthcare, in a statement, said it "welcomes the opportunity to join other health insurance plans in our shared commitment to modernize and streamline the prior authorization process."

The company said it builds on its previous efforts, including steps to reduce the number of services requiring prior authorization. It also includes UnitedHealthcare's national Gold Card program, which recognizes and awards providers who "consistently adhere to evidence-based care guidelines" by reducing their total prior authorization requests.

Russia's response to Iran's call for help is being closely watched on Monday after the U.S. bombed Tehran's nuclear facilities over the weekend — but Moscow might not be quick to offer its ally a hand.

The attacks on Iranian nuclear sites, which President Donald Trump described as an "obliteration," has left the Islamic Republic scrambling for support from the few friends it has on the global stage. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi headed to Moscow on Monday for "serious consultations" with Russian President Vladimir Putin over how to answer the assaults.

Iran has helped Russia with military drones throughout the war in Ukraine, but analysts now say there might be very little Moscow can or will to do to reciprocate.

"Iran has massively supported Putin's war against Ukraine with weapons and technology. On his trip to Moscow, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi may now ask Moscow to return the favour," Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in a note Monday.

"However, Putin has probably little to offer beyond some words. He needs his weapons himself for his continued aggression against Ukraine," he noted.

Russia also has to tread a fine line between placating and assisting ally Iran and keeping the U.S. sweet, as it looks to re-establish ties with Donald Trump's Russia-friendlier administration.

"If Putin were to annoy Trump over Iran in any significant way, Trump may change tack and impose new heavy sanctions on Russia and/or weaken Putin's position in other ways," Schmieding said.

So far, Moscow's response to the escalating crisis has been muted, with Russia calling on Iran and Israel to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis.

The Iranian conflict could strengthen Russia's position in Ukraine modestly, analysts say, as it distracts Western attention — and potentially resources — away from Ukraine. Higher oil prices could also mean more export revenue for oil producer Russia's war coffers.

At the same time, Russia is watching on as another Middle Eastern ally is weakened, eroding its own foothold in the region in the process. Russia has already seen one valuable alliance crumble recently by way of last year's ousting of Bashar al Assad's regime in Syria putting the future of Moscow's air and naval bases in the country in doubt.

Russia stands to further lose out on potentially lucrative investments and infrastructure projects, if Iran is severely destabilized. The issue for Moscow is to now gauge how much it has to win or lose by helping or abandoning Iran.

"Moscow itself appears to be undecided what to make of a new war in the Middle East," Nikita Smagin, an expert on Iranian foreign and domestic policies at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in analysis.

"On the one hand, Russia has invested heavily in various projects in Iran over the past three years, all of which could now go to waste. At the same time, Moscow hopes to benefit from Middle Eastern instability through rising oil prices and declining interest in Ukraine."

Ruling out the possibility of Russia giving Iran any military assistance, Smagin said the bigger issue for Moscow is the threat to all the Iranian ventures it has actively invested in recently, including oil and gas projects, infrastructure and transit routes.

"A few days before the start of the Israeli operation, the Iranian ambassador to Moscow said that Russia was the country's largest foreign investor in 2024. The ambassador did not specify any investment volumes, but Russian investments were estimated at $2.76 billion the previous year. Moscow planned to invest about $8 billion in oil and gas projects alone," Smagin said.

"Now the future of those projects is in doubt."

Iran may be threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz but experts told CNBC that it's also the one with the most to lose.

In major move after U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites, the country's parliament on Sunday approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, according to a report from Iran's state-owned Press TV that CNBC could not independently verify. 

The step would risk alienating Tehran's neighbors and trade partners.

The decision to close the waterway now rests with the country's national security council, and its possibility has raised the specter of higher energy prices and aggravated geopolitical tensions, with Washington calling upon Beijing to prevent the strait's closure.

Vandana Hari, founder of energy intelligence firm Vanda Insights, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" that the possibility of closure remains "absolutely minimalistic."

If Iran blocks the strait, the country risks turning its neighboring oil producing countries into enemies and risks hostilities with them, she said.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration revealed that Iran had shipped 1.5 million barrels per day via the Strait of Hormuz in the first quarter of 2025.

Furthermore, a closure would also provoke Iran's market in Asia, particularly China, which accounts for a majority of Iranian oil exports.

"So very, very little to be achieved, and a lot of self inflicted harm that Iran could do" Hari said.

Her view is supported by Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research at advisory firm Signum Global Advisors.

Iran will not want to antagonize China, he said, adding that disrupting supplies will also "put a target" on the country's own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime "at a time when there is little reason to doubt U.S. and Israeli resolve in being 'trigger-happy.'"

Clayton Seigle, senior fellow for Energy Security and Climate Change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that as China is "very dependent" on oil flows from the Gulf, not just Iran, "its national security interest really would value stabilization of the situation and a de-escalation enabling safe flows of oil and gas through the strait."

There are currently there are no indications of threats to commercial shipping passing the waterway, according to the Joint Maritime Information Center. "U.S. associated vessels have successfully transited the Strait of Hormuz without interruption, which is a positive sign for the immediate future."

The Strait of Hormuz is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, and about 20% of the world's oil transits the waterway. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has described it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint."

"Iran's operations in and around Hormuz are unlikely to be 'all or nothing' – but instead move along a sliding scale from total disruption to none at all," said Signum's Bishop.

"The best strategy [for Iran] would be to rattle Hormuz oil flows just enough to hurt the U.S. via moderate upward price movement, but not enough to provoke a major U.S. response against Iran's oil production and export capacity," he added.

On Sunday, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said in a post on X that pump prices in the U.S. could climb to $3.35-$3.50 per gallon in the days ahead, compared to the national average of $3.139 for the week of June 16.

Should Iran decide to close the strait, it would likely use small boats for a partial blockade, or for a more complete solution, mine the waterway, according to David Roche, strategist at Quantum Strategy.

In a Sunday note, S&P Global Commodity Insights wrote that any Iranian closure of the strait would mean that not only Iran's own exports will be affected, but also those of nearby Gulf nations, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.

That would potentially remove over 17 billion barrels of oil from global markets, and affect regional refineries by causing feedstock shortages, the research firm said. The disruption to supply will impact Asia, Europe as well as North America.

Besides oil, natural gas flows could also be "severely impacted," S&P said, with Qatar's gas exports of about 77 million metric tons per year potentially unable to reach key markets in Asia and Europe.

Qatar's LNG exports represent about 20% of global LNG supply.

"Alternative supply routes for Middle Eastern oil and gas are limited, with pipeline capacity insufficient to offset potential maritime disruptions through the Persian Gulf and Red Sea," S&P added.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia pointed out that "there is limited scope to bypass the Strait of Hormuz." Pipelines in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have only a spare capacity of 2.6 million barrels a day between them, while the strait oversees the transport of an estimated 20 million barrels of oil and oil products per day, the bank said in a note.

All these present upside risk to energy prices, with Goldman Sachs estimating that the market is pricing in a geopolitical risk premium of $12.

If oil flows through the strait were to drop by 50% for one month and then were to remain down by 10% for another 11 months, Brent is forecast to "briefly jump" to a peak of around $110, Goldman said.

Brent oil futures currently stand at $78.95 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate futures were trading at $75.75.

 Bitcoin bulls proved they are ready to buy dips to $100,000 and below. Which altcoins will follow? 

Key points:

Bitcoin's bounce from the $100,000 shows buyers are committed to the overarching bull trend.

Select altcoins have broken below respective support levels, suggesting further weakness for mid-caps in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has held above the psychological support of $100,000, but the strength of each will determine whether or not the bullish trend remains intact. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes sounded positive in a post on X, saying that Bitcoin's weakness shall pass, leaving no doubt about its safe haven status.

Bitcoin's relative stability compared to the top US stocks during the current geopolitical crisis shows it is maturing as an asset class. Bitwise Europe Head of Research André Dragosch shared a chart on X, showing Bitcoin's 60-day realized volatility at 27-28%, lower than the S&P 500 Index (SPX) at roughly 30%, the Nasdaq 100 at about 35% and the “Magnificent 7” technology stocks close to 40%. 

The failure to break out to a new high has not created panic among institutional investors, who continue to buy Bitcoin. CoinShares reported on Monday that Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed inflows of $1.1 billion for the trading week ending Friday. Inflows, despite a fall in the spot price, show that investors were buying on weakness, the report added.

Could sellers pull Bitcoin back below $100,000, or will buyers succeed in pushing the price higher? How are altcoins likely to behave? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

The S&P 500 Index has pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average (5,950), indicating selling by the bears in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone.

If the price dips and maintains below the 20-day EMA, the index could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average (5,747). Buyers are expected to defend the 50-day SMA with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to 5,580. The deeper the pullback, the greater the time needed for the uptrend to resume. 

This negative view will be invalidated if the price bounces off the 20-day EMA and rises above 6,060. That sets the stage for a retest of the all-time high at 6,147. A break above the 6,147 level signals the start of the next leg of the uptrend toward 6,500.

The failure of the bears to sustain the price below the 97.92 support started a bounce, which has reached the moving averages.

The 20-day EMA (98.92) is flattening out, and the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) signals that the selling pressure is reducing. That increases the possibility of a break above the 50-day SMA ($99.48). If that happens, the index could march to 100.54 and, after that, to the 102 resistance.

If bears want to retain control, they will have to successfully defend the moving averages and swiftly pull the price below the immediate support at 98.48. If they do that, the index could retest the crucial support at 97.60.

Bitcoin fell below the crucial $100,000 support on Sunday, but the bulls aggressively purchased the dip, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.

The bulls tried to start a relief rally but are facing selling at higher levels. If the price turns down from the current level or the moving averages, the bears will make another attempt to sink and maintain the BTC/USDT pair below $100,000. If they can pull it off, the pair may tumble to $93,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if buyers shove the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the downtrend line. Sellers are expected to mount a strong defense in the zone between the downtrend line and the all-time high of $111,980.

Ether (ETH) rebounded off the $2,111 support on Sunday, indicating solid demand at lower levels.

The bulls are trying to push the price above the breakdown level of $2,323 but are facing significant resistance from the bears. If the price turns down from $2,323, it heightens the risk of a break below $2,111. The ETH/USDT pair may then collapse to $1,754.

Buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,467). If they succeed, it suggests that the $2,111 level is likely to act as a new floor. The pair could then rally to $2,738.

XRP (XRP) fell below the $2 support on Sunday, but the bulls purchased the dip, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. 

The bears are unlikely to give up easily and will try to halt the relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($2.15). If the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair risks a drop to the $1.61 support.

On the contrary, a break above the 20-day EMA suggests the markets rejected the break below the $2 level. The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($2.26), extending its stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for some more time.

BNB (BNB) broke below the $634 support on Saturday, indicating that the range-bound action has resolved in favor of the bears.

The BNB/USDT pair bounced off the $600 support on Sunday, but the recovery is expected to face selling at the breakdown level of $634. If the price turns down from $634, it suggests that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That increases the possibility of a drop to the strong support at $580.

Buyers will have to propel the price above the moving averages to prevent the downside move. If they do that, the pair could ascend to $675.

Solana (SOL) fell below the $140 support on Saturday and extended the decline near the $123 support on Sunday.

Buyers are trying to start a recovery, which could face selling at the breakdown level of $140 and then at the 20-day EMA ($147). If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the bears will try to resume the downtrend. If the $123 level cracks, the SOL/USDT pair could descend to $110.

Instead, if buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA, it signals solid demand at lower levels. The pair may then rally to the 50-day SMA.

Related: Is XRP price going to crash again?

Dogecoin (DOGE) has been oscillating inside a large range between $0.14 and $0.26, indicating buying on dips and selling near the overhead resistance.

The bulls will try to start a bounce off $0.14, but the relief rally is likely to face strong selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.17). If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again attempt to sink the DOGE/USDT pair below $0.14. If they succeed, the pair could descend to $0.10.

Contrarily, if buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Sellers will try to defend the 50-day SMA and keep the pair inside the $0.14 to $0.21 range for a while.

Cardano (ADA) continued its slide and fell near the $0.50 support on Sunday. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $0.50 level, as a break below it will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern.

The recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.62). If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the possibility of a break below the $0.50 support increases. The ADA/USDT pair could then plunge to $0.40.

The first sign of strength will be a close above the 20-day EMA. That suggests the bulls are fiercely protecting the $0.50 level. The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.70) and later to the downtrend line.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($32.63) on Saturday and again on Sunday, indicating solid buying at lower levels.

Sellers are trying to retain the advantage by halting the recovery at the 20-day EMA ($36.74). If they manage to do that, the HYPE/USDT pair could retest the strong support at $30.50. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $28.50 to $30.50 zone.

On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests the bears are losing their grip. The pair could rise to $40 and subsequently to $42.50. Buyers are likely to face significant resistance in the $42.50 to $45.80 zone.

Crypto's bouncing back, and Solana is getting a lot of people talking. As more big players get involved and the idea of a Solana ETF picks up steam, experts are starting to rethink where things might go. Some are even asking the big question: Could Solana actually hit $500 next year as some bullish Solana price prediction forecasts It's a bold call, but in crypto, big moves aren't off the table. 

Solana's been getting a major credibility boost lately, thanks to some big-name financial partners. Major banks like HSBC, Bank of America, and even government-backed groups like the Monetary Authority of Singapore are starting to work with a company called R3, which just teamed up with the Solana Foundation.

Institutions are looking to use Solana's tech to help move real-world stuff like stocks and bonds onto the blockchain. It shows they trust Solana's speed, low fees, and ability to handle big traffic. That kind of real-world use could give Solana more staying power—and possibly boost its value down the line.

Another big reason people are feeling good about Solana right now is the growing chance that Solana-based ETFs could get approved in the U.S. The SEC has asked for updated paperwork from a few companies, which experts say is a solid sign things are moving forward. Some analysts think there's now a 90% chance these ETFs get the go-ahead by summer 2025.

Some of these ETFs might even let investors earn rewards through staking, which means they could make passive income while holding their investment. If the ETFs launch, they could bring in a wave of money from both big firms and everyday investors. That extra demand could make SOL more scarce. When circulating supply tightens like that, prices often rise. This gives rise to the prediction that Solana price predictions forecasting a SOL run to $500 may very well come to pass.

While Solana continues to gain momentum across select segments of the blockchain ecosystem, a complete overtaking of Ethereum's market dominance by 2025 remains improbable. Ethereum's entrenched infrastructure, developer depth, and widespread institutional backing provide it with a durable moat. That said, Solana's edge in transaction speed and cost-efficiency makes it a compelling alternative for real-time applications, consumer-facing protocols, and tokenized asset platforms. In the evolving landscape, both chains are likely to coexist—each excelling within its own strategic vertical.

For Solana to flip Ethereum, Solana will need to surge from its current price of $140 to $550 representing a 3.91x return if one were to buy SOL today. Where are those tens of billions in capital needed to pump Solana coming from? While it's definitely within the frame in the next 2-3 years, Solana is still firmly in an accumulation phase.

Bitcoin and the broader crypto market displayed remarkable resilience Monday as oil prices fell near 6% after touching a five-month high following U.S. airstrikes against Iran over the weekend and the fears of Iran closing the Strait of Ormuz.

The S&P 500 rose to 6,006 points today, gaining 0.52% from the previous session, hovering just over the psychologically important 6,000 level first breached earlier this month. The Federal Reserve held rates steady for the fourth meeting in a row at 4.25%-4.5%, maintaining its wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty about tariff impacts and Middle East tensions.

Gold sits near $3,388 per oz as investors hedge their bets while oil's sizable dip today removes one inflation concern from the Fed's radar and shows markets don't really see a global escalation at least in the short term.

But this is crypto, and while institutions might tread carefully deciding where to invest, retail traders pile into high-risk, high-reward meme coins that seem immune to macroeconomic factors.

Bitcoin has gained 2.35% in the past 24 hours to trade at $102,044, bouncing sharply from the weekend's panic episode that took the prices to lows near $99,000. The move represents a critical test of the psychologically important $100,000 level that has captivated market participants, strengthening its position as a solid support stop.

The Relative Strength Index at 58 indicates mild bullish momentum without approaching overbought territory (above 70). This "goldilocks" reading suggests Bitcoin has room to run higher without triggering immediate profit-taking. The RSI measures whether an asset is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30). Think of it as the market's temperature gauge. When RSI drops below 30, it often signals that sellers have exhausted themselves, setting up potential rebounds.

Bitcoin currently trades above its 50-week EMA (approximately $86,000 based on the chart) but faces resistance from multiple timeframe convergences. The expanding gap between the average price of Bitcoin over the last 500 weeks and 200-week EMA typically indicates sustained buying pressure, which traders typically interpret as bullish for medium-term holders.

Key Levels for Bitcoin are quite close because the coin has been trading sideways for a while:

Ethereum's weekly chart tells a more constructive story, with the second-largest cryptocurrency trading at $2,285 after a major price jump in April. The technical setup suggests accumulation beneath resistance.

The RSI at 47 sits in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This middling reading often precedes directional moves, as it shows the market has digested recent gains without excessive selling pressure. Traders view sub-50 RSI during uptrends as potential buying opportunities.

More notably, the ADX at 22 remains below the trend confirmation level of 25, suggesting Ethereum is consolidating rather than trending. This low ADX reading after a strong move typically indicates accumulation before the next leg higher, particularly when price holds above key moving averages.

Both the 50-day EMA ($2,480) and 200-day EMA ($2,093) frame the current price action. Current price action is trading around $2,245, far below the 20/50 EMA cluster near $2,480–$2,525. The fact that ETH bounced precisely off the 200-day EMA shows this long-term moving average acted as a magnet for buyers. It's worth noting that institutional algorithms often target these levels.

Key Levels:

The 24-hour chart for the meme coin SPX6900 exploded with a double digit gain to $1.35 before correcting to its current $1.35. That's enough for a 14.5% spike since yesterday's dip, showcasing the raw power of meme coin momentum when conditions align.

The RSI at 44 might seem bearish at first glance, but context is key. After a violent selloff, this recovery from oversold conditions (below 30) represents a momentum shift. In other words, yes, people are selling a lot, but not as much as a few days before, which means there are less sellers in play and a recovery could be starting.

However, the ADX at 36 signals a strong trending environment. Readings above 25 confirm trend strength, while above 35 indicates powerful directional movement. This is typical of volatile meme coins that trend hard in both directions. The bearish trend is still in play, but the lower ADX in comparison to previous days may signal exhaustion from bears.

Price action shows that bears were able to put prices below the EMA50 (the average of the last 50 days) but the momentum only lasted a few days and the price is recovering. The successful defense of sub-$1.00 levels prevented a deeper correction and attracted fresh buying interest, and rejected the scenario of a potential death cross in the near future. So, you can breathe for now—whatever that means for meme coin traders.

Key Levels:

Despite its correction, Fartcoin is showing remarkable strength with a 13% surge from yesterday's low to $1.10, driven by a combination of technical factors and on-chain dynamics that suggest more upside ahead.

The RSI at 38 shows a sharp recovery from oversold conditions. This is still bear territory, but shows momentum improving from extreme lows without yet reaching neutral (50). This could be a sort of a "sweet spot" where risk/reward favors longs—the selling has exhausted while buying interest returns. For even more copium, the coin also hasn't dropped below the average price of the last 200 days.

The ADX at 19 sits below the 25 trend threshold. This low reading after a sharp decline often marks accumulation zones where smart money positions before the next trending move. Combined with the price bounce, it suggests a trend reversal could be developing but is not yet confirmed.

The successful bounce from $0.90 support demonstrates buying interest at key technical levels known as “Fibonacci levels,” These are basically natural price zones that form between the lowest and highest point of a price movement. So, in other words, bears are struggling to take prices below that zone.

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin prices dropped below $100,000 this weekend, briefly trading below that crucial level as global markets responded to the latest developments in the conflict between Iran and Israel.

The world's most valuable digital currency by total market value approached $98,400 on Sunday, June 22, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. As recently as Friday, June 20, the cryptocurrency had been trading above $105,000.

Jacob Joseph, Senior Research Analyst at CoinDesk Data, commented on this decline, stating via email that “This movement has coincided with escalating geopolitical tensions involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran.”

“Investor sentiment appears to have become more cautious amid uncertainty over potential U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, which has likely contributed to the broader retreat seen in risk assets,” he continued.

Marc P. Bernegger, cofounder of crypto fund of funds AltAlpha Digital, offered a similar take, indicating that “Escalating geopolitical issues, particularly in the Middle East, were cited as a trigger for market uncertainty.”

“Tensions between Israel and Iran may have prompted capital flight from risk assets like Bitcoin, pushing prices below the $100,000 psychological support level,” he clarified through emailed commentary.

James Maxfield, head of trading for Gemini EU, also chimed in, emphasizing the losses bitcoin (and ether) suffered over the weekend.

“This followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which triggered a sharp selloff across crypto markets,” he said through email.

“The downturn came after President Trump confirmed the strikes and warned that further military action was possible, fueling fears of broader conflict.”

Some analysts have voiced concerns about how the ongoing conflict in the Middle East could affect global energy markets.

Dom Kwok, cofounder and COO of educational platform EasyA, spoke to this matter, specifying via email that “Fears around Iran potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil flows, have sparked concern.”

Last year, 20 million bpd moved through this straight on average, which amounted to approximately 20% of petroleum liquids consumed by the global market, according to an analysis conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Should this straight close, industry participants will have some very limited options for moving oil out of this area.

As a result of these factors, the EIA has described the Strait of Hormuz as “one of the world's most important oil chokepoints.”

“If disrupted, oil prices could spike, driving inflation higher,” Kwok noted. “Historically, inflationary pressure prompts investors to exit perceived high-risk assets and shift towards cash and gold."

The analyst shed further light on the subject, offering greater detail on the market's response to the latest geopolitical developments.

“Importantly, this isn't a crypto-specific reaction. It's a classic flight-to-safety move,” he stated.

“In times of conflict, forecasting future risk becomes nearly impossible, so capital flows to traditionally safer assets. While many believe Bitcoin should serve as a hedge, institutions still classify it as a high-risk asset.”

“Fortunately, these shocks are often short-lived,” he added. “Temporary supply disruptions rarely result in lasting inflation unless prolonged.”

“Past events, like COVID's initial crash, show that such dips can offer compelling long-term buying opportunities. The fact BTC has bounced back above $100,000 shows this.”

Bitcoin BTC$103,462.15 is quickly responding to developments in the Middle East.

After briefly sinking to $99,500, bitcoin has bounced back 2.9% in the last hour and is now trading at $102,400. The digital asset is still up 2.5% in the last 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 (an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins) has risen 2.1% in the same period of time.

Bitcoin's drop occurred as Iran retaliated against U.S. President Donald Trump's  administration's weekend bombardment of three of its nuclear sites. The Middle Eastern nation carried out missile strikes against American bases in multiple Gulf countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The attack on Qatar resulted in no casualties or injuries, according to a Qatari official.

Investors appeared to be unfazed by the military action. Gold, a traditional haven assets, barely inched higher at around $3,380, while crude oil prices plummeted 4% during the day.

"Crude getting crushed. Good sign," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, noted in an X post.

"Generally when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tends to be heavy short-term dips which later rebound depending on the severity as well as how things are communicated," said Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen. "So far I'd say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here."

"Smart money still seems to be going a bit more risk off," he said, adding that exchanges saw some notable outflows, suggesting opportunistic investors bought the dip in prices.

The company plans to launch a digital asset platform that includes a new stablecoin (FIUSD) that will be added to Fiserv's banking and payments infrastructure by the year's end, according to a Monday (June 23) press release. The platform will help the firm's regional and community bank clients embrace stablecoins' entry into the traditional finance space.

“FIUSD presents Fiserv customers with access to a new, more efficient and interoperable digital asset service for their banking and payment flows,” the release said.

Offering the coin across Fiserv's network, which includes relationships with roughly 10,000 financial institutions and 6 million merchant locations worldwide, will “provide instant scale for FIUSD while creating a digital asset network that clients can use to build new products and services,” per the release.

Fiserv intends to use stablecoin infrastructure from Paxos and Circle with the goal of making it interoperable with several stablecoins, and it will be available to Fiserv clients through the Solana blockchain, according to the release.

“In addition, the company is exploring the use of deposit tokens to maintain the benefits of stablecoins in a more capital-friendly structure for banks,” talking with other possible partners to find more use cases for stablecoins and tokenized deposits, per the release.

Fiserv Chief Operating Officer Takis Georgakopoulos said in the release that the new effort will help “democratize access” in the stablecoin market.

“Together with our other cloud-native banking and merchant platforms, we believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem,” Georgakopoulos said in the release.

The announcement is the latest example of the growing embrace of stablecoins, with retailers such as Walmart and Amazon looking to launch coins of their own.

“The rationale is straightforward,” PYMNTS noted in a report last week on the Walmart/Amazon rivalry. “By creating blockchain-based currencies that are pegged to fiat money, these retailers could sidestep traditional payment processors, reduce transaction fees and accelerate settlement times.”

In addition, a group of the country's largest banks — J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — are reportedly exploring the launch of a jointly operated stablecoin.

“The timing of this venture is no coincidence,” PYMNTS wrote in May. “For years, stablecoins … have promised to blend the best of both worlds: the efficiency of blockchain transactions and the stability of fiat currency.”

 According to Bloomberg, former executives at Coral Capital Holdings want to create a BNB treasury company. 

Crypto hedge fund executives are reportedly aiming to raise $100 million to invest in Binance's BNB token, in a move seen as mirroring Michael Saylor's Bitcoin treasury strategy.

The effort is being led by Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger and Johnathan Pasch, who previously served as executives to Coral Capital Holdings, Bloomberg reported Monday. Coral Capital was a venture capital firm acquired by DNA Fund in 2024. 

According to Bloomberg, the executives plan to complete the fundraising this month and begin accumulating BNB (BNB) through a newly formed entity called Build & Build Corporation, which seeks to become a Nasdaq-listed company. 

BNB is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by total value, with a market capitalization of $87.8 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. As the token of the Binance ecosystem, BNB functions as a utility token and the native asset of the BNB Beacon Chain.

In May, asset manager Standard Chartered forecast that BNB could more than double in price this year due to increased network activity.

Bloomberg reported that the soon-to-be-launched Build & Build Corporation is emulating MicroStrategy's Bitcoin (BTC) allocation strategy, which has enabled the Michael Saylor-led firm to accumulate over 592,000 BTC in the past five years. This includes a fresh $26 million BTC purchase last week despite geopolitical tensions. 

Several publicly traded companies have adopted similar approaches, adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets and reinforcing the digital asset's growing value proposition.

Japan's top Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet announced on Monday the additional acquisition of 1,111 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 11,111 BTC.

In April, another Bitcoin acquisition vehicle, 21 Capital, emerged from stealth with backing from major players including Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex.

As Cointelegraph reported, Tether and Bitfinex recently moved $3.9 billion in BTC to the newly created firm.

Former Chrous One CIO Xavier Meegan launched Frachtis, a $20 million crypto-native pre-seed fund.

The fund is backed by investors including Theta Capital, RockawayX, Chorus One, and Cyber Fund.

Meegan led over 40 investments during his tenure at Chorus One. Now at Frachtis, his focus is on supporting technical crypto-native founders and supporting early-stage decentralized AI, infrastructure, middleware, and consumer applications.

“Frachtis was created to support technical founders who are deeply committed to building exceptional and innovative crypto products,” Meegan said.

Frachtis is structured as a solo general partner fund, supported by an advisory and investment committee. Brian Crain (Founder and CEO, Chorus One), Felix Lutsch (Head of Ecosystem, Symbiotic), Erwin Dassen (Head of Generative AI, Chorus One), and Mel Tsiaprazis (former COO, Bitstamp) are all on the committee.

Meegan believes the crypto market is entering a consumer applications era, where the next wave of winners will come from projects that build real-world applications on existing blockchain infrastructure.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

“Crypto-native products that solve real problems for users will become some of the most capital-efficient businesses in the world,” he said.

Frachtis has already invested in eight early-stage projects, including DeFi middleware project Turtle Club and decentralized AI infrastructure protocols Hyve and Bless. 

The fund's strategy focuses on crypto-native teams that leverage decentralized architecture from inception.

The fund's launch reflects growing investor interest in decentralized infrastructure, AI, and consumer-facing crypto applications, as venture capital continues to target the next stage of blockchain adoption.

Xavier Meegan brings both academic and practical expertise to the fund, having authored research papers on DeFi risk and contributed to blockchain research initiatives with Wharton and the World Economic Forum.

 Trezor warned of ongoing phishing attempts exploiting its support contact form. 

Hardware wallet producer Trezor warned users about an ongoing phishing campaign that mimics the company's official customer support replies.

In a Monday X post, Trezor warned that the firm is aware “attackers abused our contact form to send scam emails appearing as legitimate Trezor support replies.” The company reminded its customers not to share wallet backups, noting that they should always be kept “private and offline.”

Trezor said it “will never ask for your wallet backup,” confirming that the emails may appear as legitimate but are not.

Trezor noted that the issue has now been contained. Trezor clarified that no email breach had occurred; attackers submitted requests to the firm's support system on behalf of affected users, which triggered automated replies.

Those requests resulted in an auto-reply coming from the Trezor support system. The firm claimed that its “contact form remains safe and secure.”

Trezor did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment.

Phishing attacks are prevalent in the cryptocurrency industry, with spearphishing attacks targeting high-net-worth individuals often resulting in substantial losses. Mehdi Farooq, an investment partner at crypto venture capital firm Hypersphere, recently revealed that he lost a significant portion of his life savings in such a targeted phishing attack.

In late May, a single victim was scammed two times within three hours, losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins. Hacks to expose one's phishing bait to a large number of potential victims are also not uncommon.

A few days ago, the crypto price tracking service CoinMarketCap removed a malicious pop-up notification from its website, prompting users to verify their cryptocurrency wallets. A similar attack was also conducted on Cointelegraph in a now-resolved incident.

On Saturday, Cointelegraph experienced a brief compromise of its banner publishing system. The breach resulted in a malicious advertisement promoting a fake token airdrop. The unauthorized code was removed, and additional security measures have since been implemented to prevent similar incidents.

Despite heightened geopolitical tension risks, crypto proves its mettle with steady inflows and strong ETF performance.

Digital asset investment products recorded their tenth straight week of inflows, bringing in $1.24 billion last week, according to data from CoinShares.

This continued streak has pushed year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $15.1 billion, a new record for this year.

The inflows come at a time of heightened geopolitical tension, particularly following Israel's military action against Iran. The move sparked fears of wider conflict, leading to a sharp selloff across financial markets, including crypto.

Despite the volatility, institutional interest in digital assets remained firm.

CoinShares' Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that inflows were strongest early in the week but later slowed. He noted:

“The surge in activity earlier in the week tapered off in the latter half, likely due to the US Juneteenth holiday and emerging reports of US involvement in the Iran conflict.”

Bitcoin remained the primary driver of capital, pulling in $1.1 billion over the past week. This marks its second week of positive inflows, even as prices experienced a correction.

CoinShares highlighted that many investors took advantage of the dip to increase their positions, underscoring Bitcoin's growing appeal as a macroeconomic hedge.

Notably, US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) played a central role in this flow, attracting $1.02 billion in net inflows. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out with $1.23 billion in weekly inflows, bringing the total assets under its management to more than $74 billion.

Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products saw minor outflows of $1.4 million, suggesting a drop in bearish sentiment.

Ethereum continued its strong performance, extending its inflow streak to nine consecutive weeks.

CoinShares reported that the digital asset saw $124 million in new inflows last week, pushing its total to $2.2 billion since mid-April.

Like Bitcoin, spot Ethereum ETFs also played a significant role in the inflow streak, with the nine products logging inflows on 25 of the past 30 trading days, totaling nearly $1.5 billion.

Meanwhile, market observers have linked ETH's inflow rise to several key factors, including the recent Pectra upgrade and increasing institutional interest in the crypto.

Other altcoins also showed resilience by attracting modest inflows last week.

Solana saw $2.78 million in new capital, while XRP brought in $2.69 million, reflecting continued but cautious appetite for alternative Layer 1s.

Anthony Pompliano is taking his bitcoin-native financial platform ProCap BTC public through a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. I (CCCM), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cohen & Company.

The transaction, announced Monday, positions the new entity, ProCap Financial, Inc., as one of the largest bitcoin treasuries ever to hit public markets.

In what's being called the largest initial fundraise for a public bitcoin BTC$102,431.68 treasury company to date, ProCap raised $550 million in preferred equity and secured $225 million in convertible notes, giving future shareholders immediate exposure to bitcoin through a structure designed to acquire BTC ahead of the deal's close.

Led by Pompliano, a well-known investor and vocal bitcoin advocate, ProCap aims to operate at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. 

The company plans to generate profit not just by holding BTC but by actively deploying its bitcoin balance sheet across yield-generating strategies that mitigate risk and capitalize on crypto-financial infrastructure.

"The legacy financial system is being disrupted by bitcoin," Pompliano said in a statement. "ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors."

The merger values the combined entity at up to $1 billion, depending on the final bitcoin purchase price at closing. ProCap's BTC assets will be custodied until the transaction completes, giving investors near-instant BTC exposure without waiting for the company to go public.

The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2025, pending SEC review and shareholder approval.

The Financial Times first reported that Pompliano was set to become the CEO of ProCap BTC, and that the company was planning to raise $750 million to acquire bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency market is gearing up for recovery following a geopolitical tension-triggered sell-off over the weekend after the United States (US) struck Iran's nuclear sites in support of Israel's campaign. Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $100,000, reaching a low of around $98,200, before reversing the trend and rising above $101,000 on Monday. 

Major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are paring losses while offering signs of recovery, underpinned by renewed sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market.

US President Donald Trump ordered strikes on three main Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday, unleashing mayhem in global markets, which saw Bitcoin price drop below the $100,000 mark, its lowest point since May 8.

The strikes dimmed hopes for a potential ceasefire, as reported by Reuters. "It's irrelevant to ask Iran to return to diplomacy," Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Istanbul on Sunday. 

Following the attacks, President Trump urged Iran to return to the negotiating table but warned against retaliatory attacks on US assets and personnel in the Middle East region.

Volatility in the market is likely to remain elevated, with traders treading cautiously. Liquidations exploded above the $1 billion mark on Sunday, offering a glimpse of the damage that could happen if the conflict between Iran and Israel keeps escalating.

Inflows into digital asset financial products, including spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), extended the bullish streak, reaching $1.24 billion last week. CoinShares reported that year-to-date inflows have hit a record $15.1 billion.

Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated the inflows with $1.1 billion and $124 million, signaling strong sentiment despite escalating geopolitical tensions. Ethereum posted its ninth consecutive week of inflows, bringing the total inflow for this period to slightly above $2.2 billion.

"This marks the longest run of inflows since mid-2021, reflecting continued robust investor sentiment toward the asset," the CoinShares weekly report states.

Bitcoin's price hovers at around $101,457 at the time of writing as traders focus on the possibility of the uptrend extending further. According to QCP Capital's Monday market update, "BTC's reclaim of $100k this morning suggests that the weekend drawdown was macro-driven, with investors turning to crypto as a hedge while awaiting equity futures to open."

Technically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that momentum is gradually shifting bullish as it reverses the trend, pointing toward the 50 midline. Recovery beyond this neutral level could boost the uptrend, paving the way for further gains this week.

Key monitoring levels, especially for intraday traders, include the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $99,212, which is set to serve as support, and the 50-day EMA at $102,954, a former support level that has been flipped into resistance. A break above the 50-EMA hurdle would expand the bullish scope above $105,000, a psychological round-number resistance.

Ethereum's price shows subtle signs of a minor recovery on Monday, steadying during the European session, buoyed by support at $2,111 and buy-the-dip initiatives. Although the RSI is near the oversold region, a reversal is underway at 35. The 100-day EMA at $2,366, the 50-day EMA at $2,417 and the 200-day EMA at $2,469 mark key resistance levels. Closing above these levels will likely boost ETH's bullish structure.

On the contrary, the Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator, which tracks the amount of money entering Ethereum, suggests a strong bearish grip as it slides toward the oversold area. In other words, traders may lack the conviction to keep the recovery steady in upcoming sessions.

Meanwhile, the leading cross-border money transfer token, XRP, shows signs of weakness despite reclaiming ground slightly above support at $2.00. If downside risks intensify, traders may want to prepare for the possibility of losses extending to lows last seen in April, such as $1.80 and $1.61.

XRP/USDT daily chart

The path of least resistance appears firmly downward, accentuated by the RSI pointing downwards and approaching oversold territory. On the upside, the 200-day EMA at $2.09, which served as support last week, could cap gains, favoring consolidation above the support level of $2.00.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Capitol Technology University is stepping deeper into the crypto space through a new partnership with the Maryland Blockchain Association (MDBA). Announced on March 14, the collaboration aims to grow awareness and access to blockchain and cryptocurrency education. It also opens up new career paths for students interested in emerging tech.Based in Laurel, Capitol Tech has built a reputation for preparing students in cybersecurity, engineering, data science, and other tech-focused fields. The Maryland Blockchain Association, meanwhile, has become a key voice in shaping local blockchain policy and educating the public. Together, the two organizations are combining forces to expand hands-on learning, host blockchain-related events, and explore creating a full blockchain academy in the state.



The goal is clear: give students more chances to learn real skills tied to crypto and Web3, and help Maryland stay competitive as tech moves fast. While many schools are still figuring out how to bring blockchain into the classroom, Capitol Tech is going all-in through this move.

The partnership also opens the door to joint events, including hackathons and workshops that connect students directly with professionals in the space. MDBA already works with state leaders and major companies, and this alliance means students will now have better access to real-world knowledge and potential mentors.

While blockchain education is still catching up to the technology itself, it's gaining ground, especially as demand grows not just for coders, but for people who understand how crypto works in finance, policy, and security. And for students trying to get ahead in this area, learning now is a good move.



Crypto learning is not just about college classrooms either. It is moving into workshops and short-term programs, many of which are tied to real projects or startup ideas. Some people even highlight the hottest upcoming crypto presales, where new tokens are introduced before they hit major exchanges. Understanding these early-stage launches, how they work, and what makes one more promising than another is becoming a valuable skill on its own. For young investors or developers, this is one way to connect theory to practice.

For Maryland, this partnership could also help attract more tech-focused talent to the state. With the rise of remote work and decentralized finance, many students want skills that let them work from anywhere. In 2022, the demand for skilled professionals in the blockchain field rose by 552%, and that was three years ago, when crypto wasn't as popular as today. 

MDBA's mission has always been to push blockchain innovation forward across the DMV area: D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. It does that by working with lawmakers, running public education efforts, and making sure the technology is understood, not just hyped. Adding a university partner like Capitol Tech gives it another tool to build a stronger foundation in the state.



This move also comes as other universities nationwide and worldwide begin experimenting with blockchain programs. A few large universities now offer full degrees in blockchain, while others include it as part of business or tech majors. Capitol Tech's approach focuses on practical experience and partnerships, which could give students a clearer edge when it's time to enter the job market.

There's also a growing sense that crypto is shifting from being a niche interest to something more widely accepted. With that comes the need for people who understand it well enough to guide smart decisions, whether it's in development, regulation, or finance. Training students now, while the space is still growing, makes them more prepared for what's ahead.

For Capitol Tech students, this partnership is more than just a logo swap or guest lecture series. It's a chance to get involved with the tech as it changes and to explore new ways of building a future in crypto, blockchain, and beyond. Maryland might not be the first state you think of when it comes to crypto innovation, but moves like this are putting it on the map.

Given the concerns over tariffs and a potential global trade war, a growing number of investors have suggested that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) might eventually replace the U.S. dollar and become the global reserve currency. Is this likely to happen? The answer, of course, is no.

First of all, it's debatable whether Bitcoin has the right characteristics to be a true reserve currency. According to the Federal Reserve, money must serve three critical functions. It must be a store of value. It must be a medium of exchange. And it must be a unit of account. Bitcoin does not yet meet all three of these essential criteria.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

While Bitcoin is a store of value, it is not yet a popular medium of exchange for making everyday transactions. When was the last time that you used Bitcoin to pay for anything?

Moreover, Bitcoin is not yet used as a unit of account. In other words, companies don't price their goods or services in Bitcoin. When you walk into a supermarket, for example, the goods on the shelves are priced in dollars, not Bitcoin. When you pump gas at the gas station, you see a price displayed in dollars, not Bitcoin.

Even though Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to be a digital currency, it really trades more like a global commodity these days. People buy and hold Bitcoin, they don't spend it. For that reason, it has become fashionable to refer to Bitcoin as digital gold. Gold, too, started off as a currency, with people making gold coins to trade for things of value.

It is, however, possible to imagine a future scenario in which Bitcoin finally becomes a true medium of exchange or a unit of account. However, it is highly unlikely, to say the least. It would require a tectonic readjustment of the global financial system, such as occurred in the 1920s (when the dollar replaced the pound as the global reserve currency), or in the 1970s, when the U.S. officially moved off the gold standard.

In 2025, discussion is building about Bitcoin replacing the dollar. The prospect of a global trade war, combined with an out-of-control U.S. debt load of $37 trillion, has some investors thinking that nations around the world will eventually turn their back on the U.S. dollar. A natural replacement might be Bitcoin, given its global appeal and its non-sovereign status.

However, even if foreign investors decide to flee the U.S. dollar and all dollar-denominated assets, it would likely require an epic agreement among all the major trading nations of the world to replace the dollar with Bitcoin. A good example is the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. This is when the major trading nations of the world met in the final days of WWII to discuss a reordering of the international financial system led by the U.S.

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the tariff situation gets out of hand, there is a major trade war, and top trading nations decide to meet in some far-flung foreign capital to discuss moving away from a dollar-based international financial system.

Even then, it's unlikely that they would decide on Bitcoin as the new global reserve currency. That's due to one key factor: People, companies, and governments are hoarding their Bitcoin. They are pledging never to sell their Bitcoin, and that is leading to a situation where it is increasingly difficult to find new Bitcoin for sale. Even cryptocurrency exchanges are now complaining that they are running out of Bitcoin.

A new report from digital asset bank Sygnum highlights the problems caused by Bitcoin hoarding. The report focuses on Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. It now holds close to 3% of all Bitcoin.

The more Bitcoin that Strategy hoards for its corporate treasury, the more unlikely it is that Bitcoin can ever become the global reserve currency. According to Sygnum, once Strategy holds 5% of all Bitcoin worldwide, it will become impossible for Bitcoin to ever become a global reserve currency.

Similarly, a new report from Gemini and Glassnode highlights that 30% of all Bitcoin in the world is now held by just 216 centralized entities. These include corporations, cryptocurrency exchanges, Wall Street banks, ETF investment firms, asset management firms, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. So, a digital currency that was originally designed to be as decentralized as possible, embraced by billions of people around the world, is becoming highly centralized at a rapid pace.

The good news, if you're a Bitcoin investor, is that it probably does not matter if Bitcoin ever becomes the global reserve currency. People will continue to buy Bitcoin, just as people continue to buy gold.

Demand for Bitcoin continues to soar. It's not just crypto enthusiasts who have embraced Bitcoin. It's now corporations, Wall Street banks, and even sovereign governments. It's hard not to be bullish on Bitcoin, even if the original vision of early crypto pioneers to replace the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin never materializes.

In today's rapidly developing digital economy, “mining” is no longer the exclusive domain of geeks and technical players. With the popularization of blockchain technology and the breakthrough of cloud computing capabilities, cloud mining is quietly changing the way global users participate in the cryptocurrency market with the advantages of “no equipment required, remote operation, and automatic income”. 

Today, from individual investors to small and medium-sized enterprises, more and more users are easily participating in the production and management of mainstream digital assets such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin through blockchain cloud mining, a low-threshold and high-security path. This digital gold rush is being redefined by the two key words “simple” and “safe”.

The so-called cloud mining refers to renting computing power resources from remote data centers, and the platform completes the mining process on behalf of users, and users receive daily output currency dividends in the form of contracts.

In today's rapidly developing digital economy, “mining” is no longer the exclusive domain of geeks and technical players. With the popularization of blockchain technology and the breakthrough of cloud computing capabilities, cloud mining is quietly changing the way global users participate in the cryptocurrency market with the advantages of “no equipment required, remote operation, and automatic income”. 

Today, from individual investors to small and medium-sized enterprises, more and more users are easily participating in the production and management of mainstream digital assets such as Bitcoin and Dogecoin through blockchain cloud mining, a low-threshold and high-security path. This digital gold rush is being redefined by the two key words “simple” and “safe”.

The so-called cloud mining refers to renting computing power resources from remote data centers, and the platform completes the mining process on behalf of users, and users receive daily output currency dividends in the form of contracts. You don't need to buy expensive mining machines or bear high electricity bills. Just choose a suitable computing power package on the platform to automatically start mining and enjoy daily income.Blockchain Cloud Mining Platform Core AdvantagesSign up and get a bonus

Bitcoin treasury adoption by public companies has become the new altcoin season for cryptocurrency speculators, Adam Back said on Monday.

Bitcoin BTCUSD treasury season “is the new ALT SZN for speculators,” said Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “Time to dump ALTs into BTC or BTC treasuries,” he added.

Bitcoin treasury firms are buying BTC “on repeat to increase Bitcoin per share,” tapping into different funding methods such as convertible note offerings to accumulate more of the world's first cryptocurrency, making them attractive for investors, Back explained.

His comments come amid a wave of growing corporate Bitcoin adoption, which saw the number of public companies holding Bitcoin double since June 5.

At least 240 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 firms just weeks ago, accounting for about 3.96% of the total BTC supply, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Back previously predicted that institutional and government adoption would make Bitcoin a $200 trillion market opportunity as Bitcoin treasury firms front-run hyperbitcoinization — a theoretical future where Bitcoin becomes the world's largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics.

However, Bitcoin treasury firms also present growing concerns for shareholders. For instance, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet's Bitcoin premium soared to $596,154 on May 27, meaning stockholders are paying more than fivefold for Bitcoin exposure via Metaplanet shares.

Bitcoin investments may offset altcoin losses

Still, Back argued that Bitcoin-focused firms offer a possible path to recover losses from altcoins. 

“I was encouraging them to find a way out of alts,” said Back in an X response on Monday. “Maybe they can make back their losses by switching to BTC by way of treasury companies,” he added.

Corporate adoption continues to accelerate. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a “long-term” Bitcoin treasury reserve.

Three days earlier, Paris-based cryptocurrency company The Blockchain Group announced plans to raise $340 million for a corporate Bitcoin treasury, signaling growing institutional interest in Europe.

Despite their lack of momentum, altcoins are also benefiting from institutional adoption. Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment manufacturer, announced plans to raise $500 million to establish a Fetch.ai (FET) token treasury, Cointelegraph reported on June 11.

Powerful tools

The NFT market experienced a slight downturn last week, with total sales dipping by 4.3% to $90,678,150. Despite this decline, the market remains dynamic, showcasing notable shifts in blockchain-specific performance and buyer-seller activity. Ethereum-based NFTs continued to dominate the market but saw an 8.26% drop in sales, while Solana and Bitcoin-based NFTs demonstrated resilience and growth.

Solana-Based NFTs: Sales increased by 6.39%, reaching $19.4 million, highlighting the platform's growing appeal among collectors and investors.

Bitcoin-Based NFTs: Sales rose by 12.39%, totaling $13.7 million, showcasing the increasing traction of Bitcoin-based digital assets.

These trends underscore the evolving landscape of the NFT ecosystem, where alternative blockchains are carving out significant market share.

Several NFT collections stood out this week, reflecting diverse buyer preferences and blockchain-specific strengths:

Cryptopunks (Ethereum): Despite a 29.01% decline in sales, Cryptopunks remained the top-performing collection, generating $5.43 million in sales.

Monkey NFTs (Solana): Solana's Monkey NFTs surged by 52.16%, reaching $3.36 million in sales, underscoring the platform's growing influence.

Guild of Guardians (Immutable X): This gaming-focused collection saw a 6.62% increase in sales, totaling $3.31 million.

These collections highlight the varied interests of NFT buyers, ranging from iconic Ethereum-based collectibles to emerging gaming NFTs on Immutable X.

Ethereum continues to lead the NFT market, commanding a 78% share of total sales. Its dominance is driven by its established infrastructure, widespread adoption, and high-profile collections like Cryptopunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. However, alternative blockchains are gaining ground:

Ronin: Accounts for 19% of the market.

Flow and Immutable X: Each hold 6% of the market.

The competition among blockchains is intensifying as platforms like Solana and Bitcoin demonstrate growth in sales and user activity. This diversification is reshaping the NFT landscape, offering buyers and creators more options for minting, trading, and collecting.

The NFT market has witnessed explosive growth over the past few years:

2021 Trading Volume: Surged to $17 billion, a staggering 21,000% increase from 2020's $82 million.

Wallet Adoption: Expanded significantly, with 2.5 million wallets holding or trading NFTs compared to just 89,000 in 2020.

Gaming NFTs and collectibles emerged as the largest categories in 2021, generating $5.2 billion and $8.4 billion in sales, respectively. This historical context underscores the rapid evolution of the NFT market and its potential for continued growth.

This week's priciest NFT sale was Bored Ape Yacht Club #7,398, which sold for $325,387. Other notable transactions included:

Arbitrum GUSDC Locked Deposit: Sold for $184,956.

Bitcoin-Based Ordinal Maxi Biz NFT: Sold for $82,819.

These high-value sales reflect the ongoing demand for rare and unique digital assets, even amid fluctuating market conditions.

Despite the overall dip in sales, buyer and seller activity in the NFT market increased significantly:

Buyer Interest: Rose by 31.48%.

Seller Activity: Climbed by 25.86%.

This uptick in participation suggests that the market remains vibrant, with new entrants and existing participants actively engaging in trading. The increase in activity could be attributed to the growing accessibility of NFTs across multiple blockchains, as well as the appeal of emerging collections and categories.

Accurately measuring NFT trading volume is crucial for understanding market trends. Platforms like Nonfungible.com employ methodologies that exclude bot transactions and wash trading, providing a more reliable estimate of genuine market activity. This approach often results in lower transaction volume estimates compared to other sources, such as Chainalysis.

By focusing on authentic transactions, these methodologies offer valuable insights into the true state of the NFT market, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

The NFT market's future remains promising, driven by innovation in blockchain technology, expanding use cases, and increasing mainstream adoption. While weekly transaction averages in 2022 were lower than in late 2021, this plateau may signal a period of consolidation and maturation.

Emerging trends, such as the rise of Bitcoin-based NFTs and the growth of gaming and collectible categories, suggest that the market is far from static. As new platforms and collections continue to gain traction, the NFT ecosystem is poised for further evolution and expansion.

The NFT market is a dynamic and rapidly changing space, with weekly sales trends offering valuable insights into its performance. While Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain, the growth of Solana and Bitcoin-based NFTs highlights the increasing diversity of the ecosystem. High-value transactions and rising buyer-seller activity further underscore the market's resilience and potential.

As the NFT landscape continues to evolve, staying informed about weekly trends, top-performing collections, and emerging platforms will be essential for navigating this exciting digital frontier.

Dogecoin staged a sharp recovery following a dramatic weekend selloff, during which the token plummeted to a low of $0.143 before rebounding above $0.153. The move came amid surging trading volume — over five times the daily average — confirming buyer interest at critical support levels and hinting at a potential momentum shift as broader markets remain turbulent.

DOGE posted a volatile 9.1% range over the 24-hour window, falling from $0.157 to $0.143 before rebounding to close near $0.153. Most dramatic selling occurred during hours 13–14, where volume spiked to over five times the average, establishing a firm floor at $0.145.

In the final hour of trading, Dogecoin surged from $0.152 to $0.153, with a notable breakout above $0.153432 occurring after 04:58. Volume surged again at 05:11 (10.7M), confirming buyer strength and pushing DOGE to a new local high.

Web3 Harbour, in collaboration with PwC Hong Kong, will launch five action groups in August on stablecoins, funds and other critical segments

In a call to action for greater investment to accelerate the development of blockchain infrastructure, industry group Web3 Harbour and accounting firm PwC Hong Kong released the “Hong Kong Web3 Blueprint” on Monday, capitalising on recent momentum in the city.

Highlighting the “transparency, security, and user empowerment” of decentralisation, the blueprint seeks to leverage what it calls “Web3 superpowers” through the development of “five key enablers”: talent, market infrastructure, standards, regulation, and funding and economic contribution. It calls on participants to focus on open finance, trade finance, capital markets, asset management and carbon markets.

The report was put together with input from Web3 Harbour members and other industry stakeholders. Web3 Harbour chairman Gary Liu, formerly CEO of the Post, said greater private-public collaboration was among its goals, but it was primarily a guide for where the private sector should focus its efforts.

“This is us laying out what the private sector is going to be focused on so that Web3 technologies and virtual or decentralised assets become truly part of the financial infrastructure here in Hong Kong,” Liu said.

Stablecoins keep their value steady by being pegged to a reference asset, typically backed one-to-one with fiat currency such as the US dollar.

For over 2,200 years, this shrine to the hero of The Odyssey was hidden in a Greek village.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com.

Turns out, Odysseus might've had groupies. 

On the Greek island of Ithaca, archaeologists recently uncovered new evidence that suggests ancient travelers once made real-life pilgrimages to the supposed home of Odysseus, Homer's famous wanderer from the epic poem, The Odyssey.  

According to Greek City Times, archaeologists found artifacts and inscriptions that point to the former existence of the Odysseion, a shrine or “hero cult site” devoted to Odysseus.

The idea of such a place was already known of by researchers, at least in theory, thanks to an inscription “from around 207 BC from Magnesia in Asia Minor that references a hero shrine and games (the Odysseia) held in his honor in Ithaca.” But thanks to this most recent project, which began in 2018, the scholars involved now feel confident that they've identified Odysseus's real hero-cult site.

The site's specific location in Ithaca is the village of Exogi. There, amidst a rock outcrop and a natural spring, sits the Agios Athanasios, referred to since the 19th century as the “School of Homer.” 

Archaeologists unearthed several artifacts during the recent excavation, including some dating as far back as the 13th or 14th century B.C., the period when Odysseus was said to have lived:

The more recent artifacts, at least by comparison to the Mycenaean vessel fragments, included coins, figurines, and pottery fragments from the Hellenistic and early Roman periods. The archaeologists also found tiles that “include the name Odysseus in Greek—ΟΔΥCCEOC and ΟΔΥC[CEI],” as well as a bronze bust of Homer's hero who famously ventured home across the “wine-dark sea.”

Beyond identifying the hero-cult site, the artifacts allowed scholars to conclude that, during the Mycenaean period, the settlement “was likely used to oversee port access, agricultural lands, and vital water resources in northwestern Ithaca,” and that it “appears to have been part of a network of 7–8 Mycenaean sites forming the core of the island's urban landscape during the time traditionally associated with Homer's Odyssey.”

While this particular discovery doesn't prove that a real Odysseus truly did brave cyclops and sirens to journey home to his patient Penelope back in Ithaca, it does prove that many devotees believed it to be true and made their own possibly perilous journeys to this same site.

And who knows? With a new, big-budget retelling of Homer's Odyssey on the horizon, perhaps a whole new cadre of devotees will make their way to Ithaca once more. And now, after centuries of wondering, they'll know exactly where to go.

AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are integral to fast excitatory synaptic transmission and play vital roles in synaptic plasticity, motor coordination, learning, and memory1. While extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2-5, the molecular architecture of native calcium permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. To elucidate the subunit composition, physiological architecture, and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, here we present the first visualization of these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, while auxiliary subunits, including TARPs, are located at the B′/D′ positions and CNIHs or TARPs at the A′/C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the Noelin 1-GluA1/A4 complex, wherein Noelin 1 (Noe 1) specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, Noe 1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer without affecting receptor gating properties. Noe 1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric-AMPAR assemblies that likely engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors within synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs.

This first-ever discovery could rewrite Earth's geologic history.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Mantle plumes are one of the most dynamic geologic processes on Earth. As their name suggests, these plumes move hot rock near the core-mantle boundary toward the surface, creating new landmasses (such as Hawai'i) or causing powerful geothermal activity (Yellowstone). Of course, moving all that magma beneath the Earth comes with a healthy dose of volcanism for those who live above these mantle superhighways—unless you live in Oman, that is. 

In a new paper published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, an international team of scientists—led by seismologist Simone Pilia of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia—claims to have found an amagmatic mantle plume, also known as a ‘ghost plume,' resting beneath eastern Oman. Speaking with New Scientist, Pilia said that he accidentally discovered the plume while analyzing seismic data from the region. 

Seismologists typically analyze the interior of Earth using earthquake data from around the world. When an earthquake occurs, it sends seismic waves through the planet, and the trajectory of those waves can give scientists insight into the interior of the globe. While analyzing some of these waves, Pilia noticed a cylindrical area beneath eastern Oman where they moved more slowly and the rock they moved through appeared to be less rigid. This means that temperatures were much higher in this region, indicating the presence of a mantle plume. But eastern Oman doesn't display the surface volcanism that's typical of such areas. 

Taking a closer look with independent measurements, Pilia confirmed that a mantle plume—nicknamed “Dani” after his son—likely existed roughly 660 kilometers below the surface. “The more we gathered evidence, the more we were convinced that it is a plume,” Pilia told New Scientist. 

Although there is no volcanic activity on the surface above this plume, there are other pieces of evidence that point to some sort of geologic anomaly in the region. For example, Oman continues to rise in elevation long after the impacts of tectonic compression—a process that squeezes the Earth's crust together. The plume's existence also fits nicely into models detailing the movement of the Indian tectonic plate during the late Eocene. 

If this “Dani plume” truly is a ghost plume, it would be the first one ever detected, and could possibly lead scientists to re-examine just how much heat is moving from the core-mantle boundary—especially if more ghost plumes exist around the world. Not only could that change Earth's geologic history, but mantle plumes provide many real-world benefits.

A single pellet of recycled plastic can contain over 80 different chemicals. A new study with researchers from University of Gothenburg and Leipzig shows that recycled polyethylene plastic can leach chemicals into water causing impacts in the hormone systems and lipid metabolism of zebrafish larvae.

The plastic pollution crisis has reached global levels, threatening both planetary and human health, and recycling is proposed as one of the solutions to the plastics pollution crisis. However, as plastics contain thousands of chemical additives and other substances that can be toxic, and these are almost never declared, hazardous chemicals can indiscriminately end up in recycled products.

Increasing gene expressions

In a new study, researchers bought plastic pellets recycled from polyethylene plastic from different parts of the world and let the pellets soak in water for 48 hours. After which zebrafish larvae were exposed to the water for five days. The experimental results show increases in gene expression relating to lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, and endocrine regulation in the larvae.

"These short leaching times and exposure times are yet another indicator of the risks that chemicals in plastics pose to living organisms. The impacts that we measured show that these exposures have the potential to change the physiology and health of the fish," says Azora König Kardgar, lead author and researcher in ecotoxicology at the University of Gothenburg.

"Never full knowledge" 

Previous research has shown similar effects to humans, including threats to reproductive health and obesity, from exposure to toxic chemicals in plastics. Some chemicals used as additives in plastics and substances that contaminate plastics are known to disturb hormones, with potential impacts on fertility, child development, links to certain cancers, and metabolic disorders including obesity and diabetes.

"This is the main obstacle with the idea of recycling plastic. We never have full knowledge of what chemicals will end up in an item made of recycled plastic. And there is also a significant risk of chemical mixing events occuring, which render the recycled plastic toxic," says Bethanie Carney Almroth, professor at the University of Gothenburg and principal investigator on the project.

Different chemicals

Apart from the study on the impact that recycled plastics have on zebra fish larvae, the researcher also conducted a chemical analysis of the chemicals leaching from the plastic pellets to the water. And they found a lot of different chemical compounds, but the mixture altered between different samples of pellets.

"We identified common plastics chemicals, including UV-stabilizers and plasticizers, as well as chemicals that are not used as plastics additives, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and biocides. These may have contaminated the plastics during their first use phase, prior to becoming waste and being recycled. This is further evidence of the complicated issue of plastics waste flows, and of toxic chemicals contaminating recycled plastics," says Eric Carmona, researcher at Department of Exposure Science, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig.

"Ban hazardous chemicals"

Representatives from the nations of the world are preparing to head to Geneva, Switzerland, in August, for what is planned to be the final negotiating meeting for a Global Plastics Treaty at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee under the United Nations Environmental Program. The authors of the work stress that negotiators and decision-makers must include provisions to ban or reduce hazardous chemicals in plastics, and to increase transparency and reporting along plastics value chains. Plastics cannot be recycled in a safe and sustainable manner if hazardous chemicals are not addressed.

"This work clearly demonstrates the need to address toxic chemicals in plastics materials and products, across their life cycle," says Professor Bethanie Carney Almroth. "We cannot safely produce and use recycled plastics if we cannot trace chemicals throughout production, use and waste phases."

Facts: Polyethylene (PE)

Polyethylene, abbreviated PE, is a type of plastic used in a lot of packaging materials like bottle caps, plastic bags, agricultural mulch films, insulation for wiring and cables, pipes, ropes, toys and household items. It is the most widely produced and used polymer. On plastic products made of polyethylene, the number in the recycling code is either 2 or 4.

As artificial intelligence reshapes workplaces worldwide, a new study provides early evidence suggesting AI exposure has not, thus far, caused widespread harm to workers' mental health or job satisfaction. In fact, the data reveals that AI may even be linked to modest improvements in worker physical health, particularly among employees with less than a college degree.

But the authors caution: It is way too soon to draw definitive conclusions.

The paper, "Artificial Intelligence and the Wellbeing of Workers," published June 23 in Nature: Scientific Reports, uses two decades of longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Using that rich data, the researchers -- Osea Giuntella of the University of Pittsburgh and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Luca Stella of the University of Milan and the Berlin School of Economics, and Johannes King of the German Ministry of Finance -- explored how workers in AI-exposed occupations have fared in contrast to workers in less-exposed roles.

"Public anxiety about AI is real, but the worst-case scenarios are not inevitable," said Professor Stella, who is also affiliated with independent European bodies the Center for Economic Studies (CESifo) and the Institute for Labor Economics (IZA). "So far, we find little evidence that AI adoption has undermined workers' well-being on average. If anything, physical health seems to have slightly improved, likely due to declining job physical intensity and overall job risk in some of the AI-exposed occupations."

Yet the study also highlights reasons for caution.

The analysis relies primarily on a task-based measure of AI exposure -- considered more objective -- but alternative estimates based on self-reported exposure reveal small negative effects on job and life satisfaction. In addition, the sample excludes younger workers and only covers the early phases of AI diffusion in Germany.

"We may simply be too early in the AI adoption curve to observe its full effects," Stella emphasized. "AI's impact could evolve dramatically as technologies advance, penetrate more sectors, and alter work at a deeper level."

Key findings from the study include:

Due to the data supply, the study focuses on Germany -- a country with strong labor protections and a gradual pace of AI adoption. The co-authors noted that outcomes may differ in more flexible labor markets or among younger cohorts entering increasingly AI-saturated workplaces.

"This research is an early snapshot, not the final word," said Pitt's Giuntella, who previously conducted significant research into the effect of robotics on households and labor, and on types of workers. "As AI adoption accelerates, continued monitoring of its broader impacts on work and health is essential. Technology alone doesn't determine outcomes -- institutions and policies will decide whether AI enhances or erodes the conditions of work."

The chemical reaction to produce hydrogen from water is several times more effective when using a combination of new materials in three layers, according to researchers at Linköping University in Sweden. Hydrogen produced from water is a promising renewable energy source - especially if the hydrogen is produced using sunlight.

The production of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the EU as of 2035. Electric motors are expected to become increasingly common in vehicles - but they are not suitable for all types of transport.

"Passenger cars can have a battery, but heavy trucks, ships or aircraft cannot use a battery to store the energy. For these means of transport, we need to find clean and renewable energy sources, and hydrogen is a good candidate," says Jianwu Sun, associate professor at Linköping University, who has led the study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

The LiU researchers are working on developing materials that can be used to produce hydrogen (H2) from water (H2O) by using the energy in sunlight.

The research team has previously shown that a material called cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) has beneficial properties for facilitating the reaction where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. The material can effectively capture the sunlight so that the energy therein can be used for hydrogen production through the photochemical water splitting reaction.

In their current study, the researchers have further developed a new combined material. The new material consists of three layers: a layer of cubic silicon carbide, a layer of cobalt oxide and a catalyst material that helps to split water.

"It's a very complicated structure, so our focus in this study has been to understand the function of each layer and how it helps improve the properties of the material. The new material has eight times better performance than pure cubic silicon carbide for splitting water into hydrogen," says Jianwu Sun.

When sunlight hits the material, electric charges are generated, which are then used to split water. A challenge in the development of materials for this application is to prevent the positive and negative charges from merging again and neutralising each other. In their study, the researchers show that by combining a layer of cubic silicon carbide with the other two layers, the material, known as Ni(OH)2/Co3O4/3C-SiC, becomes more able to separate the charges, thereby making the splitting of water more effective.

Today, there is a distinction between "grey" and "green" hydrogen. Almost all hydrogen present on the market is "grey" hydrogen produced from a fossil fuel called natural gas or fossil gas. The production of one tonne of "grey" hydrogen gas causes emission of up to ten tonnes of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and climate change. "Green" hydrogen is produced using renewable electricity as a source of energy.

The long-term goal of the LiU researchers is to be able to use only energy from the sun to drive the photochemical reaction to produce "green" hydrogen. Most materials under development today have an efficiency of between 1 and 3 per cent, but for commercialisation of this green hydrogen technology the target is 10 per cent efficiency. Being able to fully drive the reaction using solar energy would lower the cost of producing "green" hydrogen, compared to producing it using supplementary renewable electricity as is done with the technology used today. Jianwu Sun speculates that it may take around five to ten years for the research team to develop materials that reach the coveted 10 per cent limit.

The research has been funded with support from, among others, the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT), the Olle Engkvists Stiftelse, the ÅForsk Foundation, the Carl Tryggers Stiftelse and through the Swedish Government Strategic Research Area in Advanced Functional Materials (AFM) at Linköping University.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, leaving astronomers in awe of the unprecedented capabilities of the observatory's 3,200 megapixel digital camera — the largest in the world. The images were created from shots taken during a trial that started in April, when construction of the telescope was completed.

“Wow. You want to observe the grandeur of the Universe? This is the way to observe it!” says astronomer Robert Williams, former head of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.

Major telescope hosts world's largest digital camera: how it will transform astronomy

One of the images shows the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula, in a region of the Milky Way that is dense with ionized hydrogen and with young stars or those in the process of forming. The picture was created from 678 separate exposures taken by the observatory's Simonyi Survey Telescope in just over seven hours. Each image was monochromatic and taken with one of four filters, resulting in the rich colours of the final product.

The Rubin, which sits atop Cerro Pachón in the Andes Mountains in central Chile, is a US$810 million, US-led facility. The observatory has a very large field of view that will be able to cover the entire southern sky every 3–4 nights. Other telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, have superior sensitivity to tiny details and take in one small section of the sky at a time.

The latest images were put together mainly for aesthetic impact and to showcase how the observatory's digital camera can scan large swaths of sky with high sensitivity and in a short time. As such, they are quite different from the type of ‘data products' that astronomers around the world will use for research purposes, says Sandrine Thomas, deputy director for the observatory's construction, who is based in Tucson, Arizona. And yet, they are a reminder of what drives astronomers in the first place. “We go into astronomy because we like to look at the sky — and at the beauty of it,” she says.

Determining the similarities and differences between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) is an important goal in both computational cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, promising a deeper understanding of human cognition and safer, more reliable AI systems. Much previous work comparing representations in humans and AI has relied on global, scalar measures to quantify their alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses, these measures only inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine it. To address this challenge, we propose a generic framework to compare human and AI representations, based on identifying latent representational dimensions underlying the same behaviour in both domains. Applying this framework to humans and a deep neural network (DNN) model of natural images revealed a low-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In contrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic properties, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. Although in silico experiments showed seemingly consistent interpretability of DNN dimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed substantial differences in how they process images. By making representations directly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for representational alignment and offer a means for improving their comparability.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive performance, matching or surpassing human performance in various perceptual and cognitive benchmarks, including image classification1,2, speech recognition3,4 and strategic gameplay5,6. In addition to their excellent performance as machine learning models, DNNs have drawn attention in the field of computational cognitive neuroscience for their notable parallels to cognitive and neural systems in humans and animal models7,8,9,10,11. These similarities, observed through different types of behaviour or patterns of brain activity, have sparked a growing interest in determining both factors underlying these similarities and differences between human and DNN representations. From the machine learning perspective, understanding where DNNs exhibit a limited alignment with humans can support the development of better and more robust artificial intelligence (AI) systems. From the perspective of computational cognitive neuroscience, DNNs with stronger human alignment promise to be better candidate computational models of human cognition and behaviour12,13,14,15.

Much previous research on the alignment of human and artificial visual systems has compared behavioural strategies (for example, classification) in both systems and has revealed important limitations in the generalization performance of DNNs16,17,18,19,20. Other work has focused on directly comparing cognitive and neural representations in humans to those in DNNs, using methods such as representational similarity analysis (RSA21) or linear regression22,23,24,25. This quantification of alignment has led to a direct comparison of numerous DNNs across diverse visual tasks26,27,28,29, highlighting the role of factors such as architecture, training data or learning objective in determining the similarity to humans25,26,29,30.

Despite the appeal of summary statistics, such as correlation coefficients or explained variance, for comparing the representational alignment of DNNs with humans, they only quantify the degree of representational or behavioural alignment. However, without explicit hypotheses about potential causes for misalignment, such scalar measures are limited in their explanatory scope of which properties determine this degree of alignment, that is, which representational factors underlie the similarities and differences between humans and DNNs. Although diverse methods for interpreting DNN activations have been developed at various levels of analysis, ranging from single units to entire layers31,32,33,34,35, a direct comparability to human representations has remained a key challenge.

Inspired by recent work in cognitive sciences that has revealed core visual and semantic representational dimensions underlying human similarity judgements of object images36, here we propose a framework to systematically analyse and compare the dimensions that shape representations in humans and DNNs. In this work, we apply this framework to human visual similarity judgements and representations in a DNN trained to classify natural images. Our approach reveals numerous interpretable DNN dimensions that appear to reflect both visual and semantic image properties and that appear to be well aligned to humans. In contrast to humans, who showed a dominance of semantic over visual dimensions, DNNs exhibited a striking visual bias, demonstrating that downstream semantic behaviour is driven more strongly by different, primarily visual, strategies. Although psychophysical experiments on DNN dimensions underscored their global interpretability, a direct comparison with human dimensions revealed that DNN representations, in fact, only approximate human representations but lack the consistency expected from property-specific visual and semantic dimensions. Together, our results reveal key factors underlying the representational alignment and misalignment between humans and DNNs, shed light on potentially divergent representational strategies, and highlight the potential of this approach to identify the factors underlying the similarities and differences between humans and DNNs.

To improve the comparability of human and DNN representations, we aimed to identify the similarities and differences in core dimensions underlying human and DNN representations of images. To achieve this aim, we treated the neural network analogously to a human participant carrying out a cognitive behavioural experiment and then derived representational embeddings using a recent variational embedding technique37 from both human similarity judgements and a DNN on the same behavioural task (Methods). This approach ensured direct comparability between human and DNN representations. As a behavioural task, we chose a triplet odd-one-out similarity task, where from a set of three object images i, j and k, participants have to select the most dissimilar object (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Section D provides an analysis of the role of task instructions on triplet choice behaviour). In this task, the perceived similarity between two images i and j is defined as the probability of choosing these images to belong together across varying contexts imposed by a third object image k. By virtue of providing minimal context, the odd-one-out task highlights the information sufficient to capture the similarity between object images i and j across diverse contexts. In addition, it approximates human categorization behaviour for arbitrary visual and semantic categories, even for fairly diverse sets of objects36,37,38. Thus, by focusing on the building blocks of categorization that underlies diverse behaviours, this task is ideally suited for comparing object representations between humans and DNNs.

a, The triplet odd-one-out task in which a human participant or a DNN is presented with a set of three images and is asked to select the image that is the most different from the others. b, Sampling approach of odd-one-out decisions from DNN representations. First, a dot-product similarity space is constructed from the DNN features. Next, for a given triplet of objects, the most similar pair in this similarity space is identified, making the remaining object the odd one out. For humans, this sampling approach is based on observed behaviour, which is used as a measure of their internal cognitive representations. c, Illustration of the computational modelling approach to learn a lower-dimensional object representation for human participants and the DNN, optimized to predict behavioural choices made in the triplet task. d, Schematic of the interpretability pipeline that allows for the prediction of object embeddings from pretrained DNN features.

For human behaviour, we used a set of 4.7 million publicly available odd-one-out judgements39 over 1,854 diverse object images, derived from the THINGS object concept and image database40. For the DNN, we collected similarity judgements for 24,102 images of the same objects used for humans (1,854 objects with 13 examples per object). We used a larger set of object images since the DNN was less limited by constraints in dataset size than humans. This allowed us to obtain more precise estimates of their representation. To derive DNN representations, we chose a pretrained VGG-16 model41, given its common use in the computational cognitive neurosciences. Specifically, this network has been shown to exhibit good correspondence to both human behaviour17 and measured neural activity9,27,42 and performs well at predicting human similarity judgements24,25,30,43,44,45. VGG-16 was trained on the 1,000-class ImageNet dataset46, which contains a diverse range of image categories, such as animals, everyday objects and scenes. However, for completeness, we additionally ran similar analyses for a broader range of neural network architectures (Supplementary Section A). We focused on penultimate layer activations as they are the closest to the behavioural output, and they also showed closest representational correspondence to humans (Supplementary Section B). For the DNN, we generated a dataset of behavioural odd-one-out choices for the 24,102 object images (Fig. 1b). To this end, we first extracted the DNN layer activations for all the images. Next, for a given triplet of activations zi, zj and zk, we computed the dot product between each pair as a measure of similarity, then identified the most similar pair of images in this triplet and designated the remaining third image as the odd one out. Given the excessively large number of possible triplets for all 24,102 images, we approximated the full set of object choices from a random subset of 20 million triplets47.

From both sets of available triplet choices, we next generated two representational embeddings, one for humans and one for the DNN, where each embedding was optimized to predict the odd-one-out choices in humans and DNNs, respectively. In these embeddings, each object is described through a set of dimensions that represent interpretable object properties. To obtain these dimensions and for comparability to previous work in humans36,37,38, we imposed sparsity and non-negativity constraints on the optimization, which support their interpretability and provide cognitively plausible criteria for dimensions36,39,48,49,50,51. Sparsity constrained the embedding to consist of fewer dimensions, motivated by the observation that real-world objects are typically characterized by only a few properties. Non-negativity encouraged a parts-based description, where dimensions cannot cancel each other out. Thus, a dimension's weight indicated its relevance in predicting an object's similarity to other objects. During training, each randomly initialized embedding was optimized using a recent variational embedding technique37 (see the ‘Embedding optimization and pruning' section). The optimization resulted in two stable, low-dimensional embeddings, with 70 reproducible dimensions for DNN embedding and 68 for human embedding. The DNN embedding captured 84.03% of the total variance in image-to-image similarity, whereas the human embedding captured 82.85% of the total variance and 91.20% of the explainable variance given the empirical noise ceiling of the dataset.

Having identified stable, low-dimensional embeddings that are predictive of triplet odd-one-out judgements, we first assessed the interpretability of each identified DNN dimension by visualizing object images with large numeric weights. In addition to this qualitative assessment, we validated these observations for the DNN by asking 12 (6 female and 6 male) human participants to provide labels for each dimension separately (see the ‘Labelling dimensions and construction of word clouds' section). Similar to the core semantic and visual dimensions underlying odd-one-out judgements in humans described previously36,37,39, the DNN embedding yielded many interpretable dimensions, which appeared to reflect both semantic and visual properties of objects. The semantic dimensions included taxonomic membership (for example, related to food, technology and home) and other knowledge-related properties (for example, softness), whereas the visual dimensions reflected visual-perceptual attributes (for example, round, green and stringy), with some dimensions reflecting a composite of semantic and visual properties (for example, green and organic) (Fig. 2a). Of note, the DNN dimensions also revealed a sensitivity to basic shapes, including roundness, boxiness and tube shape. This suggests that in line with earlier studies52,53, DNNs indeed learn to represent basic shape properties, an aspect that might not be apparent in their overt behaviour54.

a, Visualization of example dimensions from human- and DNN-derived representational embeddings, with a selection of dimensions that had been rated as semantic, mixed visual–semantic and visual, alongside their dimension labels obtained from human judgements. Note that the displayed images reflect only images with a public domain license and not the full image set76. b, Rating procedure for each dimension, which was based on visualizing the top k images according to their numeric weights. Human participants labelled each of the human and DNN dimensions as predominantly semantic, visual, mixed visual–semantic or unclear (unclear ratings are not shown; 7.35% of all dimensions are for humans and 8.57%, for VGG-16). c, Relative importance of dimensions labelled as visual and semantic, where VGG-16 exhibited a dominance of visual and mixed dimensions relative to humans that showed a clear dominance of semantic dimensions. Images in a and b reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

Despite the apparent similarities, there were, however, striking differences found between humans and the DNN. First, overall, DNN dimensions were less interpretable than human dimensions, as confirmed by the evaluation of all dimensions by two independent raters (Supplementary Section C). This indicates a global difference in how the DNN assigns images as being conceptually similar to each other. Second, although human dimensions were clearly dominated by semantic properties, many DNN dimensions were more visual perceptual in nature or reflected a mixture of visual and semantic information. We quantified this observation by asking the same two independent experts to rate human and DNN dimensions according to whether they were primarily visual perceptual, semantic, reflected a mixture of both or were unclear (Fig. 2b). To confirm that the results were not an arbitrary byproduct of the chosen DNN architecture, we provided the raters with four additional DNNs for which we had computed additional representational embeddings. The results revealed a clear dominance of semantic dimensions in humans, with only a small number of mixed dimensions. By contrast, for DNNs, we found a consistently larger proportion of dimensions that were dominated by visual information or that reflected a mixture of both visual and semantic information (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 1b for all DNNs). This visual bias is also present across intermediate representations of VGG-16 and even stronger in early to late convolutional layers (Supplementary Fig. 2). This demonstrates a clear difference in the relative weight that humans and DNNs assign to visual and semantic information, respectively. We independently validated these findings using semantic text embedding and observed a similar pattern of visual bias (Supplementary Section E indicates that the results were not solely a product of human rater bias).

Despite the overall differences in human and DNN representational dimensions, the DNN also contained many dimensions that appeared to be interpretable and comparable to those found in humans. Next, we aimed at testing to what degree these interpretable dimensions truly reflected specific visual or semantic properties, or whether they only superficially appeared to show this correspondence. To this end, we experimentally and causally manipulated images and observed the impact on dimension scores. Beyond general interpretability, these analyses further establish which visual properties in each image drive individual dimensions and, thus, determine image representations.

Image manipulation requires a direct mapping from input images to the embedding dimensions. However, the embedding dimensions were derived using a sampling-based optimization based on odd-one-out choices inferred from penultimate DNN features. Consequently, this approach does not directly map these features to the learned embedding. To establish this mapping, we applied ℓ2-regularized linear regression to link the DNN's penultimate layer activations to the learned embedding. This mapping then enables the prediction of embedding dimensions from the penultimate feature activations in response to novel or manipulated images (Fig. 1d). Penultimate layer activations were indeed highly predictive of each embedding dimension, with all dimensions exceeding an R2 of 75%, and the majority exceeding 85%. Thus, this allowed us to accurately predict the dimension values for novel images.

Having established an end-to-end mapping between the input image and individual object dimensions, we next used three approaches to both probe the consistency of the interpretation and identify dimension-specific image properties. First, to identify image regions relevant for each individual dimension, we used Grad-CAM55, an established technique for providing visual explanations. Grad-CAM generates heat maps that highlight the image regions that are the most influential for model predictions. Unlike the typical use of Grad-CAM, which focuses on generating visual explanations for model classifications (for example, dog versus cat), we used Grad-CAM to reveal which image regions drive the dimensions in the DNN embedding. The results of this analysis are illustrated with example images in Fig. 3. Object dimensions were indeed driven by different image regions that contain relevant information, in line with the dimension's interpretation derived from human ratings and suggesting that the representations captured by the DNN's penultimate layer allow us to distinguish between different parts of the image that carry different functional importance.

a, General methodology of the approach. We used Grad-CAM55 to visualize the importance of distinct image parts based on the gradients of the penultimate DNN features that we initially used to sample triplet choices. The gradients were obtained in our fully differentiable interpretability model with respect to a dimension w in our embedding. b, We visualize the heat maps for three different images and dimensions. Each column shows the relevance of parts of an image for that dimension. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images available in the public domain76.

As the second image explanation approach, to highlight which image properties drive a dimension, we used a generative image model to create novel images optimized for maximizing the values of a given dimension31,56,57. Unlike conventional activation maximization targeting a single DNN unit or a cluster of units, our approach aimed to selectively amplify activation in dimensions of the DNN embedding across the entire DNN layer, using a pretrained generative adversarial neural network (StyleGAN-XL58). To achieve this, we applied our linear end-to-end mapping to predict the embedding dimensions from the penultimate activations in response to the images generated by StyleGAN-XL. The results of this procedure are shown in Fig. 4b. The approach successfully generated images with high numerical values in the dimensions of our DNN embedding. Indeed, the properties highlighted by these generated images appear to align with human-assigned labels for each specific dimension, again suggesting that the DNN embedding contained conceptually meaningful and coherent object properties similar to those found in humans.

a, Using StyleGAN-XL58, we optimized a latent code to maximize the predicted response in a specific embedding dimension. b, Visualizations for different dimensions in our embedding. We show the top ten images that score the highest in the dimension and the corresponding top ten generated images. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images available in the public domain76. Images in a and b reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

As the third image explanation approach, given that different visual properties naturally co-occur across images, and to unravel their respective contribution, we causally manipulated individual image properties and observed the effect on the predicted DNN dimensions. We exemplify this approach with manipulations in colour, object shape and background (Supplementary Section F), largely confirming our predictions, showing specific activation decreases or increases in dimensions that appeared to be representing these properties.

The previous results have confirmed the overall consistency and interpretation of the DNN's visual and semantic dimensions based on common interpretability techniques. However, a direct comparison with human image representations is crucial for identifying which representational dimensions align well and which do not. Traditional RSA provides a global metric of representational alignment, revealing a moderate correlation (Pearson's r = 0.55) between the representational similarity matrices (RSMs) of humans and the DNN (Fig. 5a). Although this indicates some degree of alignment in the object image representations, it does not clarify the factors driving this alignment. To address this challenge, we directly compared pairs of dimensions from both embeddings, pinpointing which dimensions contributed the most to the overall alignment and which dimensions were less well aligned.

a, RSMs reconstructed from human and VGG-16 embedding. Each row represents an object, with rows sorted into 27 superordinate categories (for example, animal, food and furniture) from ref. 40 to better highlight similarities and differences in representation. b, Pairwise correlations between human and VGG-16 embedding dimensions. c, Cumulative RSA analysis that shows the amount of variance explained in the human RSM as a function of the number of DNN dimensions. The black line shows the number of dimensions required to explain 95% of the variance. d–f, Intersection (red and blue regions) and differences (orange and green regions) between three highly correlating human and DNN dimensions. The pink circles denote the intersection of the red and blue regions, that is, where the same image scores highly in both dimensions. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images from the public domain76. For three images without a public domain version, visually similar replacements were used. Images in d–f reproduced with permission from ref. 76, Springer Nature Limited.

For each human dimension, we identified the most strongly correlated DNN dimension, once without replacement (unique) and once with replacement, and sorted the dimensions based on their fit (Fig. 5b). This revealed a close alignment, with Pearson's reaching up to r = 0.80 for a select few dimensions, which gradually declined across other representational dimensions. To determine whether the global representational similarity was driven by just a few well-aligned dimensions or required a broader spectrum of dimensions, we assessed the number of dimensions needed to explain human similarity judgements. The analysis revealed that 40 dimensions were required to capture 95% of the variance in representational similarity with the human RSM (Fig. 5c). Although this number is much smaller than the original 4,096-dimensional VGG-16 layer, these results demonstrate that the global representational similarity is not solely driven by a small number of well-aligned dimensions.

Given the imperfect alignment of DNN and human dimensions, we explored the similarities and differences in the stimuli represented by these dimensions. For each dimension, we identified which images were the most representative of both humans and the DNN. Crucially, to highlight the discrepancies between the two domains, we then identified which images exhibited strong dimension values for humans but weak values for the DNN, and vice versa (Fig. 5d–f). Although the results indicated similar visual and semantic representations in the most representative images, they also exposed clear divergences in dimension meanings. For instance, in an animal-related dimension, humans consistently represented animals even for images in which the DNN exhibited very low dimension values. Conversely, the DNN dimension strongly represented objects that were not animals, such as natural objects, cages or mesh (Fig. 5d). Similarly, a string-related dimension maintained a string-like representation in humans but included other objects in the DNN that were not string like, potentially reflecting properties related to thin, curvy objects or specific image properties (Fig. 5f).

Since internal representations do not necessarily translate into behaviour, we next addressed whether this misalignment would translate to downstream behavioural choices. To this end, we used a jackknife resampling procedure to determine the relevance of individual dimensions for odd-one-out choices. For each triplet, we iteratively pruned dimensions in both human and DNN embeddings and observed changes in the predicted probabilities of selecting the odd one out, yielding an importance score for each dimension for the odd-one-out choice (Fig. 6a). The results of this analysis showed that although humans and DNNs often aligned in their representations and choices, a sizable fraction of choices exhibited the same behaviour despite strong differences in representations (Fig. 6b). For behavioural choices, the semantic bias in humans was enhanced, as evidenced by an even stronger importance of semantic relative to visual or mixed dimensions in humans compared with DNNs. Individual triplet choices were affected not only by semantic dimensions but also by visual dimensions (Fig. 6c–f). Together, these results demonstrate that the differences in how humans and DNNs represent object images not only translate into behavioural choices but are also further amplified in their categorization behaviour.

a, Overview of the approach. For one triplet, we computed the original predicted softmax probability based on the entire representational embedding for each object image in the triplet. We then iteratively pruned individual dimensions from the representational embedding and stored the resulting change in the predicted softmax probability—relative to that of the full embedding—as a relevance score for that dimension. b, We calculated the relevance scores for a random sample of 10 million triplets and identified the most relevant dimension for each triplet. We then labelled the 10 million most relevant dimensions according to human-labelled visual properties as semantic, mixed visual–semantic, visual or unclear. Semantic dimensions are the most relevant for human behavioural choices, whereas for VGG-16, visual and mixed visual–semantic properties are more relevant. c–f, We rank the sorted changes in softmax probability to find triplets in which human and the DNN maximally diverge. Each panel shows a triplet with the behavioural choice made by humans and the DNN. We visualized the most relevant dimension for that triplet alongside the distribution of relevance scores. Each dimension is assigned its human-annotated label. For this figure, we filtered the embedding by images from the public domain76.

A key challenge in understanding the similarities and differences in humans and AI lies in establishing ways to make these two domains directly comparable. Overcoming this challenge would allow us to identify strategies to make AI more human like17 and for using AI as an effective model of human perception and cognition. In this work, we propose a framework to identify interpretable factors that determine the similarities and differences between human and AI representations. In this framework, these factors can be identified by using the same experiment to probe behaviour in humans and AI systems and applying the same computational strategy to natural and artificial responses to infer their respective interpretable embeddings. We applied this approach to human similarity judgements and representations of DNNs trained on natural images with varying objectives, with a primary focus on an image classification model. This allowed for a direct, meaningful comparison of the representations underlying human similarity judgements with the representations of the image classification model.

Our results revealed that the DNN contained representations that appeared to be similar to those found in humans, ranging from visual (for example, ‘white', ‘circular/round' and ‘transparent') to semantic properties (for example, ‘food related' and ‘fire related'). However, a direct comparison with humans showed largely different strategies for arriving at these representations. Although human representations were dominated by semantic dimensions, the DNN exhibited a pronounced bias towards visual or mixed visual–semantic dimensions. In addition, a direct comparison of seemingly aligned dimensions revealed that DNNs only approximated the semantic representations found in humans. These different strategies were also reflected in their behaviour, where similar behavioural outcomes were based on different embedding dimensions. Thus, despite seemingly well-aligned human and DNN representations at a global level, deriving dimensions underlying the representational similarities provided a more complete and more fine-grained picture of this alignment, revealing the nature of the representational strategies that humans and DNNs use12,14,59.

Although approaches like RSA21,60 are particularly useful for comparing one or multiple representational spaces, they typically provide only a summary statistic of the degree of alignment and require explicit hypotheses and model comparisons to determine what it is about the representational space that drives human alignment. By contrast, other approaches have focused specifically on the interpretability of DNN representations31,32,34,35,61,62,63, but either provide very specific local measures about DNN units or have limited direct comparability with human representations, as the same interpretability methods can typically not be applied to understand human mental representations. Our framework combines the strengths of the comparability gained from RSA and existing interpretability methods to understand image representations in DNNs. We applied common interpretability methods to show that our approach allows for detailed experimental testing and causal probing of DNN representations and behaviour across diverse images. Yet, only the direct comparison with human representations revealed the diverging representational strategies of humans and DNNs and, thus, the limitations of the visualization techniques we used64.

Our results are consistent with previous work indicating that DNNs make use of strategies that deviate from those used in humans65,66. Beyond previously discovered biases, here we found a visual bias in DNNs that diverges from a semantic bias in humans for similarity judgements. In particular, even the highest layers in DNNs retained strong visual biases for solving the tasks they had been trained on, including image classification or linking images with text, both of which can be described as semantic tasks with different degrees of richness. This visual strategy may, of course, reflect how our visual system solves core object recognition67. Indeed, it is an open question to what extent human core object recognition relies on a similar visual bias68 and whether this bias is also found in the anterior ventral–temporal cortex69, which is known to be involved in high-level object processing70 However, even if humans used a primarily visual strategy for solving core object recognition, our findings would demonstrate a significant limitation of DNNs in capturing human mental representations as measured with similarity judgements, despite similar representational geometries71.

Interestingly, CLIP, a more predictive model of human cortical visual processing26,29, retained a visual bias despite training on semantic image descriptions, showing that the classification objective alone is not sufficient for explaining visual bias in DNNs. At the same time, the visual bias in CLIP was smaller (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that better models of high-level visual processing may also be models with a larger semantic bias and pointing towards potential strategies for improving their alignment with humans, which may involve multimodal pretraining or larger, more diverse datasets29. Future work would benefit from a systematic comparison of different DNNs to identify what factors determine visual bias and their alignment with human brain and behavioural data.

Although these results indicate that studying core dimensions of DNN representations can improve our understanding of the factors required to identify better models of human mental representations, it has also been demonstrated recently that aligning DNNs with human representations can improve DNN robustness and performance at out-of-distribution tasks28,72. This work highlights that identifying visual bias may be useful not only for understanding representational and behavioural differences between humans and DNNs but also for guiding future work determining the gaps in human–AI alignment and identifying adjustments in architecture and training needed to reduce this bias59. Further work is needed to clarify the role of task instructions in human–AI alignment across diverse tasks and instructions73.

The framework introduced in this work can be expanded in several ways. Future work could use this approach to explore what factors make DNNs similar or different from one another. A comprehensive analysis of various DNN architectures, objectives or datasets25,26,28 could uncover the factors underlying representational alignment, and extension to other stimuli, tasks and domains, including brain recordings. Together, this framework promises a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between human and AI representations, providing the potential to identify better candidate models of human cognition and behaviour and more human-aligned artificial cognitive systems.

In the triplet odd-one-out task, participants are presented with three objects and must choose the one that is least similar to the others, that is, the odd one out. We define a dataset \({\mathcal{D}}:={\left\{\left(\{{i}_{s},{j}_{s},{k}_{s}\},\{{a}_{s},{b}_{s}\}\right)\right\}}_{s = 1}^{n}\), where n is the total number of triplets and {is, js, ks} is a set of three unique objects, with {as, bs} being the pair among them determined as the most similar. We used a dataset of human responses36 to learn an embedding of human object concepts. In addition, we simulated the triplet choices from a DNN. For the DNN, we simulated these choices by computing the dot product of the penultimate layer activation \({{\bf{z}}}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}_{+}\) after applying the rectified linear unit function, where \({S}_{ij}={{\bf{z}}}_{i}^{\top }{{\bf{z}}}_{j}\). The most similar pair {as, bs} was then identified by the largest dot product:

Using this approach, we sampled the triplet odd-one-out choices for a total of 20 million triplets for the DNN.

Let \({W}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{m\times p}\) denote a randomly initialized embedding matrix, where p = 150 is the initial embedding dimensionality. To learn interpretable concept embeddings, we used variational interpretable concept embeddings (VICE), an approximate Bayesian inference approach37. VICE performs mean-field variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution \(p({W}| {\mathcal{D}})\) with a variational distribution, qθ(W), where \({q}_{\theta }\in {\mathcal{Q}}\).

VICE imposes sparsity on the embeddings using a spike-and-slab Gaussian mixture before updating the variational parameters θ. This prior encourages shrinkage towards zero, with the spike approximating a Dirac delta function at zero (responsible for sparsity) and the slab modelled as a wide Gaussian distribution (determining non-zero values). Therefore, it is a sparsity-inducing prior and can be interpreted as a Bayesian version of the elastic net74. The optimization objective minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the posterior and approximate distributions:

where the left term represents the complexity loss and the right term is the data log-likelihood.

Since the variational parameters are composed of two matrices, one for the mean and one for the variance, that is, θ = {μ, σ}, we can use the mean representation μi as the final embedding for an object i. Imposing sparsity and positivity constraints improves the interpretability of our embeddings, ensuring that each dimension meaningfully represents distinct object properties. Although sparsity is guaranteed via the spike-and-slab prior, we enforced non-negativity by applying a rectified linear unit function to our final embedding matrix, thereby guaranteeing that \({W}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}_{+}^{m\times p}\). Note that this is done both during optimization and at inference time. We used the same procedure as in ref. 37 for determining the optimal number of dimensions. Specifically, we initialized our model with p = 150 dimensions and reduced the dimensionality iteratively by pruning dimensions based on their probability of exceeding a threshold set for sparsity:

where wij is the weight associated with object i and dimension j. Training stopped either when the number of dimensions remained unchanged for 500 epochs or when the embedding was optimized for a maximum of 1,000 epochs.

We assessed reproducibility across 32 model runs with different seeds using a split-half reliability test. We chose the split-half reliability test for its effectiveness in evaluating the consistency of our model's performance across different subsets of data, ensuring robustness. We partitioned the objects into two disjoint sets using odd and even masks. For each model run and every dimension in an embedding, we identified the dimension that is the most highly correlated among all the other models by using an odd mask. Using the even mask, we correlated this highest match with the corresponding dimension. This process generated a sampling distribution of Pearson's r coefficients for all the model seeds. We subsequently Fisher z transformed the Pearson's r sampling distribution. The average z-transformed reliability score for each model run was obtained by taking the mean of these z scores. Inverting this average provides an average Pearson's r reliability score (Supplementary Section G). For our final model and all subsequent analyses, we selected the embedding with the highest average reproducibility across all dimensions.

We assigned labels to the human embedding by pairing each dimension with its highest correlating counterpart from ref. 36. These dimensions were derived from the same behavioural data, but using a non-Bayesian variant of our method. We then used the human-generated labels that were previously collected for these dimensions, without allowing for repeats.

For the DNN, we labelled dimensions using human judgements. This allowed us to capture a broad and nuanced understanding of each dimension's characteristics. To collect human judgements, we asked 12 laboratory participants (6 male, 6 female; mean age, 29.08 years; s.d., 3.09 years; range, 25–35 years) to label each DNN dimension. Participants were presented with a 5 × 6 grid of images, with each row representing a decreasing percentile of importance for that specific dimension. The top row contained the most important images, and the following rows included images within the 8th, 16th, 24th and 32nd percentiles. Participants were asked to provide up to five labels that they thought best described each dimension. Word clouds showing the provided object labels were weighted by the frequencies of occurrence, and the top six labels were visualized. Due to computer crashes during data acquisition, three participants had incomplete data (32%, 80% and 93%).

Study participation was voluntary, and participants were not remunerated for their participation. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University Medical Center Leipzig (157/20-ek).

Two independent experts rated the dimensions according to two questions. The first question asked whether the dimensions were primarily visual perceptual, semantic conceptual, a mix of both or whether their nature was unclear. For the second question, they rated the dimensions according to whether they reflected a single concept, several concepts or were not interpretable. Overall, both raters agreed agreed 81.86% of the time for question 1 and 90.00% of the time for question 2. Response ambiguity was resolved by a third rater (Supplementary Sections A–C). All raters were part of the laboratory but were blind to whether the dimensions were model or human generated.

We additionally learned embeddings from early (convolutional block 1), middle (convolutional block 3) and late (convolution block 5) convolutional layers of VGG-16. For this, we applied global average pooling to the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and then sampled triplets from the averaged one-dimensional representations.

To visualize the learned object dimensions, we used an activation maximization technique with a pretrained StyleGAN-XL generator \({\mathcal{G}}\) (ref. 58). Our approach combines sampling with gradient-based optimization to generate images that maximize specific dimension values in our embedding space.

We started by sampling a set of N = 100,000 concatenated noise vectors \({{\bf{v}}}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{d}\), where d is the dimensionality of the StyleGAN-XL latent space. For each noise vector, we generated an image \({{\bf{x}}}_{i}={\mathcal{G}}({{\bf{v}}}_{i})\) and predicted its embedding \({\hat{{\bf{y}}}}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{p}\) using our pipeline, where p is the number of dimensions in our embedding space.

For a given dimension j, we selected the top k images that yielded the highest values for \({\hat{y}}_{ij}\), the jth component of \(\hat{{{\bf{y}}}_{i}}\). These images served as starting points for our optimization process.

To refine these initial images, we performed gradient-based optimization in the latent space of StyleGAN-XL. Our objective function \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{AM}}}\) balances two goals: increasing the absolute value of the embedding for dimension j and concentrating probability mass towards dimension j. Formally, we define \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{AM}}}\) as

where \({{\bf{z}}}_{i}=f({\mathcal{G}}({{\bf{v}}}_{i}))\) denotes the penultimate features extracted from the generated image using the pretrained VGG-16 classifier f. The term on the left, referred to as the dimension size reward, contributes to increasing the absolute value \(\hat{y}_{ij}\) for the object dimension j. The term on the right, referred to as the dimension specificity reward, concentrates probability mass towards a dimension without necessarily increasing its absolute value. The balance between these two objectives is controlled by the scalars α and β. The objective \({{\mathcal{L}}}_{{\rm{AM}}}\) was minimized using vanilla stochastic gradient descent. Importantly, only the latent code vector vi was updated, and keeping the parameters of \({\mathcal{G}}\), the VGG-16 classifier f and the embedding model fixed.

This optimization process was performed for each of the top k images selected in the initial sampling phase. The resulting optimized images provide visual representations that maximally activate specific dimensions in our learned embedding space, offering insights into the semantic content captured by each dimension.

To highlight the image regions driving individual DNN dimensions, we used Grad-CAM. For each image, we performed a forward pass to obtain an image embedding and computed gradients using a backward pass. We next aggregated the gradients across all the feature maps in that layer to compute an average gradient, yielding a two-dimensional dimension importance map.

We used RSA to compare the structure of our learned embeddings with human judgements and DNN features. This analysis was conducted in three stages: human RSA, DNN RSA, and a comparative analysis between human and DNN representations.

We reconstructed a similarity matrix from our learned embedding. Given a set of objects \({\mathcal{O}}={o}_{1},\ldots ,{o}_{m}\), we computed the similarity Sij between each pair of objects (oi, oj) using the softmax function:

where yi is the embedding of object oi, and the softmax function returns the probability of oi being more similar to ok than oj. To evaluate the explained variance, we used a subset of 48 objects for which a fully sampled similarity matrix and associated noise ceilings were available from previous work36. We then computed the Pearson correlation between our predicted RSM and the ground-truth RSM for these 48 objects.

We followed a similar procedure, reconstructing the RSM from our learned embedding of the DNN features. We then correlated this reconstructed RSM with the ground-truth RSM derived from the original DNN features used to sample our behavioural judgements.

To compare human and DNN representations, we conducted two analyses. First, we performed a pairwise comparison by matching each human dimension with its most correlated DNN dimension. This was done both with and without replacement, allowing us to assess the degree of alignment between human and DNN representational spaces. Second, we performed a cumulative RSA to determine the number of DNN dimensions needed to accurately reflect the patterns in the human similarity matrix. We took the same ranking of DNN dimensions used for the pairwise RSA, starting with the highest correlating dimension. We then progressively added one DNN dimension at a time to a growing subset. After each addition, we reconstructed the RSM from this subset and correlated both the human RSM and the cumulative DNN RSM. This step-by-step process allowed us to observe how the inclusion of each additional DNN dimension contributed to explaining the variance in the human RSM.

Metrics details

High-density silicon probes have transformed neuroscience by enabling large-scale neural recordings at single-cell resolution. However, existing technologies have provided limited functionality in nonhuman primates (NHPs) such as macaques. In the present report, we describe the design, fabrication and performance of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP, a high-channel electrode array designed to enable large-scale acute recording throughout large animal brains. The probe features 4,416 recording sites distributed along a 45-mm shank. Experimenters can programmably select 384 recording channels, enabling simultaneous multi-area recording from thousands of neurons with single or multiple probes. This technology substantially increases scalability and recording access relative to existing technologies and enables new classes of experiments that involve electrophysiological mapping of brain areas at single-neuron and single-spike resolution, measurement of spike–spike correlations between cells and simultaneous brain-wide recordings at scale.

High-channel count electrophysiological recording devices such as Neuropixels probes1,2 are transforming neuroscience with rodent models by enabling recording from large populations of neurons anywhere in the rodent brain3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The capabilities provided by this approach have led to a myriad new discoveries4,7,9. The Neuropixels 1.0 probe has also been used to record neurons in both human10,11 and nonhuman primates (NHPs) such as macaques12,13,14,15, but its 10-mm length restricts access to superficial targets and the thin shank (24 µm) renders them difficult to insert through primate dura mater. Consequently, a large community of NHP researchers articulated the need for a probe that allows large-scale access to neurons throughout the primate brain.

Current linear array technologies, such as V- or S-probes (Plexon, Inc.), provide access to the whole brain, but are limited to 64 channels and have relatively large diameters (for example, 380 µm) that increase as recording channels are added. Surface arrays such as the Utah array16 or floating microwire arrays17 allow for recording from up to 256 channels simultaneously, but are limited to recording at pre-specified depths in superficial cortex, require opening the dura for placement and cannot be moved after implantation. Alternative approaches using individually driven single electrodes have achieved recordings in deep brain regions from dozens or hundreds of neurons by a few dedicated labs18,19,20, although these approaches do not allow for dense sampling within a specific target region. Alternatively, two-photon (2P) imaging enables recording at single-cell resolution, but with limited temporal resolution and limited access to many brain areas.

We developed the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP, a high-density integrated silicon electrode array, optimized for recording in NHPs and designed to enable flexible, configurable recording from large neuronal populations throughout the brain with single-neuron and single-spike resolution. Although the probe's design and electronic specifications are based on the Neuropixels 1.0 probe (http://Neuropixels.org), fabricating these probes with the desired combination of mechanical and electrical properties using a standard CMOS photolithography process required substantial engineering advances. Each probe is larger than a photolithographic reticle, requiring ‘stitching' of electrical traces across the boundaries between multiple reticles to achieve the required probe geometry21 and the introduction of stress compensation layers to prevent intrinsic material stresses from causing the shank to bend. Relative to Neuropixels 1.0, the two variants of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP feature a longer, wider and thicker shank (45 mm long, 125 µm wide and 90 µm thick; Fig. 1a). For each probe variant, the full length of the shank is populated with recording sites with a density of two sites every 20 µm (Fig. 1b). A switch under every site allows flexible selection of the 384 simultaneous recording channels across these 4,416 sites (11 banks of 384 channels, respectively, plus one half-sized bank at the shank–base junction; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1).

Here, we described this new probe and the engineering challenges surmounted by fabrication and illustrate the ability to address a range of new experimental use cases for recording in large animal models. We focused on recording large neuronal populations, recording both in deep structures and from multiple regions simultaneously. We illustrated these use cases with four example experiments from different labs, each pursuing research questions spanning sensory, motor and cognitive domains using macaques. The scale and access provided by Neuropixels 1.0 NHP enabled a wide range of new experimental paradigms, while streamlining neural data collection at a fraction of the cost of existing alternatives.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe uses the same signal-conditioning circuits as the Neuropixels 1.0 probe1, integrating 384 low-noise readout channels with programmable gain and 10-bit resolution on a 130-nm Silicon-on-Insulator CMOS platform. Within the probe shank, an array of shift-register elements and a switch matrix enable programmable selection of recording sites. The probe is fabricated as a 54-mm-long monolithic piece of silicon that integrates both the shank and the base electronics, exceeding the size of the optical reticle used to define on-chip features. We addressed this limitation by developing a method called stitching21, which precisely aligns features from different exposures between adjacent reticles.

The typical maximum size of a 130-nm CMOS chip is limited by the maximum reticle size (that is, 22 mm × 24 mm in this case) that can be exposed in a single lithography step. To build larger chips, the CMOS chip is divided into sub-blocks smaller than the reticle field, which are later used to re-compose (that is, stitch together) the complete chip by performing multiple reticle exposures per layer. The stitched boundary regions of the small design blocks are overlapped (that is, double exposed) to ensure uninterrupted metal traces from one reticle to the next, which is accounted for in the design. As multiple levels of metal wires are needed to realize and interconnect the large number of recording sites at high density, the conducting wires in the shank must be aligned between adjacent reticles for four of the six stacked aluminum metal layers. To enable stitching and to simplify photo-mask design and reuse, the probe is designed with three elements as shown in Fig. 1d: a 5-mm tip (Fig. 1e), two 20-mm middle shank segments (stitch segments 2 and 3 in Fig. 1d) and the 10-mm base segment. Four reticles are thus required to define the features on each probe. The probe base is 6 mm wide, allowing four probes to be written across these four reticles.

Four design strategies were developed to mitigate the expected degradation of signal with increased shank length: (1) the 384 metal wires connecting recording sites to the readout circuits in the base were widened relative to Neuropixels 1.0 to keep their resistance and thermal noise contribution low; (2) the spacing between the metal wires was increased to limit the signal coupling and crosstalk along the shank; (3) the power-supply wires connected to shank circuits were made wider to minimize voltage attenuation and fluctuations along the shank; and (4) the size of the decoupling capacitors was increased. The additional width and spacing of the metal lines also mitigated the impact of anticipated reticle misalignments, magnification and rotational errors in the overlap regions during stitching. Collectively, these approaches successfully enabled recording from the full 45 mm without signal degradation as a function of position (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Figure 1e shows details of the shank recording site placement and the dense CMOS layout in the shank and Fig. 1f shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the aluminium metal wires running along one of the 0.24-µm stitching regions in the shank. As a result of the double exposure of the masking photoresist at the stitching region, the wires became 24–54% narrower in this region, but remained continuous circuits without interruption.

One of the major design changes to this device, compared with the rodent probe1, was to strengthen and thicken the probe shank, which was necessary both to support the longer 45-mm shank length and to allow the probe to penetrate primate dura. To achieve this, we increased the thickness of the shank from 24 µm to 90 µm. In addition, as the increased thickness altered the bending profile of the shank, we added stress compensation layers, which help to reduce intrinsic stresses within the material in the shank and enabled us to keep bending within the same range as the rodent probes, despite the 450% increase in length.

For the data reported in the present study, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe version with a 125 µm wide, 45 mm long shank, 4,416 selectable recording sites (pixels) and a 48 mm2 base. To facilitate insertion of the shank into the brain and to minimize dimpling and tissue damage1, the 20° top-plane, chisel-tapered shanks were mechanically ground to a 25° bevel angle on the side plane using a modified pipette microgrinder (Narishige, cat. no. EG-402). This procedure resulted in a tip sharpened along both axes (Fig. 1g). Additional discussion of insertion mechanics, methods and hardware is provided in a wiki (https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki).

The programmable sites of Neuropixels 1.0 NHP provide a number of advantages over existing recording technologies appropriate for primates. First, the high-channel count represents a transformative capability for large animal research. Large-scale recordings permitted rapid surveys of brain regions, enabled analyses that infer the neural state on single trials, made it practical to identify ensembles of neurons with statistically significantly correlated spike trains and reduced the number of animals and time required to perform experiments. Second, the high density of recording sites enabled high-quality, automated spike sorting22 when recording from one or both columns within a 3.84-mm bank of recording sites (Fig. 1c). The high density of sites also enabled continuous tracking of neurons in the event of drifting motion between the probe and tissue10,11, which is imperative for automated spike sorting of most real-world data22.

Third, users could choose to record with full density from one column in each of two banks, for 7.68 mm total length of high-quality, single-unit recordings, or specify alternative layouts (Extended Data Fig. 1). Programmable site selection allowed experimenters to decouple the process of optimizing a recording location from probe positioning. This capability allowed experimenters to survey neural activity along the entire probe length to map the relative positions of electrophysiological features. In addition, the programmability allowed experimenters to leave the probe in place before an experiment to improve stability during the recording.

We illustrated these collective advantages using example recordings in different macaque brain studies, including: (1) retinotopic organization of extrastriate visual cortex; (2) neural dynamics throughout the motor system; (3) face recognition in face patches of the inferotemporal (IT) cortex; and (4) neural signals underlying decision-making in the posterior parietal cortex.

More than half of the macaque neocortex is visual in function23 and a multitude of visual areas containing neurons with distinct feature-selective properties (for example, motion, color) lie beyond the primary visual cortex (V1). However, many of these visual areas are located deep within the convolutions of the occipital, temporal and parietal lobes (Fig. 2a). This, combined with the limitations of prior recording technologies, led to most electrophysiological studies focusing on only a subset of visual areas. Fewer than half of the identified visual areas have been well studied (for example, areas V4, MT (middle temporal)), whereas most (for example, DP (dorsal prelunate), V3A, FST (fundus of the superior temporal sulcus), PO (parieto-occipital)) have been only sparsely investigated. Given the clear similarities between the macaque and human visual systems24,25, systematic investigation across the macaque visual cortex is needed. This is practical only with technologies that enable large-scale surveys via simultaneous population recordings from both superficial and deep structures. Our initial tests with the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe demonstrate that it is well suited for that purpose.

Ntotal, total number of neurons; Nvisual, number of visually responsive neurons.

During individual experimental sessions, the activity of thousands of single neurons across multiple visual cortical areas could be recorded using a single NHP probe. Figure 2b,c shows the spike waveforms and rasters from one recording of 446 neurons simultaneously recorded from one bank of recording sites spanning 6–10 mm below the cortical surface. Of these neurons, 202 neurons exhibited well-defined receptive fields (RFs). As anticipated, the location of the neurons' RFs varied as a function of the position along the probe. RFs shifted in an orderly manner for stretches of approximately 1 mm and then shifted abruptly, reflecting probable transitions between different retinotopic areas (for example, refs. 26,27,28; Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Across the full depth, RFs tiled much of the contralateral hemifield and included some of the ipsilateral visual space (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3b). When recording from up to 23 successive sessions in the same location with each probe, the number of neurons recorded varied but showed no clear decline with repeated penetrations (Fig. 2f).

In other sessions, we recorded from up to five probe banks spanning 0–19 mm beneath the pial surface (Fig. 2g) across separate blocks of trials. Using this approach, it was possible to sample from different locations without moving the probe. In one example session, 3,029 single neurons were recorded, of which 2,729 neurons were visually responsive (Fig. 2h). As with the single-bank recordings (Fig. 2d,e), neuronal RFs shifted gradually for contiguous stretches, punctuated by abrupt changes. In the example shown (Fig. 2i), RFs at more superficial sites (0–3 mm) were located at more eccentric locations of the visual field and then abruptly shifted toward the center and closer to the lower vertical meridian (LVM; ~3 mm). At the same location, neurons became more selective to the direction of motion (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), suggesting a transition from area V4 to areas MT or MST. After that, RFs were located more centrally at the lower contralateral visual field and were observed across several millimeters. At deeper sites (~6–7 mm), smaller RFs clustered near the horizontal meridian (HM) for more than 1 mm, then quickly shifted toward the upper vertical meridian (UVM; ~8 mm). Finally, at the deepest sites (>10 mm), RFs generally became larger and much less well defined. These representations were stable throughout the duration of a session (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These data illustrate how the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP's dense sampling and single-unit resolution facilitate large-scale and unbiased mapping of the response properties of neurons across multiple visual areas.

Next, we demonstrated the utility of this technology for studying multiple brain areas involved in movement control. Primary motor cortex (M1) is situated at the rostral bank of the central sulcus and extends along the precentral gyrus. Sulcal M1 contains the densest projections of descending corticomotoneuronal cells and corticospinal neurons, which collectively are understood to convey the dominant efferent signals from the brain to the periphery in primates29,30. Constraints of existing technology have led to two broad limitations in studies of the motor system.

First, motor electrophysiologists have been forced to choose between simultaneous recording from populations of superficial neurons in gyral motor cortex (PMd and rostral M1) using Utah arrays31 and, alternatively, recording fewer neurons in sulcal M1 using single-wire electrodes or passive arrays of 16–32 contacts (for example, Plexon S-probes or Microprobes Floating Microwire Arrays17). Recording from large populations of neurons in sulcal M1 has not been feasible.

Second, the motor cortex is only one part of an extensive network of cortical and subcortical structures involved in generating movement29,32. Many investigations of the motor system focus on M1 and comparatively fewer experiments have investigated neural responses from the numerous additional structures involved in planning and controlling movements, the result in part of the challenge of obtaining large-scale datasets in subcortical structures in primates. Areas such as the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the basal ganglia (BG) are understood to be important for planning and controlling movements, but investigation of the functional roles and interactions between these regions is hampered by the challenge of simultaneously recording from multiple areas.

We developed a system capable of simultaneous recordings from multiple Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probes in superficial and deep structures of rhesus macaques. We tested this approach using a task in which a monkey generated isometric forces to track the height of a scrolling path of dots (Fig. 3a; task described in ref. 33). We recorded from the primary motor and premotor cortex (M1 and PMd; Fig. 3b) while the monkey tracked a variety of force profiles (one profile per condition). Each condition was repeated across multiple trials (Fig. 3c). Single neurons exhibited a diversity of temporal patterns throughout the motor behavior (Fig. 3d–f). When ordered using Rastermap34, neurons illustrated a diversity of phase relationships with respect to the behavior (Fig. 3f). Predictions of endpoint force from neural activity (via linear regression) improved steadily as more neurons were included in the analysis and the performance did not saturate even when including all recorded neurons (360) for an example session (Fig. 3g). Thus, despite the apparent simplicity of a one-dimensional force-tracking task, neural responses are sufficiently diverse that it is necessary to sample from many hundreds of neurons to capture a complete portrait of population-level activity.

The relative motion of the probe within the brain tissue is a major concern for the stability of neural recordings. Motor tasks represent a challenging set of conditions because movement of the body can place stresses on the implant and move the probe within the brain. With careful preparation, on most sessions we did not observe rapid probe motion due to pulse, respiration or mechanical forces from the motor task. Typically, we observed stable waveforms (Fig. 3h) and ~2–15 µm of slow drift over the course of a recording session (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Figs. 4a and 5). In some isolated cases, when the primate generated a large unexpected movement, we did observe a fast translation of the probe (for example, Extended Data Fig. 4b). However, in practice, we found that low-drift recordings could be obtained across a variety of experimental preparations in disparate brain regions (Fig. 4a–d and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5).

Programmable site selection in the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP enables simultaneous recording from superficial and deep structures using a single probe. To illustrate this capability, we recorded from superficial motor cortex and internal globus pallidus (GPi) in the BG using 192 channels in each target location (Fig. 5a,b). Alternatively, the small form factor of the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probes and headstages allows for dense packing of multiple probes by inserting probes along nonparallel trajectories to record from a large number of neurons in a single area. Figure 5c,d illustrates recordings from three probes in gyral PMd, yielding 673 neurons. This approach was tested on two sessions, in which we recorded from 6 and 7 probes, yielding 1,012 and 783 neurons, respectively. These yields were lower than average as a result of imperfect recording conditions unrelated to the insertion hardware. Sampling with multiple probes is also well suited for simultaneous recording from different brain areas. Figure 5e illustrates a system designed to record from M1, the GPi of the BG and the SMA, using multiple probes inserted into a single recording chamber, with representative neural responses illustrated in Fig. 5f.

Next, we demonstrated the use of the probes in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex, a brain region in the temporal lobe that is challenging to access because of its depth. The IT cortex is a critical brain region supporting high-level object recognition and has been shown to harbor several discrete networks35, each specialized for a specific class of objects. The network that was discovered first and has been most well studied in nonhuman primates is the face-patch system. This system consists of six discrete patches in each hemisphere36, which are anatomically and functionally connected. Each patch contains a large concentration of cells that respond more strongly to images of faces than to images of other objects. Studying the face-patch system has yielded many insights that have transferred to other networks in the IT cortex, including increasing view invariance going from posterior to anterior patches and a simple, linear encoding scheme35. As such, this system represents an approachable model for studying high-level object recognition37. The code for facial identity in these patches is understood well enough that images of presented faces can be accurately reconstructed from neural activity of just a few hundred neurons38.

A major remaining puzzle is how different nodes of the face-patch hierarchy interact to generate object percepts. To answer this question, it is imperative to record from large populations of neurons in multiple face patches simultaneously to observe the varying dynamics of face-patch interactions on a single-trial basis. This is essential because the same image can often invoke different object percepts on different trials39. In the present study, we recorded with one probe in each of two face patches, middle lateral (ML) and anterior fundus (AF), simultaneously (Fig. 6a). The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probes recorded responses of 1,127 units (622 single units, 505 multi-units) across both face patches during a single session (Fig. 6a, right). A continuous segment of approximately 220 channels (2.2 mm) in ML and 190 channels (1.9 mm) in AF contained face-selective units, indicating that these extents of the probes were in the IT cortex. In ML 261 units and in AF 297 units were face selective (two-sided, two-sample Student's t-test, threshold P < 0.05).

Coronal slices from MRI show inserted tungsten electrodes used to verify targeting accuracy for subsequent recordings using Neuropixels 1.0 NHP (top, face-patch ML; bottom, face-patch AF). Yellow overlays illustrate functional MRI contrast in response to faces versus objects. b, Response rasters for a single stimulus presentation of simultaneously recorded neurons in ML and AF to a monkey face, presented at t = 0. Each line in the raster corresponds to a spike from a single neuron or multi-unit cluster, including both well-isolated single units and multi-unit clusters. c, Neuropixels 1.0 NHP enabling recordings from many face cells simultaneously. These plots show the average responses (baseline subtracted and normalized) of visually responsive cells (rows) to 96 stimuli (columns) from 6 categories, including faces and other objects. Bottom, exemplar stimuli from each category. The plots included 438 cells or multi-unit clusters in ML (left) and 689 in AF (right), out of which a large proportion responded selectively to faces. Units were sorted by channel, revealing that face cells are spatially clustered across the probe. d, Coronal slice of MRI of Neuropixels probe targeting the deepest IT face-patch AM. The thick shadow is a cannula that was inserted through the dura into the brain. The thin shadow corresponds to the Neuropixels trajectory. e, Same as c, for face-patch AM, recorded in a different session.

Changing the visual stimulus to a monkey face yielded a clear visual response across both face-patch populations. We measured responses of visually responsive cells to 96 different stimuli containing faces and nonface objects (Fig. 6b,c). A majority of cells in the two patches showed clear face selectivity. Using single-wire tungsten electrodes, this dataset would have taken about 2 years to collect, but is now possible in a single 2-h experimental session38. In addition, to the gain in efficiency created by this technology, simultaneous recordings of multiple cells and multiple areas allowed for investigation of how populations encode object identity in cases of uncertain or ambiguous stimuli, where the interpretation of the stimulus may vary from trial to trial but is nevertheless highly coherent on each trial. The anatomical depth of face patches puts them far out of reach for shorter high-density probes. For example, face-patch AM (anteromedial) sits about 42 mm from the craniotomy (Fig. 6d) along a conventional insertion trajectory, but face patches in this region are still accessible using the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe and exhibit face-selective responses within the boundaries of AM (Fig. 6e).

For many cognitive functions, the processes that give rise to behavior vary across repetitions of a task. As such, technologies that enable the analysis of neural activity at single-trial resolution will be especially critical for research on cognition. Achieving this resolution is challenging because it requires recordings from many neurons that share similar functional properties.

This challenge is exemplified in perceptual decision-making, in which decisions are thought to arise through the accumulation of noisy evidence to a stopping criterion, such that their evolution is unique on each trial in a dynamic motion discrimination task (Fig. 7a; for task see ref. 40). This process is widely observed and known as drift diffusion41,42. Neural correlates of drift diffusion have been inferred from activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) averaged over many decisions. LIP neurons display spatial RFs and represent the accumulated evidence for directing the gaze toward the RF. Analysis of LIP activity during single decisions has proven particularly difficult because RFs have little to no anatomical organization (Fig. 7c, top), preventing simultaneous recordings from many neurons with the same receptive field.

a, Task. The monkey must decide the net direction of dynamic RDM and indicate its decision by making a saccadic eye movement, whenever ready, from the central fixation point (red) to a left-choice or right-choice target (black). The choice and response times are explained by the accumulation of noisy evidence to criterion level54. b, Simultaneous recordings in LIP and SC. Populations of neurons were recorded in LIP with a Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe and in SC (deeper layers) with a multi-channel V-probe (Plexon). c, RFs are identified, post-hoc, from control blocks in which the monkey performed an oculomotor delayed response task55. A small fraction of the LIP neurons (top) has RFs that overlap the left-choice target (outlined in black). The SC (bottom) has a topographic map, so many neurons have overlapping RFs. The large sample size in LIP facilitates identification of neurons that respond to the same choice target in LIP and SC. d, Single-trial activity in LIP (top, n = 17) and SC (bottom, n = 15). Each trace depicts the smoothed firing rate average (Gaussian kernel, σ = 25 ms) of the 17 neurons that overlap the left-choice target (Tin) on a single trial, aligned to the onset of the motion stimulus. Rates are offset by the mean firing rate of 0.18–0.2 s after motion onset to force traces to begin at 0. The line color indicates the decision for the left-choice target or the right-choice target (Tout) on that trial. A few representative traces are highlighted for clarity. e, The same trials as in d aligned to saccade initiation, without baseline offset. Single-trial firing rates approximate drift diffusion in LIP—the accumulation of noisy evidence—whereas single-trial firing rates in SC exhibit a large saccadic burst at the time of the saccade, preceded by occasional nonsaccadic bursts.

Neuropixels recording in the LIP overcomes this challenge. These recordings yield 50–250 simultaneously recorded neurons, of which 10–35 share an RF that overlaps one of the contralateral choice targets used by the monkey to report its decision. The average activity of these target-in-RF (Tin) neurons during a single decision tracks the monkey's accumulated evidence as it contemplates its options. The signal explains much of the variability in the monkey's choices and reaction times43 and conforms to drift-diffusion dynamics (Fig. 7d,e, top).

Neuropixels technology also enables multi-area recordings from ensembles of neurons that share common features (Fig. 7b). For example, neurons in the deeper layers of the superior colliculus (SC) receive input from LIP and, like LIP neurons, also have spatial RFs and decision-related activity (Fig. 7c, bottom). An ideal experiment to understand how the two areas interact is to record simultaneously from populations of neurons in LIP and SC that share the same RF. This experiment is almost impossible with previous recording technology because of the lack of anatomical organization in the LIP.

This second challenge is also overcome by Neuropixels recording in the LIP, allowing for post-hoc identification of neurons in the LIP and SC with overlapping RFs (Fig. 7c). In the experiment depicted in Fig. 5, the response fields of 17 of the 203 LIP neurons overlapped the left-choice target as well as 15 simultaneously recorded neurons in the SC. Unlike LIP, single-trial analysis of the SC population revealed dynamics that are not consistent with drift diffusion (Fig. 7d,e, bottom). Instead, the SC exhibits bursting dynamics, which were found to be related to the implementation of a threshold computation44. The distinct dynamics in the LIP and SC during decision-making were observable only through single-trial analyses, the resolution of which is greatly improved with the high yield of the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP recording.

Understanding how the anatomical structure of specific neural circuits implements neural computations remains an important but elusive goal of systems neuroscience. One step toward connecting disparate levels of experimental inquiry is mapping correlative measures of relative spike timing between pairs of neurons, which is indicative of either synaptic connection between two neurons or shared input drive6,13,45. This is often impractical or extremely challenging when recording from only a small number of neurons, because the likelihood of recording from a pair of neurons with a statistically significant peak in the spike cross-correlogram (CCG) can be quite low. The probability of recording from such pairs of neurons depends on a number of factors, including the details of anatomy in a specific species and brain region. Broadly speaking, however, the probability of successfully recording a pair of neurons with a significant CCG peak increases with the square of the total number of neurons recorded.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe typically yields 200–450 (and sometimes more) neurons when recording with 384 channels in cortical tissue. Applying the same methodology established in ref. 6 to 13 sessions from rhesus PMd and M1 yielded 111 ± 89 putative connected pairs per session and a connection probability of 0.73 ± 0.61%. Figure 8a shows three example jitter-corrected CCG plots between pairs of neurons with significant peaks in the CCG. In many examples the CCG peak lagged between one neuron relative to the other, consistent with a 1- to 2-ms synaptic delay. For other neuron pairs, the CCG peak is synchronous between the two neurons, suggesting that they may receive common input (Fig. 8a, top). Extended Data Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of spike–timing delays for 479 neurons from an example recording session. Nearby neurons are more likely to exhibit significant CCG peaks than neurons located further apart. Using this approach, we can map the full set of putative connections for a given recording across the cortical lamina (Fig. 8b).

Group means were compared using bootstrapping between nonsignificant pairs and significant, synchronous pairs (P < 10−4), between nonsignificant pairs and significant, asynchronous pairs (P < 10−4) and between synchronous and asynchronous pairs (P < 10−4). d, Relationship between signal correlation and peak value of CCG. e,f, Example putative connected cell pair identified using two probes in area AF (e) and ML (f) with putative feedforward connection. g,h, Example putative connected cell pair identified using two probes in area ML (g) and AF (h) with putative feedback connection. i, The population of functionally connected cells between AL and MF regions dominated by cells that respond to faces.

In addition to the cortical distance, we further assessed the dependence of CCG peaks on the tuning similarity between neuronal pairs for the data recorded in the visual cortex. For example, neuron populations with diverse RFs obtained from multiple visual areas (shown in Fig. 2) allow us to quantitatively determine the association between CCG peaks and RF overlap. Using signal correlation (rsig) as a measure of such tuning similarity in visual fields46, we showed that functionally connected neuron pairs exhibit higher rsig compared with nonsignificant pairs (Fig. 8c). Specifically, synchronous pairs (putatively receiving common inputs) tend to share highly overlapping RFs (rsig mean = 0.60, P < 10−4 compared with nonsignificant pairs), whereas asynchronous pairs are more likely to share moderately overlapping RFs (rsig mean = 0.43, P < 10−4 compared with nonsignificant pairs and P < 10−4 compared with synchronous pairs). Moreover, the amplitude of the significant CCG peaks is positively correlated with rsig (Fig. 8d), which is consistent with previous studies47,48.

This same methodology can be applied to assess CCG peaks between multiple simultaneously recorded regions recorded using separate probes to assess feedforward and feedback signaling between two regions. Figure 8e shows the jitter-corrected CCG for a pair of neurons where one neuron is located in face-patch ML and the other in face-patch AF in the IT cortex. Figure 8f shows a single-trial spike raster of the downstream neuron in area AF, triggered on spikes of the neuron in ML, illustrating a possible feedforward signaling, whereas Fig. 8h illustrates a putative feedback connection with opposite timing response from the cell pair shown in Fig. 8g. Remarkably, pairs of face cells were >10× as likely to have significant peaks in CCG (2.3%, 125 of 5,368 face cell pairs) as pairs where one or both cells were not face cells (0.15%, 18 of 11,912 other pairs) between the ML and AF (Fig. 8i).

We have presented a new recording technology and suite of techniques to enable electrophysiological recordings using high-density integrated silicon probes in rhesus and other nonhuman primates. This technology enables large-scale recordings from populations of hundreds of neurons from deep structures in brain areas that are inaccessible using alternative technologies. The key methodological advance in the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe is the longer recording shank, which required the development of techniques to adapt photolithographic silicon-manufacturing methods to allow for stitching across multiple reticles. Creating a long and thin probe shank also required developing approaches for reducing the bending that resulted from internal stresses within the shank.

This technology combines the advantages of multiple approaches—recording with single-neuron spatial resolution and single-spike temporal resolution—whereas the long shank length provides recording access to most of the macaque brain. Programmable site selection enabled recording from multiple brain structures using a single probe, as well as surveying multiple recording sites along the shank without moving the probe. The combination of the compact form factor, commercially available and turn-key recording hardware and modest cost per channel relative to technologies like the Utah array enabled straightforward scaling in the size of simultaneously recorded neural populations. These capabilities could be essential for achieving accurate estimates of neural dynamics on single trials or for estimating the value of small-variance neural signals embedded in the neural population response.

The high spatial resolution offered a number of advantages over sparser sampling, including high-quality single-unit isolation, ability to perform automated drift correction22,49 (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5) and localization of the position and depth of the recording sites within a brain structure (for example, inferring probe depth with respect to cortical lamina), using current source density or other features of the recording. The high density also offered additional potential advances such as identifying putative neuron subclasses using extracellular waveforms5,10,50.

Scaling up recordings using the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was straightforward by recording from multiple probes simultaneously. In the present study, we demonstrated recording from up to seven probes and scaling this approach further is realistic. In practice, if many probes were used within a single brain area, the recording yield could be lower than a simple linear scaling, because it can be challenging to optimize the probe placement and insertion geometry for each probe independently. In addition, it was comparatively more complex to prevent any single probe from encountering resistance when transiting the dura. Care should be taken when inserting many probes within a small region, particularly in superficial structures, and the subsequent recordings could exhibit lower neuron yield than anticipated, based on estimates from single-probe recording sessions. Even given this potential for reduced yield, this is still an excellent approach for recording very large populations of neurons.

Deep brain regions have historically received less attention as a result of the relative challenge of recording large numbers of neurons in these areas. The ability to conveniently record from many neurons is transformative, by enabling experiments that would be triaged otherwise, such as high-risk, high-reward projects, or simply additional control experiments. In addition to convenience, however, simultaneous large-scale population recordings from multiple structures make it possible to address questions that would not be possible otherwise, such as identifying communication between areas, for example, via communication subspaces51,52, or accurately estimating neural state on single trials53.

The recordings presented in this report have exhibited lower probe drift (often <10 µm) than recent Neuropixels recordings in humans, which can exhibit hundreds of micrometers of drift10,11. These demonstrations were performed in an operating room during neurosurgeries, which involved creating large craniotomies (sometimes ~30–50 mm in diameter) and reflecting the dura to expose the brain. Without the dura or the skull to mechanically stabilize the brain, changes in pressure from cardiac and pulmonary rhythms cause the brain to pulse, often by hundreds of micrometers. This rapid cyclical drift introduces a challenge for drift correction and spike-sorting algorithms, often reducing the neuron yield relative to a stable preparation.

This challenge is largely absent in many rhesus macaque recordings, which are most often performed with the dura intact, and often using a smaller craniotomy (often as small as 3.5 mm, although this size is not essential for enabling stable recordings). For superficial recordings, such as those in the motor cortex, we placed a blunt guide tube on the surface of the dura with gentle compression (~0.5 mm), which eliminated most residual pulsation. Furthermore, animal experiments have the luxury of additional setup time relative to human recordings in the operating room, which must take place within a 15- to 20-min window. In the present study, we began each experiment by waiting for up to an hour as the probe settled in the brain, which reduced the impact of slow drift from the tissue relaxing back after probe insertion. The commercially released version of Neuropixels 1.0 features two linear columns of recording sites, which is expected to further simplify algorithmic drift correction relative to the probe variant demonstrated here, which featured two zig-zag columns of recording sites.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe is now commercially available and integrates seamlessly with the existing set of community-supported hardware and software tools for Neuropixels probes. The Neuropixels recording system is straightforward to set up and integrate with other experimental hardware, such as behavior or stimulus control computers. Combining the low total system cost (roughly US$7,000–15,000) and large-scale recordings enables a dramatic reduction in the recording cost per neuron acquired relative to existing technologies.

Although highly capable, these probes are limited in several ways. First, this technology has not been optimized for simultaneous, dense sampling across a wide swath of cortex. For applications requiring horizontal sampling, planar recording technologies like the Utah arrays or 2P imaging may be more appropriate. Second, in contrast with many passive electrodes, it is not currently possible to use the Neuropixels probe to deliver intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), although future versions of the probe may add this functionality. The Neuropixels technology is, however, capable of recording while stimulating through external electrodes, as recently demonstrated by O'Shea et al.15. Third, the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP design is not explicitly optimized for chronic implantation. Although it is probably possible to leave the probe in place over multiple days or sessions, this possible capability remains untested and requires new implant designs. The probe base contains active electronics and is not designed for implantation under dura. As such, a chronic implant design may require mounting the probe in a manner that allows it to mechanically ‘float' with the brain, to prevent relative motion between the probe and the tissue as the brain moves. As such, this probe is most appropriate for acute recordings, although it could conceivably be implanted for subchronic (multiple-week) recordings with appropriate insertion methods and hardware. Last, although it is theoretically possible to insert the entire 45-mm-long shank into the brain, inserting a probe this deep introduces additional practical challenges to overcome—primarily a requirement for precise alignment of the probe's insertion axis with the insertion location.

Taken together, these methodological advances enable new classes of neuroscientific experiments in large animal models and provide a viable scaling path toward recording throughout the whole brain.

All surgical and animal care procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of each institution involved in the study, including Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University.

The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe consists of an integrated base and ‘shank' fabricated as a monolithic piece of silicon using a 130-nm CMOS lithography process. The 6 mm × 9-mm base is mounted to a 7.2 × 23-mm2 printed circuit board (PCB), which is attached to a 7.2 × 40-mm2-long flexible PCB. This flexible PCB plugs into a ZIF connector on a headstage (15 × 16 mm2, 900 mg), which is connected to a PXIe controller mounted in an PXIe chassis using a 5-m twisted-wire cable. The base electronics, headstage, cable, PXIe system and software are identical to the Neuropixels 1.0 probe. Data collection was performed using SpikeGLX software (https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/) and the system is fully compatible with OpenEphys software.

The commercial release of these probes features recording sites distributed in two aligned vertical columns, in contrast to the ‘zig-zag' columns described in the present report, to optimize data collection for automated drift correction and enhance automated spike sorting. A third variant, identical to Neuropixels 1.0 in length, but with a thicker shank (122 µm versus 25 µm), is also now commercially available on special request.

Recording sites are 12 µm × 12 µm, made of titanium nitride and have an impedance of ±150 kΩ at 1 kHz. The tips of the probes were mechanically beveled to a 25° angle using the Narishige EG-402 micropipette beveler. During recordings, electrical measurements were referenced to: (1) the large reference electrode on the tip of the probe; (2) an external electrical reference wire placed within the recording chamber; or (3) a stainless steel guide-tube cannula. Electrical signals are digitized and recorded separately for the action potential band (10 bits, 30 kHz, 5.7 µV mean input-referred noise) and local field potential (LFP) band (10 bits, 2.5 kHz).

Recording sites are programmatically selectable with some constraints on site selection (see Extended Data Fig. 1 for a description of site-selection rules and common configurations). Spike sorting was performed using Kilosort 2.5 and Kilosort 3.0, and results were curated using Phy. Analysis was performed using customized scripts written in Matlab and Python, leveraging the open-source software package neuropixels-utils (https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils).

Several distinct methods were used to mount and insert probes, guided by the unique constraints of inserting probes to different depths and depending on the recording chambers and mechanical access available for different primates used in these studies, as well as the existing hardware used by each of four distinct research groups. For single-probe insertions, probes were mounted using customized adapters to a commercially available probe drive (for example, Narishige, Corp.) and inserted through a blunt guide tube for superficial recordings and a sharp penetrating guide tube for deeper recordings. When using a nonpenetrating guide tube, the dura was typically penetrated with a tungsten electrode before using a Neuropixels probe to create a small perforation in the dura to ease insertion. When inserting probes to deep targets (>20 mm), the alignment between the drive axis and the probe shank is essential for enabling safe insertion, because misalignment can cause the probe to break. For this application, we developed several approaches to maintain precise alignment of the probe and drive axis. First, we employed a linear rail bearing (IKO International) and customized three-dimensional (3D) printed fixture to maintain precise alignment of the insertion trajectory. This approach is discussed in detail in the accompanying Neuropixels 1.0 NHP wiki (https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki).

For the experiments shown in Fig. 4, we developed a dovetail rail system that maintains precise alignment between a penetrating guide tube and the Neuropixels probe. The choice of appropriate insertion method depends on the mechanical constraints introduced by the recording chamber design, the depth of recording targets, number of simultaneous probes required and choice of penetrating or nonpenetrating guide tube. The interaction of these constraints and a more thorough discussion of insertion approaches are provided on the Neuropixels users wiki (https://github.com/cortex-lab/neuropixels/wiki). Open-source designs for mechanical mounting components for Neuropixels 1.0 NHP to drives from Narishige, NAN and other systems are available in a public repository: https://github.com/etrautmann/Neuropixels-NHP-hardware.

To minimize the impact of slow tissue drift during recordings, the Neuropixels probes were often inserted 150–300 µm past the desired target depth, then withdrawn by that amount and allowed to ‘settle' for 30–60 min before beginning an experiment. In addition, for superficial recordings in motor cortex, the probe was inserted through a blunt guide tube that was placed in contact with the dural surface and lowered by a small amount (~500 µm), gently compressing the dura to reduce the tissue motion resulting from pulse and respiratory rhythms.

In vitro noise measurements are performed in the standard, self-referenced configuration as described in the Neuropixels manual, with the reference and ground connected together and to a platinum wire electrode in a saline bath. The noise on each channel is measured by averaging Fourier power spectra from 5× 3-s-long sections of data and estimating the root mean square (r.m.s.) from the integral over 300–1,0000 Hz:

where P is the sum over the frequency range in the power spectrum, fs the sampling frequency and NFFT the number of points in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) calculation. Gain measurements were performed by connecting the probe ground and reference to the Faraday cage ground and a 1-mV, 3-kHz sine wave was applied to the saline bath through a Pt wire electrode. The amplitude of the sine wave on each channel was measured by averaging over a 15-Hz window about the 3-kHz peak in the Fourier power spectrum. Extended Data Fig. 2d shows the mean amplitude over channels versus bank; error bars = 1 s.d.

Two male adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, 11 and 16 kg), monkey T and monkey H, served as experimental subjects. Each animal was surgically implanted with a titanium head post and a cylindrical titanium recording chamber (30-mm diameter). In each animal, the placement of the recording chamber was centered at ~17 mm from the midline and ~7 mm behind ear-bar-zero, and a craniotomy was performed, allowing access to multiple visual areas in the superior temporal sulcus (STS). All surgeries were conducted using aseptic techniques under general anesthesia and analgesics were provided during post-surgical recovery.

We measured visual RFs by randomly presenting a single-probe stimulus out of either a 7 (H) × 11 (V) stimulus grid extending 18 (H) × 30 (V) degrees of visual angles (d.v.a.) (monkey T) or a 14 (H) × 17 (V) stimulus grid extending 26 (H) × 32 (V) d.v.a. (monkey H). The stimulus consisted of a drifting Gabor gratings (2° in diameter, 0.5 cycle per ° in spatial frequency, 4 ° s−1 in speed, 100% Michelson contrast) and was presented for a duration of 0.1 s. Monkeys were rewarded with a drop of juice if they maintained fixating at the fixation spot throughout the trial. Neuropixels data were collected using SpikeGLX. Spike sorting was performed using either Kilosort 2.0 (single-bank recording, monkey T) or Kilosort 3.0 (multi-bank recording, monkey H) and manually curated with Phy. For a given stimulus location, we obtained the neuronal activity by counting all the spikes during the stimulus presentation period, accounted for by a time delay of 50 ms. Neuronal RFs were defined as the stimulus locations that elicited >90% of the peak visual responses.

Details of the pacman behavioral task and experimental hardware presented in Fig. 3 are described in ref. 33. Three monkeys (M. mulatta) served as experimental subjects. In each, a head post and recording chamber were implanted over premotor and primary motor cortex using aseptic surgical procedures and general anesthesia. Placement of the chambers was guided using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The recordings in monkey C were performed using a standard 19-mm plastic recording chamber (Christ, Inc.), whereas monkeys I and J were implanted with customized, low-profile, footed titanium chambers (Rogue Research).

We conducted 13 sessions in monkey C and 10 sessions in monkey I, targeting sulcal and gyral M1 and PMd. On a subset of 15 sessions in monkey C, we also targeted GPi in the basal ganglia. In monkey J, we reported data from one session while simultaneously recording in GPi, SMA and M1.

For monkey C, the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was held using a standard 0.25-inch dovetail mount rod with a customized adapter to mount it to a hydraulic drive (Narishige, Inc.). A 21G blunt guide tube, 25 mm in length, was held using a customized fixture and placed over the desired recording location. The dura was then penetrated with a tungsten electrode (FHC, size E), which was bent at 27 mm to prevent the tip from inserting further than 2 mm past the end of the guide tube. This electrode was inserted manually via forceps, once or several times, as necessary, which also provided feedback on the depth and difficulty in penetrating the dura. The Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was then aligned using the Narishige tower XY stage, lowered into the guide tube and carefully monitored to ensure that the tip of the probe was aligned with the dural penetration. This procedure sometimes took several attempts to find the correct insertion point, but was generally successful in less than a few minutes.

For monkeys I and J, the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe was held using a customized fixture mounted to a linear rail bearing (IKO, Inc.). This apparatus was designed to enable close packing of many probes and to solve the challenge of precisely targeting structures deep in the brain without trial and error. The linear rail is mounted in a customized, 3D printed base, which mounts directly to the recording chamber. The geometry of the 3D printed base component determines the insertion trajectories and prevents mechanical interference between the probes and the chamber. This base also provides support for either sharp or blunt guide tubes, as required. In general, blunt guide tubes were preferred, but if necessary sharp guide tubes were sometimes used when the dura had become thicker and difficult to penetrate. The linear bearing was connected to a commercial drive system (NAN, Inc.) via a ~50-mm-long, 508-mm stainless steel wire, which provided rigid connection between the Nan drive probe mount and the Neuropixels probe mounted on the rail bearing, while allowing a small amount of misalignment between the drive axis and the insertion axis. This apparatus greatly simplifies the procedure of using many probes in a small space, while not relying on commercial drives to provide the mechanical rigidity required to safely insert a delicate probe. Additional details on the customized hardware are provided in the Neuropixels 1.0 NHP user wiki: https://github.com/etrautmann/Neuropixels-NHP-hardware.

Spike sorting was performed using Kilosort 2.5 and manually curated using Phy. Principal component analysis trajectories were calculated after smoothing spikes with a 25-ms Gaussian kernel and averaging across successful trials. Rastermap was run with default parameters after normalizing trial-averaged neural activity. An offline force model prediction performance was computed using a 50-ms time lag between arm force and neural activity. Neurons were randomly subselected and 80% of trials from six target conditions were used to train a linear regression model in Python, using scikit-learn, whereas the remaining 20% of trials were used to calculate model performance. Ten iterations were performed for each level of neurons retained. Probe drift calculations were performed using KS 2.5.

Details of the collection and analysis of the data presented in Fig. 7 are described in ref. 44. Two monkeys (M. mulatta, 8–11 kg) served as experimental subjects. In each, a head post and two recording chambers were implanted using aseptic surgical procedures and general anesthesia. Placement of the LIP chamber was guided by structural MRI. The SC chamber was placed on the midline and angled back 38° from vertical in the anterior–posterior axis. The decision task is a dynamic, random dot motion (RDM) discrimination task. A schematic of the task is displayed in Fig. 7a and its description can be found in the corresponding figure legend. A second (control) task—an oculomotor delayed response task—was used to measure the response fields of neurons in LIP and SC, described in the legend for Fig. 7c.

We conducted eight recording sessions in which activity in the LIP and SC was recorded simultaneously. In the LIP we used a single Neuropixels 1.0 NHP probe, yielding 54–203 single units per session. In the SC, we used 16-, 24- and 32-channel V-probes (Plexon) with 50- to 100-µm electrode spacing, yielding 13–36 single units per session. In each session, we first lowered the SC probe and approximated the RFs of SC neurons using a few dozen trials of a delayed saccade task. As our penetrations were approximately normal to the retinotopic map in the SC, the RFs of the SC neurons were highly similar within a session. We proceeded only if the center of the RFs was at least 7° eccentric to ensure minimal overlap with the motion stimulus.

If the RF locations in the SC were suitable, we then lowered the Neuropixels probe into the LIP through a dura-penetrating, stainless steel guide tube (23G) at 5 µm s−1 using a MEM microdrive (Thomas Recording) that was attached to a chamber-mounted, three-axis micromanipulator. Custom-designed adapters were used for mounting the Neuropixels probe on to the drive (wiki: https://github.com/etrautmann/Neuropixels-NHP-hardware). Once the target depth was reached (~10 mm below the dura), we allowed 15–30 min of settling time to facilitate recording stability. To precisely measure RF locations in both areas, the monkeys performed 100–500 trials of the delayed saccade task and LIP neurons with RFs that overlapped those of the SC neurons were identified post-hoc. Finally, the monkeys performed a reaction-time RDM discrimination task until satiated (typically 1,500–3,000 trials).

Neurons in both areas were sorted using Kilosort 2.0 and manually curated in Phy. We restricted our analysis of the LIP data to neurons with RFs that overlapped those of the simultaneously recorded SC neurons (164 of 1,084 total LIP neurons). Spike trains were discretized into 1-ms bins and convolved with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 25 ms) to produce the single-trial activity traces depicted in Fig. 7d,e.

Two monkeys (M. mulatta) served as experimental subjects. Each animal was surgically implanted with an MRI-compatible Ultem head post and a large rectangular recording chamber (61 at 46-mm diameter, 65 at 50-mm diameter and 58 at 61-mm diameter, respectively), covering most of the animal's acrylic implant. Monkeys were trained to passively fixate on a spot for juice reward while visual stimuli of 5° size, such as images of faces or objects, were presented on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen (Acer). We targeted face patches ML and AF (monkey 1) and face-patch AM (monkey 2) in the IT cortex for electrophysiological recordings. Face patches were identified using functional (f)MRI. Monkeys were scanned in a 3T scanner (Siemens), as described previously56. MION contrast agent was injected to increase the signal:noise ratio. During fMRI, monkeys passively viewed blocks of faces and blocks of other objects to identify face-selective patches in the brain. During electrophysiology, monkeys viewed two stimulus sets: one consisting of the same stimuli shown during fMRI, consisting of faces and nonface objects, with 150 ms of ON time and 150 ms of OFF time (Fig. 4c,e), and a stimulus set consisting of a monkey face alternating with a lemon every second, without any blank period (Fig. 4b).

Before targeting fMRI-identified face patches with Neuropixels probes, we performed scout recordings with tungsten electrodes with 1-MΩ impedance (FHC) using grids designed with the software Planner57. While inserting tungsten electrodes, we performed structural MRI to confirm correct targeting (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we performed a total of 72 Neuropixels insertions. To perform very deep recordings (for example, 42 mm from the craniotomy; Fig. 4d), we lowered a cannula holder to touch or gently push the dura. The cannula holder contained a short cannula to penetrate the dura. A probe holder, which held the probe, was slid through the cannula holder via matching dovetails. This dovetail mechanism was designed to ensure that the direction of probe movement matched the direction of the cannula, because even small differences in angles would risk breakage of the probe when inserted deeply into the cannula. The probe holder was advanced using an oil hydraulic micromanipulator (Narishige), but, importantly, the precise direction of probe movement was constrained by the dovetail between the probe holder and cannula holder rather than the micromanipulator.

Neuropixels data were recorded using SpikeGLX and OpenEphys and spikes were sorted using Kilosort 3.0. To compute responses for Fig. 4c,e, average spike rates from 50 ms to 250 ms after trial onset were computed and baselines, averaged from 0 ms to 50 ms after trial onset, were subtracted.

Functional interactions between pairs of neurons were measured with an established crosscorrelation method. CCGs were calculated using spike trains from pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, during either the whole stimulus presentation period or the intertrial intervals. The CCG is defined as:

where M is the number of trials, N the number of time bins within a trial, \({x}_{1}^{i}\) and \({x}_{2}^{i}\) the spike trains of neurons 1 and 2 from trial i, t is time, τ the time lag relative to the reference spikes and \({\lambda }_{1}\) and \({\lambda }_{2}\) the mean firing rate of the two neurons, respectively. \(\theta (\tau )\) is a triangular function calculated as \(\theta (\tau )=N-\left|\tau \right|\) which corrects for the overlapping time bins at different time lags. A jitter-corrected method was used to remove correlations caused by stimulus locking or slow fluctuations:

where CCGoriginal and CCGjittered are CCGs calculated using the above equation, with the original dataset and the dataset with spike timing randomly perturbed (jittered) within the jitter window, respectively. The correction term (CCGjittered) captured slow correlation longer than the jitter window (caused by common stimulation or slow fluctuation in the population response), so, once it's subtracted, only the fine temporal correlation is preserved. A 25-ms jitter window was chosen based on previous studies6. Only well-isolated single units with a firing rate of at least 1 Hz were included for CCG.

As with previous studies6,13, in the present study a CCG is classified as significant if the peak of jitter-corrected CCG occurred within 10 ms of zero time lag and if this peak is >7 s.d. values above the mean of the noise distribution (CCG flank).

Neuron centroid positions were estimated by computing the 2-d average of the channel locations of channels on which the spike appears (defined by the Kilosort spatial template for that unit), weighted by the amplitude of the spike on each channel. This calculation is performed using the neuropixel-utils library available online (https://github.com/djoshea/neuropixel-utils).

The main purpose of the present report is to demonstrate the technical viability of a new recording technology. For many of the analyses presented here, standard statistical tests were used. The spike–timing correlation analyses used standard approaches that were used in refs. 6,13. For all experiments, animals were trained on the task before any recording. Eight adult male M. mulatta animals were used in the results presented here, with data presented for two animals for each of the four example use cases (multiple visual areas, M1, LIP and IT cortex). No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size for each experiment.

The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment, but the analysis was largely automated, reducing the influence of subjective judgments. In most cases, blinding was not relevant to the technical proofs of concept that we present in this report. Spike sorting was conducted primarily using automated spike-sorting algorithms (Kilosort 2.5 and 3.0), followed by some minimal manual curation and inspection of cluster isolation quality. This manual step was performed by different individuals in different labs, but none of the results presented here are highly sensitive to the individual choices made during spike sorting.

For most experiments, datasets from specific sessions were excluded from further analysis if large-scale probe movement precluded automated spike sorting with Kilosort, but this happened only occasionally and was not a frequent occurrence. The stability recording results presented in Figs. 3–5 are intentionally not statistical arguments, because the stability of any given recording is much more highly determined by the details of the experimental prep and the condition of the implant and tissue. The fraction of datasets with poor recording quality or excessive drift is probably not generalizable to other preparations. Instead, our purpose was to illustrate that highly stable recordings are achievable in multiple brain areas with relative ease. Similarly, we make no statistical claims about the expected yield of neurons recorded on a probe in a given session; instead we present several observed values from these datasets. We feel that this is important because accurate neuron counts remain subjective if manual curation is performed.

How Bird Flu Became a Human Pandemic Threat

The first hints that a new strain of avian illness is emerging could be found on this beach on Delaware Bay, where migrating birds flock. Here's what virus detectives who return there every year know right now.

By Lauren J. Young, Jeffery DelViscio, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Rachel Feltman 

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

H5N1 bird flu has been making a lot of headlines since last year, and for good reason: since March 2024 this subtype of bird flu has infected upwards of 1,000 herds of dairy cattle, raising concerns about the virus's ability to pass between mammals.

This week Science Quickly is doing a three-part deep dive to bring you the latest research on bird flu. From visiting dairy farms to touring cutting-edge virology labs we'll explore what scientists have learned about bird flu—and why it poses such a potential risk to humans.

Today's episode brings us back to the start: the wild flocks where new strains of bird flu evolve and spread. Our host is Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American.

[CLIP: Birds cawing.]

Pamela McKenzie: So many red knots—it's unbelievable.

Lauren Young: Out on Norbury's Landing, a small strip of sandy beach at the southern tip of New Jersey on the Delaware Bay, Pamela McKenzie peers through her binoculars at a massive flock of shorebirds.

McKenzie: It's just, like, a sea of red bellies.

Young: A flurry of different migratory birds, including red knots, ruddy turnstones and sanderlings, are making a pit stop on their long migration up to the Arctic Circle.

The birds are just in sight, and Pam desperately wants to get closer without disturbing them. But there's a problem: the high tide has filled a small channel that's blocking our path.

Young (tape): Wow, there's, like, tons of them over there. That's wild.

McKenzie: Of course, right where we need to go.

Young: So most people go to the beach for the cool waves, the salty breeze and the sunshine. Some might go to collect seashells. But Pam is out here collecting bird poop.

Pamela McKenzie of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital collects avian fecal samples at a beach in Delaware Bay in New Jersey. McKenzie is a virus hunter who has returned to the beaches in the area for years looking for new strains of avian influenza, including H5N1.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Every year in mid-May she hops between the various beaches of Delaware Bay, scooping poop that just might contain avian influenza viruses. By the second day of this year's collection her team had already found samples that came back positive for different bird flu viruses, but not the headline-making H5N1—at least not yet.

McKenzie: What's unique about Delaware Bay is that it's a hotspot for influenza. Every year these birds migrate here, and we find influenza—and different influenza—every year.

Young: Pam is a virus detective. As director of surveillance for the St. Jude Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response she and her fellow research scientists take an annual visit to Delaware Bay. They do this to stay on top of the avian influenza viruses actively circulating in the flocks of migrating shorebirds.

Robert Webster: One of the very important contributions that the laboratory here at St. Jude has made was the realization that influenza in aquatic birds replicates mainly in the intestinal tract and the birds poop it out.

Young: That's Robert Webster. He first visited Delaware Bay in 1985. Robert began St. Jude's influenza surveillance research at the bay, which has continued for the last 40 years.

Webster: Vast quantities of virus [were] in the feces. And so going back to Delaware Bay we didn't have to catch the birds; we simply followed them and took fecal samples from the beach when they pooped.

Young: The reason the shorebirds are here, pooping out a lot of influenza, has to do with the full moon—the first full moon in May, to be exact. The moon's gravitational pull causes the high tides to swell, drawing in thousands of horseshoe crabs, tussling in huge mating piles along the waterline. And the birds know this is the start of the crabs' mating season.

[CLIP: Waves crash on the beach, and birds caw.]

Young: Standing on the shore of Norbury's Landing on a blustery mid-May afternoon, I watched this scene unfold.

Young (tape): So that one is attached and mating.

McKenzie: Yeah, so if she was over here laying eggs, it would be trying to fertilize the eggs, and—like right here: see how its claws are attached to her?

Young: The heavily armored crabs look a bit alien, and sometimes a bit silly, as they draw odd tracks in the sand like uncoordinated Roombas. The ancient arthropods burrow into the sand and lay millions of gelatinous eggs. Those eggs provide the perfect buffet for the migrating birds that need to bulk up before their next leg in their journey.

McKenzie: They're pretty thin though, so they'll be around for a while. They're not nice and fat.

Young: And Pam needs the birds to eat because she needs them to poop.

As time passes and the tide retreats, first the birds swoop in to feast, and then Pam comes in, hot on their trail of droppings. After 15 years of doing this work Pam has developed a special eye for bird poop. She can make a pretty good first guess of what poop belongs to the migratory bird she's most interested in.

McKenzie: Here's one. That's one. It's probably a sanderling, like, small—you know, it's small, so probably a small bird. So this right here, this is so crass [laughs], but it's like a little log, and ruddy turnstones tend to drop logs, so.

Pamela McKenzie inspects a sample on the beach in southern New Jersey. She is collecting bird poop to test for avian influenza.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: Fresh poop is best—damp but not drenched from the tide. This increases the odds it'll contain live virus that can be sequenced back at the lab. Once Pam spots a promising, intact poo she'll use a swab to swiftly scoop the sample from the sand and into a vial.

St. Jude's research center holds a library of more than 20,000 viruses, including isolates of various iterations, or subtypes, of avian influenza collected from Delaware Bay and other locations around the world.

Influenza subtypes are generally classified based on two specific surface proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. They represent the H and the N in flu names you've probably seen, like the common seasonal flu subtypes H1N1 and H3N2.

There are 144 H and N possible combinations of avian influenza. And over the years the St. Jude team has detected nearly every subtype in fecal samples collected at Delaware Bay. That includes the subtype that's been on our minds a lot lately.

Webster: Amongst those was H5N1, indeed, but not from the European or Chinese ones.

Young: The particular shorebirds stopping by Delaware Bay might not be carrying the kind of bird flu that could be dangerous to domestic animals or humans. But with the right genetic mixing we could potentially see outbreaks of a new “killer” strain like the one currently ripping through U.S. farms.

Since 2022 a deadly new strain of H5N1 has infected more than 170 million domestic poultry, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The virus has raised our egg prices, led to the culling of millions of chickens and infected upwards of 1,000 herds of dairy cattle since March 2024.

But to really understand the high-pathogenic H5N1 in our cows and chickens—and where it might go from here—we have to go back in time and look at wild birds.

Pamela McKenzie collects avian fecal samples with a keen eye and Q-tips at a beach in New Jersey.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: Wild birds, particularly aquatic birds, are hosts, or reservoirs, of different influenza viruses. They're categorized as either low-pathogenic or highly pathogenic, depending on how well they cause disease in chickens. A highly pathogenic, or “high-path,” virus, as many influenza researchers like to call it, can wipe out an entire poultry flock in just a few days.

The earliest records of high-path avian influenza are believed to come from the late 1800s, when what was known at the time as “fowl plague” ripped through poultry in Europe. Sporadic spillovers from wild to domestic birds have continued ever since.

Keiji Fukuda: In the influenza field it was clear that there was a very large group of influenza viruses, which infected birds and sometimes infected animals, and then there was a much smaller group of human influenza viruses, which infected people.

Young: That's Keiji Fukuda, a retired physician and influenza epidemiologist who worked for various institutions, including the University of Hong Kong, World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Fukuda: We thought these were separate groups of viruses and that animal influenza viruses did not infect humans.

Young: That changed in 1997, when a previously healthy three-year-old boy in Hong Kong was hospitalized and developed a severe pneumonia. Six days later the boy died. Influenza researchers around the world were called upon to help identify the exact type of virus. Robert was one of them.

Webster: It couldn't be identified at CDC. It couldn't be identified in London or in Holland, where they sent it, and they applied to me for the whole range of influenza virus reference serum, and they identified this virus as an H5, an H5N1. And no one would quite believe that this virus had killed the child.

Young: That shocked scientists and public health leaders, including molecular virologist Nancy Cox. She's retired now but worked at the CDC from 1975 to 2014 and was leading the agency's influenza branch in 1997.

Nancy Cox: We didn't expect to see high-path avian influenza viruses infecting humans. We just didn't expect that. We hadn't seen it before. It was really quite out of left field.

Young: Questions started flying rapid-fire.

Fukuda: How could this boy have become infected?

Cox: Where'd this virus come from? Could it have been a laboratory contaminant from eggs that had come in from an infected farm?

Fukuda: Was this boy associated with any kind of unusual exposures?

Cox: Were there other cases that had yet to be identified in Hong Kong?

Young: Everyone hoped the child was a tragic one-off case. But a few months later their worst fears became a reality: more people developed H5N1 infections.

Keiji, who was also with the CDC at the time and had worked with local public health officials on the ground on the first case, returned to Hong Kong.

[CLIP: A reporter interviews Keiji Fukuda during a 1997 press conference: “[Is there a] possibility this virus could, could become stronger in, in terms of its efficiency?”]

[CLIP: Fukuda responds to the reporter: “Well, by stronger, you mean it could become more adapted to humans and sort of pass through? Yes, there is that possibility.”]

Young: That was younger Keiji back in 1997, talking to a reporter at a press conference in Hong Kong as the outbreak was unfolding.

Fukuda: We're dealing with a virus which has remained persistent for at least some period of time, and we have no idea: “Is this the beginning of another pandemic?” And the investigations took on a whole different flavor. It was very serious.

Young: Keiji says the team eventually determined that the virus seemingly spread through traditional live bird markets, often referred to as wet markets. As is the case in many Asian cultures it is common for people in Hong Kong to purchase fresh poultry, including chicken, duck and goose, that is often killed on-site.

Guided by public health advisers, government officials ordered that the markets suspend sales and get cleaned—and that farms and markets cull all poultry.

Fukuda: At that time it was a very kind of disquieting decision and implementation. You know, we had never before recommended the culling of such a large number of birds.

Young: Although it was a brutal decision for farmers and sellers the tactic worked, effectively squashing an outbreak that seemed on the verge of taking off. By the end of the outbreak six people had died of the 18 with confirmed infections. Thankfully there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, which is key to kick-starting a pandemic.

The genetic sequences of the virus also revealed genes tracing back to its likely reservoir: waterfowl, or geese. Here's Nancy.

Cox: What we saw at the very beginning of the H5N1 outbreak back in 1997 is that the viruses that we identified from poultry and from people were really very, very similar.

Young: But she says a lot has happened since the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak.

Cox: Now we've had this virus circulating globally, and what we're seeing is a huge amount of diversity, and what does that mean? It means that we have a lot more opportunities for the virus to develop the ability to infect humans more efficiently and then eventually, potentially, to become transmissible from human to human.

Young: As H5N1 has fanned across the globe over the years its activity has been a bit like a simmering volcano: occasionally waking up in dramatic spurts, only to go quiet again. And each time it flares up the virus gets a new opportunity to tweak itself—ever so slightly.

Wendy Puryear: During that whole 30-year time period there continued to be ongoing evolution and shifts and changes in the virus.

Young: Wendy Puryear is a scientist studying influenza evolution and adaptation at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University.

Puryear: It's an RNA virus, and that means that it is sloppy in the way that it replicates, so there's constantly slight changes that are being introduced every time that virus goes through a replication cycle.

Young: Wendy's research at Tufts focuses on the surveillance of different subtypes of influenza and wildlife. She's been watching with increasing unease how changes, or mutations, are creating a vast diversity of H5N1 viruses—including ones that might be better at infecting different animals.

Puryear: Prior to the COVID pandemic the thing that many of us were very concerned would be the next pandemic of large impact on human health was influenza. So this is one that we've been worried about for a long time.

Young: Wendy says H5N1 keeps hitting mutation milestones that are getting too close for comfort.

Puryear: We keep going further down that road of “at least it hasn't.”

“At least it hadn't gone into a lot of wild animals and was disseminating around the globe.”

Young: Now lineages of the virus have been detected in animals in nearly every continent. H5N1 has established itself in domestic poultry in various countries in Asia, the Middle East, the Americas, Africa and Europe.

And [starting] a few years ago the number of bird species carrying H5N1 has ballooned. More than 500 different avian species, ranging from seabirds to songbirds, have tested positive for H5N1, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Puryear: “Well, now it is. Well, at least it wasn't going into mammals.”

Young: Then around 2020 and 2021 highly pathogenic H5N1 started to infect different mammals, to date affecting more than 90 different species in total, including coyotes, minks, opossums, skunks and rodents.

The virus had previously been found in the occasional fox or tiger, typically predators that might've eaten an infected wild bird. But the list of newly infected mammal species is growing in a way that hasn't been seen before.

Pruyear: “At least there wasn't evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission.” Well, then we had that in marine mammals in South America.

Young: In 2022 and 2023 the virus spread among various marine animals along the coast of Peru and Chile, killing more than 30,000 sea lions. It happened so rapidly that scientists suspected it must have traveled directly between animals.

The virus made its way around to the Atlantic coast. Groups of dolphins, porpoises and otters were also infected.

Puryear: “Well, at least it's not in a context that we're in close proximity between humans and those mammals.” Well, now it's in dairy cattle.

Young: No one expected the virus to hit U.S. dairy cows. How it got onto farms in the first place is still a bit of a mystery; you'll hear a lot more about that in the next episode of this three-part series. But it's important to say that scientists do have a strong hunch about how the virus made that jump—and you probably guessed it: wild birds.

Louise Moncla: There's this whole diversity of low-path viruses that don't really cause as many problems that circulate endemically in these wild birds in North America.

Young: That's Louise Moncla. She's a pathobiologist leading a lab at the University of Pennsylvania that's building a family tree of avian influenza viruses.

Moncla: Through this process called reassortment this incurring kind of new virus that entered started mixing with those viruses, and so we now have this diverse mixture of viruses sort of circulating in wild birds, resulting in the emergence of these new genotypes ...

Young: New genotypes, or unique genetic profiles, like the high-path H5N1 that scientists think started infecting dairy cows. This genetic mixing, or reassortment of different influenza viruses, occurs when they co-infect one host: a bird, an animal or, worse, a human. That opens up the window for genetic information to be exchanged.

Here's Wendy again to unpack a bit of what Louise said.

Puryear: Not only do you have this regular evolution that happens with the virus being sloppy in how it replicates, but the fact that it has its genome on separate pieces, its genetic information is actually—those genes are on separate chunks of, of RNA, and that means that it can take a whole gene and swap it out with a different form of influenza, so that gives a whole new kinda Frankenstein version of the virus that can then move forward.

Young: And this process of virus info swapping can potentially spiral into something much bigger—and deadlier.

Here's Louise again.

Moncla: Reassortment is a really important process for influenza evolution because it has led to every past pandemic that we know about. So we usually get influenza pandemics when viruses from two different species mix via reassortment and [that] results in a virus for which a host population like humans doesn't have any prior immunity.

Young: But those viral swap meets leave footprints—clues that help researchers like Wendy and Louise track influenza evolution through time and space. Louise's flu family tree models, for instance, allow for real-time tracking of noteworthy genetic changes in H5N1. The tree's branches show small shifts from the virus's sloppy reproduction and the big evolutionary leaps from reassortment.

Moncla: If you sample and sequence those viral genomes, you can use those mutations to link cases together. So these genomes provide this nice little map of how this virus has been moving between different host species or populations or geographic areas.

Young: And wild birds help paint a picture of where the virus might be now and where it might go next. These feathered virus carriers have effectively moved influenza around the world and into our domesticated animals.

But Louise, Wendy, Nancy, Keiji and folks at St. Jude are all quick to say that migrating birds and wildlife shouldn't be blamed for H5N1's current stronghold—it's the way that humans monitor and respond to the situation.

Moncla: Now that these viruses are really being driven by transmission of wild birds we need to understand how these viruses evolve in wild birds a lot better. And so something I'm really hoping continues to happen is surveillance in wild birds. You know, so without this kind of continuous surveillance effort in wild birds we wouldn't have been able to understand the outbreak in dairy cattle or these human spillovers and where they're coming from.

Young: Wild birds can't be stopped, but they can be watched—just like how the St. Jude group is surveying the shorebirds at Delaware Bay, year after year.

[CLIP: Birds caw.]

Young: Back in Delaware Bay, armed with vials of bird poop and a compact scientific camper van, another virus hunter is doing exactly that.

Lisa Kercher: My name is Lisa Kercher. I am the director of laboratory operations for the Webby Lab group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, which is a—our lab group is a large influenza research laboratory.

Young (tape): Great, and tell us where we are right now.

Kercher: Yes, we're sitting in a 19-foot toy hauler that is a trailer camper that has been built out to work as a molecular biology lab.

Lisa Kercher, the director of laboratory operations for the Webby Lab group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, stands in the doorway of her converted camper that she has retrofitted as a mobile avian influenza testing laboratory. Next to her is her trusty lab assistant, Jax, a Labrador Retriever.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: Lisa lives part time in her truck and camper, living and sleeping alongside carefully stored poop samples preserved in cold liquid nitrogen. The space is a cozy fit for the two of us and her sweet English Labrador retriever, Jax.

Like a lot of campers it's got a small kitchen, bathroom and a very comfortable bed, according to Lisa, but she's customized the space with a makeshift lab bench.

Kercher: I have like already shattered the door once and had to have it replaced.

Young (tape): No...!

Young: Her working area is stocked with protective gear, reagents, pipettes, well plates and a variety of miniature equipment, including a PCR machine that can quickly amplify DNA from samples Pam collected the day before.

Kercher: It can then immediately run a PCR for flu and for H5, and I know on my little laptop here if that's positive within about an hour. And so by the time I'm driving home I have the prevalence of the flu that was in these shorebirds for the time I was here. So it's a great first step.

Young: At that point in site collecting she had processed 250 fecal samples. By the end of the week the team will have collected 1,000. Later the samples will be transported to St. Jude's main labs in Tennessee to verify Lisa's initial readings.

Before she started doing this real-time surveillance work two years ago, the team wouldn't know what avian influenza subtypes they had on their hands until about six months after the sample collections.

Kercher: It's very hard to do epidemiology of how the virus is moving and tracking when you spend six months waiting for the sequence to come out of a national lab or any big lab. It's just hard logistically to then backtrack and figure that out. You can do it, but it's usually a year later. And then you are usually faced with a whole different virus by that time. So the point of doing it faster is so that you can do risk assessment in more real time.

Young: But if Lisa wants to be really fast, she needs more data. The poo samples from the beach are valuable sources of viral sequences, but they can't offer the full flu picture.

Kercher: So when you get a flu virus from a fecal sample you have to give it a name, you have to same say the species that it came from. How do you know?

Young: Like solving any mystery the researchers want to answer the big whodunit—or in this case, who-dung-it.

Knowing the exact bird species that pooed the poo requires more testing and more time, and it's not something that she can do from inside the camper lab. That's why Lisa is teaming up with local wildlife ecologists. Enter Larry Niles and his bird-catching cannon.

Young (tape): So what do we have here today? What, what are we looking at with the, the little squeaking noises we've got going on?

Larry Niles: Most of those noises are from the sanderling. We caught almost 100 sanderlings.

Young (tape): Wow.

Niles: We caught a handful of [red] knots and ruddy turnstones.

Larry Niles holds a sanderling that is about to be weighed and measured and sampled at a beach in Delaware Bay in New Jersey.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Young: The day before visiting the mobile lab I was on the beach with Lisa and Larry. He co-leads the Delaware Bay Shorebird Project with Wildlife Restoration Partnerships. Larry has been catching shorebirds here as part of his conservation work for the last 29 years. And yes, his group uses something called a cannon net to nab these birds because ...

Niles: See, shorebirds very difficult to catch because they're hard to get close to because they're used to being out on flats like sand flats. Today we used two cannon, and see, the advantage of that is: the net, which is about 40 feet [roughly 12 meters] long, when we hook it up to the cannons, that net goes so fast that it gets over the birds before they have the time to react.

Young: The birds are temporarily corralled in cloth-covered boxes, waiting for Larry and the other researchers and volunteers to gently pull them out to collect various data points. They'll measure the birds' wings and beaks, weigh them and take a blood and feather sample before they're released back to the horseshoe-crab-egg feast on the beach.

And though Larry has his own research to do on the ecology of the birds—their health, their population numbers and what might threaten those things—he says it's a real bonus to have virus detectives like Pam and Lisa to work with, side by side.

Niles: I'm not a virologist; I'm an ecologist. But I understand the ecology of things, and I think melding the ecology of birds with the ecology of these viruses, that's our part—working with the virologists so that together we could figure it out.

Young: For Lisa, getting access to the shorebirds directly unlocks all sorts of crucial information.

Kercher: So, when you're getting the samples straight from the birds then you already know the species, so that just makes it a little bit easier.

Young: And it's along these migratory routes, called flyways, where the birds, the ecologists and the virologists with camper labs need to meet.

Kercher: When the avian virus jumps into a mammal it has the opportunity to mutate into becoming more mammalianlike, and that is why we are so concerned in the flyway.

Young: There are four main flyways, [also] called avian superhighways, that run through North America. Since getting her mobile lab up and running Lisa has driven it thousands of miles up and down these flyways to sites in Alberta, Canada, and northwest Tennessee. But these avian superhighways have also become increasingly concerning for H5N1.

Lisa Kercher, the director of laboratory operations for the Webby Lab group at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, works in her converted camper on avian fecal samples.

Jeffery DelViscio/Scientific American

Kercher: Those birds are carrying this virus in greater numbers and in lots more areas where there's potential for spillover into domestic poultry farms. And of course, this happened in the dairy farms—it spilled over into the cattle, so this virus is now very prevalent all over North America. But the flyways are important because the birds that carry it are moving quickly down the flyway in a very short period of time, and you have a lot of opportunity for spillover there.

Young: Lisa says that speed matters for a rapidly changing virus like H5N1. She could imagine her mobile lab getting scaled up into a large biosurveillance network: multiple satellite labs dotted up and down all the flyways, relaying genetic sequences to other influenza trackers like Louise and Wendy but also to farmers on the ground trying to keep their chickens and cows healthy.

Kercher: Wouldn't it be great if the farmer had a way to go on his computer and look at a dashboard and say, “Wow, I wonder where the flu is?” They need to know where it is circulating in the wild birds. And if they knew where it was ahead of time—or at least where it was coming from—they would have an opportunity, if they chose, to up their biosecurity a little bit.

Young: Until then virus detectors like Pam and Lisa continue to keep a watchful eye on the surprising twists and turns of H5N1, looking to the birds and the clues they leave behind.

Kercher: We'll never catch up with Mother Nature. We're never gonna catch up with the virus and how it mutates. But if we can get closer and approach it more, you can then look for mutations, much quicker things that make the virus resistant to antivirals or things that make it more mammalian adaptable. You would wanna know that sooner rather than later.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode, but there's lots more to come. Tune in on Wednesday for part two of our special series on bird flu, which explores how avian influenza made its unprecedented leap into cattle.

Metrics details

Chemotherapies are often given without precision biomarkers, exposing patients to toxic side effects without guaranteed benefit. Here we present chromosomal instability signature biomarkers that identify resistance to platinum-, taxane- and anthracycline-based treatments using a single genomic test. In retrospectively emulated randomized-control biomarker clinical trials using real-world cohorts (n = 840), predicted resistant patients had elevated treatment failure risk for taxane (hazard ratio (HR) of 7.44) and anthracycline (HR of 1.88) in ovarian, taxane (HR of 3.98) and anthracycline (HR of 3.69) in metastatic breast and taxane (HR of 5.46) in metastatic prostate. Nonrandomized emulations showed predictive capacity for platinum resistance in ovarian (HR of 1.46) and anthracycline in sarcoma (HR of 3.59). We demonstrate feasibility using whole-genome sequencing, capture-panel sequencing and cell-free DNA. Our findings highlight the clinical value of chromosomal instability signatures in predicting resistance to chemotherapies across multiple cancer types, with the potential to transform the one-size-fits-all chemotherapy approach into precise, tailored treatment.

Cytotoxic chemotherapies exploit the defective properties of a cancer cell, such as impaired DNA repair mechanisms, to preferentially drive cancer cells to programmed cell death1. Chemotherapies also have detrimental effects on healthy cells, potentially causing severe side effects despite administration alongside modern-day supportive care2. Many of these agents were approved for clinical use before the adoption of therapy selection biomarkers, which is in contrast to new targeted therapies that increasingly require the presence of companion diagnostic tests to guide treatment selection3. Identifying inherent resistance to these agents could allow patients to avoid unnecessary side effects and receive an alternative therapy, ultimately improving overall health outcomes. Furthermore, precision use of cytotoxics could reduce healthcare costs by lowering expenditure on ineffective cancer therapies and additional medical interventions for treatment-related complications.

Before adoption in the clinic, therapy selection biomarkers must undergo clinical performance and utility evaluation4. Ideally, these evaluations are done using a prospective randomized-control biomarker trial. In these cases, treatment is randomized across each of the biomarker positive and negative groups and the performance is evaluated within each group5. This ‘phase 3 biomarker trial' design, while determining both the predictive performance and clinical utility of the biomarker, usually requires a large (and sometimes impractical) number of patients. As such, alternative designs with smaller patient numbers can be used, which trade off the capacity to assess either predictive performance or clinical utility. For instance, enrichment designs only randomize across one biomarker arm, eliminating the ability to assess utility in the other arm6. Single treatment arm or ‘phase 2 biomarker trials', where all patients receive the experimental treatment and differences in outcome are compared between biomarker positive and negative groups, requires the smallest number of patients, but does not truly determine whether the biomarker is predictive or prognostic7.

Considering the often prohibitive financial costs and burden of patient suffering associated with running a randomized-control trial (RCT), there has been a shift toward retrospective analysis of existing trial data for biomarker evaluations8. For new therapies, real-world data9 have also been used to emulate trials10 to seek approvals11,12. As chemotherapies are ubiquitous in cancer treatment, there is an exciting opportunity to combine existing methodologies of real-world emulation with accepted biomarker trial designs to emulate phase 2 and phase 3 biomarker trials.

We have recently developed a class of biomarker, chromosomal instability (CIN) signatures, that has the potential to predict therapy response13,14. As the full spectrum of signatures can be quantified in a tumor using a single genomic test, we hypothesize that CIN signatures might be used to predict resistance to multiple chemotherapies at diagnosis. Here, we present three CIN signature-based biomarkers for predicting resistance to treatment with platinum-based chemotherapies, taxanes and anthracyclines. We use real-world cohorts totaling 840 patients to emulate phase 2 and phase 3 biomarker trials for clinical performance evaluation. Finally, we show the feasibility of calling these biomarkers on targeted-capture gene panel sequencing of tumor tissue and shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) of plasma.

The presence of CIN in a tumor has long been recognized to contribute to chemotherapy sensitivity15. The opposite also holds true, where tumors with stabilizing genomes tend to be resistant16. In a recent proof-of-principle study, we showed that CIN signatures can further refine treatment response prediction, identifying patients resistant to platinum-based chemotherapies13. Here, we aimed to reformulate and extend these biomarkers as predictors of chemotherapy resistance across multiple tumor types.

First, we constructed a biomarker of resistance to platinum treatment. Initially, we apply our CIN signature framework to determine tumors with and without detectable CIN. Those tumors without CIN are classified as resistant. For tumors with CIN, similar to our original study13, we use a ratio of two signatures of impaired homologous recombination (IHR), where CX2 > CX3 indicates resistance (Fig. 1a). This is based on observations that CX2 represents a type of IHR that does not confer sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies, whereas CX3 does13. This sensitivity is based on a principle of synthetic lethality, where cells with CX3-based IHR cannot tolerate the damage introduced by platinum treatment. A critical step to enable application of this classifier to multiple tumor types is the computation of a robust scaling model for the signatures. Here, we compute a multitumor-type scaling using all BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant cases present in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1a). This scaling shows improved overall survival prediction for patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapies when applied to an esophageal cohort from the original study13 (Fig. 1b).

Samples with at least one of the three amplification-related signatures (CX8/CX9/CX13) showing an activity higher than the optimal threshold were predicted as resistant.

Next, we built a biomarker of taxane resistance using IHR signature CX5, which was previously shown to be correlated with paclitaxel response in vitro13, again under the principle of synthetic lethality (Supplementary Table 1). As with the platinum biomarker, samples without CIN are considered resistant. For samples with CIN, we sought an optimal threshold on CX5 signature activity to classify a sample as resistant (Fig. 1c). To do this, we used 287 cell lines treated with paclitaxel and explored a range of signature values to find the optimal activity threshold to separate cells based on the area under the dose response curve (AUC) density (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1). To ensure multitumor-type applicability, we scaled signature activities across the whole TCGA, resulting in an optimal threshold of z score-scaled signature activity of CX5 < 0 to classify a tumor sample as resistant (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Finally, as anthracyclines are widely used across multiple tumor types, we sought a biomarker of resistance to anthracycline treatment. Like many other genotoxic chemotherapies, anthracyclines can cause DNA damage resulting in extrachromosomal DNA encapsulated in micronuclei17. When micronuclei rupture and release their contents into the cytoplasm, this can trigger the activation of cGAS–STING signaling, resulting in proinflammatory signaling through type I interferon18. It has also been established that such immune system activation is crucial for the success of anthracycline treatments19. However, how tumors resist anthracycline treatment is less well known. Tumors exposed to chronic cGAS–STING activation have been shown to undergo a switch to noncanonical NF-κB signaling, ultimately promoting metastasis and immune evasion20. Therefore, it is possible that tumors resistant to anthracyclines may tolerate the ongoing formation of micronuclei via this switching mechanism. This switching mechanism is seen as an important bottleneck during tumor evolution18 and may represent a vital distinction between anthracycline sensitive and resistant tumors. As the amplified DNA commonly found in micronuclei can be incorporated back into the genome as homogeneously staining regions21, it may be possible to identify tumors that have survived this evolutionary bottleneck from their genomes. CIN signatures CX8, CX9 and CX13 represent focal amplifications linked to extrachromosomal DNA13,14. We therefore hypothesized they could be used to identify micronuclei-tolerant, and thus anthracycline-resistant, tumors. Indeed, we found the presence of these signatures in ovarian cell lines to be associated with reduced micronuclei formation capacity, suggesting the presence of tolerance mechanisms (Supplementary Note 1).

Therefore, we sought to construct a predictor where the presence of any of these three signatures would indicate resistance to anthracycline treatment (Fig. 1e). To estimate optimal thresholds for these signatures, we used a cohort of 8 patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids and 15 primary tumor spheroids isolated from ascites and treated with the anthracycline doxorubicin in vitro (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). Signature activity was computed from sWGS of the organoids and spheroids before treatment and treatment response was estimated using the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50). Samples were ranked by IC50 and labeled as sensitive or resistant based on the expected number of sensitive samples given the observed sensitivity to first-line platinum treatment in the donor patients (platinum-resistant patients are expected to have an 18% response rate to doxorubicin monotherapy22,23,24,25,26,27,28, whereas sensitive patients have a 28% response rate29). A threshold of 0.01 for CX8, and 0.009 for CX9 and CX13 showed optimal classification of the patient-derived models (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Note 1).

To test the performance of these resistance biomarkers in a clinic-like setting, we wanted to see whether we could use real-world data. To determine the feasibility of this strategy, we assembled a cohort of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). HGSOC is an ideal test bed as all three chemotherapies (platinum based, taxanes and anthracyclines) are routinely used to treat patients. Here, we aimed to emulate three different phase 2 single-arm biomarker trials using 50 patients from the OV04 study where we could assess biomarker performance after first-line platinum treatment, post-first-line anthracycline treatment and post-first-line taxane treatment (Extended Data Figs. 2–4, Supplementary Figs. 2–4 and Supplementary Table 3).

For each patient, we sequenced tumor material collected at diagnosis using sWGS, derived copy number profiles and applied our three classifiers. Then, if eligible, patients were included in the emulation of a phase 2 biomarker trial, with a single-arm study design where all patients received the chemotherapy of interest (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or older, confirmed HGSOC, had progression free survival (PFS) intervals measurable by CA125 using the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria30,31 and recorded tumor stage. The primary objective of the trial emulation was to test the biomarker's ability to predict resistance with an endpoint of CA125-based PFS.

For each of the three emulations, we considered patients who received treatment lines containing first-line platinum-based chemotherapies, post-first-line taxanes and post-first-line anthracyclines. Treatment lines were accepted that were either monotherapy or given in combination with other treatments. Predicted resistant and sensitive arms were compared using Cox proportional-hazards models, correcting for tumor stage, age at diagnosis, treatment line (for taxane), general aneuploidy (via the weighted genome instability index (wGII)) and whether the patient received maintenance therapy (during first-line treatment or before treatment with taxane or anthracycline). We defined maintenance therapies as either niraparib, olaparib, bevacizumab or letrozole. For taxane and anthracycline treatments, eligibility criteria and survival analysis design was given careful consideration to control for the effects of first-line platinum-free interval on treatment response at second line32 (see Supplementary Note 2 for details).

The 22 (out of 45) patients predicted as platinum resistant showed significantly increased risk of progression after treatment with platinum (hazard ratio (HR) of 2.340, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.155–4.742, P = 0.0183; Fig. 2a). The 17 (out of 29) patients predicted as taxane resistant also showed significantly increased risk of progression after treatment post-first-line with taxane (HR of 6.567, 95% CI 1.489–28.957, P = 0.013; Fig. 2b). Finally, the 13 (out of 30) patients predicted as anthracycline resistant showed increased risk of progression after treatment with anthracycline post-first-line (HR of 20.020, 95% CI 1.059–378.635, P = 0.010; Fig. 2c). For all analyses, the significance level for detecting an effect was 0.05.

PFS was used as the endpoint. All analyses were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. An asterisk denotes significant results. Dots and error bars represent the HR and its 95% CI, respectively. Multiple testing correction was not applied as each combination of biomarker and cohort is unique.

Since the pilot study confirmed that retrospective real-world data can be used to test performance, we sought orthogonal validation using additional real-world data to emulate either phase 3 RCTs (Extended Data Fig. 5b), phase 3 RCT enrichment trials (Extended Data Fig. 5c) or phase 2 single-arm trials (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

To achieve this, we assembled a series of pan-cancer real-world retrospective cohorts33,34 consisting of patients with primary or metastatic disease who were treated with one of the chemotherapies of interest or with an alternate standard of care (SoC), had clinical response data enabling time to treatment failure (TTF) calculation and had sufficient quality genomic data to compute CIN signatures. To identify which cohorts were powered for phase 3 or phase 2 analysis, we used the HRs determined from the pilot study, alongside censoring and prediction ratio data from the cohorts, to carry out calculations for a one-tailed power analysis with a power of 0.8 and a significance level of 0.05 (Supplementary Table 4). Cohorts that had sufficient sample sizes to meet the power requirements were then taken forward for analysis (summarized in Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). We were sufficiently powered to perform phase 3 emulation assessments for patients with relapsed ovarian, metastatic breast and metastatic prostate cancer treated with taxanes, and patients with relapsed ovarian and metastatic breast treated with anthracyclines. We were sufficiently powered to perform phase 2 emulation assessments (but not phase 3) for patients with primary ovarian cancer treated with platinum and sarcoma treated with anthracyclines.

In the phase 3 RCT emulations, patients were classified as resistant or sensitive to the chemotherapy of interest based on our biomarkers. Within these sensitive or resistant groups, patients were then retrospectively assigned to the experimental arm (treated with the chemotherapy of interest) or to the control arm (treated with an appropriate SoC therapy). Inverse probability weighting was applied to account for potential treatment selection biases across patients due to year of treatment/biopsy. The experimental and control arms were then compared using Cox proportional-hazards models for both the predicted resistant and predicted sensitive populations, with TTF as the primary endpoint.

In the phase 2 single-arm emulations, patients that were treated with the chemotherapy of interest were classified as resistant or sensitive based on our biomarkers, then these groups were compared using a Cox proportional-hazards model with TTF as the primary endpoint.

Prediction of resistance to platinum-based treatment in primary HGSOC was assessed using a cohort of 352 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over, had grade 3 and stage III/IV cancer, with no requirement for measurable disease (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0). Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model by age at diagnosis (<65 or ≥65 years) and controlling for tumor stage (III or IV). Patients predicted as platinum resistant showed significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with those patients classified as sensitive (HR of 1.459, 95% CI 1.121–1.899, P = 0.0049; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5).

The limited sample size precluded us from correcting the model by other clinical covariates. All analyses were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. An asterisk denotes significant results. The dots and error bars represent the HR and its 95% CI, respectively. Multiple testing correction was not applied as each combination of biomarker and cohort is unique. Inverse probability weighting was applied in all analyses to account for treatment selection biases across patients due to year of treatment/biopsy.

Prediction of resistance to taxane-based treatment in relapsed HGSOC was assessed across a cohort of 112 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Eligibility criteria, trial design and survival analysis were given careful consideration to control for the effects of first-line platinum-free interval on treatment response at second line32 (Supplementary Note 2). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over, had grade 3 and stage III/IV cancer, with no requirement for measurable disease. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of taxane treatment post-first line. Patients were assigned to the control arm if they received treatment containing any of the five most common non-taxane- and non-platinum-based therapies, being doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, topotecan and vinorelbine. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using stratified Cox proportional-hazards models by age at diagnosis (<65 or ≥65 years), including an interaction between first-line TTF and treatment group (see Supplementary Note 2 for details).

In patients predicted to be resistant, the use of taxane-based treatment resulted in significantly higher risk of treatment failure compared with the SoC treatment (HR of 7.435, 95% CI 3.967–20.458, P = 0.0003; Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting predicted resistant patients do not derive benefit from taxane treatment. By contrast, the predicted sensitive patients showed no significant difference in TTF between the experimental and control arms (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 7). This is in agreement with previous studies reporting comparable response among different chemotherapies after first-line treatment35. We found similar results when restricting the analysis to patients receiving single-agent taxane treatments, indicating that the differences in TTF between the experimental and control arms were not caused by the co-therapy administered (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9).

The prediction of resistance to anthracycline-based treatment in HGSOC was conducted in a cohort of 115 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over and had grade 3 and stage III/IV cancer. There was no requirement for measurable disease. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of anthracycline and patients were assigned to the control arm if they received treatment containing any of the five most common non-anthracycline- and non-platinum-based therapies, being gemcitabine, vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide, taxane and topotecan. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using stratified Cox proportional-hazards models by age at diagnosis (<65 or ≥65 years) and controlling for platinum sensitivity (≤6 months or >6 months first-line TTF).

In patients predicted to be resistant, the use of anthracycline-based treatment resulted in significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with the SoC treatment (HR of 1.881, 95% CI 1.029–3.439, P = 0.040; Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 10). By contrast the predicted sensitive analyses showed no significant difference in TTF between the experimental and control arms (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 11). Similar results were found restricting to single-agent anthracycline treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13).

Prediction of resistance to anthracycline-based treatment in sarcoma was assessed across 27 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or over with no requirement for measurable disease. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model controlling for the presence of isophosphamide as a co-therapy36. Tumor stage annotation was not available for this cohort and so was not included in the analysis. Patients predicted to be resistant demonstrated a significantly increased risk of treatment failure when they received anthracycline-based treatment compared with those predicted as sensitive (HR of 3.591, 95% CI 1.193–10.811, P = 0.023; Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 14).

Prediction of resistance to taxane-based treatment was conducted in a cohort of 238 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or over and had presented with metastatic tumors. Treatment lines were only considered if they occurred immediately after a biopsy event. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of taxane or to the control arm if they had received any of the five most common non-taxane therapies given within the cohort: abiraterone, enzalutamide, olaparib, pembrolizumab or radium-223. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using Cox proportional-hazards models controlling for age at diagnosis (46–85 years). Tumor stage annotation was not available for this cohort.

Patients predicted to be resistant demonstrated a significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with SoC (HR of 5.462, 95% CI 2.189–13.628, P = 0.0003; Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 15), while no significant differences were detected between treatment arms for patients predicted to be sensitive (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 16). Similar results were observed when limiting the analyses to single-agent taxane treatment (Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18).

Gleason grade was not available for correction. b,c, Cox proportional-hazards regression models showing TTF in metastatic breast patients predicted as resistant to taxane (b) and anthracycline (c). Regression models were controlled for age at diagnosis. The limited sample size in the anthracycline-sensitive arm precluded us from performing a survival analysis. All analyses were evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. An asterisk denotes significant results. The dots and error bars represent the HR and its 95% CI, respectively. Multiple testing correction was not applied as each combination of biomarker and cohort is unique. Inverse probability weighting was applied in all analyses to account for treatment selection biases across patients due to year of treatment/biopsy.

Prediction of resistance to taxane-based treatment was conducted across 134 patients with metastatic breast cancer (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years or over and had presented with metastatic tumors. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of taxane and to the control arm if they received gemcitabine or capecitabine, in some cases in combination with bevacizumab, vinorelbine, gemcitabine or carboplatin. Patients were not included if they received hormone therapies. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using a Cox proportional-hazards model controlling for age at diagnosis (33–80 years).

Patients predicted to be resistant demonstrated a significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with SoC (HR of 3.976, 95% CI 1.196–13.219, P = 0.024; Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 19), while no significant differences were detected in survival time between the treatment arms for patients predicted to be sensitive (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 20).

The prediction of resistance to anthracycline-based treatment in breast cancer was conducted in a cohort of 108 patients (Supplementary Table 5). Patients were considered eligible if they were 18 years of age or over and had stage III/IV cancer with no requirement for measurable disease. Patients were assigned to the experimental arm if they received at least three cycles of anthracycline-based treatment and assigned to the control arm if they received treatment containing any of the five most common non-anthracycline therapies, being bevacizumab, vinorelbine, gemcitabine or carboplatin. Statistical analysis of the cohort was performed using Cox proportional-hazards models controlling for age at diagnosis.

Patients predicted to be resistant showed significantly increased risk of treatment failure compared with SoC (HR of 3.685, 95% CI 1.866–7.277, P = 0.0002; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 21). We were not powered to determine performance in the predicted sensitive group, thus this emulation is considered to have an enrichment design (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

In the analyses presented here, our CIN signature biomarkers were determined using copy number profiles derived from either deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or sWGS, or Affymetrix SNP6 arrays. However, these assays are not yet routine in clinical practise. Comprehensive capture gene panels currently dominate the diagnostic DNA testing landscape in oncology. Therefore, we wanted to assess the feasibility of using the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO500) assay to apply our resistance classifications. In addition, we also assessed the feasibility of using sWGS from liquid biopsies collected at the time of diagnosis. For eight tumors in the Cambridge Translational Cancer Research Ovarian Study 04 (OV04) pilot study with greater than 40% tumor purity, we performed profiling of the same DNA aliquot as the sWGS using the TSO500 assay; and for 29 patients, plasma samples were used to extract cell-free DNA, which underwent sWGS (Extended Data Table 3).

For samples profiled with the TSO500 assay, the copy number profiles derived showed a median percentage of genome-wide copy number difference of 16% (Supplementary Fig. 22). CIN signatures computed across these samples showed a median cosine similarity with the matched sWGS of 0.92 (Fig. 5a). Applying our classifiers showed 93% concordance, with only one sample given a prediction that did not match the sWGS-based prediction (Fig. 5b).

Only tissue biopsies from patients with high-quality sWGS-derived copy number profiles that met the inclusion criteria were also sequenced with TSO500. A cosine similarity close to 1 indicates similar activities between sample-matched data. b, A contingency table showing the number of patients predicted as sensitive or resistant using our signature-based clinical classifiers in tumor samples sequenced by sWGS and TSO500. c, A bar plot showing signature activities in matched tumor tissue (T) and plasma (P) samples from the same patient.

A cosine similarity close to 1 indicates similar activities between patient-matched biopsies. d, A contingency table showing the number of patients predicted as sensitive or resistant using our signature-based clinical classifiers in tumor tissue and plasma biopsies. The numbers in gray boxes represent the patient IDs.

For cell-free DNA samples, DNA copy number profiles were generated and samples were categorized based on their circulating tumor DNA fraction as either low or high. Of the 29 patients who had plasma samples available, 9 samples (31%) were considered to have high circulating tumor DNA fraction and were subjected to CIN signature analysis. The remaining plasma samples had insufficient overall tumor DNA to assess CIN using the currently available CIN signature methods. Between plasma and tumor tissue pairs, the median percentage of genome-wide copy number difference was 20.8% (Supplementary Fig. 23), and activity levels of CIN signatures had a median cosine similarity of 0.90 (Fig. 5c). Resistance classification for relevant therapies across the patients showed 83.3% concordance (Fig. 5d), with two patients showing alternate predictions for platinum and one patient for taxane. These results suggest that for approximately 31% of patients with ovarian cancer, our predictors may be applied using a simple blood test, without the need for a tumor biopsy or a surgical specimen, although testing over larger cohorts is necessary.

In this study, we demonstrate the potential for CIN signature biomarkers to predict resistance to multiple chemotherapies. Previous approaches have largely focused on platinum-based chemotherapies and rely on cell culture or gene expression assays37,38. However, these tests have failed to reach widespread adoption in the clinic. The OncotypeDX recurrence score is the only test to have been widely adopted; however, it is not a direct test for chemotherapy response, rather it determines whether a patient will be adequately managed with hormone therapies alone (compared with a combination with chemotherapy)39. Homologous recombination deficiency tests such as Myriad myChoice or HRDetect may also have the potential to predict response to platinum-based treatment40. However, these do not appear to perform as well as our CIN signature biomarkers (Supplementary Note 3). The ability to predict resistance to multiple chemotherapies from a single genomic assay is thus a unique offering.

Our analysis encompassed three common chemotherapies, platinum-based, taxanes and anthracyclines. When testing the performance of our biomarkers we leveraged real-world data to retrospectively emulate phase 3 RCTs. However, we were unable to emulate a phase 3 biomarker trials for our platinum biomarker in ovarian and anthracycline biomarker in sarcoma. This was due to an absence of alternative SoC treatments at first line. Instead, we pursued phase 2 single-arm studies. Further follow-up work is required to assess the true predictive capacity of the resistance biomarkers in this context.

Further work will also be necessary to understand the regulatory pathway of a clinical decision support test for already approved chemotherapies. One of the main challenges to overcome will be the heterogeneity of genomic testing in a clinical environment. Currently, different hospital systems employ different genomic assays including gene panel sequencing and WGS. Thus, the use of CIN signature biomarkers for chemotherapy response prediction will need to be enabled across a variety of technologies. In this regard, we showed a proof-of-concept that our resistance classifications may be applied using the regulatory approved TSO500 assay, alongside shallow and deep WGS, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Furthermore, in a subset of patients, it may be possible to perform the predictions using liquid biopsies. However, further studies will be necessary to determine the optimal clinical implementation strategy and will need to assess the trade off between taking a biopsy or blood draw as well as assessing the risk of biopsy, the cost of applying the test to blood draws or tissue, the fraction of patients with adequate biopsy material and the stage at which the test is administered, to name a few.

Importantly, our study introduces biomarkers for patient stratification for multiple medicines that were not originally developed as targeted therapies. CIN signature analysis can be applied widely across cancer types13 and thus our results have broad future implications for patient stratification and precision medicine in cancer.

Details on statistical analyses are outlined in each relevant section of Methods and the Supplementary Information. All code is provided to completely reproduce all analyses performed in this study and all experimental details are outlined in relevant sections of Methods and the Supplementary Methods. For biomarker discovery and optimization, no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. For biomarker performance assessment, power analyses were conducted to ensure the clinical cohorts were well powered (detailed in the Supplementary Methods). In vitro experiments and single-arm trials were not randomized. For retrospectively emulated phase 3 trials, patients were pseudo-randomized to the control and experimental arm. Patients were filtered for biomarker clinical assessment based on the exclusion criteria detailed in the ‘Cohort curation' sections of the Supplementary Methods. Flowcharts detailing inclusion and exclusion criteria for all cohorts used in this study are available via Figshare at ref. 41.

Clinical data and samples for patients with HGSOC were collected as part of the prospective Cambridge Translational Cancer Research Ovarian Study 04 (CTCROV04) approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (REC07/Q0106/63). OV04 is an ongoing observational study that records patient clinical data and collects patient material for the purpose of biomarker and scientific discovery. Patients provided written, informed consent for participation in this study and for the use of their donated tissue for the laboratory studies carried out in this work. The samples included primary ascites spheroids, tumor tissue, plasma samples and tumor tissue-derived organoids and cell lines. DNA was extracted and sequenced, copy number profiles derived, CIN signatures computed and biomarkers called (see details below). Treatment histories for each patient are shown in Supplementary Figs. 24–73. Clinical data (where applicable) were curated and response determined (further details in the Supplementary Methods).

In this study, we used data from the TCGA consisting of high-quality copy number profiles from 7,880 patients and matching clinical records for 7,105 patients, representing 33 cancer types. These data were curated to provide clinical response data and biopsy-level activities of CIN signatures for biomarker performance analysis (further details in the Supplementary Methods).

In this study we use data from The Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF), which manages a multicenter database of genomic and clinical data collected from 2,979 patients with metastatic cancer in the Netherlands. This dataset, representing 35 cancer types, was curated to provide clinical response data and biopsy-level activities of CIN signatures for biomarker performance analysis (further details in the Supplementary Methods).

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut as 8 μm sections and tumor-enriched regions were recovered by macrodissection based on regions marked on an adjacent hematoxylin and eosin-stained section by the study pathologist. DNA was extracted from 3–10 sections at 8 μm thickness using the QIAmp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen, 56204) with the following modification to the original protocol: an additional incubation step with buffer ATL at 95 °C for 15 min was introduced before adding proteinase K. The paraffin was removed using a xylene/ethanol method. DNA extraction from fresh frozen tumor tissues and spheroids fraction was performed using the Allprep DNA/RNA tissue kit (Qiagen, 80204) following the manufacturer's instructions.

We focused on selected plasma time points collected before the primary line of chemotherapy treatment and before anthracycline treatment (usually before the second or third line of therapy). DNA was extracted from 2 or 4 ml of plasma using the QIAamp circulating nucleic acid kit (Qiagen, 55114) or QIAsymphony (Qiagen, 937556), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Organoids were derived as previously described42. Samples were obtained from patients via surgical resection, ward drains or surgical washings. Solid tumors were assessed by a pathologist and only tumor samples with ≥50% tumor cellularity were selected for organoid model derivation. Organoid culture medium was refreshed every 2 days. To passage the organoids, the domes were scraped and collected in a Falcon tube, TrypLE (Invitrogen, 12604013) was added and they were incubated at 37 °C for approximately 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 800g for 2 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 7.5 mg ml−1 BME-2 supplemented with complete media and plated as 20 μl droplets in a six-well plate. After allowing the BME-2 to polymerize, complete medium was added and cells incubated at 37 °C. DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA (Qiagen, 80204) extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Ascitic fluid was collected from patients, with between 100 ml and 2 l volume. The fluid was initially gently centrifuged at 800g for 5 min and the majority of the supernatant was removed. The sample was filtered using autoclaved muslin cloth and the flow through was then filtered again using a 40 μm cell strainer. Spheroids from the strainer were then recovered by a 10 ml wash with PBS and centrifuged at 1,500g for 5 min. The spheroid fraction was divided in two: a cell pellet for DNA extraction and resuspension of cells in filtered acellular ascitic supernatant and 8% dimethylsulfoxide for the drug screen. Spheroids were thawed and put in media overnight to fully recover before dispensing for the drug screen. DNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA (Qiagen, 80204) extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F12 or RPMI1640 plus 10% of fetal calf serum. Cell line identities were confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling. Cells were regularly screened for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection kit (Lonza, LT07-118). The sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay was used for quantifying cell numbers and cell proliferation in culture. DNA extraction from cell pellets of approximately 2 × 106 million cells per sample was performed using the Qiagen Allprep DNA/RNA (Qiagen, 80204) extraction kit following the manufacturer's recommendations.

WGS libraries were prepared from 50 ng DNA using Illumina DNA prep (S) Tagmentation (Illumina, 20025523) and SMARTer Thruplex DNA-Seq (Takara, R400676) reagents, following the manufacturer's protocol. Library quality and quantity were assessed with D5000 on a 4200 Tapestation, a Fragment Analyzer next-generation sequencing (NGS) kit (Agilent Technologies, 5067-5582) and the Qubit BR dsDNA assay, according to the supplier's recommendations. Libraries were then diluted to 10 nmol l−1 and pooled together in equal ratios and sequenced using paired-end (PE) 50 mode on a NovaSeq6000 S2 flow cell 100 cycles kit (Illumina, 20028316), aiming for 80 million reads per sample.

A total of 10 µl of extracted circulating nucleic acids was taken as input for whole-genome library preparation using the SMARTer ThruPLEX DNA-Seq (Takara, R400676) library prep kit with the following modifications: no DNA shearing was performed, 14 PCR cycles were applied, library purification using Ampure beads (Beckman Coulter, 10136224) was performed separately for each sample and elution was performed using 20 µl of Tris EDTA buffer. Generated libraries were quantified using the Fragment Analyzer NGS kit (Agilent Technologies, cat no. DNF-467-0500) diluted to 10 nmol l−1 and pooled in the same proportions. All libraries were sequenced using the NovaSeq6000 S2 flow cell 300 cycle kit (Illumina, 20028314) using PE 150 bp mode to achieve at least 80 million reads per sample.

Hybridization-based NGS libraries were prepared from 40 ng DNA using the TruSight Oncology 500 Library Preparation kit (Illumina, 20076480), following the manufacturer's protocol. Library quality and quantity were assessed with the High Sensitivity/D5000 Screentape assay (Agilent Technologies, 5067-5592) on a 4150/4200 Tapestation Quant-IT/Qubit dsDNA HS (Qiagen, Q32851) assay system according to the supplier's recommendations. Libraries were then pooled together in equal ratios and sequenced using PE 150 bp mode on a NovaSeq S1 flow cell 300 cycles kit (Illumina, 20028317) or S4 flow cell 300 cycles kit (Illumina, 20028312) aiming for 100 million reads per sample.

Reads were aligned as single-end against the human genome assembly GRCh37 using BWA-MEM v0.7.17 (ref. 43), following which duplicate reads were identified and marked using the MarkDuplicates tool in the GATK v4.1.8.1 (ref. 44) tool suite.

After alignment, relative copy number was computed using QDNAseqmod45 with a bin size of 50 kb. Bins mapped to centromeres and regions of undefined sequence in the reference genome hg19 were excluded. Read counts were corrected for the relationship between sequence mappability and GC content.

Absolute tumor copy number (the number of chromosome copies of each DNA segment in the tumor cells in a sample) was computed for every bin across each sample. Each segmented relative copy number bin estimate j was transformed from relative copy number (rCN) to absolute copy number (aCN) by

where purity is the fraction of tumor cells in the sample and d is a constant proportional to the read depth, which is computed from the mean relative copy number of the sample, r, and the average absolute copy number of the tumor cells in the sample, ploidy, by

Both purity and ploidy were unobserved in the data and were estimated using a grid search of purities ranging from 0.05 to 1 in 0.01 increments and ploidies ranging from 1.8 to 8 in increments of 0.1, minimizing the following mean squared error:

Cell lines and organoid samples were assumed 100% pure, so purity was fixed to 1 and a search was only performed across ploidy states. Purity/ploidy values were excluded from consideration if they resulted in a fit which showed greater than 10 megabases of the genome with homozygous loss. For tissue samples, an additional filter was used, removing fits which did not show at least one genomic segment at every integer copy number state from 1 to ploidy.

After alignment, PE raw reads were split into equally-sized bins of 50 kb in size. Bins were annotated with GC content, mappability and replication timing, after a bin-level filtering based on a panel of 40 normal samples sequenced by deep whole-genome sequencing as part of the 1000 Genomes Project46. The remaining annotated bins were then interrogated for overlaps with target regions (bed file). Only bins with less than 25% overlap with the target regions and a maximum of 10 total overlaps per bin were kept. For the remaining set of bins, we removed on-target reads and counted the number of reads per bin. To correct for artificially high off-target read counts in parts of the genome with high sequence similarity to the target regions, we generated a score per bin that quantified the magnitude of this bias and used it for a single linear model fit and correction. For bins with any overlap with the bed file, we filled the gap caused by the removal of the on-target reads with a pseudocount estimation using the per-bin mean off-target read count. GC and replication timing corrections were performed using locally estimated scatter plot smoothing fitting and correction. We segmented these data using the same segmentation procedure used in QDNAseqmod45. Absolute copy numbers were inferred as described above in the section ‘OV04 sWGS'. For purity/ploidy selection, we fixed a range of ±0.2 with respect to the ploidy and ±0.05 with respect to the ploidy using the paired sWGS curated data.

We downloaded copy number profiles derived using PURPLE from a total of 5,200 samples released by the HMF34,47. As PURPLE47 determines the allele-specific copy number of every base of the genome, the genome binning resolution is substantially higher compared with the resolution of the copy number profiles used to derive feature components of the CIN signature encoding13. To avoid incorrect mapping of signatures due to differences in segmentation resolution, copy number profiles were binned into 30 kb bins and then resegmented. In our previous work13, we estimated this bin size as appropriate to have a segmentation agreement between copy number calls derived from SNP6 arrays and WGS/whole-exome sequencing. The copy number value of each 30 kb bin was computed by averaging the copy number value of the segments spanning a given bin. For bins spanning multiple copy number segments, this resegmentation may generate artificial segments with a 30 kb length. Segments with a 30 kb length were therefore removed to avoid this artificial oversegmentation, and we then applied a smoothing procedure for merging continuous segments with a ±0.1 difference in copy number.

ASCAT-derived TCGA copy number profiles were downloaded from ref. 48.

We quantified the activities of 17 CIN signatures13. We extracted five copy number features (segment size, breakpoint count per 10 MB, changepoint of copy number, breakpoint count per chromosome arm and length of segments with oscillating copy number) from the absolute copy number profiles to then compute a sum-of-posterior probability vector per sample. The sum-of posterior probability vectors were finally used to compute signature activities using the LCD function found in the YAPSA49 package in R, and the signature definition matrix. To ensure robustness of the signature activities and to enable trust in small signature activities, we applied the signature-specific thresholds derived from the TCGA pan-cancer cohort in our previous work13.

We emulated phase 3 biomarker trials to compare the TTFs of patients in the experimental arm (where patients received the chemotherapy of interest) with the TTFs of patients in the control arm (where the patients received an appropriate alternative SoC treatment) (Supplementary Fig. 74).

To construct the experimental arm, we selected the closest treatment line to diagnosis containing the chemotherapy of interest (platin/taxane/anthracycline), either administered in combination with another therapy or as a single agent. For HMF patients with multiple metastatic biopsies, each treatment line was linked to the most recent biopsy, better reflecting the patients' tumor state at the time of treatment. To account for metastasis progression, only treatments given immediately after a biopsy were retained. In ovarian cancer cohorts, we excluded platinum treatment to avoid the effect of the response to this chemotherapy on TTF intervals (see further details in Supplementary Note 2). To validate that TTF differences between predicted resistant and sensitive patients were not influenced by the co-therapy, we also performed this analysis by limiting to single-agent administration where possible.

To construct the control arm, we first excluded all treatment lines that did not contain the chemotherapy of interest. As the filtering at this stage was performed at the level of the treatment line instead of at a patient level, it was possible for patients to have treatment lines in both experimental and control arms. Hence, patients appearing in both arms were removed from the control. Then, the control arm was further filtered to retain only the most common SoCs, which were identified based on frequency. The top five monotherapies formed the control arm. Platinum was excluded from SoCs in relapsed ovarian cancer.

Both arms were further filtered to remove treatment lines with an insufficient therapy exposure: at least three cycles or a treatment length of at least 28 days. Finally, only one treatment line per patient was used in the survival analysis, prioritizing the first viable treatment. Patients without clinical follow-up beyond 1 year were excluded if their last treatment line had a TTF exceeding 730 days.

We emulated a phase 2 trial for assessing biomarker performance to predict resistance to first-line platinum in ovarian cancer and to first-line anthracycline in sarcoma. Patients with stage I tumors, non-calculable TTF, fewer than three cycles of treatment or fewer than 28 days were excluded. We included all ovarian and sarcoma TCGA patients who received treatment, alone or in combination, at first line.

Patient counts for single-agent and combination treatments are shown in Supplementary Figs. 75–78.

The performance assessment of our signature-based biomarkers to identify patients resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, taxanes and anthracyclines was carried out using Cox proportional-hazards modeling (function coxph from the survival package in R50). We used the function cox.zph to test the proportional-hazards assumption for all Cox proportional-hazards model fits. Further details on survival time period calculations and inverse probability weighting can be found in the Supplementary Methods. Detailed results of all the survival analyses performed in this study can be seen in Supplementary Figs. 5–21. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated using the survfit function from the survival package in R50, and used to represent differences in treatment effectiveness across treatment arms in a univariate mode (Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7).

We compared absolute copy number profiles (by using the getDifference function from our CNpare tool in R51), signature activities (by computing cosine similarity) and drug resistance predictions (by observing classification concordance) obtained from tissues sequenced using sWGS and the regulatory approved Illumina TSO500 assay. Supplementary Fig. 22 illustrates differences between matched sWGS- and TSO500-derived copy number profiles of all patients, while Fig. 5a shows signature composition concordance between pairs.

We also assessed concordance between tissue and plasma samples collected from the same patient following the same approach. Supplementary Fig. 23 illustrates differences between matched tissue- and plasma-derived copy number profiles of all patients, while Fig. 5c shows signature composition concordance between pairs.

a) Implementation of a robust signature scaling procedure for pan-cancer application of the platinum biomarker13. All BRCA1/2 mutants in the TCGA dataset (n=375) are used as reference for scaling signature activities of new samples (see Methods). b) Optimisation and pan-cancer implementation of a clinical biomarker for predicting taxane resistance. Biomarker optimisation was initially performed using a collection of 285 cancer cell lines treated with taxanes. To achieve a pan-cancer implementation, all TCGA samples were used as reference for scaling signature activities of new samples (see Methods). c) Identification, optimisation and implementation of a biomarker for predicting resistance to anthracyclines. In vitro models derived from 23 ovarian cancer patients were treated with doxorubicin and then used to identify and optimise the biomarker (see Methods).

How do you intuitively know that you can walk on a footpath and swim in a lake? Researchers from the University of Amsterdam have discovered unique brain activations that reflect how we can move our bodies through an environment. The study not only sheds new light on how the human brain works, but also shows where artificial intelligence is lagging behind. According to the researchers, AI could become more sustainable and human-friendly if it incorporated this knowledge about the human brain.

When we see a picture of an unfamiliar environment -- a mountain path, a busy street, or a river -- we immediately know how we could move around in it: walk, cycle, swim or not go any further. That sounds simple, but how does your brain actually determine these action opportunities?

PhD student Clemens Bartnik and a team of co-authors show how we make estimates of possible actions thanks to unique brain patterns. The team, led by computational neuroscientist Iris Groen, also compared this human ability with a large number of AI models, including ChatGPT. "AI models turned out to be less good at this and still have a lot to learn from the efficient human brain," Groen concludes.

Viewing images in the MRI scanner

Using an MRI scanner, the team investigated what happens in the brain when people look at various photos of indoor and outdoor environments. The participants used a button to indicate whether the image invited them to walk, cycle, drive, swim, boat or climb. At the same time, their brain activity was measured.

"We wanted to know: when you look at a scene, do you mainly see what is there -- such as objects or colors -- or do you also automatically see what you can do with it," says Groen. "Psychologists call the latter "affordances" -- opportunities for action; imagine a staircase that you can climb, or an open field that you can run through."

Unique processes in the brain

The team discovered that certain areas in the visual cortex become active in a way that cannot be explained by visible objects in the image. "What we saw was unique," says Groen. "These brain areas not only represent what can be seen, but also what you can do with it." The brain did this even when participants were not given an explicit action instruction. 'These action possibilities are therefore processed automatically," says Groen. "Even if you do not consciously think about what you can do in an environment, your brain still registers it."

The research thus demonstrates for the first time that affordances are not only a psychological concept, but also a measurable property of our brains.

What AI doesn't understand yet

The team also compared how well AI algorithms -- such as image recognition models or GPT-4 -- can estimate what you can do in a given environment. They were worse at predicting possible actions. "When trained specifically for action recognition, they could somewhat approximate human judgments, but the human brain patterns didn't match the models' internal calculations," Groen explains.

"Even the best AI models don't give exactly the same answers as humans, even though it's such a simple task for us," Groen says. "This shows that our way of seeing is deeply intertwined with how we interact with the world. We connect our perception to our experience in a physical world. AI models can't do that because they only exist in a computer."

AI can still learn from the human brain

The research thus touches on larger questions about the development of reliable and efficient AI. "As more sectors -- from healthcare to robotics -- use AI, it is becoming important that machines not only recognize what something is, but also understand what it can do," Groen explains. "For example, a robot that has to find its way in a disaster area, or a self-driving car that can tell apart a bike path from a driveway."

Groen also points out the sustainable aspect of AI. "Current AI training methods use a huge amount of energy and are often only accessible to large tech companies. More knowledge about how our brain works, and how the human brain processes certain information very quickly and efficiently, can help make AI smarter, more economical and more human-friendly."

Metrics details

Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a promising source of new pharmaceuticals, yet the therapeutic potential of fungal RiPPs remains largely underexplored. Here we report asperigimycins as a distinct class of fungal RiPPs, featuring a unique heptacyclic scaffold consisting of a benzofuranoindoline core and three additional macrocycles, primarily assembled by six distinct fungi-specific DUF3328 oxidases. Inspired by the enhancement of anticancer activity through the N-terminal pyroglutamate in naturally occurring asperigimycins C and D, we chemically modify the inactive asperigimycin B with a series of lipid substitutions at its N-terminus. A derivative with a C-11 linear fatty acid, 2-L6, achieves nanomolar anticancer potency comparable to that of clinically approved antileukemia drugs. High-throughput CRISPR screening identifies the SLC46A3 transporter as a critical factor mediating 2-L6 cellular uptake into human cells. Our findings highlight the promise of engineering asperigimycins as therapeutic leads for cancer treatment.

α-amanitin and omphalotin A from basidiomycetes (left panel) and ustiloxin B, epichloëcyclin B, victorin C, phomopsin A, and asperipin-2a from ascomycetes (right panel). The structure of epichloëcyclin B was proposed by MS/MS data. The structure of asperipin-2a was revised in 2020 by chemical synthesis72.

This figure showed major clusters in the molecular network. Node sizes represent relative precursor ion intensity. Pie charts represent relative spectral counts of defined groups with different colors. Clusters circled are labeled with the potential compound types identified by GNPS analysis for the corresponding cluster.

a. COSY and HMBC correlations. b. ROESY correlations. The relative configuration of 1 was assigned by detailed interpretation of the ROESY spectrum, in which the correlations of H-27/H-22 and H-27/H-21 revealed that these protons are cofacial. Correlations between H-4/H-6, H-6/H-10, and H-10/H-12 indicated that H-6 and H-12 are the same oriented, while the small coupling constant ( < 3 Hz) suggested that H-12 and H-13 are the same oriented. H-36, H-37, and H-38 were assigned as the same oriented since the ROESY correlations were observed between H-36/H-38 and H-37/H-38. In general, all the amino acid residues were proposed to be L-configuration, thus the absolute configuration was determined as 2S, 4S, 6S, 12R, 13S, 18S, 21S, 23S, 27R, 34R, 38S, 41S. Considering the similar chemical shifts and biosynthetic origins, the stereochemistry of 2-4, was proposed to be the same as those of 1. c. Lowest-energy conformer of compound 1.

The left panel showed EIC of targeted compounds from the extract broth of ApgAT mutants. The proposed chemical structures of these derivatives are shown in the right panel.

Homologous gene clusters of apg are found in diverse fungal species. Homologous enzymes of ApgYa and ApgYe are highlighted. The putative core peptides encoded by corresponding homologous BGCs indicated the close relationship between ApgYa and ApgYe with the modification of Leu, Trp, and Tyr.

Randomness is incredibly useful. People often draw straws, throw dice or flip coins to make fair choices. Random numbers can enable auditors to make completely unbiased selections. Randomness is also key in security; if a password or code is an unguessable string of numbers, it's harder to crack. Many of our cryptographic systems today use random number generators to produce secure keys.

But how do you know that a random number is truly random? Classical computer algorithms can only create pseudo-random numbers, and someone with enough knowledge of the algorithm or the system could manipulate it or predict the next number. An expert in sleight of hand could rig a coin flip to guarantee a heads or tails result. Even the most careful coin flips can have bias; with enough study, their outcomes could be predicted.

"True randomness is something that nothing in the universe can predict in advance," said Krister Shalm, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Even if a random number generator used seemingly random processes in nature, it would be hard to verify that those numbers are truly random, Shalm added.

Einstein believed that nature isn't random, famously saying, "God does not play dice with the universe." Scientists have since proved that Einstein was wrong. Unlike dice or computer algorithms, quantum mechanics is inherently random. Carrying out a quantum experiment called a Bell test, Shalm and his team have transformed this source of true quantum randomness into a traceable and certifiable random-number service.

"If God does play dice with the universe, then you can turn that into the best random number generator that the universe allows," Shalm said. "We really wanted to take that experiment out of the lab and turn it into a useful public service."

To make that happen, NIST researchers and their colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder created the Colorado University Randomness Beacon (CURBy). CURBy produces random numbers automatically and broadcasts them daily through a website for anyone to use.

At the heart of this service is the NIST-run Bell test, which provides truly random results. This randomness acts as a kind of raw material that the rest of the researchers' setup "refines" into random numbers published by the beacon.

The Bell test measures pairs of "entangled" photons whose properties are correlated even when separated by vast distances. When researchers measure an individual particle, the outcome is random, but the properties of the pair are more correlated than classical physics allows, enabling researchers to verify the randomness. Einstein called this quantum nonlocality "spooky action at a distance."

This is the first random number generator service to use quantum nonlocality as a source of its numbers, and the most transparent source of random numbers to date. That's because the results are certifiable and traceable to a greater extent than ever before.

"CURBy is one of the first publicly available services that operates with a provable quantum advantage. That's a big milestone for us," Shalm explained. "The quality and origin of these random bits can be directly certified in a way that conventional random number generators are unable to."

NIST performed one of the first complete experimental Bell tests in 2015, which firmly established that quantum mechanics is truly random. In 2018, NIST pioneered methods to use these Bell tests to build the world's first sources of true randomness.

However, turning these quantum correlations into random numbers is hard work. NIST's first breakthrough demonstrations of the Bell test required months of setup to run for a few hours, and it took a great deal of time to collect enough data to generate 512 bits of true randomness. Shalm and the team spent the past few years building the experiment to be robust and to run automatically so it can provide random numbers on demand. In its first 40 days of operation, the protocol produced random numbers 7,434 times out of 7,454 attempts, a 99.7% success rate.

The process starts by generating a pair of entangled photons inside a special nonlinear crystal. The photons travel via optical fiber to separate labs at opposite ends of the hall. Once the photons reach the labs, their polarizations are measured. The outcomes of these measurements are truly random. This process is repeated 250,000 times per second.

NIST passes millions of these quantum coin flips to a computer program at the University of Colorado Boulder. Special processing steps and strict protocols are used to turn the outcomes of the quantum measurements on entangled photons into 512 random bits of binary code (0s and 1s). The result is a set of random bits that no one, not even Einstein, could have predicted. In some sense, this system acts as the universe's best coin flip.

NIST and its collaborators added the ability to trace and verify every step in the randomness generation process. They developed the Twine protocol, a novel set of quantum-compatible blockchain technologies that enable multiple different entities to work together to generate and certify the randomness from the Bell test. The Twine protocol marks each set of data for the beacon with a hash. Hashes are used in blockchain technology to mark sets of data with a digital fingerprint, allowing each block of data to be identified and scrutinized.

The Twine protocol allows any user to verify the data behind each random number, explained Jasper Palfree, a research assistant on the project at the University of Colorado Boulder. The protocol can expand to let other random number beacons join the hash graph, creating a network of randomness that everyone contributes to but no individual controls.

Intertwining these hash chains acts as a timestamp, linking the data for the beacon together into a traceable data structure. It also provides security, allowing Twine protocol participants to immediately spot manipulation of the data.

"The Twine protocol lets us weave together all these other beacons into a tapestry of trust," Palfree added.

Turning a complex quantum physics problem into a public service is exactly why this work appealed to Gautam Kavuri, a graduate student on the project. The whole process is open source and available to the public, allowing anyone to not only check their work, but even build on the beacon to create their own random number generator.

CURBy can be used anywhere an independent, public source of random numbers would be useful, such as selecting jury candidates, making a random selection for an audit, or assigning resources through a public lottery.

"I wanted to build something that is useful. It's this cool thing that is the cutting edge of fundamental science," Kavuri added. "NIST is a place where you have that freedom to pursue projects that are ambitious but also will give you something useful."

Resistance to colistin, a potent antibiotic, is on the rise.

Colistin is a potent, last-resort antibiotic, used only to treat people with dangerous, life-threatening bacterial infections that have developed resistance to other drugs. But it's not foolproof. Worldwide, resistance to colistin is spreading, further diminishing treatment options and putting infected people at higher risk.

Researchers from the University of Georgia recently identified a way that colistin resistance genes are spreading: Imported seafood. In a new study, microbiologist Issmat Kassem, Ph.D., and his group have reported the first isolation of colistin-resistance genes in bacteria found in imported shrimp and scallops, purchased from 8 food markets around Atlanta, Ga. Kassem will be presenting the findings this week in Los Angeles at ASM Microbe 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. An accompanying paper will be published in the ASM journal mSphere.

"We love our seafood," Kassem said. Many people don't know that most seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, he said, including about 90% of shrimp. Imported seafood is screened for contaminants but the process doesn't catch everything, especially antimicrobial resistance genes. "The bacteria that were carrying colistin resistance genes are not normally screened." Kassem and his group also found that some of the resistance genes are carried on plasmids -- round bits of genetic material that can be transmitted from bacteria to bacteria.

Antimicrobial resistant infections kill hundreds of thousands of people globally every year, and antimicrobial resistance is a rising public health menace. Colistin was first introduced in the 1950s to treat infections by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, but it takes a heavy toll on patients, including increased risk of damage to the nerves and kidneys. It was discontinued in the U.S. in the 1980s. However, Kassem noted, other countries continued to use it in agricultural settings, both to treat infections and to promote animal growth. Colistin was eventually reintroduced to human medicine because it was one of the few options available to treat certain bacterial infections. The World Health Organization categorizes colistin as a high priority critically important antibiotic, which means it is an essential option for treating serious human infections.

In 2016, researchers discovered a mobile colistin resistant gene, or mcr, that was "mobile" because it could be transferred via lateral transmission, in plasmids passed among bacteria. Before then, Kassem said, researchers believed colistin resistance was inherited, not shared, "which means it could not jump between different bacteria."

Researchers have now identified at least 10 mcr genes and many alleles, or variations. Kassem, who has been studying antimicrobial resistance for 2 decades, suspected it might spread through the importing and exporting of food.

"Our food is sourced from different places," he said. "If you go out to lunch today, your plate might have ingredients from 6, 7, 8 countries. Some countries do not have strict regulations for using antibiotics in food animal production, so imported food can be a vehicle for transmission of resistance." In previous work, his group found mcr genes in samples from wastewater in Georgia; they also found the bacterial host that was carrying the plasmid containing the genes. It wasn't normally screened in food coming into the United States, he said. In studies published since then, researchers have found mcr genes in plasmids elsewhere.

When they screened seafood purchased from markets in Georgia, they found the same bacterial host, the same plasmids and the same genes that they'd previously identified in wastewater. "The good news is that we didn't find it in locally produced seafood," Kassem said.

He cautioned that the group identified 1 source of colistin resistance, but there could be other, and they're likely spreading. "We live in a very connected world," he said. "We move a lot, we travel a lot, our food travels, and we are going to spread whatever emerges, even across national borders. So, it's important to invest in monitoring systems and expand them and collaborate, especially on the global level, on the issue of antimicrobial resistance."

Majestic First Images from Rubin Observatory Show Universe in More Detail Than Ever Before

Astronomy fans can zoom in practically forever into the stunning first images from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

A small section of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's total view of the Virgo Cluster shows two prominent spiral galaxies (lower right), three merging galaxies (upper right), several groups of distant galaxies, many stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and more.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Editor's Note (6/23/25): This story will be updated with additional images and details shortly after 11 A.M. EDT.

Welcome to a mind-blowing new era of astronomy.

The long-awaited Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a cutting-edge new telescope perched atop a mountain in Chile, is releasing its first images of the universe on June 23—and its views are just as jaw-dropping as scientists hoped. (The observatory is holding a celebratory event today at 11 A.M. EDT to reveal additional images that you can watch a livestream of on YouTube. In addition, organizations are hosting watch parties open to the public around the world.)

The new images come from only 10 hours of observations—an eyeblink compared with the telescope's first real work, the groundbreaking, 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) project. On display are billowing gas clouds that are thousands of light-years away from our solar system and millions of sparkling galaxies—all emblematic of the cosmic riches that the observatory will ultimately reveal.

A brief excerpt from a longer video made from more than 1,100 images captured by the Rubin Observatory begins with a close-up of a spiral galaxy and then zooms out to reveal about 10 million galaxies. Those 10 million galaxies are roughly 0.05 percent of the approximately 20 billion galaxies that Rubin will capture during its 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Credit: NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory

“In a lot of ways, it almost doesn't matter where we look,” said Aaron Roodman, a physicist at Stanford University and program lead for the Rubin Observatory's LSST Camera, in a preview press conference held on June 9.

“We're going to see changing objects; we're going to see moving objects; we're going to get a view of thousands and thousands of galaxies of stars in any field we look at,” he said. “In some sense, we could have looked anywhere and gotten fantastic images.”

In the end, the team decided to share several mosaics of images from the observatory that highlight its extremely wide field of view, which can capture multiple alluring targets in a single snapshot.

This image combines 678 separate images taken by the Rubin Observatory in just more than seven hours of observing time. Combining many images in this way clearly reveals otherwise faint or invisible details, such as the clouds of gas and dust that comprise the Trifid Nebula (top right) and the Lagoon Nebula, which are several thousands of light-years away from Earth.

The view above of the Triffid Nebula (top right) and Lagoon Nebula includes data from 678 individual images captured by the Rubin Observatory. Scientists stack and combine images in this way to see farther and fainter into the universe. The Triffid Nebula, also known as M20, and the Lagoon Nebula, also known as M8, are star-forming regions both located several thousand light-years away from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius.

The observatory also captured an initial view of the Virgo Cluster, a massive clump of galaxies located in the constellation of the same name. Individual detail images (at top and below) show a mix of bright Milky Way stars against a backdrop of myriad more distant galaxies. In addition, the team has released a teaser video of a stunning zoomable view of some 10 million galaxies that was created by combining some 1,100 images taken by the new observatory.

In a small section of the Rubin Observatory's total view of the Virgo Cluster, bright stars in the Milky Way galaxy shine in the foreground, and many distant galaxies are in the background.

The Rubin Observatory has promised to reveal additional imagery during the unveiling event later today, including the full video of the massive view of countless galaxies and another video depicting the more than 2,000 asteroids the telescope has already discovered in just 10 hours of observations.

These first glimpses from Rubin showcase the observatory's unprecedented discovery power. The telescope will survey the entire southern sky about once every three days, creating movies of the cosmos in full color and jaw-dropping detail.

“We've been working on this for so many years now,” says Yusra AlSayyad, an astronomer at Princeton University and the Rubin Observatory's deputy associate director for data management. “I can't believe this moment has finally come.”

Over the weekend, OpenAI removed all promo materials related to its $6.5 billion buddy-buddy partnership with Apple design legend Jony Ive and their still unannounced AI-centric device. This wasn't a falling out between the two titans in tech, but rather the result of something altogether stranger. The nixed webpages and videos are due to a trademark lawsuit filed by a separate startup, iyO, which is seemingly miffed about the companies names being a single letter apart.

On July 20, California federal Judge Trina L. Thompson granted a temporary restraining order against OpenAI that forced it to remove all mentions of Ive's design company, “io.” You can still find the bromance video of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive—who helped bring us products like the iMac and iPhone—on YouTube through unofficial uploads. A page on OpenAI's site that previously talked up its partnership with Ive now reads:

“This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name “io.” We don't agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.”

What's the distinction between iyO Inc. and io, other than the inclusion of everybody's favorite sometimes vowel? iyO also makes “hardware and software allowing users to do everything they currently do on a computer, phone, or tablet without using a physical interface.” Which is to say, it's an AI device company. Jony Ive and several other ex-Apple staff founded io in 2023. Since then, it poached some big-name Apple design stars, though the company hadn't released any real products in that time. Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, helped design a button for a separate fashion designer.

iyO has been around since 2021, though its latest product—an in-ear headset called the iyO One—is still up for preorder. It's a device that claims to replace apps by letting users talk in natural language to a chatbot that then computes for you. It requires an audiologist to make an impression of your ear and costs $1,000 for a version with Wi-Fi connectivity or even more for a version with LTE. The device maker claimed in its lawsuit it is manufacturing an initial batch of 20,000 units and is still looking to raise more funds. The AI device maker sued IO Products and OpenAI earlier this month and said it was seeking an immediate restraining order and injunction to stop Ive and OpenAI from using their two-letter brand name. iyO claimed it sought some investment from OpenAI and LoveFrom, though Altman told them in March that it was “working on something competitive so will respectfully pass.”

“Defendants [AKA OpenAI and Ive] have known about the existence of iyO, the iyO Marks, and the nature of iyO's technology since at least 2022,” the AI device maker claims in its lawsuit. “Indeed, the parties had a series of meetings with representatives of OpenAI's principal, Sam Altman, and designers from LoveFrom Inc., a design studio founded by Jony Ive, about the prospect of iyO and OpenAI working together.” For its part, OpenAI said in response to the lawsuit it had decided not to pursue any collab or funding with iyO. The makers of ChatGPT said it surveyed many existing commercial AI devices in the run-up to its May partnership announcement. Ive even went as far as to say the Rabbit R1 and Humane Ai Pin were “very poor products.”

The name “io” derives from a tech term referring to “input/output,” such as the “IO ports” like USB or HDMI you may find on a typical PC. In a statement published on the opening salvo for the lawsuit, iyO cofounder Justin Rugolo said OpenAI was trying to “trample” on the rights of his “small startup.” Rugolo also claimed he had messaged Altman saying that investors were concerned about confusion surrounding the company's names. Rugolo complained that OpenAI had previously sued a separate artificial intelligence company, Open Artificial Intelligence, over a similar trademark claim.

At the very least, this lawsuit offers a few more slim details about what Ive and Altman have in store. In its response to iyO's claims, OpenAI said, “io is at least a year away from offering any goods or services, and the first product it intends to offer is not an in-ear device like the one Plaintiff is offering.” OpenAI further suggested whatever spins out of io will be a “general consumer product for the mass market.”

It's unlikely that we'll see work stop on whatever Ive and co. are working on. There are more hearings surrounding this trademark case slated for the months ahead. The lawsuit offers yet another glimpse into the high-stakes world of AI wearable startups and just how hard it is to come up with a device that can match the versatility of an iPhone. We'll still have to wait at least a year to see if anybody can cook up something more usable than an earpiece that lets you talk to a chatbot.

One month ago, the messaging app Telegram summarily beheaded the online industry of Chinese-language crypto scam services: It banned virtually all accounts related to the first and second most popular marketplaces for vendors offering money laundering, stolen data, and a variety of other illicit wares to the vast criminal enterprises carrying out investment scams from compounds across Southeast Asia.

Then, Telegram watched impassively as those black marketeers rebranded, rebuilt, and returned to business as usual on the messaging service's platform.

On Monday, crypto tracing firm Elliptic published a new report showing how the industry of Telegram-based Chinese-language black markets for crypto scammers has bounced back in the wake of Telegram's takedown last month of the two biggest of those bazaars, known as Haowang Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee. Before Telegram banned the two markets' channels and usernames on May 13, they had together enabled a staggering $35 billion in transactions, much of which represented money laundering by crypto scam operations that steal billions from Western victims and force tens of thousands of people to carry out scams in forced labor compounds across Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. Since Telegram's purge, however, Elliptic has found that other smaller markets have now grown to almost entirely fill the vacuum those two key marketplaces left behind—and Telegram appears to have no plans to stop them.

In particular, one market called Tudou Guarantee, partially owned by Huione Group, the same parent company as the now-defunct Haowang Guarantee, has more than doubled in size, likely taking in many of the scammer-friendly services displaced by Telegram's bans and again enabling those fraudsters' billions of dollars a year in illicit revenue. Its main channel now has 289,000 users by Elliptic's count, close to the 296,000 users that Haowang Guarantee had at the time Telegram banned it. Xinbi Guarantee, too, has relaunched on new channels and regained hundreds of thousands of users, Elliptic says. In terms of sales, Tudou is now enabling around $15 million a day in crypto payments, close to the $16.4 million Haowang was facilitating daily, according to Elliptic.

“Telegram recognized this was illicit activity and the kind they didn't want to be hosting, and so they deleted the channels and banned the associated usernames. But it was clear that these people wouldn't just give up, that they would transfer to different marketplaces,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic's cofounder. “These scammers have inflicted misery on millions of victims around the world, stealing billions of dollars. Unless these marketplaces are actively pursued, they will continue to flourish.”

Elliptic shared posts with WIRED from Tudou Guarantee—now by some measures the biggest black market on the internet—which show examples of money laundering services, offers of scam website development, and vendors selling stolen personal data that scammers use for targeting. Another Tudou post explicitly offers prostitution, including references to possible minors: “Students, queens, lolita,” the post states next to pictures of young women. “All available!!”

WIRED reached out to Tudou Guarantee for comment via an administrator's Telegram account but didn't receive a response.

Before they were taken down by Telegram, Xinbi Guarantee and Haowang Guarantee displayed similar posts offering explicitly illegal services in all those categories and more. Like the newly ascendant Tudou Guarantee, those other “Guarantee” marketplaces didn't directly sell services, but instead offered escrow and deposit features that prevent vendors from defrauding customers.

When WIRED asked Telegram in May about a report from Elliptic that focused on Xinbi Guarantee's criminal offerings, Telegram responded with a broad purge: It banned not only Xinbi's accounts but also those of Haowang Guarantee, the much larger market that had persisted for three years, enabled around $27 billion in transactions, and sold scam industry services as explicit as the batons and shackles used to imprison forced laborers in scam compounds.

In a statement sent to WIRED at the time, Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn wrote that “communities previously reported to us by WIRED or included in reports published by Elliptic have all been taken down,” and added that “criminal activities like scamming or money laundering are forbidden by Telegram's terms of service and are always removed whenever discovered.”

Since then, however, Elliptic has continued to share its findings about apparent money laundering activity on ten other markets, including Tudou Guarantee, in a Telegram group that included a WIRED reporter and a Telegram spokesperson. Yet Telegram didn't take down any of the accounts related to the black markets Elliptic highlighted. Xinbi Guarantee has, in fact, rebuilt at new accounts without even rebranding. It still hasn't faced new account bans, despite Telegram itself stating that the market's content violated its terms of service.

In a statement to WIRED, a Telegram spokesperson defended the company's apparent decision not to ban the rebounding black markets. “The channels in question predominantly involve users from China, where rigid capital controls often leave citizens with little choice but to seek alternative avenues for moving funds internationally,” the statement reads. "We assess reports on a case-by-case basis and categorically reject blanket bans—particularly when users are attempting to circumvent oppressive restrictions imposed by authoritarian regimes. We remain unwavering in our commitment to safeguarding user privacy and defending fundamental freedoms, including the right to financial autonomy.”

Elliptic's Robinson rejects that argument. “We've been researching these marketplaces for nearly two years now, and they're not about helping people achieve financial autonomy,” Robinson says. “These are marketplaces that primarily facilitate money laundering for the proceeds of fraud and other illicit activity."

Erin West, a former prosecutor who now leads the nonprofit Operation Shamrock, an organization focused on disrupting crypto scam operations, states her accusation against Telegram more simply. “These are bad guys, enabling bad-guy business on their bad-guy platform,” West argues. “They have the ability to shut down a scam economy and the trafficking of human beings. Instead, they're hosting Craigslist for crypto scammers.”

Telegram's seemingly inconsistent approach to banning crypto-scam black markets may have less to do with its principles of “financial autonomy” than with trying not to run afoul of the US government, says Jacob Sims, a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Asia Center. In early May, the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network officially labeled Huione Group a “primary money laundering concern.” Sims argues that designation, which referred directly to Haowang Guarantee but not Tudou Guarantee, may have spurred Telegram to take action—and that it may take another similar move at the government level to push Telegram to act again.

“Ultimately, last month's crackdown shows how disruptive Telegram can be when it does cooperate, but it also shows how fast the scammers are going to adapt,” Sims says. “There's no real legal culpability that tech companies have for what happens on their platform unless there's a specific case brought to their attention by law enforcement. And so, until that changes, I just don't know what incentive they have to be proactive.”

Updated at 2:30 pm ET, June 23, 2025: Clarified the period during which Haowang Guarantee had approximately 296,000 users.

There is no shortage of workflow collaboration tools — like Slack or Google Docs, in addition to industry-specific ones like GitHub — for software developers. A startup called AllSpice.io successfully bet that electrical hardware engineering teams need their own collaboration platform, too.

AllSpice's platform sits between existing workflow software. It allows hardware teams to collaborate on the types of documents they traditionally work in — documents that don't easily translate over Slack and email — like PCB files and electronic CAD files, both of which are used to design circuit boards.

Engineers can use AllSpice to single out and comment on design aspects in these types of documents, the same way software engineers can comment on specific lines of code through GitHub.

Kyle Dumont, co-founder and CTO of AllSpice, told TechCrunch that the startup has been able to find success because they haven't tried to build a new end-to-end collaboration platform but rather fill the gap between the software solutions that hardware teams were already using.

“The teams that we were talking to had really integral tools already in their workflows,” Dumont said. “They had these electrical CAD tools, they had [product life cycle management] tools, they had existing workflows that we knew the product that we launched had to operate between.”

This learning came from research the founding team did prior to launching their product to make sure that they were building something teams would actually use. In early tests, AllSpice not only focused on what their users commented on, both good and bad, but also what didn't get mentioned at all, Valentina Ratner, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.

“Some of the most valuable things that we learned were maybe the things that people didn't need or didn't want,” Ratner said. “That helped us kind of scope something that will be really helpful and really an integral part of the workflow. Because we wanted to build not another point solution for our space, but a centralized platform that will become that home base for electronics teams.”

Both Ratner and Dumont had experienced the pain points AllSpice is trying to solve firsthand while working as engineers at Amazon and iRobot, respectively. Ratner said that hardware design doesn't translate through email chains and PDFs, and by the end of Ratner's time at Amazon, she was spending the majority of her time building an internal collaboration tool to solve this problem for Amazon.

The duo met in grad school and launched the first version of AllSpice's product in 2022, which was focused on small businesses and other startups. The company started to see growing demand from enterprises, pivoted, and has since landed customers such as Blue Origin, Bose, and Sam Altman's Tools for Humanity, among others.

The startup just raised a $15 million Series A round led by Rethink Impact with participation from L'attitude Ventures, Gingerbread Capital, and DNX Ventures, in addition to existing investors. The company will put the capital toward hiring and continuing to build out its product offerings.

AllSpice is also launching its new AI agent tool that helps validate engineers' designs and spot mistakes.

“We've seen huge demand to find out how our hardware, [and] AI tools, can help make their teams more effective, catch these design errors, and that's exactly what we're targeting for this product,” Dumont said.

The company is purposefully launching this new AI agent just in closed beta for now, with an emphasis on working with their existing partners, Ratner said. The company wants to be able to ensure full accuracy before opening the product up further.

“The cost of a hardware mistake is so much higher than the cost of a software mistake,” Ratner said. “We have to make it in a way that makes sense for our industry, because of those kinds of broad differences between releasing a software product versus releasing a hardware product.”

Venture capital company HongShan Capital Group originally developed it to assess its potential investments. Now it's opening it up for anyone to use.

When testing an AI model, it's hard to tell if it is reasoning or just regurgitating answers from its training data. Xbench, a new benchmark developed by the Chinese venture capital firm HSG, or HongShan Capital Group, might help to sidestep that issue. That's thanks to the way it evaluates models not only on the ability to pass arbitrary tests, like most other benchmarks, but also on the ability to execute real-world tasks, which is more unusual. It will be updated on a regular basis to try to keep it evergreen. 

This week the company is making part of its question set open-source and letting anyone use for free. The team has also released a leaderboard comparing how mainstream AI models stack up when tested on Xbench. (ChatGPT o3 ranked first across all categories, though ByteDance's Doubao, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok all still did pretty well, as did Claude Sonnet.) 

Development of the benchmark at HongShan began in 2022, following ChatGPT's breakout success, as an internal tool for assessing which models are worth investing in. Since then, led by partner Gong Yuan, the team has steadily expanded the system, bringing in outside researchers and professionals to help refine it. As the project grew more sophisticated, they decided to release it to the public.

Xbench approached the problem with two different systems. One is similar to traditional benchmarking: an academic test that gauges a model's aptitude on various subjects. The other is more like a technical interview round for a job, assessing how much real-world economic value a model might deliver.

Xbench's methods for assessing raw intelligence currently include two components: Xbench-ScienceQA and Xbench-DeepResearch. ScienceQA isn't a radical departure from existing postgraduate-level STEM benchmarks like GPQA and SuperGPQA. It includes questions spanning fields from biochemistry to orbital mechanics, drafted by graduate students and double-checked by professors. Scoring rewards not only the right answer but also the reasoning chain that leads to it.

DeepResearch, by contrast, focuses on a model's ability to navigate the Chinese-language web. Ten subject-matter experts created 100 questions in music, history, finance, and literature—questions that can't just be googled but require significant research to answer. Scoring favors breadth of sources, factual consistency, and a model's willingness to admit when there isn't enough data. A question in the publicized collection is “How many Chinese cities in the three northwestern provinces border a foreign country?” (It's 12, and only 33% of models tested got it right, if you are wondering.)

On the company's website, the researchers said they want to add more dimensions to the test—for example, aspects like how creative a model is in its problem solving, how collaborative it is when working with other models, and how reliable it is.

The team has committed to updating the test questions once a quarter and to maintain a half-public, half-private data set.

To assess models' real-world readiness, the team worked with experts to develop tasks modeled on actual workflows, initially in recruitment and marketing. For example, one task asks a model to source five qualified battery engineer candidates and justify each pick. Another asks it to match advertisers with appropriate short-video creators from a pool of over 800 influencers.

The website also teases upcoming categories, including finance, legal, accounting, and design. The question sets for these categories have not yet been open-sourced.

ChatGPT-o3 again ranks first in both of the current professional categories. For recruiting, Perplexity Search and Claude 3.5 Sonnet take second and third place, respectively. For marketing, Claude, Grok, and Gemini all perform well.

“It is really difficult for benchmarks to include things that are so hard to quantify,” says Zihan Zheng, the lead researcher on a new benchmark called LiveCodeBench Pro and a student at NYU. “But Xbench represents a promising start.” 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

President Donald Trump and his most vocal supporters have been using disinformation, fake videos, and mental gymnastics to try to spin the US military's bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites as a complete and total victory that signals the end of a war instead of the beginning.

On Saturday night, with the B-2 stealth bombers that dropped a dozen GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs on the Fordow underground nuclear facility just beginning their flights back to the US, Trump declared the mission a complete success.

But rather than relying on information from his own intelligence agencies, satellite imagery, or on-the-ground reporting, Trump instead posted on Truth Social a screenshot of an X post from an anonymous account that claims to conduct open source intelligence investigations.

“Fordow is gone,” the account, which lists the website of a Zionist clothing company in its biography, wrote, providing no further information. Trump followed this up by claiming in a press conference that Fordow had been “completely and totally obliterated.”

It immediately became clear that the triumphant declarations were likely premature, with Trump's own military officials pushing back against his assessment. “It would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there,” said General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Israeli military officials told The New York Times that while the facility had sustained significant damage, it had not been destroyed. Additionally, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that most of the highly enriched uranium at the Fordow facility had been moved before the bombing, while the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency told The New York Times that the highly enriched uranium previously stored at the Isfahan facility had been moved before it was targeted by US strikes.

Trump's early declarations of success on Truth Social set the tone, though—and appear to have inspired others. Fox News host Sean Hannity, among the loudest proponents for bombing Iran in recent weeks, posted the same phrase the account Trump screenshotted did—”Fordow is gone”—on his Instagram account, alongside a video of a massive explosion. (After WIRED published this story, Hannity appeared to have deleted the post.)

The video, however, does not show Fordow and is instead of a December 2024 Israeli strike on a missile base in Tartous, Syria. Hannity's post, which remains on the platform, had been viewed more than 5 million times as of Monday morning.

That same video and other obviously fake videos have been shared widely on platforms like X, Facebook, and TikTok, with accounts also claiming they show explosions at Fordow. In some cases, users on X asking Grok to verify the footage have been told by X's AI-powered chatbot that the footage is real—even though it is not.

Despite the pushback from his own military, Trump has continued to claim that the Fordow facility had been destroyed. “Obliteration is the accurate term,” Trump wrote on Sunday evening in a Truth Social post.

Trump's effort to frame the bombing as a decisive end to Iran's nuclear ambitions, while heavily disputed by arms control experts, was picked up by supporters who claimed the bombing raid had effectively ended any potential conflict.

“Nobody is celebrating war,” right-wing commentator Dave Rubin wrote on X on Sunday morning. “People are celebrating the end of war.” Pro-Trump commentator Ben Shapiro hailed Trump's actions as historic on his YouTube channel: “President Trump was never going to start world war three … he played this absolutely perfectly … President Trump was not dragged into a war, he managed this with absolutely stunning professionalism.”

However, just hours later, Trump raised the possibility of an extended military engagement in Iran when he suggested replacing the current leadership in a post on Truth Social.

“It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!,” Trump wrote. Trump's suggestion came after his own vice president, secretary of defense, and secretary of state had all declared that the bombing raid had nothing to do with regime change.

A MAGA cohort had warned for weeks that any attempt to replace the Iranian government would lead to a protracted war that would see US troops on the ground in the Middle East getting involved.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist who had repeatedly voiced his opposition to war with Iran, appeared to make a U-turn on Sunday evening in response to Trump's “regime change” post.

“A bottom-up revolution rises from the will of the people,” Kirk wrote on X. A top-down regime change is engineered by elites and the intel community. One is organic, the other is orchestrated, forced … President Trump is talking about an organic uprising.”

Kirk was mocked by other right-wing influencers for his U-turn. “Oh now it's TOP DOWN US led regime change that your [sic] against,” influential podcasters Keith and Kevin Hodge, wrote on X in response to Kirk. “Not just regular old regime change. We get a new and improved regime change sponsored by the intel community and defense contractors!”

While some of the loudest opponents to engaging in military activity in Iran—such as Tucker Carlson—have yet to comment on Trump's suggestion of regime change, many have criticized the weekend's incidents.

“American troops have been killed and forever torn apart physically and mentally for regime change, foreign wars, and for military industrial base profits,” US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote in a lengthy diatribe on X after the bombings. “I'm sick of it.”

Meanwhile, Alex Jones, the school-shooting conspiracist and Pizzagate conspiracy promoter who filed for bankruptcy in 2022, said Trump's regime change comments would drag US troops into the conflict.

“Now Trump joins in, essentially calling for regime change, that's called sleepwalking us into total war, not what we voted for,” Jones said on his Infowars show on Sunday night.

On Monday morning, Trump himself indicated that the fallout from the US bombing raid may continue for some time, writing a post apparently in response to speculation that Iran will close one of the world's busiest oil shipping channels, the Strait of Hormuz.

“EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN. I'M WATCHING! YOU'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY. DON'T DO IT!” Trump wrote on Truth Social, before adding: “To The Department of Energy: DRILL, BABY, DRILL!!! And I mean NOW!!!”

Over the weekend, OpenAI removed all promo materials related to its $6.5 billion buddy-buddy partnership with Apple design legend Jony Ive and their still unannounced AI-centric device. This wasn't a falling out between the two titans in tech, but rather the result of something altogether stranger. The nixed webpages and videos are due to a trademark lawsuit filed by a separate startup, iyO, which is seemingly miffed about the companies names being a single letter apart.

On July 20, California federal Judge Trina L. Thompson granted a temporary restraining order against OpenAI that forced it to remove all mentions of Ive's design company, “io.” You can still find the bromance video of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive—who helped bring us products like the iMac and iPhone—on YouTube through unofficial uploads. A page on OpenAI's site that previously talked up its partnership with Ive now reads:

“This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name “io.” We don't agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.”

What's the distinction between iyO Inc. and io, other than the inclusion of everybody's favorite sometimes vowel? iyO also makes “hardware and software allowing users to do everything they currently do on a computer, phone, or tablet without using a physical interface.” Which is to say, it's an AI device company. Jony Ive and several other ex-Apple staff founded io in 2023. Since then, it poached some big-name Apple design stars, though the company hadn't released any real products in that time. Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, helped design a button for a separate fashion designer.

iyO has been around since 2021, though its latest product—an in-ear headset called the iyO One—is still up for preorder. It's a device that claims to replace apps by letting users talk in natural language to a chatbot that then computes for you. It requires an audiologist to make an impression of your ear and costs $1,000 for a version with Wi-Fi connectivity or even more for a version with LTE. The device maker claimed in its lawsuit it is manufacturing an initial batch of 20,000 units and is still looking to raise more funds. The AI device maker sued IO Products and OpenAI earlier this month and said it was seeking an immediate restraining order and injunction to stop Ive and OpenAI from using their two-letter brand name. iyO claimed it sought some investment from OpenAI and LoveFrom, though Altman told them in March that it was “working on something competitive so will respectfully pass.”

“Defendants [AKA OpenAI and Ive] have known about the existence of iyO, the iyO Marks, and the nature of iyO's technology since at least 2022,” the AI device maker claims in its lawsuit. “Indeed, the parties had a series of meetings with representatives of OpenAI's principal, Sam Altman, and designers from LoveFrom Inc., a design studio founded by Jony Ive, about the prospect of iyO and OpenAI working together.” For its part, OpenAI said in response to the lawsuit it had decided not to pursue any collab or funding with iyO. The makers of ChatGPT said it surveyed many existing commercial AI devices in the run-up to its May partnership announcement. Ive even went as far as to say the Rabbit R1 and Humane Ai Pin were “very poor products.”

The name “io” derives from a tech term referring to “input/output,” such as the “IO ports” like USB or HDMI you may find on a typical PC. In a statement published on the opening salvo for the lawsuit, iyO cofounder Justin Rugolo said OpenAI was trying to “trample” on the rights of his “small startup.” Rugolo also claimed he had messaged Altman saying that investors were concerned about confusion surrounding the company's names. Rugolo complained that OpenAI had previously sued a separate artificial intelligence company, Open Artificial Intelligence, over a similar trademark claim.

At the very least, this lawsuit offers a few more slim details about what Ive and Altman have in store. In its response to iyO's claims, OpenAI said, “io is at least a year away from offering any goods or services, and the first product it intends to offer is not an in-ear device like the one Plaintiff is offering.” OpenAI further suggested whatever spins out of io will be a “general consumer product for the mass market.”

It's unlikely that we'll see work stop on whatever Ive and co. are working on. There are more hearings surrounding this trademark case slated for the months ahead. The lawsuit offers yet another glimpse into the high-stakes world of AI wearable startups and just how hard it is to come up with a device that can match the versatility of an iPhone. We'll still have to wait at least a year to see if anybody can cook up something more usable than an earpiece that lets you talk to a chatbot.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in an emergency meeting on Monday that the escalating conflict in Iran “risks collapsing the global nuclear nonproliferation regime” and that if diplomacy is not pursued, “violence and destruction could reach unimaginable levels.”

The IAEA, the United Nations' international nuclear watchdog, convened the emergency meeting following US strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites this weekend. In remarks delivered to the organization's board of governors, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the IAEA, called for a “return to the negotiating table” to allow inspectors for the agency to safely assess damage to the sites and check in on Iran's nuclear stockpile.

Iran has maintained to the IAEA that no additional radiation has been monitored at the sites throughout the duration of the attacks. IAEA inspectors have not been able to inspect the sites since the crisis began earlier this month.

“IAEA inspectors are in Iran, and they are ready,” Grossi said on Monday. He added that “no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow,” but he expected that the strikes did “very significant damage.”

Fordow, a centerpiece of Iran's nuclear program and a uranium enrichment facility, was one of three sites struck by US bombs this weekend. Fordow has nearly 3,000 centrifuges stored some 90 meters underground. It was unclear as of Monday morning just how much damage the strikes did to the Fordow site, although some of the damage was visible from satellites. Natanz, another enrichment facility, as well as an important nuclear research facility near the city of Isfahan, which operates three small research reactors, were also attacked. (Israeli forces had also previously targeted Isfahan.)

It is unclear just how much nuclear material has been destroyed thus far. Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists and a member of the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, tells WIRED that it's likely that Iran, acting on probable intel about the strikes, moved its enriched uranium to different sites a few weeks ago. A political executive at Iran's state TV network said Sunday that all three sites had been evacuated before the attacks began. Experts also told WIRED that satellite imagery of Fordow from last week showed a lot of activity at the site, including trucks driving in and out.

Grossi told the IAEA board Monday that Iranian roreign minister Abbas Araghchi had sent a letter to him on June 13 claiming that the country would “adopt special measures to protect nuclear equipment and materials.”

“In my response, that same day, I indicated that any transfer of nuclear material from a safeguarded facility to another location in Iran must be declared to the agency as required under Iran's safeguard agreement, and I expressed my readiness to work with Iran on this matter,” Grossi said.

Grossi told The New York Times that he believed that Iran had moved much of its stockpile of enriched nuclear fuel.

The idea of attacking facilities working to develop nuclear power might immediately bring to mind the worst images of disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima. But experts say that even if the strikes hit crucial materials, bombing uranium enrichment sites is not likely to yield a large-scale nuclear catastrophe. Despite concerns about widespread radiation, the IAEA maintains that it doesn't “expect that there will be any health consequences for people or the environment outside the targeted sites,” Grossi said in a previous update issued Sunday.

The biggest current environmental risk from these sites, the IAEA says, is local. Uranium enrichment facilities contain toxic gases and chemicals, similar to what would be stored at any large industrial chemical plant.

The material in enrichment facilities, Wolfsthal says, “is not yet to the point where it can reach a chain reaction where it can sustain a large-scale nuclear explosion.” (The IAEA estimates that Iran has a stockpile of enriched uranium up to 60 percent—not yet high enough to make a nuclear weapon, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The IAEA did report in January that it had found a small amount of substantially more enriched uranium at the Fordow site.) Wolfsthal compares the damage that strikes on sites like Natanz can cause as analogous to a car accident.

“There's gasoline in your car,” he says. “You have a collision with your car or an accident, you might have a fire, it might even explode. There's some toxic material that might get released. But it's going to be fairly limited damage.”

There's a chance, he adds, that the attacks on Isfahan could have damaged casks holding uranium hexafluoride gas, a radioactive chemical compound, which could spread around the area. But damage from such an explosion is likely to be limited in scope.

"It's just a big, heavy gas molecule, so it's not going to go very far," Emily Caffrey, the director for the Health Physics Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News.

There is one facility in Iran that could cause significant damage if it is hit. Iran's only commercial nuclear reactor is located near the city of Bushehr; the site contains thousands of kilograms of nuclear material undergoing chain reactions to produce fuel. (Research reactors, like the ones at Isfahan, use much less fuel than commercial reactors and operate at much lower temperatures, making them less dangerous in the event of an accident.) In comments delivered a day before the US strikes, Grossi said that a strike on the plant “could result in a very high release of radioactivity to the environment.” The Israeli government said last week that its own strikes had hit Bushehr, but Israeli officials later walked back these claims.

“In my technical assessment, attacking a nuclear reactor is really, really, really, really dumb,” Wolfsthal says.

There is also a larger, more long-term environmental threat at hand: the chance that Iran takes final steps following these attacks to actually build a nuclear weapon.

“It is not lost on anybody that Israel and the United States both have nuclear weapons and have attacked Iran, that does not,” Wolfsthal says. “Russia has nuclear weapons and Ukraine does not. North Korea, which has nuclear weapons, is sitting pretty. The message here is nuclear weapons bring you security and immunity and empower you to take action against your adversaries. That's a very dangerous message that we're sending to countries that were on the cusp of nuclear options and might decide now to pursue them.”

Grossi's remarks on Monday echoed this concern.

“One thing is certain, and this is the simple truth: We will not be safer if there are more nuclear weapons in more states around the world,” he said.

Two U.S. senators have requested that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate Spotify due to allegations that the company bundled its music streaming and audiobook services into a more expensive subscription without obtaining user consent, while also reducing royalty payments to creators in the process.

On Friday, June 20, U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn and Ben Ray Luján wrote a letter to the FTC, claiming that Spotify converted standard premium subscriptions into higher-cost bundled subscriptions without informing consumers. They also highlighted that existing U.S. regulations permit digital music providers to pay a reduced music royalty rate if the subscription is bundled with other legitimate offerings.

“Spotify's intent seems clear — to slash the statutory royalties it pays to songwriters and music publishers. Not only has this harmed our creative community, but this action has also harmed consumers,” the letter states.

Last year, the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) sued Spotify for allegedly undercompensating songwriters and publishers, but the lawsuit was dismissed in January.

In March 2024, Spotify restructured its Premium tiers to include 15 hours of audiobooks, raising the price to $12 for individuals and $20 for families. Users have to manually opt out of the plan. 

This change has reportedly caused publishers to lose $230 million in the first year, according to Danielle Aguirre, executive vice president of the National Music Publishers' Association.

In a statement shared with Variety, a Spotify spokesperson noted that users were notified a month in advance about the price increase and the platform offers “easy cancellations as well as multiple plans for users to consider.”

TikTok parent ByteDance's book publisher 8th Note Press is closing up shop, according to a report from The Bookseller.

Through its #BookTok community, TikTok has become an irreplaceable engine for publishers to drive book sales; even self-published authors have found unprecedented success by capturing a viral moment on TikTok. ByteDance took the next logical step in 2023, figuring that if the app was revolutionizing book sales, then it may as well cash in on selling its own books.

But ByteDance's foray into publishing is being cut short. While authors were drawn to 8th Note Press because it seemed like its affiliation with TikTok could drive sales, the press is now telling writers that it will shut down and give them their publication rights back.

It's not clear why ByteDance has shut down the press after such a short lifespan. The company has not responded to TechCrunch's request for comment, nor has it responded to requests from any other outlets thus far.

Aflac, one of the largest insurance companies in the United States, says hackers stole an unknown quantity of its customers' personal information from its network during a cyberattack earlier this month. 

The insurance giant confirmed Friday in a legally required filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the company identified hackers in its system on June 12 and contained the incident. Aflac, which provides supplemental insurance to individuals whose expenses are not covered by their primary providers, said it was not yet known how many customers are affected by the data breach but that the personal data includes customers' claims, such as Social Security numbers and health information.

The breach also included data from Aflac's beneficiaries, employees, and agents, the company said.

Aflac said its systems were not affected by ransomware, but attributed the breach to an unspecified cybercrime group known to be targeting the U.S. insurance industry. According to its Friday press release, Aflac said the hackers used social engineering tactics to break into its network. 

An Aflac spokesperson, who did not provide their name, declined to answer TechCrunch's questions when reached by email on Monday.

Aflac, which has around 50 million customers per the company's website, is the latest U.S. insurance company to experience a cyberattack in recent weeks, amid warnings that hackers are targeting the wider insurance industry. 

John Hultquist, the chief analyst for Google's threat intelligence unit, said last week that the unit was “aware of multiple intrusions” in the U.S. that bear the hallmarks of activity linked to Scattered Spider, a loose-knit collective of hackers and tactics that rely on social engineering tactics and sometimes threats of violence to target company help desks and call centers in order to gain access to their networks.

The hackers are also reportedly behind the recent intrusions at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies, which disclosed cyberattacks this month, with disruption ongoing.

The hackers linked to Scattered Spider attacks are known to be financially motivated and have been previously linked to cyberattacks and intrusions at tech giants, casinos, and hotels, and recent data breaches across the U.K. and U.S. retail sector.

Nvidia says DeepSeek lawfully acquired H800 chips, not H100


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new report claims that Chinese AI juggernaut DeepSeek is helping China's military and intelligence operations, and may have even used shell companies to help procure Nvidia chips that are otherwise covered by export restrictions that prevent their sale to China, according to Reuters.

A senior State Department official told Reuters," We understand that DeepSeek has willingly provided and will likely continue to provide support to China's military and intelligence operations, adding the effort goes "above and beyond" open-source access to DeepSeek's AI models.

More interestingly, the official said DeepSeek was using workarounds to get access to advanced Nvidia chips, evading export controls. It is claimed DeepSeek has access to "large volumes" of Nvidia's H100 chip, which has been covered by Washington export restrictions since 2022.

It is alleged by the official in the interview that DeepSeek tried to use Southeast Asia shell companies to get around the restrictions, but wouldn't be drawn on whether it was successful in its endeavours. The same official also claimed DeepSeek was trying to access data centers in Southeast Asia to remotely access U.S. chips.

The news is a continuing sign that Chinese companies are trying their level best to skirt U.S. export restrictions to get their hands on Nvidia's coveted hardware. It follows reports of Chinese companies flying hard drives to Malaysia in suitcases to try and train AI models using Nvidia hardware in rented servers, a phenomenon Malaysia is now investigating.

However, Reuters reports that three sources familiar with the matter told the outlet that DeepSeek does indeed have H100 chips, which it procured after the U.S. banned their sale to China. Notably, it is claimed that the number is much smaller than the 50,000 chips alleged by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang in January.

Perhaps understandably, Reuters was not able to verify the number of H100 chips DeepSeek may or may not have, but Nvidia denies the claim. "Our review indicates that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100," Nvidia told Reuters.

Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, or NYK Line, is acquiring Germany's salary payment platform for seafaring workers, Kadmos, as it seeks to further expand the reach of its fintech services in the maritime sector. 

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the acquisition deal, which is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.

MIT alumni Justus Schmueser and Sasha Makarovych founded Kadmos in 2021, aiming to provide businesses, including shipowners and ship management companies, with affordable and transparent options for transferring salaries internationally, specifically for seafaring workers.  

In 2019, NYK launched a financial services platform called MarCoPay in Manila, the Philippines, offering loans and insurance for Filipino seafaring workers and their families. Since then, it has collaborated with shipowners and ship management companies, and has even acquired an Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) license from the Philippine central bank.

NYK approached Kadmos for the acquisition in line with its plan to grow its digital payment business beyond the Philippines. It plans to incorporate the Kadmos platform into MarCoPay, providing payroll solutions to seafaring workers of all nationalities. 

“Our plan is to leverage Kadmos' global reach and coverage while using advantages that MarCoPay has in the Philippines,” Makarovych told TechCrunch. “Beyond that, we are planning to use the NYK brand and reputation to grow faster in shipping and sign customers quicker – they are a widely respected brand globally recognized by the whole industry.”

Kadmos also plans to expand its capabilities beyond payroll to offer cross-border B2B payments and corporate cards. The company intends to expand its remit to also service the cruise industry, and wants to offer additional financial services for shipping companies and seafarers through a partnership with NYK, Makarovych added.

Makarovych said Kadmos' team will stay with the company, with slight adjustments to the management structure.

There are several digital payment platforms available for maritime companies, such as MarTrust, ShipMoney and Brightwell. 

Makarovych, however, thinks Kadmos stands apart thanks to its end-to-end reach, listing as examples its features that let companies operate completely cashless on vessels, including virtual point-of-sale devices and peer-to-peer transfers.

“Our cards are non-personalized and have the widest acceptance, which allows companies to roll out Kadmos to their ships very quickly without complicated card logistics,” Makarovych said. “Kadmos pricing is built in an extremely flexible way, allowing companies to cover fees for their crew in a very personalized way while staying compliant with regulations by the Maritime Labor Convention — our competition simply charges a monthly SaaS fee.”

Kadmos most recently raised a $29.5 million Series A round in 2022. The round brought Kadmos' total capital raised to $38 million. It now has more than 40 enterprise customers.

What do you need your Chromebook to do for you? If you're like most people who buy the cheaper ChromeOS-based laptops, you want it to access a browser and—if you're feeling particularly spicy—maybe a few select Android apps. The most important elements for these lightweight clamshells are normally whether it can load webpages fast, has a long-enough battery, and if it has a quality display for your average Netflix and chill session. With its latest update, Google and Lenovo are asking consumers if they are willing to drop more money on a Chromebook that's more powerful to potentially run a few AI apps on-device.

The $650 Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 doesn't have your average low-end chip made for lightweight PCs. The laptop sports 16GB of RAM alongside MediaTek's Kompanio Ultra chip. It's an 8-core processor designed specifically for Chromebooks. On paper, the Chromebook Plus 14 has some impressive specs, including an 11-core, ray tracing-capable GPU for those few games or 3D apps on Chromebook that support enhanced, realistic lighting effects. It should also supply enough juice to support up to two 4K external displays, plus it has Wi-Fi 7 connectivity.

The Chromebook Plus 14 seems designed to compare with today's AI PCs, specifically thanks to its NPU, or neural processing unit. It's a portion of the chip designed to process AI-related tasks. MediaTek said the NPU hits 50 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. That number offers a rough estimate of how well it can handle simple AI tasks. Most “AI PC” chips from companies like Intel and AMD can support 45 TOPS. As for what AI features are available at launch, that's a little more disappointing. Lenovo's laptop will get exclusive capabilities that automatically group your browser tabs, whether they're your Google Docs or internet searches. If you're the type to have too many tabs open simultaneously, it could prove an easy way to get them all contained.

Otherwise, the only other exclusive software feature is AI image editing in the Gallery app. It'll let you use Magic Eraser to remove objects in an image's background without needing an internet connection. The system is lacking any on-device Gemini chatbot. While Google didn't confirm what was coming next for Chromebooks, it implied we could eventually see some Gemini Nano language model integration on Chromebook Plus. Is that something we're really looking for? Considering how limp Microsoft's Copilot has been on PC, it's not the kind of feature we're truly jonesing for.

All Chromebook Plus models will get a few more features to add on to last year's updates. The recently introduced “Quick Access” key, which on some models replaced Caps Lock, can now generate AI images. Users can also access a “Help me read” function to break down a web page or document into more condensed bullet points with AI-generated text. Chromebooks, including non-Plus models, will be able to perform Google Lens image searches by either hitting the on-screen launcher button or using the screenshot tool. Google has been on an AI kick these past few years, and it's still promoting that you'll get a full year of Google One premium subscription with a handy 2TB of cloud storage.

These features aren't anything we haven't seen before on Google's phones or other devices. Chromebooks generally don't need anything truly special, since most people who buy one just need it for the sake of accessing browser- or cloud-based apps. Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook Plus from last year was already too expensive at $700 despite its light frame and pretty AMOLED display. Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 sports an OLED screen and what the company claims is some of the longest battery life of any Chromebook—17 hours, though that's in video streaming tests. It's also the only Chromebook that supports Dolby Atmos audio through its quad speaker system. The Chromebook 14 Plus is the most PC-like of any Chromebook ever made, but without broader app support, it can never match the versatility of other laptops running Windows 11 or Linux. If you're entrenched in the Google ecosystem and don't mind cloud-based work, most modern Chromebooks of even moderate quality will serve you well. Lenovo's latest seems to sit somewhere between great and overkill, but we'll need to do our own tests to see whether you should want a multimedia Chromebook, especially if you don't care a lick for Google's AI features.

Amazon Prime Day is not yet upon us, but that hasn't stopped deals from already popping up ahead of time. If you're looking for a superfast Windows boot drive or games drive with ample storage, this SSD deal could be the one for you. The Samsung 990 Pro 2TB may no longer be the fastest kid on the block, but if you don't have a motherboard or system that supports PCIe 5.0, then this is still one of the fastest SSDs you can get your hands on.

You can find today's SSD deal at Amazon, where Samsung's 2TB 990 Pro SSD is on sale for just $149. Although a markdown in price of $20 from the original $169 list price, the $149 deal price isn't the lowest price this SSD has ever been. Looking at my price histories, I can see that at one point it was as low as $119 for the 2TB model. With current tariff uncertainty and general price increases for memory and controllers, it's still good to see SSDs of this quality not climbing too high in price.

We reviewed the Samsung 990 Pro SSD and highlighted it as one of the best SSDs available. It's efficient, runs cool, and has top-notch performance to back up our high praise. Originally, one of our biggest concerns with Samsung's 990 Pro was the high MSRP price, but that negative aspect disappears with these price discounts. After testing, we awarded the Samsung 990 Pro an Editor's Choice award and placed it atop the list of the best SSDs.

Samsung 990 Pro 2TB SSD: now $149 at Amazon (was $169)The Samsung 990 Pro is one of the fastest and most popular PCIe Gen 4 SSDs available for both PCs and PlayStation 5 gaming. Using a 2280 form factor and M.2 connection. The 990 Pro can hit read/write speeds as high as 7,450/6,900 MB/s.

The Samsung 990 Pro drive is supported by a limited five-year manufacturer's warranty that voids should the drive reach 1,200 TBW. The 990 Pro uses Samsung's Pascal SSD controller and 176-layer V-NAND TLC memory. If you're looking for a fast drive for either your PC or a PlayStation 5 console, then you can't go far wrong with the Samsung 990 Pro.

As summer arrives, having a portable power station by your side is a lifesaver for camping excursions, van trips and outdoor parties with friends. Among the reputable brands playing in this niche, Bluetti joins the ranks of EcoFlow and Anker and provides solid and robust options for those who require power in the field.

Today, Amazon is discounting the fantastic Bluetti AC70 1000W portable power station at an all-time lowest price: Originally priced at $599, this giant is available for a paltry $328 (45% off).

See at Amazon

With a generous capacity of 768Wh and an inverter rated at 1000W (with a surge capacity of up to 2000W), this Bluetti AC70 power station is built to handle a wide range of devices from smartphones and laptops to mini-fridges and small appliances. Its powerful strike configuration includes two 1000W AC outlets, two 100W USB-C charging port, two USB-A ports, and a 12V car output, which gives you seven outputs total to charge all your needs. This power and connectivity combination gives you the capability of being able to charge multiple devices at the same time.

With an AC wall outlet, you can recharge the unit 0 to 80% in a span of 45 minutes and the complete level in 1.5 hours: no cumbersome adapters, no more than one cord. If you're off the grid, Bluetti AC70 has a solar charging capacity of up to 500W (sold separately) and allows you to charge it in 1.9 to 2.4 hours of full sun. It also charges via car port to make it even more handy so it's an all-rounder no matter what.

What's more, it uses a LiFePO4 battery which is longer-lasting, offers greater discharge efficiency and is safer than normal lithium-ion batteries. The chemistry of the battery is also famous for its reliability when exposed to poor conditions and provides consistent performance throughout its cycle of charging. The AC70 weighs 22.5 pounds which is light enough to make it travel well but heavy enough to provide serious power capabilities.

At just $328, it's hard to find a more complete package in the portable power market.

When Hideo Kojima—the man fashioned into a video game auteur out of his work on Metal Gear Solid—launched his debut title under the newly formed Kojima Productions in 2019, Death Stranding arrived shrouded in mystery and hype. Every Death Stranding trailer was full of cryptic imagery and spectral apparitions, and its stacked cast featuring Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Mads Mikkelsen set expectations sky-high. It was also the first title to come from the creator following a messy and public exodus from Konami. Would Kojima once again rewrite the rules of game design?

Upon release, Death Stranding didn't disappoint so much as it defied prediction. At its core, it was an immersive, slow-burning post-apocalyptic courier simulator. Players took control of Sam Porter Bridges, a pulp comics-esque naming convention of a protagonist suffering from aphenphosmphobia, an extreme fear of being touched, tasked with completing a herculean cross country trek across haunted landscapes by plagued eldritch horrors with the help of a baby in a container on his chest—avoiding environmental hazards and balancing parcels on every available piece of real estate on his body to “reconnect America.” Reductively, Death Stranding is regarded in gaming circles as a “triple-A” indie game, with a weird (but not overly confusingly dense) world-building serving as the connective tissue propelling every careful footstep on Sam's odyssey. What Death Stranding lacks in conventional thrills, it made up for with sheer conceptual weight.

And yes—it eerily echoed real life in ways no one expected. The game's premise, centered on isolation, bunkered survivors, and the life-or-death role of delivery drivers, landed eerily close to home mere months before the world locked down due to a global pandemic. It was dubbed “the game that predicted 2020,” not a first for Kojima, and not unfairly.

Being a “big idea game” comes with its own set of challenges. Its narrative often gets buried beneath a slow drip of actual story progression, unraveling across long stretches of gameplay that make the usual open-world promise of “you see that mountain, you can go there” feel strangely perfunctory. Former Kotaku writer Tim Rogers once likened it to eating your vegetables before dessert, but I'd argue it's closer to gaming's purest example of the carrot-on-a-stick design—except here, the carrot is a 10-minute cutscene stylized as gaming's navel-gazing at wanting to be cinema, and the stick is a seven-hour hike.

Kojima's eccentric roster of superpowered, trauma-scarred outcasts occasionally interrupts the lonely, meditative rhythm of traversal with dense lore drops laced in pun-heavy dialogue. At times, it's profound; at others, it teeters dangerously close to groan-worthy. Much of Death Stranding‘s script leans into Kojima's newfound signature use of homonyms and wordplay—an approach that often thrives in Japanese, a language rich in double meanings and visual punning through kanji. There, it probably lands with layered nuance; in English, it falls somewhere between a dad joke and a freshman poetry slam stanza.

Still, despite its long stretches of powerwalking monotony, the challengingly Metal Gear-esque moments of tactical espionage, Monster Energy product placement, and the memes about Norman Reedus and his funky fetus that spawned endless parody, there's a rich, strange beauty to the first Death Stranding. It's a game worth experiencing once, and then revisiting vicariously through those who have dissected its mythos in in-depth essays and lore videos. Its legacy is secured not just as a bold experiment but as a haunting artifact of the pre-pandemic world—one that resonates differently, and maybe more profoundly, in hindsight.

Personally, while I appreciated the high-concept ambition of Death Stranding, I struggled with it and ultimately lost interest. It felt more like a conceptual art piece than a fully realized game. An intellectual exercise whose ideas overshadowed the experience and gratification of playing it. As someone who values creative works that marry emotional gravity with speculative cultural context, I often found Death Stranding‘s narrative throughlines reaching further than they could fully grasp. The worldbuilding fascinated me far more than the story it was built to support.

Now, six years later, with Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, set to release later this week, I spent 65 hours to hit the credits (with hours left of pending deliveries still in transit, and roads unbuilt) of the highly anticipated sequel and feel nearly the opposite. Where the first Death Stranding felt like a conceptual mood board come to life, this sequel is more narratively grounded. It's like a musician remixing their greatest hits with a tighter production—fewer self-indulgent lyrical bars, more emotional clarity. Granted, it's still a story that's got its foibles. But this time it lands more often than it drifts into the faux profundity of its predecessor.

Set 11 months after the events of the original game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach picks up with Sam and his bridge baby, Lou, living off the grid. Fragile (Seydoux) arrives on his doorstep with a job that pulls the freelance courier back into the field. This time, the mission is to integrate Mexico into the United Cities of America's ever-expanding chiral network. Essentially, Sam is tasked with lacing up his boots and trekking across the continent, linking his USB dog tag key fob to bunker mailboxes and connecting settlements to their supernatural strand-based Wi-Fi.

The game is self-aware enough to admit its familiar call to action—more trekking, more connecting—but framed with a wink. Rebuilding the world, one footstep at a time, shouldn't be too difficult since you've done it before and came out straight… until it is. Just as Sam nears the end of what seems like a modest fetch-quest, the story swerves dramatically, widening its scope to extend the network to Australia as well. From here, the narrative spirals into something far more ambitious, involving the return of Sam's rival Higgs (Troy Baker) and his newfound mech-ghost army, as well as a new antagonist not-so-subtly modeled after Metal Gear Solid‘s Snake, Neil (Luca Marinelli).

Joining Sam on this escalating journey are fresh faces like Tarman (modeled after Mad Max director George Miller), Rainy (played by Deadpool Yukio actor Shioli Kutsuna), Dollman (modeled after director Faith Akin and played by Jonathan Roumie), and a mysterious girl named Tomorrow (Elle Fanning), alongside returning allies liked Deadman (modeled after director Guillermo del Toro and played by Jesse Corti) and Heartman (modeled after Nicolas Winding Refn and played by Darren Jacobs).

In Death Stranding 2, managing Sam still feels like you've adopted a rugged, soft-spoken post-apocalyptic Tamagotchi. You're constantly tending to his hygiene with showers and potty breaks to get the blood, dirt, and gunk of the day off his person, recalibrating his loadout in a Tetris-like inventory grid that can quickly collapse like Jenga if a BT±the inky monstrosities that stalk the lands, injecting bursts of pulse-spiking horror into On The Beach‘s walking sim vibes on a dime—knocks him and his tower of cargo off balance.

Between encounters, Sam needs snack breaks—munching stamina-restoring larvae, taking swigs from his canteen, or tapping into blood bags that serve as makeshift health kits during especially sticky scuffles. It's a loop that's both ritualistic and irksome, but weirdly intimate. Once I settled back into its rhythm, carefully balancing weight by holding down triggers, preplanning my cargo, and eyeing every lost parcel, and negotiating whether I should add it to Sam's burden as humanity's pack mule because it's destination is “on the way,” I started to embrace the strange zen of it all.

Unlike my first go-around with its predecessor, there's something endearingly relatable about overloading Sam with gear, teetering under the weight of ambition and generosity like a dad determined to carry all the grocery bags in one go, rather than humoring a second trip. It also didn't hurt that completing deliveries rewarded me with tools to make traversal less tedious by providing me material to construct roads to make traversal less of a pain in the ass, and tracks to add to a playlist so I can whistle as I work (so long as I was in areas I've given chiral network coverage to). This became even more manageable when vehicles and ziplines came into play, turning multi-trip dread into a cross-country trip with a rig built for warfare, or trucker hauls to build more pavement between settlements like I was Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Dollman serves as Sam's ever-present companion throughout On the Beach, functioning like a clip-on belt charm meets hiking buddy. He fills the silence of On the Beach‘s often monotonous walking with commentary, assists with surveillance when attempts at stealth run sideways, and even offers tips when you get sidetracked hyperfixating on building roads, by reminding you of your main objective. He's basically to Sam what Mimir was to Kratos in God of War, but filtered through Kojima's eccentric lens. Whether it's reconnaissance for combat or providing emotional ballast during the journey, Dollman's low-frame-rate presence is as functional as it is oddly comforting.

While most of Sam's allies don't accompany you physically, they remain present in quieter, digital ways—checking in through social media-like SMS updates and snapshots of their day-to-day while you're en route to the next locale. These messages arrive as you slog through treacherous terrain, building roads, bridges, and generators across a landscape slowly being shaped by your own hands, like creating natural trails on a nature path, and by the footprints and constructive efforts of other players in the game's online asynchronous network. You can like their structures, read stray bits of encouraging signs, and even borrow their vehicles, creating a soft echo of camaraderie amid the isolation.

It transforms what could have been a dreadful, monotonous string of fetch quests into something quietly meaningful. My deliveries and infrastructure work stopped feeling like solo busy work and instead became part of a larger, shared mission—a collective effort tethered to the game's thematic core. What's more, unlike the first game's narrative, which leans more into abstract meditations on connection, Death Stranding 2 is anchored in a leaner, plot-driven momentum, planting seeds of hope as you journey with Sam to his more personal story of overcoming loss and navigating a future for himself. I was reminded, in both subtle story beats and asynchronous multiplayer gestures, that I wasn't hauling this burden alone. Whether it was an anchor left on the side of a mountain that someone else left behind, or a message warning me of hazards on my route, there's a persistent sense that others, virtual or otherwise, had my back when a climb began to feel insurmountable.

But among this broader feeling of connection it's Seydoux's Fragile who's the real anchor to On the Beach this time around. She captains Drawbridge, a submersible airship that doubles as the mission's hub and lifeline for Sam's motley crew, making her role feel far more central and emotionally resonant than before. And while Sam's band of allies mostly keep their presence to cutscenes, they're no longer just digital marionettes of Kojima's excessive lore dumps. They feel more like an evolving found family—integrated into the narrative and Sam's mission, not just orbiting around it. There's a greater sense that they're in the trenches with him, not standing on the sidelines posing dramatically for motion capture posterity.

If all of the above has sounded overwhelming… it is. Kojima Productions has kept it in mind, with both a recap video that summarizes the broad strokes of its first game to get new and old players up to speed, and the inclusion of an interactive real time glossary that pings on the top right corner of the screen with the introduction of new proper nouns and terms, making it easy for players to keep Death Stranding‘s ever-expanding lexicon and story developments straight by referring back to Corpus, its heavily annotated virtual database tome.

Away from its dense worldbuilding however, from the first frame of Death Stranding 2 Kojima is fully in his cinematic bag. The opening scene of the game is so photorealistic that I had to blink twice trying to decipher when it transitioned from drone footage to an in-engine render of a mountainside, which immediately asked me to walk from the top of a mountain to Sam's hidden abode.

Death Stranding 2‘s tone is rich and indulgent, often bordering on decadent. There's a self-aware messiness to how it picks up the narrative shards of its first game. Some characters, like Mama (Margaret Qualley) and Die-Hard Man (Tommie Earl Jenkins), are benched, while others, like Fragile, are further expanded upon. Most prominently, On the Beach‘s plot reimagines its linear progression in favor of crafting a new odyssey that is less “pandemic prophetic” and more centered on connections reinforced by the process of grieving, and rebuilding after suffering a tragic loss. While the game is literally about bringing humanity whole again by your lonesome, this time around its about uniting the entire globe as Sam terraforms Australia and Mexico, building bridges to reconnect the straggling, hikikomori vestiges of humanity.

Gameplay-wise, On The Beach continues to oscillate between a meditative hiking simulator and a sprawling cinematic spectacle full of hype moments and aura—the latter dangling like a shiny reward at the far end of a grueling pilgrimage. I routinely tiptoed through ruins, mercenary outposts, and ghost-drenched wastelands, cradling Lou with each stumble or misstep as my carefully stacked tower of weaponry threatened to topple over. Its geometric minefield of picturesque terrain is still as oppressive as it could be in the first, if not more so, as I found myself dangling off cliffsides, braving torrential rivers, and inching up icy escarpments, one calculated movement at a time (albeit often followed by an improvised one). On The Beach is sequel-scaled, yes—but purposeful, not padded.

What lands differently this time is Sam himself. He no longer marches forward as the gruff, unflinchingly obedient, and politically agnostic mailman resigned to his fate that he once was. Instead, he surprised me by questioning the very foundation of his mission. Not in intentionally sly (but groanworthy) meta jabs of the first game, where he compares himself to Mario looking for his “Princess Beach,” but with sincere moral unease. Reconnecting the world doesn't sound as noble when it starts to look like he's just doing the legwork for post-apocalyptic imperialism for America, which he surprisingly calls into question in the game's early stages.

The seeds of conflict in On the Beach plant between reconnection and overreach, healing and haunting, and they give it a more chaotic, more human pulse. It's messier, less abstract, and far more emotionally legible than its predecessor. Moment-to-moment, the traversal remains the core attraction of On the Beach. You're not just moving, you're mapping, adapting, and experimenting. Think The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom‘s improvisation meets Phantom Pain‘s stealth improvisations when things break bad, and you're suddenly cornered without the proper tools to get from point A to point B. The gunplay combat is still there. Crank the difficulty up a notch to the highest difficulty, and the enemy AI gets surprisingly savvy and savage, allowing for Dishonored-style stealth and tense firefights that feel genuinely earned when you defeat waves of enemies.

But that's never really where the heart of On the Beach lies. Where the first game made you slog for hours before it let its story moments rear their head, On the Beach hits its pace faster. While picking up the pieces of global tragedies, such as the pandemic, is still in the DNA of On the Beach‘s pathos, gone is the heavy reliance on it as an allegory. In its place is something more introspective, present-minded, universal, and grounded than it is speculative. Less “look how prophetic and smart we were” and more, “how do we pick up the pieces and properly reconnect?”

Once you get used to the terrain puzzles of each of On the Beach‘s landmarks—when your instincts kick in and the map becomes muscle memory—those fetch quests start feeling therapeutic in a way. The traversal, not the combat, becomes the game's engine. Sure, the Silent Hill-coded BT encounters and MGS-inspired skirmishes inject tension and excitement, but it's the quiet rhythm between them that defines the journey.

Sam now feels more like a protagonist in his own story. No longer a cipher for Kojima's pun-laden essays on connection, he finally clicks into place as he navigates the next steps in his journey alongside the mission he's been saddled with. The real drama, while compelling, isn't the firefights with Higgs or sussing out Neil's deal; it's whether Sam has the confidence to trust his legs, his gear, and the chart he's set for his journey.

In the lead-up to On the Beach‘s release, Kojima confessed that early playtest feedback made him uneasy, not because it was negative, but because it was too positive. He purportedly worried the game might come across too mainstream, so made adjustments, presumably with the intent to make Death Stranding‘s friction more impactful, and occasionally more hostile, to its players. Around the 70 percent mark of the game, I felt the weight of that philosophy first hand, when the somewhat easy sailing of On the Beach‘s gameplay up to that point turned downright oppressive. There was a moment where I hated the game for a solid five-hour stretch, due to how granularly tedious, and outlandish, the delivery demands became.

I still don't entirely love On the Beach having navigated that momentary frustration, either. However, I do appreciate how it made me value the things I didn't like about the first, namely the sense of place earned in Death Stranding‘s world by navigating it on your own two feet. I would never have imagined the game would have me go from abandoning a tower of weaponry on my backpack, to carrying an emu across a haunted mountain range, gazing from its crest to catch the sunrise, and hearing a rooster crow as if I had reached a sacred checkpoint. It's absurd. It's poignant. It's Kojima. New tracks to add to your playlist cue when near your destination, like divine applause. I started treating Sam like a Tamagotchi—testing his limits, suffering with him, learning to pivot when everything collapses. Your hubris becomes your strategy. Your journey becomes a ritual that I couldn't help but love, albeit in a masochistic sense, as a player.

On the Beach‘s narrative speaks louder and clearer than its predecessor. Its story, while still strange, is more coherent—its symbolism less cluttered by its vocabulary. At times, it plays like a proof-of-concept for Kojima's inevitable foray into filmmaking. But there's beauty in its broken pacing. After surviving that five-hour gauntlet of pure punishment, the final act delivers in spades. Yes, the game is maddeningly back-loaded—but it's worth it.

What's most surprising is how Kojima's signature penchant for weirdness, once a shield for abstraction, now feels like scaffolding for something more emotionally grounded. It's tighter, and stronger for it, and even willing to poke fun at itself to show it's learned from experience, to the point there were times I felt like I was sincerely laughing with Kojima, not at his trademark absurdity.

On the Beach still demands a ton of patience. It still punishes, but it also rewards, with a narrative that feels sculpted rather than splattered. Where its predecessor felt like a rambling, late-night text, On the Beach is what happens when those thoughts are carved into marble for all to see. The glossary breaks, the combat struggles, the endless geometric trek, and, most of all, the exceptional acting on display from its stellar cast—they all contribute to a finale that lands with surprising elegance.

If On the Beach proved anything, it's that Kojima—eccentric, indulgent, brilliant—still knows how to make the absurd feel resonant. This sequel isn't just an echo of the first. It's the payoff. It's the strange, painstaking journey I hoped for the first time around—and somehow, against all odds, it sticks the landing in spite of it all.

Users warn against installing the IT5701/5702 update

A firmware update for Gigabyte's RGB lighting controller is reportedly causing issues for users, as pointed out by various social media posts online. In a recent case, Charlie (@ghost_motley) on X highlighted a concern with a firmware package for the RGB controller listed on the Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard support page, which added support for Windows Dynamic Lighting.

The firmware update in question is the Gigabyte IT5701/ 5702 RGB lighting controller firmware upgrade package with version 1.0.0.9 dated 24 November, 2024. After installing the update and rebooting, the user noticed that not only was Windows Dynamic Lighting unavailable, but the motherboard's onboard RGB lighting was completely non-functional. Their PC would shut down normally; however, the CPU fan continued to spin. Re-running the tool made no difference, and the update managed to brick the Q-Flash Plus feature (Gigabyte's BIOS update utility) from working on the particular motherboard.



As pointed out, performing a quick search for terms like “bricked Gigabyte LED update” or “IT5701/IT5702 Gigabyte” reveals multiple forum threads detailing similar problems. The issue is clearly widespread and is not just limited to the above-mentioned motherboard but across Gigabyte's 600 and 700 series motherboards with RGB lighting.

A similar case, posted by u/PuzzleheadedClue7694 on Reddit, involves a Gigabyte B650 GAMING X AX (rev. 1.3) motherboard. The user claims to have followed the procedure of updating the firmware, only to notice that the progress was stuck and the PC had to be restarted after five minutes. This ended in the RGB lighting being stuck on a rainbow pattern, and using Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software did not help either. The user went on to use SignalRGB, a popular unified RGB control software, which could not recognize the RGB headers on the motherboard.

Another user on Reddit ended up with a bricked Gigabyte B650E Aorus Elite AX V2 motherboard after attempting the same IT5701/5702 RGB controller firmware update. According to u/vReadyyy, they ran the flash.bat file with administrator privileges, but during the update process, the PC stopped responding. Eventually, the user was forced to shut the system down. Upon reboot, the system failed to POST with the CPU debug LED indicator turned on. Despite recovery attempts including CMOS reset and Q-Flash BIOS recovery, the board remained unresponsive.

We have reached out to Gigabyte for a statement regarding the issue; however, the company wasn't immediately available for comment. For now, users of Gigabyte 600 and 700 series motherboards are advised to avoid flashing the IT5701/5702 RGB controller firmware update. In addition to that, updating the firmware using the Gigabyte Control Center (GCC) utility for Windows can also potentially create problems; thus, we do not recommend taking that path.

A possible solution for those who were unable to successfully apply the update is this guide, which explains the issue and offers a step-by-step process on how to safely update the RGB controller firmware and possibly fix the issue. However, if this process still does not solve the problem, you may have a hardware-level issue and need to visit the Gigabyte service center.

The performance increase looks poor compared to the increased power consumption, though.

An Asus ROG Astral LC RTX 5090 has been shunt modded, resulting in its performance eclipsing the $10,000 RTX Pro 6000. This kind of PCB surgery mod is notorious for resulting in damaged graphics cards, so please monkey-see monkey-do with extreme caution. However, the video of this particular feat was put together by overclocking legend Der8auer, so everything went extremely smoothly and to plan. Below, we will ponder over the process, the results, and consider whether the work and risks are worth it.

As briefly mentioned above, shunt modding can be dangerous to the life of your GPU. If mistakes are made, your $$$ GPU could degrade slowly, or become toast extremely quickly. As well as any concerns about the actual mod to the PCB, remember that any strain on the 16-pin power connector could become even more perilously high at 800W.

Der8auer told viewers that he waited until he could get a capable AiO card for this shunt mod experiment, as it should be better at handling the greater power. And indeed, the Asus ROG Astral LC RTX 5090 runs quieter than the ‘vanilla' Astral, according to the overclocker. All else being equal, the Astral cards offer a welcome degree of parameter adjustment and monitoring options via Asus GPU Tweak III – this will be useful later.

First things first, Der8auer set a baseline for out-of-the-box Astral LC RTX 5090 performance. During this initial assessment, he observed that it was hitting the standard 600W power target constantly when under load, but seemed “pretty quiet” and capable of handling more juice. It was concluded by the OC expert that the 600W limit was definitely reducing OC potential.

Now the decision had been made and baselines recorded – it was time to crack open the LC and mod the PCB. We won't get into the details of how to shunt mod, but you can see an overview of the procedure in the video embedded above. But in brief, the mod is rather straightforward. It simply requires changes to be made to the resistors coming from the power connector to ‘fool' the controlling circuitry into thinking less power is coming in to the PCB than there actually is... With the resistor replacements Der8auer chose, the mod would allow “us in theory to get about 30% higher power draw without the card noticing.” Thus, a separate piece of hardware, called WireView, would be used to see the actual power draw. In the case of the Astral cards, you also have pin sensing on the 16-pin power input, so that is another view of the incoming power that is available, and should remain useful.

The mod went well, and WireView reported about 660 to 700W being used under modest benchmark loads. That contrasts with the GPU-Z readout of around 500W. It was also observed that there was 15 to 20% more headroom left until the new power limit would be hit.

During fresh benchmarks, the CPU only occasionally ran into the new power limit; most of the time, it seems to be at around 750W during the tests. Then it was decided to delve into manual overclocking, with acceptable temperatures and noise levels continuing.

To conclude, the shunt-modded RTX 5090 beats the $10,000 RTX Pro 6000, but only just. You can also see an alarmingly higher power consumption vs both the unmodded RTX 5090 and the professional graphics card with its 96GB VRAM. Der8auer was pleased and called the result “quite nice.” However, we think it is worth underlining our earlier comments about the dangers of doing a shunt mod on expensive graphics cards.

A visit to one of Unifi's last remaining US polyester plants, in Yadkinville, North Carolina, can make you feel like an optimist.

After driving through a sweet little neighborhood of small homes, you crest the hill and see the Unifi facility on your right: giant silver-gray buildings perched on a tidy, gently rolling lawn that looks like an advertisement for organic milk. A small solar farm sits off to the side, and 18-wheelers branded in grass-green and sky-blue livery pull in and out of the property, dropping off clean PET plastic flake and picking up shipments of polyester fiber.

This is the flagship factory where one of the world's most popular so-called sustainable fibers is manufactured: polyester made from recycled plastic bottles. In the last 18 years, more than 42 billion bottles have flowed globally through the owned and partner facilities of Unifi and been turned into a branded polyester fabric Unifi calls Repreve.

Unifi pioneered this eco-friendly fabric, but today it is far from the only recycled polyester maker. According to Textile Exchange, an industry group that has been pushing the fashion industry to commit to recycled polyester, the apparel industry used 32 million metric tons of polyester fiber in 2019, and approximately 14 percent of this was recycled. That's the equivalent of almost 16 billion bottles a year.

Unifi is unique in one sense, though. Traditionally, polyester manufacturers are hidden in the back of fashion's supply chain. They sell to fabric mills, which sell to garment factories, which sell to brands, which sell to you. But Unifi is special; not only does it have a strong relationship with brands, the brands brag to shoppers about using Repreve in their garments.

Follow the green and blue ceiling decor as it swishes through the all-white, modern lobby of Unifi, past the recycling and compost receptacles, and into a large meeting room, and you'll see some of the wares created with Repreve: Ugg fuzzy slippers, Rothy's ballet flats, Nike sneakers, Levi's stretch jeans, a Patagonia fleece, a Quicksilver fuzzy camouflage hoodie, a North Face jacket, and an Asics sports bra.

Plastic bottles destined for recycling.

Repreve's promise to brands and shoppers is that turning bottles into fiber reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60 percent when compared to virgin polyester fiber, and water consumption by up to two-thirds. Unifi and its brand partners (like the ones I saw in the showroom, and more) also claim to keep old water bottles from going to landfills, incinerators, or the ocean.

It's because of this promise that this Unifi factory survived the Great Offshoring of textile manufacturing, and the onslaught of cheap Chinese polyester.

Not everyone agrees recycled polyester is part of a better future. Nike is one of Unifi's biggest customers and has bragged that the sportswear brand alone diverts more than one billion plastic bottles a year from landfills and waterways. In May of 2023, a Missouri consumer filed a greenwashing lawsuit against Nike, alleging in part that the recycled polyester in Nike's shoes and shirts isn't actually sustainable. The lawsuit was dismissed, along with a similar complaint against H&M, but it expressed a bubbling resentment against corporations that use recycled polyester to green up their image without addressing the many other forms of environmental and human damage of plastic fashion.

Bottle-to-polyester recycling, once thought to be a key tool in combating our global plastic pollution problem, has been under fire for a few years. “We've been led to believe that recycled and sustainable are synonymous, when they are anything but,” Maxine Bédat, executive director of the New Standard Institute, a nonprofit pushing for a sustainable fashion industry, told The Guardian in 2021. (When I asked her if she stands by that statement today, she said yes.)

I'm here in Yadkinville because I wanted to see this operation for myself and decide: Is recycled polyester actually sustainable? Or, as many now claim, is it greenwashing, a get-out-of-jail-free card for brands who want to look like they're saving the planet while going on with their toxic, fossil-fueled business as usual?

Over the past two years, that question has morphed into an even more fraught one: Does this factory provide the kind of good, safe factory jobs that Americans say they yearn for, and that Trump's proposed tariffs purport to bring back to our shores?

Unifi CEO Eddie Ingle may look like one of the North Carolina good ol' textile boys—gray hair parted to the side, a neat button down and slacks—but he has a clipped Irish accent, visits the farmers market on Saturdays, and drives a Tesla. He started out as an entry-level mechanical engineer in Ireland, moved to North Carolina in 1987 to join Unifi, and ended up staying for 40 years, with just two years away, before returning in 2020 to take the helm as CEO.

His paternal pride in his workforce can seem vintage.

“The Unifi people, they are just good North Carolinians,” he tells me over a lunch of fried chicken and mashed potatoes in an old farmhouse that Unifi owns, and which serves as a sort of bed and breakfast for visiting fashion professionals. “They're conscientious, they're hard-working. A lot of our managers have been here 25, 30 years.“ (A third of the company's workforce has been there that long, in fact.) “It's clean, it's safe, and there's a lot of room for advancement. We have good wages, we offer nice benefits.”

“Certainly the labor force has changed a lot over the last 40 years since I've been here,” he adds.

North and South Carolina together used to be a leading global textile hub. The White Oak mill of Cone Mills was once the largest denim mill in the world, and it operated for over 100 years in Greensboro, less than an hour from Unifi's headquarters.

The floor of a Unifi factory, where plastic bottles are processed to create synthetic yarn fiber.

Like many textile plants across the Southeast, Cone‘s White Oak mill is closed now, one of the many casualties of the great textile offshoring of the late 1990s and early 2000s. There are still a few textile and dye manufacturers around the Carolinas, but the bustling fabric industry in the Greensboro area has given way to pharmaceutical plants, dog food factories, and Amazon warehouses delivering Chinese-made goods.

According to a (yes, self-mythologizing but extremely detailed) history book that Unifi gave me, through the late '90s, Unifi was known as a fiercely competitive innovator that went from win to win, absorbing smaller polyester companies and going public. It was the place to work, a relief from the heat of North Carolina's tobacco and cotton farms.

A lot of Unifi's growth, according to its history book, came from its salesmen convincing brands to try synthetics for an increasing array of products, from drapes to automotive carpeting and military tents. You could make the argument that Unifi is partly responsible for the plasticization of fabrics. Today, polyester makes up more than half of all fashion textiles produced worldwide.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, China was a huge market for Unifi. Unifi says that it and one of its biggest competitors, Macfield (with which it would later merge) were together shipping a million pounds of polyester a week to China. But, the company says, by 1985 China had greatly expanded its own synthetic manufacturing capacity, and slapped tariffs on American polyester. The tide began to shift to the other shore.

The North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994, and when China joined the WTO in 2001, a flood of cheap fabrics crashed into the United States. "Between 1997 and 2009, more than 650 textile plant facilities closed in the United States," notes the Textile Heritage Museum in Burlington, North Carolina. Unifi's history book says of the 115 American polyester manufacturing companies in the 1970s, only 12 remain in business as of 2022, when the book was published.

The Chinese government was financially supporting the growth of its textile industry; it became impossible for American polyester producers to compete. “They were selling below raw material costs,” former president Tom Caudle told the company's biographer. “For the next five to seven years we couldn't shut plants down fast enough and consolidate fast enough to keep up.”

Unifi survived, though it shrank and laid off hundreds of employees, closed several plants, and stopped trying to compete with China's cheap polyester. Instead, it sources PET resin, then melt-extrudes it and does what is called texturing, covering, and twisting to turn it into high-end, functional fabrics that have built-in features like water repellency or fire retardancy. Still, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan have a way of copying our innovations, and then doing them with as much skill, for cheaper.

About 70 percent of that polyester is now made in China.

It was around 2000 that Unifi discovered the fabric that would save its business. It was trying to recycle some bad runs of polyester that would have normally gone in the trash. Even after mixing in virgin PET flake, the experimental product from Unifi and other mills was at first low quality and manila-folder yellow, only suitable to be dyed and put into a fuzzy fleece, and that is where it went. (Both PolarTec and Patagonia had launched their recycled polyester fleece in 1993, though it's unclear if they launched it together in a partnership.)

Repreve yarn.

After years of work to create a process that would purify the waste flake so it could be made into a high-quality, white polyester thread, Unifi debuted Repreve at the Outdoor Retailer show in 2004. After a few years, it took off.

Fashion brands did not need much convincing to switch to Unifi's new fabric. It had the sheen of sustainability without the unreliability of cotton (a seasonal crop with human rights issues) or the stigma of wool (which draws the ire of animal rights activists). It also came with a ready-made marketing story, literally—Repreve products are sold with a green hang tag in the shape of a water bottle that will sometimes even say how many used bottles went into that particular product.

Ingle says the fashion brands Unifi works with “don't have to compromise anything” when they choose Repreve for their garments. “They might have paid a little bit more, but the quality of the product is in many ways better.”

While rumors of fake recycled polyester dog the industry overall, Repreve is also infused with a proprietary chemical tracer, so the material can be tested to ensure it was actually made in a Unifi facility of old bottles.

Since Repreve was launched, it has grown to make up 30 percent of Unifi's revenue. Sold at a premium price, it's been a bright spot for Unifi even when overall demand for fashion and fashion materials has fallen into a global post-pandemic slump. In February 2024, Unifi told investors it would cut costs and focus on Repreve to shore up its finances.

“I'm fairly convinced we wouldn't be where we are today without it,” Ingle says of Repreve. Usually, the textile business is seen as dirty and outdated. But the Repreve factory in North Carolina buzzes with new machinery and young engineers. “You can attract people when you're in the sustainability business,” he says.

Seen up close, Repreve seems like a win for the environment and a win for American jobs. “Brands like Adidas, Nike, Patagonia, The North Face, they've got all these big commitments around sustainability. If they didn't have a regional secure supply of recycled yarn, there would be a lot of businesses that would just be moved to Asia,” Ingle says.

But once you step outside the factory, the picture gets muddy.

When Coca-Cola first introduced its PET plastic bottle in 1978, Unifi's founder Allen Mebane worried the beverage industry would take up all the supply of PET resin. Instead, 20 years later, the opposite has happened, with polyester plants buying up the supply of used water bottles. Forty to 60 truckloads of plastic waste get dropped off at Unifi's bottle processing plant per week, bought from material recovery facilities as far away as Michigan and Maine.

In 2023, the CBC did a high-profile investigative piece into fashion's greenwashing, and focused most of its critique on recycled polyester. “If you're using plastic bottles, you're actually taking bottles out of a potentially closed-loop recycling system, and then giving them a one-way ticket to a landfill disposal,” George Harding-Rolls, a sustainable fashion advocate, told the CBC.

But most bottles aren't being recycled anyway. The collection rates for PET plastic started rising around the time Unifi debuted Repreve, hitting 30 percent in 2012 and hovering around there for a decade. Meanwhile, demand for recycled PET from both the fashion and packaged food industry, who have both committed to sourcing recycled material, has soared. It's expected to outpace supply by 2030.

“You know who's complaining about it? The bottle companies,” Ingle says. “Because they believe the textile industry is taking their bottles.”

“Is that true?” I ask.

“Well, yeah,” he laughs. “The market for recycled bottles is very transparent. The price of recycled bottles changes twice or sometimes three times a week. So if you want to buy a bottle and turn that bottle back into a bottle, have at it. Nobody is stopping the bottle industry from doing that.”

Well, there is one thing. Unifi's willingness to pay more for old bottles, because it's turning them into a premium product that brands and consumers will pay more for, may be driving the market rate of old water bottles up. But nobody wants to pay more for a soda in a bottle made with recycled plastic.

A Unifi manufacturing plant.

When I tour the bottle processing plant, large bales of crushed plastic packaging, each averaging roughly 1,000 pounds, are lined up, ready to be run through the sorting, cleaning, and flaking process. There's a clear difference in quality between the clean and uniform bales from states like Michigan, Maine, Vermont, and New York that mandate deposits of a few cents on bottles to incentivize collection, and the chaotic and dirty bales from states that treat recycling as a purely volunteer activity.

North Carolina made it illegal to throw out plastic water bottles in 2009, but despite pleas to supply local industry with material so it can create jobs, a 2021 report put the state's PET recycling rate at a measly 8 percent. Ingle thinks if North Carolina passed a bottle bill that levied a 5- or 10-cent deposit on each bottle, Unifi could get everything it needs from within its borders. “Unifi is involved at the state level in various efforts to increase the recycling rates of PET post-consumer bottles,” he later wrote by email.

So what we seem to have is not a demand problem, but a supply problem born of bad government policy.

Kirstie Pecci, executive director of Just Zero, a nonprofit that works across the country on waste issues, sees all bottle recycling—no matter what they are made into—as more insidious. “You're giving cover to a bad practice, which is putting beverages or food in plastic. We should not be drinking or eating out of plastic in any way, shape, or form.”

And what about claims that turning bottles into polyester locks PET into a landfill-bound product? Sure, some polyester clothing is for all intents and purposes a single-use product. (Hello, ugly $7 polyester dress bought off of Instagram.) But not the PETA-approved recycled polyester fill inside my well-loved puffy hiking jacket, the knit uppers of my Nike running shoes, or the recycled polyester yoga leggings that I can't bring myself to get rid of because they still look perfect after seven solid years of use.

Polyester, for all its faults, does perform. It's lightweight, durable, impervious to water, and increases the durability of any garment it is in. Is it overused? Yes, of course. Polyester baby onesies are an abomination. But I can't imagine doing serious outdoor activities like camping, jogging, or snowboarding without synthetics of some sort.

As I've reported, the fashion industry has been looking for a way to recycle polyester garments into polyester fabric, instead of relying on bottles to make more raw fabric. Unifi has been recycling preconsumer waste polyester fabric into polyester fabric for over a decade, for The North Face. It has a textile take-back program in the US, and last year expanded its textile-to-textile recycling to its plants in China. But this is almost completely repurposed factory waste.

The barriers to recycling post-consumer polyester into polyester are almost completely out of Unifi's control. Post-consumer polyester fashion is almost always mixed with other materials and hung with zippers and trims. And according to Meredith Boyd, Unifi's chief product officer, it is often dyed, printed, and finished with substances that would become so toxic if they were run through the high-temperature recycling process that doing so would be an OSHA violation.

Last year, H&M announced that it is committing to buy $600 million of recycled polyester over seven years from Syre, a Swedish startup that chemically recycles polyester by breaking it down into monomers and then remanufacturing it. Syre says it will open its first pilot plant by the end of this year, and build more plants with the aim of producing 3 million metric tons of circular polyester in a decade, including a gigascale plant in Vietnam in 2027.

When I ask, Ingle says he is excited for the new chemical recycling technologies coming up, because Unifi can buy that recycled raw material and spin it into fiber. “It took 50 years to build out the virgin infrastructure. It won't take 50 years to build out the chemical recycling infrastructure, but it's going to happen and we're going to be right there,” he says.

The plastic flake that is eventually processed into Repreve recycled polyester.

There are legitimate questions about whether the Unifi plant can be considered a clean and green workplace.

In the bottle processing plant in Reidsville, North Carolina, drifts of plastic particles, like snow banks, are piled in every nook of the machinery that chops the bottles into flake. When I ask our tour guide, a floor manager, if he worries about breathing it in, he says he doesn't. "We do a good job of cleaning it up," he says, adding that the bags of dust that are vacuumed up are sold off, and the wastewater is filtered.

But I'm concerned. A 2023 study of a UK plastics recycling plant found that even after the installation of state-of-the-art filters, around 6 percent of the plastic being processed was released into the wastewater as micro and nanoplastic, while the air around the facility was full of microplastics small enough to be hazardous to human health.

Scientists are still puzzling out what microplastics do to our health, but one study found that people with IBS tended to have more microplastics, including PET and polyamide (of which nylon is one type), in their gut. While PET seems to be one of the most benign out of all the plastics, at least two studies have found BPA, a hormone-disrupting chemical, in polyester baby clothing, and a number of brands agreed to a settlement with California lawmakers in 2023 over the presence of BPA in polyester athletic shirts.

In addition, water utility managers in Reidsville have alleged that Unifi and other polyester manufacturers could be potentially be sources of 1,4-dioxane, a probable human carcinogen, in the Cape Fear watershed, which provides drinking water for over 1 million people as it flows from central to southeast North Carolina. Technically, that's not illegal (especially since Unifi, along with other industrial sources and several towns, successfully lobbied against a North Carolina rule limiting 1,4-dioxane in wastewater). Because 1,4-dioxane is a byproduct of manufacturing PET resin, the EPA declared in late 2024 that almost any exposure to 1,4-dioxane constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health of polyester workers and surrounding communities. There are (very costly) ways to treat wastewater for 1,4-dioxane, so how ensuing regulations would affect Unifi remains to be seen, especially since the EPA doesn't currently seem keen to do any regulating of toxic chemical exposure.

Ingle and Boyd both declined to speak in detail about these issues. In person, they cited the advice of Unifi's counsel (BPA), said Unifi follows all regulations (1,4-dioxane), or pled ignorance (microplastics). Follow-up questions to Boyd went unanswered. Ingle responded to follow-up questions via email by writing, “We maintain active participation in The Microfibre Consortium, in order to support academic and industry research into the source and impact of fiber fragmentation from textiles into the natural environment.” And “We are compliant with all local, state, and federal regulations for all of our sites.”

To advocates, each micro-scandal is proof that there is no environmentally friendly polyester. “We can't do this sustainably in a nontoxic way, it's literally impossible,” Pecci says.

But I left the Repreve plant wondering if we're letting perfect be the enemy of good American jobs. Polyester will continue to be in demand, and it will either be made here in a compliant factory using recycled sources, or abroad in a sketchy factory using fresh petrochemicals. Pecci says she doesn't want to “call out that company or those people, because they might be the nicest people in the world doing the best they can with what they have.” She described for me a utopia in which nontoxic and natural clothing is all made here and then composted and recycled here. Sounds gorgeous, and impossible.

In February of this year, Unifi announced it was closing its Madison, North Carolina, polyester processing plant. It would ship some of its machinery to its Latin American plants, and offer the Madison employees new job opportunities at the Yadkinsville and Reidsville plants, which remain in service.

For now, anyway.

Intel has published a paper about its 18A (1.8nm-class) fabrication process at the VLSI 2025 symposium, consolidating all its information about the manufacturing technology into a single document. The new 18A production node is expected to deliver significant improvements in power, performance, and area over its predecessor, increasing density by 30% while enhancing performance by 25% or reducing power consumption by 36%.But, perhaps more importantly, 18A will be Intel's first process technology in years that will compete head-to-head with TSMC's leading-edge technology when both enter mass production in the second half of this year.

Intel's 18A process node is designed for a wide range of range of products across both client and datacenter applications, and the first Intel's product to use it will be the Panther Lake CPU, which is due to be formally announced later this year. To address different applications, Intel 18A has two libraries: high-performance (HP) with 180nm cell height (180CH) and high-density (HD) with 160nm cell height (160CH) for lower-power applications.

Intel says that compared to Intel 3, its 18A fabrication technology boosts performance by 25%. It manages to achieve this without increasing voltage or circuit complexity when running a typical Arm core sub-block, implemented using a 180CH HD library at 1.1. When operating at the same clocks and 1.1V voltage, it also cuts power usage by 36% compared to the same design on Intel 3. At a reduced voltage of 0.75V, 18A offers an 18% speed increase and uses 38% less energy. Furthermore, designs fabricated on 18A occupy roughly 28% less area than those built with Intel 3.



There is a major catch about comparison of voltages between Intel 3 and 18A. The former supports <0.6V, 0.75V, 1.1V, and 1.3V, which makes it particularly suitable for data center devices. This type of workload needs to burst to high clocks, across dozens of cores when demanding peak performance. Then, it'll need to throttle down to a low-power state to save power. To contrast, 18A seems to support 0.4V, 0.75V, and 1.1V, which very good for client PCs and data center CPUs, but may not be ideal for processors that need maximum clock speeds. However, other advantages of Intel's 18A will likely offset the lack of 1.3V support for the vast majority of applications (more on this later).

As for SRAM, Intel's 18A process includes a high-density SRAM bit cell measuring 0.021 µm², translating to an SRAM density of roughly 31.8 Mb/mm². This is a major improvement over the 0.024 µm² bit cell used in Intel 4. This puts Intel 18A on par with TSMC's N5 and N3E nodes in terms of SRAM density. However, TSMC's upcoming N2 process goes further, reducing the bit cell to approximately 0.0175 µm² and achieving a higher density of around 38 Mb/mm².

Intel's 18A relies on the company's 2nd generation RibbonFET gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, and a PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN). We investigate exactly how Intel managed to implement GAA transistors and BSPSN below.

In GAA transistors, the gate completely wraps around the channel, offering superior electrostatic control compared to FinFETs, which only wrap around on three sides. Such an architecture enables engineers to finely tune device characteristics for either high performance or low power consumption by adjusting the total effective channel width (Weff). This is typically achieved by varying the width and number of stacked nanosheets. More sheets, alongside wider sheets, can increase drive current and performance at the cost of power, while fewer or narrower sheets reduce both performance and power consumption.

Intel's 18A RibbonFET transistors feature four nanoribbons and support eight distinct logic threshold voltages (VTs) — four for NMOS, and four for PMOS — spanning a 180mV range. This level of VT granularity is achieved through dipole-based work-function tuning, a method that allows precise control of transistor behavior without altering its physical dimensions. This approach is especially important, given the tight spatial constraints in GAA transistor structures, such as RibbonFETs, where traditional methods, like doping adjustments, are limited.

An Intel graph from the paper shows that despite this wide VT range, the transistors exhibit strong electrical characteristics, including steep subthreshold slopes and well-behaved drive currents across both Id–Vg and Id–Vd curves. These results confirm that Intel has successfully maintained device performance and control across the entire VT spectrum, which enables flexible circuit design choices that balance frequency, power, and leakage within the same process.

Intel's PowerVia backside power delivery network (BSPDN) relocates power delivery from the top metal layers to the rear side of the chip, creating a physical separation between power and signal wiring. This technique addresses issues like rising resistance in the vertical connections of in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) layers, which in turn enhances transistor efficiency and reduces power usage. Additionally, it prevents signal degradation caused by power interference and allows for tighter packing of logic elements, increasing overall circuit density.



Intel's PowerVia delivers power to transistor contacts, which is a slightly less sophisticated approach compared to TSMC's Super Power Rail (coming in 2H 2026 along with A16), which connects directly to each transistor's source and drain. In addition to BSPDN, Intel also implemented its new high-density metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor to enhance power supply stability.

Intel has now disclosed the key benefits of its backside power routing. First up, PowerVia increases transistor density by 8% to 10%, which is quite a sizeable part of 18A's overall 1.3X transistor density increase over Intel 3. Secondly, the front-side metal layers in its 18A process achieve approximately 12% better resistance-capacitance (RC) performance and show a 24% to 49% decrease in via resistance compared to Intel 3, thanks to improved metallization techniques and the use of ultra-low-k dielectrics. Thirdly, 18A's PowerVia reduces voltage droop compared to Intel 3 (the worst-case scenario for Intel 3) by up to 10 times. Lastly, BSPDN simplifies chip design as it simplifies the routing of signal and power wires.

Since PowerVia is the industry's first backside power delivery network (BSPDN) used in mass production, Intel also presented reliability test results. These demonstrate its long-term durability and chip-package interaction (CPI) performance.



According to JEDEC-standard TQV tests, PowerVia passed multiple stress conditions with zero failures, including highly accelerated stress testing at 110°C and 85% humidity for 275 hours, extended high-temperature bake tests up to 1000 hours at 165°C, and 750 cycles of temperature swings from –55°C to 125°C. These results confirm that PowerVia can withstand harsh operating environments, without compromising structural or electrical integrity.

In addition to CPI reliability, Intel evaluated the impact of PowerVia on SRAM aging and performance stability. Under conditions equivalent to 1000 hours of high-temperature operation, SRAM arrays maintained stable minimum operating voltage (Vmin) with margin, showing no signs of degradation. This suggests that PowerVia does not negatively affect sensitive on-chip memory and is robust enough to support both digital logic and embedded SRAM under extended stress. Together, these findings are meant to affirm PowerVia's readiness for deployment in high-performance, long-lifecycle computing platforms.

In addition to improving performance, reducing power consumption, and enabling higher transistor density, Intel's 18A simplifies production flows and simplifies chip design.



By moving power delivery to the backside, Intel eliminates the need for a front-side power grid, which, combined with direct EUV patterning, lowers the total number of masks and simplifies the front-end metal process. By using low-n absorber reticles with tailored dimensional adjustments, Intel also enabled single-pass EUV patterning for the M0–M2 metal layers. This simplification of the lower metal layers reduces process complexity and helps offset the cost of adding extra backside metal layers, which are based on mature, low-cost fabrication techniques. As a result, the overall design process becomes easier and cheaper.

In addition, the backside metal layers of 18A's PowerVia are designed for low resistance and high thermal conductivity, which helps manage the increased power density from the GAA transistors. Also, carrier wafer bonding is optimized for heat removal through the backside, addressing the thermal challenges introduced by high-performance transistors. Finally, PowerVia is compatible with advanced packaging methods like Foveros and EMIB, though we already know this from the fact that Panther Lake uses 18A tiles as well as Foveros 3D.

Intel's comprehensive technical overview of its 18A process node has highlighted the architecture, performance, and manufacturability improvements that position it as a competitor to TSMC's upcoming N2. The 18A process introduces Intel's second-generation RibbonFET (GAA) transistors and the industry's first mass-production-ready backside power delivery network, PowerVia.

Together, these innovations enable up to 25% higher performance or 36% lower power consumption compared to Intel 3, while also increasing transistor density by about 30%.

Intel's PowerVia contributes an 8–10% density gain, 12% RC improvement in metal layers, and up to 10 times lower voltage droop.

The new node has also passed stringent JEDEC reliability tests, including 1000-hour high-temperature aging and extensive thermal cycling to verify that it can be used for designs meant to work for a long time. Additionally, Intel further streamlined front-end patterning using single-pass EUV at M0–M2, thereby reducing mask counts and simplifying the design.

However, whether or not 18A can help Intel restore some of the lustre to its brand remains to be seen, as the company continues to wade its way through rocky waters.

Zubaida starts her day at eight in the morning, sorting discarded plastics, glass, and chemicals with her bare hands, to collect items she can sell. With waste-segregation centers in this part of East Delhi currently shut down, she and other waste-pickers from the Seemapuri slum work outside by a dusty road through the hottest hours of the day, under the blazing sun. There is no fan or shade. With Delhi's heat wave season here, they are constantly exposed to intense high temperatures.

On June 11, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for Delhi, warning of a high risk of heat illness and heat stroke. Temperatures that week pushed beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) across northern India, with the real-feel temperature, which factors in how humidity augments the effects of heat, spiking at an alarming 54 degrees Celsius. Prolonged exposure to such high heat can raise a person's body temperature to dangerous levels. It's potentially fatal.

In the face of this inferno, the IMD advised people to avoid going outdoors during the daytime, and markets and streets were deserted during the day. But even when extreme heat strikes, Delhi's large, informal workforce continues to work. Street vendors, rickshaw pullers, and waste pickers have reported dizziness, infections, breathing difficulties, and persistent fatigue during recent heat waves. “We cannot stop,” says Zubaida. “We earn each day to eat each day. If we miss a day, we miss a meal.”

At present, heat action plans (HAP) are India's primary approach for managing heat waves and keeping essential services running. Developed annually by state, district, and city governments—the Delhi government released its citywide HAP for 2025 in April—these plans are designed to help cities prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme heat. And they're not working.

This has driven nonprofits and research organizations to show how HAPs can be improved—with one key idea being to use geographic information systems (GIS) that combine satellite imagery with local data to provide cities with a granular, building-by-building views of their heat. Action plans, often plagued by generalization, can then be tailored to better protect those at the highest risk.

Places like Ahmedabad and Tamil Nadu have seen falls in heat-related illnesses and deaths since introducing their plans (Ahmedabad's was the first to be implemented in India, back in 2013). But with most HAPs there are still major gaps when it comes to their implementation, coordination, and funding. A 2023 study found that 95 percent of HAPs do not have detailed mapping of heat-prone areas or vulnerable populations. Without this kind of granular data, it becomes difficult to allocate resources where they are needed most.

What is still missing is a hyperlocal targeted response to risk, says Radhika Khosla, associate professor at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford. She explains that heat risk is really the intersection of three things: the hazard—where temperature and humidity are highest within different city regions; exposure—which communities are most exposed to heat; and their vulnerability—factors like socioeconomic status, health conditions, levels of outdoor work, access to electricity, and the conditions of the built environment. Right now, most plans aren't collecting and analyzing this sort of data, Khosla says. “Often where the actions are taken may not be where the most vulnerable are.”

Heat doesn't just differ between cities; it varies significantly within them. The urban heat island effect—the phenomenon of cities being hotter than surrounding rural areas—is often discussed at the city scale, but what isn't understood well enough is how differently it is felt at ground level. A slum settlement with a tin roof can be about 6 degrees Celsius hotter than a nearby independent house with a garden, even though they are both on the same street. The way heat is absorbed, trapped, and felt can shift block by block, depending on land use, construction materials, density, and the presence or absence of green cover, says architect and climate researcher Ujjvala Krishna. Because heat is granular, city-level HAPs are too broad to provide solutions that are specific to the most vulnerable.

To understand just how local heat stress can be, Krishna and her team at the nonprofit Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) conducted a study in a ward in north Bengaluru of just two square kilometers. That ward has a mix of land use and building types—high-rise apartments, low-income informal settlements, large independent houses, old industrial zones, and commercial areas. “Because the built environment and green cover were so heterogeneous, we saw land-surface temperature differences of up to 9 degrees Celsius within the same ward,” Krishna says.

Krishna and her team at ATREE first plotted the different land uses within the Marappanapalya ward in north Bengaluru.

They then used satellite imagery to map surface heat across the ward, and investigated how this correlated with land use.

“And that is exactly how most cities are built,” Krishna says. Urban land use is shifting rapidly, and large plots are being converted to high-rise towers, which increases density, reduces airflow, and traps heat for more people in a smaller area.

Delhi's 2025 heat action plan made some progress towards addressing the data gap. It included high-resolution, ward-level land surface temperature maps that identified the city's most heat-vulnerable areas—neighborhoods that are also lacking basic infrastructure to cope with extreme temperatures. However, the quality and application of that data remain limited. “It's a step forward, but GIS and remote-sensing analysis still need to be more advanced to influence decision-making,” says Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, senior program manager of geoanalytics at WRI India, an independent research organization that works with India's local and national governments.

Palanichamy points out that many land-surface temperature maps currently used are based on satellite datasets originally designed for agricultural monitoring, which might not be calibrated for complex multi-use urban landscapes. They may be incapable of the specificity needed to support targeted interventions in a city like Delhi.

To try to better capture that variability, SEEDS, a Delhi-based disaster-preparedness nonprofit, along with Chintan, a nonprofit working on waste management and livelihoods, have used GIS mapping of indoor heat risks across homes in low-income settlements in Delhi, located near landfills and industrial zones, and inhabited by waste pickers.

A Delhi heat map created by SEEDS and Chintan using maximum land surface temperatures for the month of May, 2013–2021. The team then used this map to identify high heat density areas to target with hyperlocal interventions.

They used an artificial intelligence model called Sunny Lives—built by SEEDS and Microsoft—to assess indoor heat risk across different types of buildings. “Our model looks at how heat is experienced inside individual homes,” says Anshu Sharma, cofounder of SEEDS. “If the outside temperature is 40 degrees Celsius, a house with a tin roof can reach 45 degrees Celsius indoors. And that's where the most vulnerable people—infants, elderly, and the unwell—are stuck during the hottest times of the day.”

SEEDS and Chintan also calculate the wet-bulb temperature, a measure that combines heat and humidity to indicate the effectiveness of evaporative cooling—or in human terms, sweating. The higher the humidity, the higher the wet-bulb temperature, and the less effective sweating is at keeping someone cool—meaning they are more likely to experience heat stress.

The team tracked conditions in homes topped with tin roofs, tiles, plastic sheeting, and concrete to figure out which are at the highest risk of extreme indoor heat. “That trained the model to recognize patterns, which we then combined with satellite imagery to identify roof types and building materials at scale. We can now assess indoor heat exposure for individual buildings even without installing sensors for similar geographic locations.”

A Sunny Lives assessment of a dense Delhi neighborhood. In this example, the AI has highlighted all houses in the neighborhood at low-risk from heat.

Sharma believes this kind of micro-level resolution should guide the next generation of heat action plans in India. “We now have the tech to zoom in down to individual buildings and clusters, and it's available and affordable. The same temperature doesn't impact everyone the same way, and our planning has to reflect that,” he says.

“What we need are ward-level plans, because that's the smallest administrative unit where the nuances of heat can actually be addressed,” Krishna says. At that level, resources can be better allocated, responsibilities assigned to local bodies, and interventions coordinated with residents' welfare associations, slum group associations, hospitals, and schools. She also suggests building a heat vulnerability index to take stock of everyone in the area based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status and identify the most vulnerable groups.

“The more granular your data, the more targeted your response can be,” Krishna adds. Instead of generic advisories like “drink more water,” localized data could drive specific actions: change market or factory hours, deploy cost-effective heat shelters, or set up oral rehydration solution stations in high-footfall areas. “If you know who's most vulnerable, you can act faster,” she adds.

But as Delhi goes through another searing summer, against a backdrop of rising heat-related deaths and increasing climate stress, many of the relief measures already promised by the government—such as placing 3,000 water coolers in public places, altering timings of construction work, and building daytime shelters for outdoor workers and homeless people—are yet to be carried out.

This year, the heat feels even more unbearable for Zubaida. “My blood pressure drops, I get splitting headaches,” she says. Frequent and prolonged power cuts in her neighborhood also mean there's little respite at home. “We need proper shelter and some shade to work under.”

Part of the problem is that heat action plans aren't legally binding, says Tamanna Dalal, a senior research associate at the New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, an environmental research organization. “Heat waves aren't recognized as state-specific disasters in most parts of India,” she explains. “Right now, only about eight states have formally declared heat waves as disasters. This means that local authorities aren't obligated to prioritize heat action unless they get direct rapid response guidelines during the heat wave from higher levels.”

The national government also doesn't recognize heat waves as “notified” disasters, meaning they can't trigger financial assistance under the country's disaster-management legislation.

As a result, whatever measures are taken tend to be short term and reactive. Temporary measures like school closures ordered by the education department or oral rehydration solution stockpiling orders by health departments are being repeated each year. But these measures don't do anything to build structural resilience for cities to adapt to worsening heat conditions.

It is ultimately about building more heat-resilient cities that can adapt and mitigate simultaneously, while integrating heat with other policy goals such. as energy, water, job creation, and air quality, explains Khosla.

Some of the funding pathways already exist. “We found that 18 centrally sponsored schemes have direct linkages to long-term solutions listed in HAPs, like piped water supply, rooftop solar, et cetera,” says Dalal. But many local officials don't know these resources are available. A recent amendment to India's national disaster mitigation fund now helps states finance heat-related actions but awareness remains very low. India is still in the early stages of heat planning in the country, and large-scale capacity building is urgently needed to help implementers see heat as a chronic threat in a warming world.

“We are soon reaching the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is going to be irreversible,” Dalal says, referring to the targeted limit for global warming set out in the Paris Agreement, which the world is almost certain to break. “This will impact every aspect of our daily lives. The next few years are critical in implementing some of the long-term solutions, because they take years to implement and even longer to have an impact.”

As the leading cause of cancer-related death, lung cancer remains a noteworthy hazard to human health. NSCLC is the most prevalent subtype, accounting for nearly 85% of all lung cancer cases. Although targeted therapy and immunotherapy have improved the efficacy of NSCLC treatment, therapeutic resistance and poor patient response indicate the urgent need to find more effective therapies.

Researchers from the Department of Radiation Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, published their summary (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0470) on the application and future prospects of bsAbs in the treatment of NSCLC in Cancer Biology & Medicine. This study underscores the promising role of bsAbs in improving antitumor efficacy and overcoming treatment resistance.

This study reviews the classification, mechanisms of action and clinical application of bsAbs in the treatment of NSCLC. By binding two antigens or epitopes, bsAbs could cause tumor cells lysis by recovering the activity of exhausted T cells, precisely redirecting T cells to tumor cells and simultaneously inhibiting two critical signaling pathways. Furthermore, bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (bsADCs) combine the precise targeting capability of bsAbs with cytotoxic payload delivery, enabling selective tumor cell killing upon target engagement.According to pivotal clinical trials, bsAbs demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and a manageable safety profile in NSCLC patients, providing a robust solution for those resistant to targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Dr. Xiangjiao Meng, a leading researcher in the study, underscores the promising antitumor role of bsAbs in NSCLC: "Primary and secondary treatment resistance has severely compromised the prognosis and survival of NSCLC. The bsAbs holds promise for overcoming therapeutic resistance and improving survival prognosis in NSCLC. "

The study's findings have significant implications for the future use of bsAbs in the NSCLC treatment. Through gaining a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms of action of bsAbs and reviewing the latest clinical trial evidence, clinicians are enabled to fully understand this emerging therapeutic approach, thereby advancing the clinical adoption of bsAbs in the treatment of NSCLC.

Lower blood sugar and increased fat burning – without negatively affecting appetite or muscle mass. These are some of the most promising effects of a new potential drug treatment for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, according to a new study published in the journal Cell by researchers from Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University.

The new drug, which is taken in tablet form, has a completely different mechanism of action than the well-known GLP-1-based drugs, such as Ozempic, which is administered via injections. GLP-1 drugs affect hunger via signals between the gut and the brain, but often have side effects such as loss of appetite, reduced muscle mass, and gastrointestinal problems.

The new substance instead activates metabolism in skeletal muscle. In animal studies, the treatment has shown good effects on both blood sugar control and body composition, but without the side effects associated with today's GLP-1-based drugs.

An initial phase I clinical trial involving 48 healthy subjects and 25 people with type 2 diabetes shows that humans also tolerate the treatment well.

Our results point to a future where we can improve metabolic health without losing muscle mass. Muscles are important in both type 2 diabetes and obesity, and muscle mass is also directly correlated with life expectancy."

Tore Bengtsson, one of the researchers behind the study, professor at the Department of Molecular Bioscience, Wenner-Gren Institute, Stockholm University

The drug substance is based on a molecule-a type of β2 agonist that the researchers have developed in a laboratory. The molecule can activate important signaling pathways in the body in a new way, which has a positive effect on the muscles without overstimulating the heart, which is a known problem with β2 agonists.

"This drug represents a completely new type of treatment and has the potential to be of great importance for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our substance appears to promote healthy weight loss and, in addition, patients do not have to take injections," says Shane C. Wright, assistant professor at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Karolinska Institutet, who is one of the researchers behind the study.

This new type of drug not only works on its own, but can also work in combination with GLP-1, thanks to their different mechanisms of action.

"This makes them valuable both as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with GLP-1 drugs," says Shane C. Wright.

The next step is a larger, clinical phase II study planned by Atrogi AB, the company developing the treatment. The aim of the study is to see whether the same positive effects seen in preclinical models also occur in people with type 2 diabetes or obesity.

The study is the result of close collaboration with Professor Volker M. Lauschke and other researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm University, and Uppsala University in Sweden, the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and Monash University and the University of Queensland in Australia. The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Society for Medical Research, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, among others.

Several of the article's authors are employed by and/or own shares in Atrogi AB, which funded the clinical trial. Tore Bengtsson is the founder and chief scientific officer at Atrogi AB, which is further developing the drug candidate, and has, together with a co-author, applied for patents for the substances investigated in the study. Several other company connections are reported; see the study for more detailed information.

Researchers at the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have found that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound found in cannabis, could help reduce problematic behaviors in autistic boys. The results provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and limitations of CBD as a therapeutic intervention for autism.

Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In more severe cases, these behaviors can also include self-injury or aggression. While existing treatments can help manage these symptoms, there is a pressing need for effective and safe interventions to address the diverse needs of autistic individuals.

Some prior studies have suggested that CBD could help reduce problematic behaviors in children with autism. However, no controlled clinical trials have addressed safety, tolerability and efficacy of this treatment approach until now.

In the trial, autistic boys with severe behavior problems aged 7–14 years were split into two groups. One received eight weeks of daily CBD then eight weeks of placebo, separated by a four-week "washout" period in which no treatment was given. The other group received placebo first, then CBD. Behavioral assessments were completed before and after each treatment phase. A total of 30 participants completed the trial.

The researchers found:

The study's findings suggest that while CBD may have some benefits in reducing problematic behaviors in autistic children, its effectiveness is not universally established, and more research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential. The study's results also underscore the importance of rigorous, controlled trials in evaluating the efficacy of novel treatments for autism.

The study, published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, was led by UC San Diego School of Medicine distinguished professors Doris Trauner, M.D., in the Departments of Neurosciences and Pediatrics, and Igor Grant, M.D., in the Department of Psychiatry.

Sonata Scientific, a leader in advanced industrial air purification, today announced the launch of its revolutionary Helios MP500, a high-performance solution for eliminating fugitive ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions in medical device sterilization facilities. Tested and validated in real-world environments, the Helios technology platform consistently delivers destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) exceeding 99%, ensuring a safer environment for workers and surrounding communities.

Unlike traditional solutions, the Helios MP500 is a standalone, ductless powerhouse that operates at 500 cubic feet per minute (cfm) while maintaining high-efficiency performance. Initial units have been deployed into the medical device supply chain, and new orders will be accepted beginning July 2025. With scalable manufacturing capabilities, Sonata is prepared to deliver these units in volume to meet global demand.

This is not just another air purifier – it's a game-changer.

Our Helios technology is proven to eliminate EtO in the low parts-per-million (ppm) range where existing systems simply can't compete."

Bob Henderson, Director of Applications Engineering, Sonata Scientific

Helios MP500 is the first in a growing family of EtO control solutions from Sonata Scientific. The company is actively developing additional products to address transportation, warehouses, and distribution centers. Localized enclosures and integrated monitoring technologies will also be addressed to ensure a range of solutions for diverse industry needs.

"We are in close collaboration with our customers, refining our product roadmap to address their immediate and future needs," said Melissa Petruska, Chief Technical Officer at Sonata Scientific. "This is just the beginning."

Many doctors abandon a potentially life-saving medical scanning technology soon after training, because systemic barriers prevent it from becoming part of their routine practice, a study has found.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) enables doctors to perform rapid bedside scans using a portable device. This can quickly reveal life-threatening problems – including heart failure, fluid in the lungs, or internal bleeding – that can often be treated if identified in time.

Although thousands of doctors in the UK are now trained to use POCUS, research, including the new study, shows that many do not continue to use it in practice after completing their training.

The urgent need to improve access to POCUS has been raised by several sources. Shock to Survival, a framework jointly produced by the British Cardiovascular and Intensive Care Societies, for example, highlights the critical role that the technology can play in diagnosing and managing conditions such as cardiogenic shock.

Evidence from Prevention of Future Deaths reports similarly indicates that point-of-care cardiac ultrasound has been underutilised in assessing critically ill patients with shock, and that this has led to cases where opportunities for timely, potentially life-saving intervention were missed.

The new study, by researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Exeter, and Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, identifies six "vicious cycles" that explain why POCUS is being underused.

The root causes include limited expert support and workplace cultures that discourage less experienced clinicians from scanning. Researchers found that these factors created patterns of behaviour that inhibited the use of POCUS, even in settings where equipment and training opportunities were available.

"POCUS is being underused internationally, but it still feels like a problem that many people are unaware exists," lead author Professor Riika Hofmann, from the University of Cambridge, said. "A lot of time and money is being spent on training, but if the working culture of hospitals doesn't support it, that investment risks being wasted."

"Our study is the first to explain why POCUS is not being integrated into everyday medical care. Unless we address this at the level of underlying culture, it won't be used as intended, and lives could be lost."

Failure to utilize POCUS in the assessment of critically ill patients may contribute to missed opportunities for timely, potentially life-saving intervention. This has led to growing calls for a deeper understanding of the barriers to its use. Our study seeks to address those concerns directly."

Dr. Nicola Jones, co-author from Royal Papworth Hospital

The researchers conducted interviews and focus groups with clinicians involved in the national Focused Intensive Care Echocardiography (FICE) training programme, which supports healthcare professionals to use POCUS to assess heart function in patients with serious circulatory compromise. The participants included a range of professionals, from those just beginning to develop their scanning skills to those with extensive experience, as well as others involved in delivering or supporting its use in clinical practice.

Although the research revealed some practical barriers to using point-of-care ultrasound, such as difficulties scanning particular types of patient, the standout finding was that these challenges tended to interlink and reinforce one another. The study identifies six cycles, or "closed loop problems", which hinder the technology's uptake.

One loop, for example, stems from the fact that trainees' early efforts to use POCUS did not always produce high-quality scans. This fed scepticism among experienced clinicians about how much they should be using the technology, which in turn dented the trainees' confidence and made them reluctant to use it.

Another cycle involves expertise. With few trained specialists available and limited protected learning time, trainees often struggled to get expert feedback on their scans. This limited their progress and, as a result, the development of a bigger pool of experts who could support future trainees.

A third loop relates to workplace norms. In some departments, scanning was not part of routine care and senior staff were resistant to its use. Trainees also worried about "treading on the toes" of senior colleagues who saw scanning as their responsibility. Without encouragement, they backed away from using POCUS, reinforcing the very norms that discouraged them in the first place.

To help break these cycles, the researchers propose three practical steps that could improve POCUS uptake without adding strain to overstretched health services.

"These are scalable, sustainable solutions that could work even in very busy hospitals," Hofmann said. "If we can halt the cycles we identified here, we should be able to increase the number of confident POCUS users and maximise the benefits for patients."

The study is published in Advances in Health Sciences Education.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide. However, the mechanisms controlling the early stages of prostate cancer formation are poorly understood.

In a study published in the prestigious journal Nature Cancer, researchers led by Professor Cédric Blanpain, MD/PhD, WELBIO researcher, director of the Stem Cells and Cancer Laboratory, and professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, discovered that inflammation induced by cancer-associated mutations leads to the reprogramming of mutated cells into cell states essential for tumor initiation.

Chen Jiang and colleagues studied the molecular mechanisms regulating the early stages of prostate cancer initiation. They discovered that cellular reprogramming events leading to cancer formation occur differently in different regions of the prostate. The ULB researchers discovered that cellular reprogramming mediated by inflammatory activation was associated with the most severe cases of prostate cancer in human.

It is exciting to see that the cellular reprogramming identified in the mouse model correlates with more aggressive prostate cancers in men, suggesting that the reprogramming markers we identified could serve as a predictive biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer."

Dr. Chen Jiang, first author of the article

Using molecular profiling during prostate tumor initiation, the researchers identified that inflammatory activation is a key regulator of cellular reprogramming and tumor initiation. Pharmacologically blocking inflammation prevents cellular reprogramming and prostate tumor initiation. "By identifying the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular reprogramming required for prostate tumor formation, our results pave the way for new therapeutic approaches targeting inflammation-induced reprogramming, which could prevent the formation of prostate cancers and potentially other cancers," comments Professor Cédric Blanpain, the director of this study.

This work is a collaborative effort between the team of Pr Blanpain (ULB) and Pr Sifrim (KUL).

This work was made possible thanks to the support of the FNRS, TELEVIE, the WEL Research Institute, the Fondation Contre le Cancer, the Julie and Françoise Drion Foundation, the André Vésale Association, the ULB Foundation, the Yvonne Boël Foundation, and the European Research Council (ERC).

Researchers have discovered that the most aggressive melanomas, the deadliest form of skin cancer, overactivate two key processes in mitochondria, the components of cells that provide energy. Blocking these pathways with currently available drugs effectively killed melanoma cells. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

By mapping the proteins expressed in 151 tumor and normal skin samples, investigators found that the most aggressive melanomas hyper-activate the machinery that builds mitochondrial proteins and the mitochondrial system that turns nutrients into energy.

Remarkably, blocking these pathways effectively halted or killed melanoma cells cultured in lab dishes. Two types of drugs accomplished this: antibiotics-originally designed to block bacterial protein synthesis machinery, which closely resembles the machinery found in mitochondria-and specialized energy-production inhibitors. Importantly, non-cancerous skin cells remained mostly unaffected, highlighting the safety and specificity of these treatment approaches.

This discovery identifies melanoma's excessive reliance on mitochondrial energy as its Achilles' heel, revealing a therapeutic vulnerability that we can exploit with existing drugs. By pairing mitochondrial blockers with today's standards of care, we may cut off a major escape route that cancers use to resist therapy and come back."

Jeovanis Gil, PhD, senior author of Lund University, Sweden

Dr. Gil added that the mitochondrial-protein signature his team discovered can be measured in routine biopsy material and could serve as a biomarker to identify patients most likely to benefit from mitochondrial-targeted add-on therapies. By enabling clinicians to match treatments to each patient's tumor biology, these findings mark a step forward for precision medicine in melanoma. Moreover, because mitochondrial rewiring fuels resistance across many cancers, success in melanoma could open the door to similar personalized combination strategies in other hard-to-treat cancers.

Penn-led researchers have turned a deadly fungus into a potent cancer-fighting compound. After isolating a new class of molecules from Aspergillus flavus, a toxic crop fungus linked to deaths in the excavations of ancient tombs, the researchers modified the chemicals and tested them against leukemia cells. The result? A promising cancer-killing compound that rivals FDA-approved drugs and opens up new frontiers in the discovery of more fungal medicines.

"Fungi gave us penicillin," says Sherry Gao, Presidential Penn Compact Associate Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) and in Bioengineering (BE) and senior author of a new paper in Nature Chemical Biology on the findings. "These results show that many more medicines derived from natural products remain to be found."

Aspergillus flavus, named for its yellow spores, has long been a microbial villain. After archaeologists opened King Tutankhamun's tomb in the 1920s, a series of untimely deaths among the excavation team fueled rumors of a pharaoh's curse. Decades later, doctors theorized that fungal spores, dormant for millennia, could have played a role. 

In the 1970s, a dozen scientists entered the tomb of Casimir IV in Poland. Within weeks, 10 of them died. Later investigations revealed the tomb contained A. flavus, whose toxins can lead to lung infections, especially in people with compromised immune systems. 

Now, that same fungus is the unlikely source of a promising new cancer therapy.

The therapy in question is a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs, pronounced like the "rip" in a piece of fabric. The name refers to how the compound is produced - by the ribosome, a tiny cellular structure that makes proteins - and the fact that it is modified later, in this case, to enhance its cancer-killing properties.

"Purifying these chemicals is difficult," says Qiuyue Nie, a postdoctoral fellow in CBE and the paper's first author. While thousands of RiPPs have been identified in bacteria, only a handful have been found in fungi. In part, this is because past researchers misidentified fungal RiPPs as non-ribosomal peptides and had little understanding of how fungi created the molecules. "The synthesis of these compounds is complicated," adds Nie. "But that's also what gives them this remarkable bioactivity."

To find more fungal RiPPs, the researchers first scanned a dozen strains of Aspergillus, which previous research suggested might contain more of the chemicals.

By comparing chemicals produced by these strains with known RiPP building blocks, the researchers identified A. flavus as a promising candidate for further study.

Genetic analysis pointed to a particular protein in A. flavus as a source of fungal RiPPs. When the researchers turned the genes that create that protein off, the chemical markers indicating the presence of RiPPs also disappeared.

This novel approach - combining metabolic and genetic information - not only pinpointed the source of fungal RiPPs in A. flavus, but could be used to find more fungal RiPPs in the future.

After purifying four different RiPPs, the researchers found the molecules shared a unique structure of interlocking rings. The researchers named these molecules, which have never been previously described, after the fungus in which they were found: asperigimycins.

Even with no modification, when mixed with human cancer cells, asperigimycins demonstrated medical potential: two of the four variants had potent effects against leukemia cells.

Another variant, to which the researchers added a lipid, or fatty molecule, that is also found in the royal jelly that nourishes developing bees, performed as well as cytarabine and daunorubicin, two FDA-approved drugs that have been used for decades to treat leukemia.

To understand why lipids enhanced asperigimycins' potency, the researchers selectively turned genes on and off in the leukemia cells. One gene, SLC46A3, proved critical in allowing asperigimycins to enter leukemia cells in sufficient numbers.

That gene helps materials exit lysosomes, the tiny sacs that collect foreign materials entering human cells. "This gene acts like a gateway," says Nie. "It doesn't just help asperigimycins get into cells, it may also enable other 'cyclic peptides' to do the same."

Like asperigimycins, those chemicals have medicinal properties - nearly two dozen cyclic peptides have received clinical approval since 2000 to treat diseases as varied as cancer and lupus - but many of them need modification to enter cells in sufficient quantities.

Knowing that lipids can affect how this gene transports chemicals into cells gives us another tool for drug development."

Qiuyue Nie, postdoctoral fellow in CBE and paper's first author

Through further experimentation, the researchers found that asperigimycins likely disrupt the process of cell division. "Cancer cells divide uncontrollably," says Gao. "These compounds block the formation of microtubules, which are essential for cell division."

Notably, the compounds had little to no effect on breast, liver or lung cancer cells - or a range of bacteria and fungi - suggesting that asperigimycins' disruptive effects are specific to certain types of cells, a critical feature for any future medication.

In addition to demonstrating the medical potential of asperigimycins, the researchers identified similar clusters of genes in other fungi, suggesting that more fungal RiPPS remain to be discovered. "Even though only a few have been found, almost all of them have strong bioactivity," says Nie. "This is an unexplored region with tremendous potential."

The next step is to test asperigimycins in animal models, with the hope of one day moving to human clinical trials. "Nature has given us this incredible pharmacy," says Gao. "It's up to us to uncover its secrets. As engineers, we're excited to keep exploring, learning from nature and using that knowledge to design better solutions."

Kim Beckham, an insurance agent in Victoria, Texas, had seen friends suffer so badly from shingles that she wanted to receive the first approved shingles vaccine as soon as it became available, even if she had to pay for it out-of-pocket.

Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. So, in 2016, she celebrated her 60th birthday at her local CVS.

"I was there when they opened," Beckham recalled. After getting her Zostavax shot, she said, "I felt really relieved." She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as a pneumonia shot, an RSV vaccine to guard against respiratory syncytial virus, annual flu shots and all recommended covid-19 vaccinations.

Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated.

Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, California, has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. "I'm sort of hectoring," she acknowledged.

Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella as a child, in case her immunity to measles had waned.

For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody foresaw.

The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt.

On June 9, Kennedy fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later replaced them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. But so far, Kennedy has not tried to curb access to the shots for older Americans.

The evidence that vaccines are beneficial remains overwhelming.

The phrase "Vaccines are not just for kids anymore" has become a favorite for William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

"The population over 65, which often suffers the worst impact of respiratory viruses and others, now has the benefit of vaccines that can prevent much of that serious illness," he said.

Take influenza, which annually sends from 140,000 to 710,000 people to hospitals, most of them seniors, and is fatal to 10% of hospitalized older adults. 

For about 15 years, the CDC has approved several enhanced flu vaccines for people 65 and older. More effective than the standard formulation, they either contain higher levels of the antigen that builds protection against the virus or incorporate an adjuvant that creates a stronger immune response. Or they're recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels.

In a meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, "all the enhanced vaccine products were superior to the standard dose for preventing hospitalizations," said Rebecca Morgan, a health research methodologist at Case Western Reserve University and an author of the study.

Compared with the standard flu shot, the enhanced vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu in older adults, by at least 11% and up to 18%. The CDC advises adults 65 and older to receive the enhanced vaccines, as many already do.

More good news: Vaccines to prevent respiratory syncytial virus in people 60 and older are performing admirably.

RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. "Season in and season out," Schaffner said, "it produces outbreaks of serious respiratory illness that rivals influenza."

Because the FDA first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided "the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context," said Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open.

In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider.

The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older.

Immunocompromised patients, despite having a somewhat lower level of protection from the vaccine, will also benefit from it, Terebuh said. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. That, she said, "shouldn't dissuade people."

The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they're at higher risk of severe illness (from, say, heart disease).

As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine whether the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination.

People 65 and up express the greatest confidence in vaccine safety of any adult group, a KFF survey found in April. More than 80% said they were "very "or "somewhat confident" about MMR, shingles, pneumonia, and flu shots.

Although the covid vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety.

Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines.

Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. "People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated," said Pascal Geldsetzer, an epidemiologist at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study.

"It's hard to know whether this is cause and effect," he said, "or whether they're less likely to develop dementia anyway."

So the Stanford team took advantage of a "natural experiment" when the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was introduced in Wales. Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren't eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible.

In the sample of nearly 300,000 adults whose birthdays fell close to either side of that date, almost half of the eligible group received the vaccine, but virtually nobody in the older group did.

"Just as in a randomized trial, these comparison groups should be similar in every way," Geldsetzer explained. A substantial reduction in dementia diagnoses in the vaccine-eligible group, with a much stronger protective effect in women, therefore constitutes "more powerful and convincing evidence," he said.

The team also found reduced rates of dementia after shingles vaccines were introduced in Australia and other countries. "We keep seeing this in one dataset after another," Geldsetzer said.

In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect.

By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group.

How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. Perhaps the vaccine revs up the immune system in general or affects inflammation.

"I don't think anybody knows," said Paul Harrison, a psychiatrist at Oxford and a senior author of the study. But, he added, "I'm now convinced there's something real here."

Shingrix, now recommended for adults over 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. In 2021, however, only 41% of adults 60 and older had received one dose of either shingles vaccine.

A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial.

And "if you needed another reason to get this vaccine," Schaffner said, "here it is."

Researchers estimate that more than 1 billion people globally live with migraine, a neurological condition causing severe, chronic headaches that are often accompanied by other issues such as nausea and light sensitivity.

The number of migraine headaches a person has each month varies depending on their situation and overall health. Those with chronic migraine can experience them for 15 or more days each month. Migraine headaches also range in severity and length of time, normally lasting anywhere between four to 72 hours. 

Currently, migraine is treated through medications and lifestyle changes to help stop migraine triggers from occurring, such as stress, poor sleep, certain foods, and environmental factors like strong smells, loud noises, or bright light. 

“Despite new advancements, there is still an unmet need in migraine treatment, imposing a substantial burden on patients,” Simone Braca, MD, a neurology resident and clinical research fellow at the Headache Centre of the University of Naples in Italy, told Medical News Today. 

Braca is the lead author of a new study recently presented at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025 that has found that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity may help cut a person's monthly migraine days by about half. 

The study was published in the journal Headache.

For this study, researchers recruited 31 study participants with both obesity and chronic migraine, who were given the GLP-1 medication liraglutide. Liraglutide is currently sold under two brand names: Victoza for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and Saxenda for chronic weight management. 

“In our country it was easier to have access to liraglutide, compared to other GLP-1 agonists,” Braca explained. “In any case, we think that the observed effect reflects a mechanism of action inherent to targeting the GLP-1 receptor.”

Braca said they decided to study the potential impact of GLP-1s on migraine based on previous work done by their research team, which suspected that a derangement in intracranial pressure control plays a role in the pathophysiology of migraine.

“Since GLP-1R agonists are known to greatly modulate and reduce intracranial pressure, we therefore hypothesized that these drugs could be effective in migraine,” he said. 

At the study's conclusion, Braca and his team found that study participants taking liraglutide had an average of nine fewer migraine days each month. 

“They saw their headache days per month drastically reduced, with consequent improvement in their quality of life,” Braca commented. 

Additionally, researchers also discovered that study participants experienced a drop in their Migraine Disability Assessment Test scores by 32 points. 

“(This) means that they saw their migraine-related burden drastically reduced, adding a nuanced view on their quality of life improvement beyond the raw number of headache days,” Braca said. 

“If confirmed by subsequent larger, multicenter, randomized, and controlled studies, GLP-1 agonists may represent a novel class of drugs for migraine prevention,” he continued. “Additionally, this would place intracranial pressure control as one of the mechanisms underlying migraine, a pharmacologically-targetable one.”

Braca added that they plan to conduct a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study as this was a pilot, exploratory study.

MNT spoke with Hsinlin Thomas Cheng, MD, PhD, senior neurologist in the Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, about this study. 

“The study helps to answer a common question: whether GLP-1 agonists can reduce the frequency of migraines,” Cheng said. “The hypothesis is supported by the facts that there are GLP-1 receptors in the choroid plexus, the structure that produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and regulates intracranial pressure, and weight loss is an essential component of headache management. Using GLP-1 agonists may provide dual benefits in regulating CSF pressure and weight control, thereby reducing migraine frequency.” 

Luis Felipe Tornes, MD, neurologist and director of the epilepsy program at Miami Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, told MNT he was cautiously enthusiastic about this research's findings.

“As a neurologist who treats people with chronic migraines, seeing a diabetes medication cut migraine days in half was exciting,” Tornes said. 

“These patients were dealing with at least 15 headache days a month, and on average, they had 11 fewer days after taking the medication for just three months. That's life-changing for someone living with near-constant pain. And the effect didn't seem to be from weight loss — it may be helping by reducing intracranial pressure, which opens up a whole new way to think about treating migraines.”— Luis Felipe Tornes, MD

MNT also spoke with Hao Huang, MD, a neurologist at Hackensack University Medical Center and assistant professor of Neurology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine in New Jersey, about this research. He commented that while the reduction in headache days is impressive, the study is small and lacks direct measurement of intracranial pressure.

“For next steps in the research of migraines, and in this particular case, the role of GLP-1-receptor agonists, it would be helpful to see a larger group of migraine patients in studies,” Huang said. 

“It'll be interesting to see what this research team finds in their next study into whether other GLP-1 drugs can positively affect migraine sufferers without the physical discomfort experienced by the participants of the pilot study,” he added.

Insulin resistance detected by routine triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index can flag people with early Alzheimer's who are four times more likely to present rapid cognitive decline, according to new research presented at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025.

Neurologists at the University of Brescia reviewed records for 315 non-diabetic patients with cognitive deficits, including 200 with biologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. All subjects underwent an assessment of insulin resistance using the TyG index and a clinical follow-up of 3 years. When patients were divided according to TyG index, those in the highest third of the Mild Cognitive Impairment AD subgroup deteriorated far more quickly than their lower-TyG peers, losing >2.5 points on the Mini Mental State Examination per year (hazard ratio 4.08, 95% CI 1.06–15.73). No such link appeared in the non-AD cohort.

Once mild cognitive impairment is diagnosed, families always ask how fast it will progress. Our data show that a simple metabolic marker available in every hospital laboratory can help identify more vulnerable subjects who may be suitable candidates for targeted therapy or specific intervention strategies."

Dr. Bianca Gumina, lead investigator 

While insulin resistance has been linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, its role in how quickly the condition progresses has received less attention. This study aimed to fill that gap by focusing on its impact during the prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, when patients follow highly variable trajectories. The researchers used the TyG index, which offers a low-cost, routinely available surrogate for insulin resistance, to explore whether metabolic dysfunction could help predict the pace of cognitive decline after diagnosis.

In AD specifically, insulin resistance is believed to impair neuronal glucose uptake, promote amyloid accumulation, disrupt the blood–brain barrier, and fuel inflammation – pathways that are less relevant or differently regulated in other neurodegenerative diseases.

"We were surprised to see the effect only in the Alzheimer's spectrum and not in other neurodegenerative diseases", Dr. Gumina noted. "It suggests a disease-specific vulnerability to metabolic stress during the prodromal window, when interventions may still change the trajectory."

The researchers at University of Brescia, led by Professor Padovani and Professor Pilotto, found that high TyG was also associated with blood–brain barrier disruption and cardiovascular risk factors, yet it showed no interaction with the APOE ε4 genotype, indicating that metabolic and genetic risks may act through distinct pathways.

Identifying high-TyG patients could refine enrolment for anti-amyloid or anti-tau trials and prompt earlier lifestyle or pharmacological measures to improve insulin sensitivity. The researchers are currently investigating whether TyG levels also track with neuroimaging biomarkers to aid earlier detection and stratification.

"If targeting metabolism can delay progression, we will have a readily modifiable target that works alongside emerging disease-modifying drugs", concluded Dr. Gumina.

Why do men see more dramatic results from the keto diet? Explore the latest science on how hormones and metabolism shape weight loss success for men and women.

Study: Sex differences in ketogenic diet: are men more likely than women to lose weight? Image Credit: Tatiana Bralnina / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, researchers reviewed sex differences in the efficacy of the ketogenic diet (KD) for weight loss, revealing that men show significantly greater weight loss than women under identical KD protocols. For example, in a 45-day clinical trial, men lost an average of 11.63% of body weight compared to 8.95% in women.

Women's muscles work differently. Females naturally have more slow-twitch muscle fibers built for endurance activities, which may make traditional exercise more effective for their weight loss than strict ketosis.

Obesity is a significant public health concern worldwide and is also closely related to cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and cancers. In 2020, 2.6 billion people aged over five were overweight or obese, and this figure is estimated to exceed four billion by 2035. Dietary interventions for obesity have become a focal point in recent years, with various weight loss strategies being promoted.

The traditional low-fat diet is widely used, but it may promote excessive carbohydrate intake, which could exacerbate weight concerns and lipid abnormalities. In contrast, KD is an ultra-low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, and high-fat dietary approach. KD induces a state of ketosis, in which the body uses ketone bodies as its primary energy source instead of glucose.

As such, KD has gained popularity as an effective weight loss strategy. Despite the significant weight loss associated with KD, notable sex differences persist. The present study reviewed the literature on the mechanisms of KD in obesity treatment and the sex differences resulting from interactions between hormones and innate factors.

Gut genes react differently. When researchers altered intestinal genes in mice, females produced significantly more fat-burning enzymes (HMGCS2) – suggesting women's digestive systems might respond uniquely to diet changes.

Only minimal ketones are produced under standard dietary conditions. However, KD tricks the body into mimicking a fasting state, and carbohydrate scarcity leads to the accumulation of acetyl-CoA. This triggers the liver into an overdrive, producing excess ketones, such as acetoacetate, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate, byproducts of fat metabolism.

Further, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the brain's energy sources to ketones and glucose. During fasting, ketones account for 25% to 75% of the brain's energy demands. Thus, KD can maintain regular brain energy supply and peripheral blood glucose levels, promote fat breakdown, and reduce lipogenesis. KD promotes weight loss through various mechanisms.

KD suppresses appetite by elevating peptide neurotransmitters (e.g., glucagon-like peptide-1) and decreasing appetite-regulating hormones (e.g., ghrelin and cholecystokinin), reducing food intake. Furthermore, KD promotes the breakdown of visceral fat, depleting liver glycogen storage and reducing visceral fat accumulation. KD also alters the gut microbiota function, which exhibits sex-specific variations such as a higher abundance of fat-metabolizing bacteria like Bacteroidetes in males, reducing short-chain fatty acid production, which impacts the gut-brain axis signaling.

The overview of the KD's mechanism. Under normal metabolic conditions, glucose serves as the primary energy substrate and is metabolized into pyruvate. This pyruvate is then converted to acetyl CoA, generating oxaloacetate, which enters the TCA cycle to produce ATP. However, under ketogenic dietary states, the synthesis of oxaloacetate is restricted, impeding the normal progression of the TCA cycle. Consequently, a substantial consumption of fat occurs, with processes such as fatty acid activation and β-oxidation generating acetyl-CoA, which promotes the production of ketone bodies. Subsequently, this ketogenesis process yields energy and inhibits appetite, while also shifting the brain to a “fat-fueled” energy mode.

Inflammation plays a hidden role. Studies found women's bodies naturally produce more inflammation-linked fat molecules during rest, potentially making fat breakdown harder when shifting to ketosis.

While studies have not systematically examined the genetic underpinnings of KD-induced sex disparities, literature suggests that these differences may be intricately linked to neurotransmitter levels, genetic factors, intermediate phenotypes, and individual sensitivity to environmental stimuli. Specifically, KD reduces the levels of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which affect feeding behaviors.

Catecholamines also inhibit appetite and decrease food intake, helping control calorie intake. Males accumulate fat centrally (visceral fat), which is more readily metabolized under KD conditions, while females store fat subcutaneously. This sex-specific disparity in fat distribution could be linked to the effects of norepinephrine on regional adipose tissue, which is influenced by differing densities and affinities of adrenergic receptors, accounting for variations in KD's weight loss effects between females and males. Further, the differential response to KD between sexes may be attributed to estrogen, which can increase the sensitivity of α-adrenergic receptors that inhibit fat breakdown.

A study showed that male murine models on KD achieved weight loss and glycemic control, whereas their female counterparts had a slight weight gain, delayed onset of insulin resistance, and compromised glucose tolerance. However, eliminating endogenous estrogen production improved glycemic control and decreased adiposity, comparable to males. Furthermore, testosterone plays a crucial role in the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

Evidence suggests that testosterone enhances norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in isolated adipocytes from male rats by increasing the number of β-adrenergic receptors that promote fat breakdown. Visceral fat converts testosterone into estrogen in males. As such, an increase in body fat percentage tends to increase estrogen levels in males, while testosterone levels decrease. A recent clinical study reported that overweight males benefit from KD through increased testicular hormone profiles, elevated testosterone/SHBG levels, and reduced obesity markers.

The diet's medical origins. Before becoming a weight-loss trend, this approach successfully treated epilepsy in the 1920s but was abandoned when seizure medications emerged decades later.

For premenopausal women, the menstrual cycle introduces another layer of complexity. The review highlights that during the luteal phase, elevated progesterone levels can impair insulin sensitivity and increase carbohydrate cravings, making it more difficult to achieve and maintain the state of ketosis necessary for the diet to be effective.

Furthermore, sex disparities exist in immediate energy sources in resting and postprandial states. Females tend to incorporate postprandial free fatty acids (FFAs) into triglycerides, storing fat and using carbohydrates as an energy source. In contrast, males generate energy through FFA oxidation, storing carbohydrates as glycogen. As such, females following KD tend to store fat and face difficulties in fat consumption and mobilization.

KD is also reported to be effective for muscle growth. A randomized controlled trial found that individuals following KD for six weeks gained more muscle than those on a regular diet. Notably, another study found that KD may adversely affect muscle fatigue in young, healthy females, potentially influencing their perception of fatigue. This suggests that the adverse effects of KD on muscle endurance in females may influence the efficacy of weight loss. Finally, differences in brain regulation, such as the reduced potency of the energy-regulating neuropeptide POMC in female mice, also suggest a neurobiological basis for the differing outcomes.

Taken together, obesity manifests differently in females and males, and sex differences influence the effectiveness of KD in obesity treatment. Current evidence suggests that KD is most effective in males, followed by postmenopausal females, with its efficacy limited in premenopausal females. These differences could be attributed to genetics, sex hormones, the menstrual cycle, neurotransmitters, neural regulation in energy-expending brain regions, gut microbiota, and immunity. Overall, the study offered insights for improving weight loss strategies and facilitating personalized preventive and therapeutic measures. The authors note that more research in ethnically diverse populations is needed to validate these findings.

Trump's military action raises questions for football body 

Infantino and council to decide if Iran can play in Mexico

Fifa is facing new questions over the increasingly fraught World Cup next year, with the issue of how to treat Iran while the country is involved in a conflict with the co-host the US.

There are no provisions within Fifa's regulations to prevent Iran from playing their group matches in the US, despite the country being subject to military action by the Trump administration and Iranian citizens being under a travel ban that prevents them from entering the country. The ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup.

Iran, who faced USA in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, qualified in March for their fourth consecutive World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A could Iran avoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico.

If Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Should they go further – and they have never reached a World Cup knockout game – they would then play in the US.

Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.

Infantino and the Fifa Council will have the final say on inclusion in the competition and the makeup of the draw, but the organising committee for Fifa competitions will be expected to have input. The committee has members from Canada, Mexico and Iran, and its chair is Uefa's president, Aleksander Ceferin. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow.

Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.

Atletico Madrid head into their final Club World Cup Group B matchup on Monday; it's win or go home for the Spanish giants. After being humbled in their opener, Atletico bounced back in classic Diego Simeone fashion, earning a gritty win, walking away with all three points in their second match.

How to Watch Atletico Madrid vs Botafogo

Group B leaders Botafogo, fresh off a shocking win over Paris Saint-Germain, are riding high with momentum. They only need a draw to punch their ticket to the knockout round. On the other side, anything less than a win for Atletico Madrid, and their tournament dreams are done.

Led by a relentless midfield and a backline that can frustrate even the flashiest of attacks, Atletico will look to impose their physical style early and disrupt Botafogo's rhythm. But the Brazilians have already proven they can dance with Europe's elite.

This will be a great Club World Cup matchup; make sure to tune in and catch all the action on Monday!

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are back in action Monday night with a chance to advance to the FIFA Club World Cup knockout stage.

Messi is expected to play as Inter Miami faces Brazilian club Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium, with one foot practically in the next round. Inter Miami can advance with a win, draw or a loss – but would need some help with the latter option.

Also playing at the same time in Group A: FC Porto (Portugal) vs. Al Ahly (Egypt) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ.

If Inter Miami concludes the group stage with a win or draw against Palmeiras, both clubs will advance to the Round of 16. Here's everything you need to know about tonight's match, including losing scenarios to advance.

Stay tuned here for live updates from USA TODAY Sports during both Group A matches.

Inter Miami and Palmeiras play at 9 p.m. ET (10 p.m. in Argentina and Brazil). The Porto-Al Ahly match also begins at the same time.

The Inter Miami-Palmeiras match is available on TBS and TruTV in English, and available to live stream on DAZN. The Porto-Al Ahly match is also available to live stream on DAZN.

Messi is expected to play. His status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match.

Along with Group A, Group B will also be decided Monday. Botafogo plays Atletico Madrid, while Paris Saint-Germain will face MLS side Seattle Sounders at 3 p.m. ET (12 p.m. PT). We'll have the results of those matches here, when they conclude.

Botafogo leads the group, while PSG and Atletico each have three points through two games. The Sounders will play their final match in the tournament.

Stevie Nicol believes fans are struggling to back the Club World Cup as attendances remain relatively low. (1:04)

This is supposed to be the summer of soccer in the U.S. The newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup -- a warmup act for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- has kicked off. And the U.S. men's national team is taking part in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

The idea behind the Club World Cup is that U.S. sports fans would shell out top dollar to see some of the best teams in the world, including Manchester City, Botafogo and Real Madrid, dazzle audiences in competitive matches. Thirty-two teams from practically every continent on the planet -- from River Plate in South America to Urawa Red Diamonds in Asia -- would test their mettle against the presumed European heavyweights.

Meanwhile, the three World Cup hosts face off in their final competitive matches before next summer's extravaganza.

Both competitions were expected to serve as a dry run for next summer's main event, giving organizers plenty of data, the better to discern dos and don'ts.

And yet, despite the importance of and excitement behind both tournaments, tune in to practically any game in either competition and it will be impossible to ignore the empty seats at both intimate 25,000-seat MLS grounds and cavernous 80,000-seat NFL stadiums.

If these tournaments were designed to give fans a veritable buffet of club and international competition, the early signs are that there is a point where U.S. spectators push themselves away from the table and say, "I've had enough." And with teams playing more matches than ever before, the players might not have a great appetite for yet another competition after a grueling 2024-25 club season.

While a match between reigning UEFA Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain and LaLiga's Atlético Madrid drew 80,619 fans to Pasadena's Rose Bowl, an evening encounter involving South Korean side Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa drew a paltry 3,412 fans to Orlando's Inter&Co Stadium. Even better-attended games have suffered from poor optics. A match between Chelsea and LAFC drew 22,137 fans who were all but swallowed up in Atlanta's 71,000-capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On Thursday, FIFA announced an average attendance of 34,773.

The Gold Cup has had its share of poorly attended games as well. A doubleheader involving Haiti and Saudi Arabia, followed by a match between Costa Rica and Suriname, drew just 7,736 fans to San Diego's Snapdragon Stadium. Games involving the USMNT, which Concacaf usually counts on to bolster attendance, haven't gotten fans excited either. The match between the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago drew just 12,610 on a picture-perfect afternoon at San Jose's PayPal Park. Thursday's USMNT match in Austin, Texas against Saudi Arabia drew even fewer; just 11,727. Keep in mind that these numbers are "tickets distributed" and don't necessarily reflect the number of actual fans in the venue.

For the U.S., the poor attendance could be explained by the absences of several star players, such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson. Or it could be the four-game losing streak the national team was in the midst of coming into the tournament.

But what about for the rest of football? Is it simply a case of an oversaturated market? Were FIFA's eyes bigger than its stomach? Or could it be that the U.S. market is simply not buying what FIFA and Concacaf are selling?

The Club World Cup might have "World Cup" right there in the name, but make no mistake, this competition lacks the two characteristics that make FIFA's showpiece quadrennial event an "I remember when ..." cultural phenomenon: history and cachet.

When the real World Cup kicks off next summer, it will be the tournament's 23rd edition, and the 24th, hosted by Portugal, Spain and Morocco, will mark 100 years of the World Cup. So iconic is the Jules Rimet trophy to sporting culture that it's been stolen. Twice.

The Club World Cup has been in existence for only 25 years, and up until this summer, it was an annual event pitting each continent's champions against one another; and with European clubs winning 16 of 20 of those editions, it began to feel like a glorified midseason training camp for the Champions League holders. The expansion of the field to 32 clubs changes that calculus, but the overarching sentiment remains: this is not a competition that players grew up dreaming of playing in, nor is it one that shaped viewers' fandom.

When the World Cup comes to North America next summer, even the sports averse among us can find enough enthusiasm to support the country of their birth or the country of their heritage or even just the country with the finest kits. The indifferent segment of the sporting culture will find it harder to connect with Al Ain or Auckland City or the Seattle Sounders.

And when tickets to the Club World Cup are priced like they're tickets to the World Cup, it shouldn't come as a surprise that stadiums are bereft of all but the most die-hard of fans.

From the beginning, the Club World Cup hasn't been a competition universally embraced by the game or those who live it. High-profile coaches and players including Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and Robert Lewandowski, have raised concerns over the demands being placed on players by the tournament after a long season. The interest from broadcasters and sponsors was tepid. FIFA eventually got what it wanted: a $1 billion broadcast rights fee from DAZN and a $1 billion prize money package that was so large clubs couldn't say no.

There has been a knock-on effect that has trickled down to attendance. One FIFA source indicated that the broadcast rights and prize money issues took up so much of the organization's time that the actual organizing of the games suffered. It wasn't a case of a lack of resources either. According to another FIFA source, the marketing budget to try to boost ticket sales was $50 million, but there was no clear vision as to what the goal was and not enough time to plan. There was also no real comparison with the past, given FIFA had never had another competition -- such as the Gold Cup -- going on at the same time.

The resulting muddled rollout plan has been evident in the Club World Cup's visibility. Several ESPN writers covering the tournament noted a lack of signage promoting the competition in host cities, and few have managed to find sports bars airing games.

There is also an acknowledgment from the tournament organizers that they are competing against some heavyweight U.S. sports. There was golf's U.S. Open on opening weekend, then hockey's Stanley Cup Final, and also the NBA Finals. In terms of soccer, MLS is on a 10-day pause to mark the start of the Club World Cup but will return to action this week, while the NWSL's regular season only just went on hiatus to observe the Women's Euros. This made planning around the games a challenge, and left FIFA making some uncomfortable tradeoffs.

Because FIFA wanted matches to be broadcast in primetime in Europe and Africa, half of the 48 group-stage games had kickoff times of 3 p.m. local time or earlier, with 17 of those 24 matches happening on weekdays.

"The match was clearly influenced by the temperature," PSG manager Luis Enrique said after his team beat Atlético 4-0 at the Rose Bowl in a 12 p.m. local kickoff. "The timing is great for European fans, but the teams are suffering."

There is also the question of whether to stage matches in smaller, soccer-specific stadiums or larger venues. One industry source with knowledge of FIFA's thinking said it was suggested to the organizing body that matches be played in smaller venues, but FIFA preferred to use larger NFL stadiums in order to allow anyone who wanted to attend a match the opportunity to do so. Yet there is an admission on FIFA's part that more needs to go into reaching out to local markets. For example, more outreach needed to be made to youth soccer teams to see if they would be interested in attending.

Then there's the presence of agents from Customs and Border Protection. CBP posted on social media saying it would be "suited and booted" at the tournament opener between Inter Miami and Al Ahly, only for the post to eventually be taken down, but CBP said it would be providing security at the Club World Cup.

The Inter Miami supporters group The Siege canceled its pregame tailgate, stating that the "mixed messaging makes it hard for us to promote a gathering in good conscience; knowing rights could be potentially infringed."

Then there were the ticket prices. FIFA utilized a concept called dynamic pricing that measures demand from fans to help set prices. If demand is high, the price goes up. If not, the price goes down. Count FIFA president Gianni Infantino as a fan.

"I didn't know about [dynamic pricing] but it means that the prices can go up or can go down," he said, "and for us, the important element is to fill stadiums to give opportunities to people to come."

But what Infantino is overlooking is that it leaves fans who paid a premium feeling like they've been duped. There were also instances where FIFA went to extraordinary lengths to sell tickets. FIFA entered into a partnership with Miami-Dade College that provided faculty and students a promotion for the Miami-Al Ahly game. With the purchase of one $20 ticket, individuals with the MDC code could receive up to four complimentary tickets. The Seattle Sounders tried to placate fans who paid full freight during a pre-sale period by giving them two free tickets to their match against Botafogo, but not every fan was so fortunate.

The use of dynamic pricing has led some spectators to adapt to the approach. One FIFA source said that part of the reason why crowds have looked sparse at kickoff is that fans are waiting until the last minute to buy tickets, when prices would go down. As an example, the price of the aforementioned Chelsea-LAFC match dropped from $83 to $51 for general admission.

"We had a good crowd in a big stadium. The atmosphere was good, too," said one club official from a participating team. "It is different from when we've been on tours, and I think that has to do with how they distributed the tickets. We as a club haven't been that involved and maybe that's part of it.

"People see big crowds at U.S. sporting events -- the NFL, the NBA, whatever -- but they often don't realize a lot of work goes into it. This is a new competition and there's a learning curve for everything."

While crowds have often been underwhelming in the first nine days of play, FIFA expects crowds to increase as the tournament heads into the knockout stages. That is similar to what the Gold Cup has experienced over the years. Matches featuring the tournament's lightweights tend to draw poorly, which is why the Gold Cup makes heavy use of doubleheaders. As the tournament progresses, the crowd sizes improve. Concacaf has already distributed nearly 50,000 tickets to the final. FIFA and Concacaf engaged in some collaboration in terms of venues, hence the segmentation that saw most Club World Cup games held on the east coast while the Gold Cup matches took place mostly in the central and pacific time zones.

Concacaf also uses dynamic pricing, although its effectiveness is an open question. An hour before kickoff for the U.S.-Saudi Arabia match, the lowest price for a ticket was $87. In the largely unused second deck at Q2 Stadium, tickets were still being listed at $114. In terms of pricing, Concacaf uses several criteria, including demand, competition, participating federations and day of the week, among others.

Across the first round of matches, the Gold Cup is averaging more than 20,000 fans, including 54,000 for the opening game between Mexico and the Dominican Republic. When asked if Concacaf was concerned about the attendance for the U.S. matches, a Concacaf spokesperson said via email, "We thank all fans who have come out to support their national teams in the 2025 Gold Cup opening games."

Herc Gomez discusses the reasons why fans might be discouraged to support the USMNT at the Gold Cup.

That the U.S. has actually been a drag on the tournament average isn't unheard of. In 2021, under similar circumstances in which the USMNT's top players were missing, the first two Gold Cup matches involving the U.S. drew 12,664 and 7,511 fans.

That the USMNT recently endured a four-game home losing streak hasn't helped, but Trevin Wurm, the chapter management lead for the USMNT supporters' group, the American Outlaws, thinks the reason for the low attendances has more to do with economics rather than the team's form. He pointed to a "huge saturation of soccer" that is dividing fans' attention.

"We've heard from members how expensive prices have gotten at an event like the Gold Cup," Wurm said. "And I think that definitely is keeping some people away. We are working with U.S. Soccer on some things to try and lower prices, and we're always working towards advocating for that. But yeah, the cost is obviously a barrier. I mean, the cost of everything has gone up so much recently that you have less wiggle room for an expense like that."

Whitney Zaleski, who helps with operations for the American Outlaws, added, "There's so much soccer going on, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just kind of is what it is at this point. Leading up into the World Cup, we're just going to keep getting busier."

This summer is perfectly illustrating the point at which American fans can't consume all of that soccer and start picking and choosing where to invest their time and money. And as the sun sets on this summer of soccer, and we transition into the year of the World Cup, the historic 48-team tournament won't have any of the empty calories in the early stages of this summer's competitions.

Stevie Nicol believes fans are struggling to back the Club World Cup as attendances remain relatively low. (1:04)

This is supposed to be the summer of soccer in the U.S. The newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup -- a warmup act for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- has kicked off. And the U.S. men's national team is taking part in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

The idea behind the Club World Cup is that U.S. sports fans would shell out top dollar to see some of the best teams in the world, including Manchester City, Botafogo and Real Madrid, dazzle audiences in competitive matches. Thirty-two teams from practically every continent on the planet -- from River Plate in South America to Urawa Red Diamonds in Asia -- would test their mettle against the presumed European heavyweights.

Meanwhile, the three World Cup hosts face off in their final competitive matches before next summer's extravaganza.

Both competitions were expected to serve as a dry run for next summer's main event, giving organizers plenty of data, the better to discern dos and don'ts.

And yet, despite the importance of and excitement behind both tournaments, tune in to practically any game in either competition and it will be impossible to ignore the empty seats at both intimate 25,000-seat MLS grounds and cavernous 80,000-seat NFL stadiums.

If these tournaments were designed to give fans a veritable buffet of club and international competition, the early signs are that there is a point where U.S. spectators push themselves away from the table and say, "I've had enough." And with teams playing more matches than ever before, the players might not have a great appetite for yet another competition after a grueling 2024-25 club season.

While a match between reigning UEFA Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain and LaLiga's Atlético Madrid drew 80,619 fans to Pasadena's Rose Bowl, an evening encounter involving South Korean side Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa drew a paltry 3,412 fans to Orlando's Inter&Co Stadium. Even better-attended games have suffered from poor optics. A match between Chelsea and LAFC drew 22,137 fans who were all but swallowed up in Atlanta's 71,000-capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On Thursday, FIFA announced an average attendance of 34,773.

The Gold Cup has had its share of poorly attended games as well. A doubleheader involving Haiti and Saudi Arabia, followed by a match between Costa Rica and Suriname, drew just 7,736 fans to San Diego's Snapdragon Stadium. Games involving the USMNT, which Concacaf usually counts on to bolster attendance, haven't gotten fans excited either. The match between the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago drew just 12,610 on a picture-perfect afternoon at San Jose's PayPal Park. Thursday's USMNT match in Austin, Texas against Saudi Arabia drew even fewer; just 11,727. Keep in mind that these numbers are "tickets distributed" and don't necessarily reflect the number of actual fans in the venue.

For the U.S., the poor attendance could be explained by the absences of several star players, such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson. Or it could be the four-game losing streak the national team was in the midst of coming into the tournament.

But what about for the rest of football? Is it simply a case of an oversaturated market? Were FIFA's eyes bigger than its stomach? Or could it be that the U.S. market is simply not buying what FIFA and Concacaf are selling?

With additional reporting by Lizzy Becherano, Rob Dawson, Cesar Hernandez, Gab Marcotti and James Olley.

The Club World Cup might have "World Cup" right there in the name, but make no mistake, this competition lacks the two characteristics that make FIFA's showpiece quadrennial event an "I remember when ..." cultural phenomenon: history and cachet.

When the real World Cup kicks off next summer, it will be the tournament's 23rd edition, and the 24th, hosted by Portugal, Spain and Morocco, will mark 100 years of the World Cup. So iconic is the Jules Rimet trophy to sporting culture that it's been stolen. Twice.

The Club World Cup has been in existence for only 25 years, and up until this summer, it was an annual event pitting each continent's champions against one another; and with European clubs winning 16 of 20 of those editions, it began to feel like a glorified midseason training camp for the Champions League holders. The expansion of the field to 32 clubs changes that calculus, but the overarching sentiment remains: this is not a competition that players grew up dreaming of playing in, nor is it one that shaped viewers' fandom.

When the World Cup comes to North America next summer, even the sports averse among us can find enough enthusiasm to support the country of their birth or the country of their heritage or even just the country with the finest kits. The indifferent segment of the sporting culture will find it harder to connect with Al Ain or Auckland City or the Seattle Sounders.

And when tickets to the Club World Cup are priced like they're tickets to the World Cup, it shouldn't come as a surprise that stadiums are bereft of all but the most die-hard of fans.

From the beginning, the Club World Cup hasn't been a competition universally embraced by the game or those who live it. High-profile coaches and players including Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and Robert Lewandowski, have raised concerns over the demands being placed on players by the tournament after a long season. The interest from broadcasters and sponsors was tepid. FIFA eventually got what it wanted: a $1 billion broadcast rights fee from DAZN and a $1 billion prize money package that was so large clubs couldn't say no.

There has been a knock-on effect that has trickled down to attendance. One FIFA source indicated that the broadcast rights and prize money issues took up so much of the organization's time that the actual organizing of the games suffered. It wasn't a case of a lack of resources either. According to another FIFA source, the marketing budget to try to boost ticket sales was $50 million, but there was no clear vision as to what the goal was and not enough time to plan. There was also no real comparison with the past, given FIFA had never had another competition -- such as the Gold Cup -- going on at the same time.

The resulting muddled rollout plan has been evident in the Club World Cup's visibility. Several ESPN writers covering the tournament noted a lack of signage promoting the competition in host cities, and few have managed to find sports bars airing games.

There is also an acknowledgment from the tournament organizers that they are competing against some heavyweight U.S. sports. There was golf's U.S. Open on opening weekend, then hockey's Stanley Cup Final, and also the NBA Finals. In terms of soccer, MLS is on a 10-day pause to mark the start of the Club World Cup but will return to action this week, while the NWSL's regular season only just went on hiatus to observe the Women's Euros. This made planning around the games a challenge, and left FIFA making some uncomfortable tradeoffs.

Because FIFA wanted matches to be broadcast in primetime in Europe and Africa, half of the 48 group-stage games had kickoff times of 3 p.m. local time or earlier, with 17 of those 24 matches happening on weekdays.

"The match was clearly influenced by the temperature," PSG manager Luis Enrique said after his team beat Atlético 4-0 at the Rose Bowl in a 12 p.m. local kickoff. "The timing is great for European fans, but the teams are suffering."

There is also the question of whether to stage matches in smaller, soccer-specific stadiums or larger venues. One industry source with knowledge of FIFA's thinking said it was suggested to the organizing body that matches be played in smaller venues, but FIFA preferred to use larger NFL stadiums in order to allow anyone who wanted to attend a match the opportunity to do so. Yet there is an admission on FIFA's part that more needs to go into reaching out to local markets. For example, more outreach needed to be made to youth soccer teams to see if they would be interested in attending.

James Olley reacts to Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC at the Club World Cup.

Then there's the presence of agents from Customs and Border Protection. CBP posted on social media saying it would be "suited and booted" at the tournament opener between Inter Miami and Al Ahly, only for the post to eventually be taken down, but CBP said it would be providing security at the Club World Cup.

The Inter Miami supporters group The Siege canceled its pregame tailgate, stating that the "mixed messaging makes it hard for us to promote a gathering in good conscience; knowing rights could be potentially infringed."

Then there were the ticket prices. FIFA utilized a concept called dynamic pricing that measures demand from fans to help set prices. If demand is high, the price goes up. If not, the price goes down. Count FIFA president Gianni Infantino as a fan.

"I didn't know about [dynamic pricing] but it means that the prices can go up or can go down," he said, "and for us, the important element is to fill stadiums to give opportunities to people to come."

But what Infantino is overlooking is that it leaves fans who paid a premium feeling like they've been duped. There were also instances where FIFA went to extraordinary lengths to sell tickets. FIFA entered into a partnership with Miami-Dade College that provided faculty and students a promotion for the Miami-Al Ahly game. With the purchase of one $20 ticket, individuals with the MDC code could receive up to four complimentary tickets. The Seattle Sounders tried to placate fans who paid full freight during a pre-sale period by giving them two free tickets to their match against Botafogo, but not every fan was so fortunate.

The use of dynamic pricing has led some spectators to adapt to the approach. One FIFA source said that part of the reason why crowds have looked sparse at kickoff is that fans are waiting until the last minute to buy tickets, when prices would go down. As an example, the price of the aforementioned Chelsea-LAFC match dropped from $83 to $51 for general admission.

"We had a good crowd in a big stadium. The atmosphere was good, too," said one club official from a participating team. "It is different from when we've been on tours, and I think that has to do with how they distributed the tickets. We as a club haven't been that involved and maybe that's part of it.

"People see big crowds at U.S. sporting events -- the NFL, the NBA, whatever -- but they often don't realize a lot of work goes into it. This is a new competition and there's a learning curve for everything."

While crowds have often been underwhelming in the first nine days of play, FIFA expects crowds to increase as the tournament heads into the knockout stages. That is similar to what the Gold Cup has experienced over the years. Matches featuring the tournament's lightweights tend to draw poorly, which is why the Gold Cup makes heavy use of doubleheaders. As the tournament progresses, the crowd sizes improve. Concacaf has already distributed nearly 50,000 tickets to the final. FIFA and Concacaf engaged in some collaboration in terms of venues, hence the segmentation that saw most Club World Cup games held on the east coast while the Gold Cup matches took place mostly in the central and pacific time zones.

Concacaf also uses dynamic pricing, although its effectiveness is an open question. An hour before kickoff for the U.S.-Saudi Arabia match, the lowest price for a ticket was $87. In the largely unused second deck at Q2 Stadium, tickets were still being listed at $114. In terms of pricing, Concacaf uses several criteria, including demand, competition, participating federations and day of the week, among others.

Across the first round of matches, the Gold Cup is averaging more than 20,000 fans, including 54,000 for the opening game between Mexico and the Dominican Republic. When asked if Concacaf was concerned about the attendance for the U.S. matches, a Concacaf spokesperson said via email, "We thank all fans who have come out to support their national teams in the 2025 Gold Cup opening games."

Herc Gomez discusses the reasons why fans might be discouraged to support the USMNT at the Gold Cup.

That the U.S. has actually been a drag on the tournament average isn't unheard of. In 2021, under similar circumstances in which the USMNT's top players were missing, the first two Gold Cup matches involving the U.S. drew 12,664 and 7,511 fans.

That the USMNT recently endured a four-game home losing streak hasn't helped, but Trevin Wurm, the chapter management lead for the USMNT supporters' group, the American Outlaws, thinks the reason for the low attendances has more to do with economics rather than the team's form. He pointed to a "huge saturation of soccer" that is dividing fans' attention.

"We've heard from members how expensive prices have gotten at an event like the Gold Cup," Wurm said. "And I think that definitely is keeping some people away. We are working with U.S. Soccer on some things to try and lower prices, and we're always working towards advocating for that. But yeah, the cost is obviously a barrier. I mean, the cost of everything has gone up so much recently that you have less wiggle room for an expense like that."

Whitney Zaleski, who helps with operations for the American Outlaws, added, "There's so much soccer going on, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just kind of is what it is at this point. Leading up into the World Cup, we're just going to keep getting busier."

This summer is perfectly illustrating the point at which American fans can't consume all of that soccer and start picking and choosing where to invest their time and money. And as the sun sets on this summer of soccer, and we transition into the year of the World Cup, the historic 48-team tournament won't have any of the empty calories in the early stages of this summer's competitions.

FT: Real Madrid 3-1 Pachuca

Real Madrid got their first win under new boss Xabi Alonso last night but Jude Bellingham criticised the state of the pitches in the US ahead of the World Cup next summer. 

"The pitches aren't great at all. It holds the ball up," said Bellingham. "The ball barely bounces. It's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully it's something that someone will look at, going into next year."

Let's see how the two pitches are tonight.

Hopefully anyway!

Have to confess they aren't the best halves of football I've ever seen but you get the feeling the Atletico Botafogo game could catch fire in the second half.

The Athletic has live coverage of Seattle Sounders vs. PSG from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

This is a public service announcement.

You may think that this Club World Cup is an American affair. You probably looked at the list of host cities, saw FIFA president Gianni Infantino glad-handing with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, noted the distinctive bombast of those grating individual player walk-ons and heard the U.S. national anthem being played before each of the 32 matches so far.

All very American. Fair enough. Hence your confusion.

But sorry, no. Appearances have deceived you. This is actually a Brazilian tournament. The rest of the world just hasn't realised it yet.

First, there are the demographics. 508 players took to the field in the first round of group matches. Seventy of these — 14 per cent — were from Brazil. Argentina had 57 players on that list. Next came Spain with 26.

There are, granted, four Brazilian clubs competing in the U.S. this summer, and the host nation is the only other country with more than two. But the reach of the diaspora is remarkable. There are Brazilians in the ranks of Manchester City, Real Madrid and Los Angeles FC, but also at Esperance de Tunis and Urawa Red Diamonds, Pachuca and Al Hilal, Ulsan and Mamelodi Sundowns. Some countries sell oil, grain or circuit boards to the wider world; Brazil exports footballers.

This, though, is only a footnote to the bigger story. The four Brazilian teams have played eight matches between them so far. They have won six of these, drawn two and lost zero. Each tops their group after two rounds of games.

It's not because they've only had easy fixtures, either. Flamengo duffed up Chelsea. Fluminense went toe-to-toe with Borussia Dortmund. Botafogo defrocked Paris Saint-Germain, the new European champions and any rational person's idea of the best club side in the world right now. “No one has defended better against us this season,” an admiring Luis Enrique, PSG's head coach, said after that match.

The results have been greeted with a mixture of humour and excitement back in Brazil. “The Europeans are sending a petition to FIFA,” went one typically catty gag doing the rounds on Brazilian WhatsApp. “They want Vasco da Gama (the fourth of the big Rio de Janeiro sides) in the competition, so they have a chance of winning.”

Writing in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, former Brazil international Tostao — usually a fairly sober observer of the game — allowed himself to dream, just for a sentence: “Can you imagine the euphoria and pride if a Brazilian team ends up becoming champion?”.

Take a long view of football history and this may appear quite normal.

In the early 1960s, Pele's all-conquering Santos side enjoyed back-to-back victories in the Intercontinental Cup, a competition established at the start of that decade to pit the European champions against their South American counterparts. Flamengo thrashed Liverpool in the same competition in 1981; Gremio and Sao Paulo (twice) also tasted glory in it.

When FIFA first dreamt up expanding that fixture into a Club World Cup in 2000, Brazil's representatives continued to thrive. Corinthians won the inaugural edition in 2000, beating Vasco in an all-Brazilian final. The next two trophies went to Sao Paulo and Internacional.

The years since, though, have been cruel.

In 2010, Internacional were knocked out by Congolese side TP Mazembe. Santos were hammered by Barcelona a year later. Gremio, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Fluminense have all lost to European teams in the final. Before this current tournament began, no Brazilian club had beaten a European side in a competitive match since 2012, when Corinthians famously overturned Chelsea in the Club World Cup final.

You could write a book on the factors underpinning that drift.

The short version is that European football — the top leagues at least — left the Brazilian domestic game behind in a number of areas, from commercialisation and investment to infrastructure and tactical innovation. It is no coincidence that Brazil's most recent World Cup win came in 2002. Nor did the decline go unnoticed: lamentations about the growing quality gap have been a staple of the Brazilian media for decades.

Where, then, have the results of the past nine days come from?

In the first instance, a little context is probably due before we get too excited.

Dortmund and Porto — held to goalless draws by Fluminense and Palmeiras respectively — are not great teams. Fluminense also made extremely heavy work of beating South Korea's Ulsan in a match they were losing with 25 minutes of the 90 to go. Flamengo fans were thrilled with the win over Chelsea but dedicated watchers of the Premier League may not have viewed it as quite such a coup. Even Botafogo's result against PSG came with a minor caveat: Luis Enrique rested several key players that day.

None of which is to say it isn't an eye-catching pattern, or not worth zooming in on. Indeed, even those involved have been struck by the novelty of it all. “I'm surprised by these results,” Flamengo manager Filipe Luis said after the match against Chelsea, where he played for one season a decade ago. “I know the quality of European clubs, especially the elite.”

There are three circumstantial factors at play during this Club World Cup.

One is the climate: Brazilian clubs are more accustomed to playing under a roasting sun. “We're used to it,” Botafogo right-back Vitinho said last week. “I hope that it works in our favour.”

Another is that its teams are midway through their season, which runs from January until December. The national league only kicked off at the end of March. Compared to the European sides, many of whom look exhausted at the end of a long campaign at domestic and continental levels, there is a level of freshness there.

Motivation is also relevant. There has been scant evidence to suggest that the European sides are truly phoning it in, but are they committing to the tournament with every last drop of energy? That's up for debate. Rightly or wrongly, the Club World Cup is not currently seen as being on the same level as the Champions League or even competitions within their own country.

For the Brazilian clubs, like many others from outside Europe, this is a priority. Even if they are just half a percentage point more motivated, it can make a big difference.

“You can see the teams are playing every game like it's a final,” Filipe Luis said on Friday. “That makes a lot of difference.”

There are wider trends at work here, too.

Brazilian football has evolved a lot in the past 10 years, particularly behind the scenes.

A number of the country's big clubs — Flamengo and Palmeiras in particular — have gone to great lengths to become more professional and stable. Their training facilities are every bit as good as those found at the best European teams; their marketing departments have finally found a way to leverage the colossal fanbases that exist in a country the size of Brazil (ie, larger than the contiguous United States).

In 2021, Brazil's government passed a law that introduced a new ownership model for its football clubs, promising to make them more corporate, more sustainable and even — whisper it quietly — profitable. In has come foreign investment: John Textor, the co-owner of Crystal Palace, acquired Botafogo; Red Bull has put significant resources into Bragantino; the City Football Group added Bahia to its roster of clubs.

As recently as 15 years ago, most Brazilian clubs' squads were filled with players at the bookends of their careers: youngsters destined to move to European sides and veterans in the twilight years, in many cases having returned home from those same leagues. The very best young players do still leave but clubs can afford to sign and pay others who are in their prime. The midfielder Gerson, bought by Flamengo from France's Marseille for €15million (£12.8m/$17.2m at current rates) in December 2022 at age 25, is the most obvious example of this trend, but far from the only one.

Nor is it just a question of quality. “You look at the Palmeiras squad and they have two or even three high-level players in every position,” Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said on Sunday, before his MLS team's group game tonight (Monday) against the Sao Paulo side. “It's the same with Flamengo, Fluminense, Botafogo. They have invested a lot of money.”

Alongside the spending has come greater openness to new ideas. A wave of foreigners has freshened up the domestic managerial scene, challenged old notions. Four of the past six Brazilian championships have been won by teams with Portuguese coaches. Little wonder that public opinion over the possibility of a non-Brazilian manager of the national team softened considerably over that time frame, leading to the recent appointment of Italy's Carlo Ancelotti.

The result of all this? Brazil has begun to dominate the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League equivalent, like never before. The past six editions have been won by clubs from the Campeonato Brasileiro. Four of those finals were all-Brazilian affairs.

That might not be good for the overall health of the South American game overall. For Brazil, though, it's a signal that they are doing something right. So too is the growing ease with which they can scout and sign youngsters from other nations on their continent. “They clearly have an economic strength that the rest of the countries do not,” Mascherano, who is Argentinian, said.

The next step is unclear.

There are some who see huge potential, just waiting to be harnessed by good governance, and the right global TV deal. “Brazilian football looks like the next Premier League,” ran a headline in The Economist in December. Botafogo owner Textor has been bullish in his championing of the Brazilian game.

Hurdles remain, however.

The calendar remains bloated: the most successful teams play 70 or 80 matches a season, many of them in the outmoded, low-wattage state championships. This affects the quality of the football, as do poor pitches. Working conditions for coaches have improved but there is still a culture of short-termism and churn.

The Club World Cup, though, is providing hope that the chasm is bridgeable.

Not even the most one-eyed Botafogo fan thinks their team are better than PSG. But maybe they're not as far off as some would have assumed before this tournament began.

“I think there's an elite in football, formed of eight or 10 teams,” Flamengo coach Filipe Luis said last week. “They're far superior. Beyond that elite group, I think the Brazilian clubs are on the second rung.”

Renato Gaucho, his Fluminense counterpart, echoed that view.

“There's no way we can compete with the European teams financially,” he said on Saturday. “They can buy the best players and build incredibly strong teams. But football matches are decided on the pitch. The Brazilian people should be really proud of what our clubs are doing at this Club World Cup.”

The Athletic has live coverage of Seattle Sounders vs. PSG  and Inter Miami vs. Palmeiras from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Gianni Infantino is brushing off early criticisms of the Club World Cup this summer.

The FIFA president, speaking on a small stage at Fanatics Fest in Manhattan this weekend, backed the expanded competition, suggesting any hiccups over its opening week are to be expected because of its novelty.

“So, maybe some criticize it a little bit, but it's something new. It's something special,” Infantino said. “It's a real World Cup with the best teams and the best players.”

The tournament has been condemned on multiple fronts. Global player organization FIFPro were outspoken in the additional demands an expanded tournament places on professionals, and, over the past week, several games featured large sections of empty seating as ticket sales failed to reach the kind of level Infantino would have hoped for.

The FIFA chief accompanied representatives from Serie A side Juventus as they visited President Donald Trump at the White House and was speaking in New York on the day American strikes were launched at Iran, a potential issue for FIFA with Iran having qualified for next summer's World Cup that the U.S. will share with Canada and Mexico.

Infantino's remarks were part of a wide-ranging conversation with Jordan Schultz at the Javitz Center on Saturday. Before the FIFA head spoke at length about his vision for soccer in America, he was asked about the “Gianni Cup,” as Schultz jokingly called the Club World Cup.

“It was about time that somebody invented a World Cup for club teams,” Infantino said. “Since 100 years, we know which is the best country in the world, but, until today, we do not really know which is the best team in the world. So, we thought it might not be a bad idea to create a World Cup for teams to decide.”

While the Club World Cup has existed before, this summer's format, featuring 32 teams with a $1 billion fund, is a first.

The Club World Cup has had its fair share of criticism, stretching back to when players threatened to boycott the competition over concerns with player workload. Many also question whether its prize pool has the potential to unbalance leagues when participating teams return home.

Now that the tournament is underway, though, empty seats and extreme weather have raised eyebrows, particularly as it relates to next year's men's World Cup, also being hosted in the United States.

Infantino insisted the tournament has got off to a successful start. “Well, I think the players who play, they are loving it,” Infantino told Schultz.

He referenced Bayern Munich's Harry Kane, captain of the English men's national team, who spoke fondly of the lively atmosphere he experienced on Friday night in Miami Gardens. That was thanks to Boca Juniors fans who made Hard Rock Stadium feel more like La Bombonera.

“Harry Kane gave an interview saying, ‘It's a fantastic competition. It's beautiful',” Infantino said. “They (players) love it. Those who are not there, of course, they would love to be there.”

That match between Bayern and Boca is a positive sign for the potential a Club World Cup offers. Another is Brazilian club Botafogo beating European champions Paris Saint-Germain, one of the first major upsets.

While the competition is considered Infantino's prized project, he believes a successful Club World Cup and men's World Cup have the potential to change the trajectory of the sport in America.

“The Club World Cup, and with the World Cup next year, is to show to young Americans that, actually, if you are good and if you are talented, you don't need to go to another sport, because through soccer, there is a path for glory and a path for money, as well,” Infantino said.

“You can become famous. You can become rich if you follow a soccer path, which today young Americans don't see. Because they see, of course, the NFL or the NBA or baseball or ice hockey, but we will show them here, in their country, the power of soccer.”

    Los Colchoneros need a win against the Brazilian Group B leaders to progress.
  

The final round of group stage games at the FIFA Club World Cup kicks off with this Group B clash, which sees Atlético Madrid in need of a win against table-topping Botafogo as they chase a place in the round of 16. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are. 

Atlético bounced back from a thrashing in its first game at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, with a professional 3-1 win over MLS outfit Seattle Sounders. 

Botafogo, meanwhile, followed a 2-1 win over the Sounders in its first match with arguably the result of the tournament so far. The Brazilian team shocked newly crowned Champions League winner PSG with a 1-0 victory on Friday to go to the top of Group B. 

Atlético Madrid play Botafogo on Monday, June 23, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT. That makes it an 8 p.m. BST start in the UK and an 5 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Tuesday morning. 

Igor Jesus's first-half strike was enough for Botafogo to grab a headline-grabbing 1-0 win over European champion PSG last Friday. 

The great news for soccer fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds. It can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN that works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100, you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Australia has a second option for watching every game of the tournament live. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. 

A Kayo Sports subscription starts at AU$25 a month and lets you stream on one screen, while its Premium tier costs AU$40 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices.

The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts. 

Better still, if you're a new customer, you can take advantage of a one-week Kayo Sports free trial.

Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and Fluminense are not as rich as European clubs but they have heart and heritage

“The graveyard of football is full of ‘favourites',” warned Botafogo manager Renato Paiva in what has proven to be this summer's coldest line in sweltering United States heat. Gritty draws achieved by Palmeiras against Porto and Fluminense against Borussia Dortmund at the Club World Cup were enough to start a conversation. But the underdog heroics of Brazil's other two clubs have shaken up how we see club football across the world.

For the first time since Corinthians shocked Chelsea in Yokohama in 2012, when some Brazilian fans sold their homes and vehicles to make the trip, the reigning Copa Libertadores champions have beaten the Champions League winners. Igor Jesus, who has been strongly linked to Nottingham Forest, scored the only goal of the game as Botafogo beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, a special setting for Brazilians given it is where they won the World Cup in 1994 and honoured the recently deceased Ayrton Senna.

Not to be outdone by their Rio rivals, Flamengo erased some of the hurt of losing to Liverpool in 2019 – when the Brazil forward Roberto Firmino scored the winner – by beating Chelsea 3-1 to guarantee a place in the knockouts. It was also the first time a Brazilian club has beaten a European side by two goals since Vasco da Gama embarrassed Manchester United in 2000.

“It was a remarkable victory, against a team that needs no introduction,” said Flamengo No 7 Luiz Araújo after the win against Chelsea. “It has a special flavour not only because of the size of the opponent, but also because of all our preparation and dedication up until now. We deserved the result and we want more.

Old heads will be quick to remind us that this is the usual order being restored. Throughout the 20th century, Brazilian sides regularly got the better of those from the Old Continent. Pelé scored five goals as Santos beat Benfica 8-4 over two legs in the 1962 Intercontinental Cup final; he scored four in the final the following year as Santos saw off the mighty Milan. In 1981, Flamengo thrashed Liverpool in the final; and in the 1990s São Paulo beat Barcelona's “Dream Team” in 1992 and then dispatched the great Milan team of the era the following year.

There were valid arguments for the Brasileirão being the strongest domestic league in the world. At the Club World Championship in 2000 – a similar tournament to the one in the United States this year – the best European sides visited Brazil and were soundly beaten. Manchester United, fresh off winning the treble, and Real Madrid did not qualify from their group. Two Brazilian clubs – Corinthians and Vasco da Gama – contested the final.

Despite the odd recent victory for Brazilian clubs – such as São Paulo beating Liverpool in 2005, Internacional overcoming Barcelona in 2006, and Corinthians winning against Chelsea in 2012 – the tide has turned against them in this century. A generation ago, when Brazilian clubs were under less pressure to sell their stars, players such as Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos did not move across the Atlantic until they were well into their 20s, keeping the league strong. Now, however, the clubs are financially mismanaged and have to sell their best talents for a relative pittance when they are teenagers. On top of that, TV rights money in Europe and the financial doping of state-run clubs provided further disparity.

At the Club World Cup, however, matters are being decided between the white lines and away from the boardroom. “Football is played on the pitch, 11 against 11,” says Araújo. “We have great teams in Brazil who are all capable of facing any team in the world. Flamengo always goes on the pitch to win, regardless of who is on the other side.”

The facts don't lie. The four Brazilian teams are unbeaten in the tournament and top of their groups, having scored 14 goals and conceding just four. “The victories show the strength of Brazilian football,” says Fluminense manager Renato Gaúcho, who dismisses the argument that European sides are tired after a long season. “If a Brazilian club loses, they say: ‘Ah, Brazilian football can't measure up to European football'. If they win, they say: ‘Ah, European football is coming back from holiday'. That doesn't exist in football!”

He points out that the teams usually meet at the end of the calendar year, when Brazilian clubs are coming off an even more exhausting season. “When European football catches Brazilian clubs having played between 70 and 80 games a year, nobody makes that excuse. Nobody says: ‘Ah, the Brazilian team is tired'. When the European team crushes them, then they say: ‘Ah, we really can't measure up to them.' Brazilian football has been having a great Mundial, overcoming powerful opponents and achieving results. This shows that money alone does not always win matches.

“Yes, there is no way to compete with the Europeans in terms of finances; they can sign great players and form very strong teams, but football is decided on the field. And, on the field, today, Brazilian football and the Brazilian people have to be very proud of what Brazilian clubs have been doing. When many people didn't believe this would happen, it is happening.”

Palmeiras boss Abel Ferreira has also balked at the idea that European clubs are tired, saying the number of games “excuse” is “a lie” – and something that Brazilian clubs have had to cope with in the past. “When we go to the Mundial, we're also at the end of the season. Porto has 50 games; Palmeiras has 36 already. And when we go to play in a Mundial, we'll have more than 70 games. These are excuses.”

To their credit, Luis Enrique and Enzo Maresca did not make excuses and were very gracious in defeat. But not everyone has been as generous. Marc Cucurella said Chelsea struggled in the heat and the Borussia Dortmund substitutes ridiculously sat inside the dressing room for the first half against Mamelodi Sundowns when the temperature was just 30.5C.

Mauro Cezar, a hugely popular pundit in Brazil, says the European teams showed “a certain arrogance” in not giving the tournament due respect. “European teams entered this tournament without taking it as seriously as those from other continents. Of course, the heat is a hindrance for them, as is the fact that it's the end of the season. But if they have more money, better players and better coaches, they should compensate for these negative points by playing the minimum to overcome opponents who did not cause much concern, at least until the competition began.

“These arguments are valid, but they do not justify Paris Saint-Germain being unable to score a goal against Botafogo and barely threatening; Monterey drawing with Inter; Borussia Dortmund almost losing to Fluminense and conceding three goals to a South African team; Porto being dominated by Palmeiras; and Flamengo crushing Chelsea for practically the entire time. Claiming that the competition is not important does not justify this sequence of results against teams with much lower investment. Not facing this reality is yet another sign of arrogance.”

Araújo, who saw the Chelsea players close up on the field, pushes back on the idea that they do not care about the tournament. “No one goes on the field to lose; everyone wants to win,” says the Flamengo forward. “The game against Chelsea was very competitive. Everyone defends their family, their shirt and the fans who are in the stands cheering them on.”

The Flamengo manager Filipe Luís, who spent most of his playing career in Europe at Atlético Madrid, Chelsea and Deportivo, believes that Brazilian clubs have rebalanced the scales at the tournament but cannot compete with the very best “eight or 10 clubs” from Europe. “Apart from this elite, Brazilians are at the same level as the second European tier because of how we compete, how we understand the game, how we adapt to the climatic and field conditions. This elite is superior to us, but on the field anyone can win.”

As Cezar points out, the “big difference between Europe and South America is money”, with Chelsea alone investing €1.5bn in their squad. “This amount is equivalent to the combined debts of several Brazilian clubs; the disproportion is enormous. Since the European leagues have more global visibility and money, they naturally attract the best coaches and players. Consequently, they are more tactically, technically and even physically developed in some cases. However, when a Brazilian club, like Flamengo, which defeated Chelsea with authority, organises itself financially, with good players within the South American reality, and has a coach with a modern mentality, although very young and without much experience, the result is what we saw in Philadelphia.”

We are only at the group stage of the Club World Cup but, whether it's merely a Fifa cash grab or a holiday camp for the European teams, the tournament has served an unexpected purpose for Brazil. It has allowed Brazilians to take pride in the idea that not everything is always better over the water.

A juvenile was arrested for assaulting an officer, and seven people were ejected after Wydad AC fans were seen setting off smoke bombs at Lincoln Financial Field during the FIFA Club World Cup on Sunday, Philadelphia police said.

Wydad, which is based in Morocco, was taking on Juventus in a group stage match when the smoke bombs went off in a section of the Linc. Wydad fans also set off the smoke bombs during last Wednesday's match against Manchester City in South Philly.

A representative from FIFA told CBS News Philadelphia that smoke bombs are not allowed at their events. Lincoln Financial Field also has a strict bag policy. Fans are permitted to bring the following kinds of bags into the stadium: clear bags within a certain measurement range, a one-gallon clear plastic freezer bag or a small clutch-style bag that is around the size of a hand.

Juventus defeated Wydad in Sunday's group stage match, 4-1.  

The FIFA Club World Cup, which is in the city a year before Philly hosts 2026 World Cup matches, will resume on Tuesday when Esperance de Tunis takes on Chelsea. 

Soccer fans from all over the world have invaded Philadelphia since the FIFA Club World Cup began last week.

United States Women's National Team Icon and Two-Time FIFA Player of the Year Back in Studio for UEFA Women's EURO 2025™ and 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup

Lloyd Makes Summer Debut on FOX and FS1 Wednesday, July 2 as Studio Analyst Across Both Tournaments

LOS ANGELES – With the Summer of Soccer reaching a fever pitch, FOX Sports, America's English-language home for the world's top international soccer tournaments, today announces all-time great and United States Women's National Team (USWNT) legend Carli Lloyd will return for her third consecutive summer as a studio analyst with the network.

“With the UEFA Women's EURO starting up and the U.S. off to a good start in the Gold Cup, I'm thrilled to be back with FOX Sports for what promises to be an incredible next few months of soccer,” said Lloyd. “I can't wait to cover all the storylines across both tournaments and especially with the UEFA Women's EURO, continuing to be a part of growing the women's game on FOX with a really impressive schedule that puts the tournament and players center stage.”

On Wednesday, July 2, Lloyd makes her summer debut in studio for an epic opening edition of WOMEN'S EURO TODAY before UEFA Women's EURO 2025™ kicks off on FOX with Iceland vs. Finland at 12:00 PM ET and Switzerland vs. Norway at 3:00 PM ET. Later that day, she'll be back in studio on CONCACAF GOLD CUP MATCH DAY ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Semifinals from St. Louis, Missouri and Santa Clara, California, starting at 6:30 PM ET on FS1.

Lloyd first appeared as a studio analyst with FOX Sports in April 2022 before becoming a featured member of the broadcast team at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™. She then joined the network for FIFA Women's World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023™ and was back in studio last year for CONMEBOL Copa América 2024™.

A 2025 National Soccer Hall of Fame inductee, Lloyd's legendary international career spanned 17 years and concluded with 316 caps, good for second all-time in U.S. history and third all-time internationally for both men and women. She represented the U.S. on the pitch across three different decades, including four FIFA World Cups™ and four Olympics, and played in more FIFA World Cup™ and Olympic matches than any other player in USWNT history. A two-time FIFA Women's World Cup™ champion, two-time Olympic gold medalist and back-to-back FIFA Women's Player of the Year in 2015 and 2016, Lloyd retired from the game in October 2021 as the highest scoring midfielder in U.S. history with 134 career goals, ranking third all-time for the USWNT.

The winger's provocative post has confirmed supporters' belief that the Red Devils would be better off without him

You might have heard of the film 'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People'. Alejandro Garnacho has just written a sequel: 'How to Lose Fans and Alienate Prospective Clubs'.

The Manchester United winger is enjoying his summer break and looking for a new team after being told to find one by Ruben Amorim. But rather than keep a low profile, he deliberately courted controversy and baited Red Devils' fans with a provocative Instagram post on Sunday evening. Walking into a luxury villa in Ibiza, between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, Garnacho posed wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford's name on the back. Rashford gleefully responded to the post, calling Garnacho 'My brother'.

It was blatantly clear what message Garnacho was trying to send. He was putting himself on the side of Rashford and against both the United coach and the club, forming an alliance of outcasts who are heading for permanent exits from the place that formed them. He was painting himself and Rashford, who were both handed lucrative contracts by United in 2023, as the victims.

And so while Garnacho has served to rile up United fans and confirm the growing suspicion among them that the club will be better off without his petulant attitude, despite his enormous talent, he has also raised a red flag towards all the other clubs who might want to sign him this summer and grant him his exit from Old Trafford...

That's all we've got time for today but thank you for your company!

Don't forget the Club World Cup continues this evening - at the slightly more sociable hour of 20:00 BST - when Atletico Madrid face Botafogo and Seattle Sounders play Paris Saint-Germain to determine which two teams will qualify for the round of 16.

But until then, have a catch-up on the overnight action and the rest of today's football news:



See you soon!

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

In all honesty I'm not going to even attempt the permutations for the rest of the groups after that ... that's a headache for tomorrow's team!

What I will tell you though is how the rest of the week shapes up: 

Tuesday 24 June 

Auckland City v Boca Juniors - 20:00 BST (Group C)

Benfica v Bayern Munich - 20:00 BST (Group C)

Inter Miami v Palmeiras - 02:00 BST (Group A)

Porto v Al Ahly - 02:00 BST (Group A)



Wednesday 25 June 

Borussia Dortmund v Ulsan HD - 20:00 BST (Group F)

Mamelodi Sundowns v Fluminense - 20:00 BST (Group F)

ES Tunis v Chelsea -  02:00 BST (Group D)

Los Angeles v Flamengo-  02:00 BST (Group D)



Thursday 26 June 

Juventus v Manchester City - 20:00 BST (Group G)

Wydad Casablanca v Al Ain - 20:00 BST (Group G)

Inter Milan v River Plate - 02:00 BST (Group E)

Urawa Reds v Monterrey - 02:00 BST (Group E)



Friday 27 June 

Al Hilal v Pachuca - 02:00 BST (Group H)

Red Bull Salzburg v Real Madrid - 02:00 BST (Group H)



Knockout football begins on Saturday 28 June, with the final taking place on Sunday 13 July.

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

The Club World Cup continues tonight as we head into the final group games. 

In Group B, Atletico Madrid play Botofogo and Seattle Sounders face Paris Saint-Germain at 20:00 BST.

In what may come as a surprise, it is all still to play for in Group B because PSG lost to Botofogo who are currently top the group with two wins in two.

PSG are, though, still in a very strong position to qualify for the last 16 because they have a stronger goal difference than Atletico Madrid who sit third on an equal points tally of three.

Botafogo will also qualify if they avoid defeat against Atletico Madrid by a margin of three goals or more or if PSG fail to beat Seattle Sounders.

Furthermore, anything but defeat for Botafogo against the Spanish giants would result in them winning the group.

In terms of Atletico Madrid, if they lose they are knocked out of the competition. If they win or draw then they are relying on scoring a number of goals or PSG losing. 

 Are you still with me? I've lost my head working that out.

The CWC has been more competitive than I expected. With the exception of Auckland and Al Ain, every team has been able to hold their own. Every tournament has a few underdogs - Bayern won 9-2 in the Champions League this season.

Fifa insisted Fifpro and the World Leagues Association were consulted about changes to the overall 2025-30 international match calendar, including the 2025 Club World Cup, which was confirmed by the Fifa Council in December 2022.

"While we disagree with the tenor and content of your letter, we have nonetheless taken note of your concerns and are more than happy to invite you to discuss the matter further at a time convenient to you," Fifa added.

Fifpro, the worldwide representative organisation of footballers, were not impressed with the idea of the Club World Cup when it was announced last year.

"The decision to schedule the FIFA Club World Cup between June 15 and July 13 without implementing further player workload safeguards demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives.

"The extreme mental and physical pressures at the pinnacle of the game is the principal concern of players with multiple club and national team competitions, leading to exhaustion, physical injuries, mental health issues, diminished performance, and risks to career longevity."

We have heard managers and players from Europe's top teams voicing their concerns and frustrations over the fixture schedule for what seems like years now.

And it is no surprise, as those that play for club and country have endured jam-packed season's with very little respite since the 2022 winter World Cup.

League campaign, cup competitions, international friendlies and qualifiers, Euro 2024 and the Nations League are just those that immediately spring to my mind.

So as the expectation on players' to perform consistently at a high level continues, so does the risk of burn-out, fatigue and injuries.

That is one of the issues for this Club World Cup. The European teams want to take it seriously because of the huge prize money at stake, but they are also having to rotate players after long domestic seasons.

It is different for the teams from the United States, South America and Oceania, who have hit pause on their regular seasons and will return to their respective leagues after the competition. 

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

The teams playing in the Club World Cup don't even have to win or draw a game to be financially better off. 

As I just mentioned, there is a participation fee which basically means they get paid for just showing up. 

We know that the European teams are awarded the most, but the South American sides will receive just over £11m, while clubs from North America, Central America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean will each take home £7m.

And even Auckland City, from New Zealand in Oceania, will receive £2.6m for attending.

There has been a lot of talk about what impact this could have on the Premier League if Manchester City or Chelsea lift the trophy because inevitably the more you earn the more you can spend.

But what about the money going to teams from the 'smaller' nations/leagues where their money is likely to help them dominate when they return home?

How can other teams in their domestic leagues realistically compete to make up that £2.5m-£11m difference?

Katie StaffordBBC Sport Journalist

Is the Club World Cup an opportunity for the rich clubs to just get even richer? In short, yes. 

A £775m prize pot will be split between the 32 participating teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m.

But you don't even have to progress far into the competition to bag yourself some serious cash, as clubs will take home a set figure for each round:



Clubs will also receive an award for participation - the fee depending on different sporting and commercial criteria - and European clubs will earn more for taking part than clubs from other continents.

The highest ranked European clubs will receive £29.6m, and the lowest £9.9m.

Not bad, ey?

English champions = absent. Italian champions = absent. Spanish champions = absent.
Argentine champions = absent. Until they work out a better form of qualification, the tournament is a farce!

Tom, London

Fifa president Gianni Infantino came to the defence of the Club World Cup this week while answering questions in Manhattan.

“So, maybe some criticise it a little bit, but it's something new. It's something special,” Infantino said. 

“It's a real World Cup with the best teams and the best players.”

“It was about time that somebody invented a World Cup for club teams. Since 100 years, we know which is the best country in the world, but, until today, we do not really know which is the best team in the world. So, we thought it might not be a bad idea to create a World Cup for teams to decide.”

Infantino also claimed that all players are in favour of the tournament, despite concerns about growing fixtures list and players welfare. 

“Harry Kane gave an interview saying, ‘It's a fantastic competition. It's beautiful',” Infantino said. 

“They [players] love it. Those who are not there, of course, they would love to be there.

"The Club World Cup, and with the World Cup next year, is to show to young Americans that, actually, if you are good and if you are talented, you don't need to go to another sport, because through soccer, there is a path for glory and a path for money, as well."

So the Club World Cup is criticised for having too many weak teams involved and the Champions League is criticised for having too many teams from the strongest leagues.

The financial backing of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) at the revamped Club World Cup means a prize pot of $1bn (£750m) is up for grabs, while top European teams are in line to earn up to £97m if they win. However, this bumper payday has led to concerns such money could distort domestic leagues and skew competitive balance.

Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal, who are in Group H with Real Madrid and sit third, highlight another intriguing aspect of the tournament, as the Riyadh club are majority-owned by the country's sovereign wealth fund. 

In a statement, a Fifa spokesperson rejected the suggestion that investment into the Club World Cup was from one country, saying it now had nine tournament sponsors and that "commercial momentum is strong".

Fifa has also been criticised by campaigners after it appeared to drop anti-racism messaging at the Club World Cup, with some suggesting it may be connected to the policies of President Trump.

Fifa backed 'no discrimination' armbands at the Qatar 2022 World Cup and last month hailed a new disciplinary code "to fight racism more efficiently and decisively". But at the tournament in the US, the governing body instead is promoting a 'Football Unites the World' campaign.

On Sunday, Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso says defender Antonio Rudiger complained of a racist incident. 

Rudiger clashed with Pachuca captain Gustavo Cabral in stoppage time after claiming he had been fouled.

Rudiger spoke to referee Ramon Abatti Abel, who crossed his arms in front of his chest to signal that Fifa's anti-racism protocol had been activated.

Cabral denied he racially abused Rudiger, saying he had used an expletive and called him a "coward".

BBC Sport has contacted Fifa for comment.

Awkward White House encounter between Trump and Juventus players

Football and politics collided at this year's Club World Cup when Juventus spent last Wednesday in the Oval Office of the White House, meeting United States President Donald Trump to promote the tournament. 

However, most of the 15-minute encounter was taken up by questions about politics, rather than sport. Right-back Timothy Weah said the meeting was "a bit weird". 

Trump was presented with a Juventus shirt and one for next year's World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, watched on by Fifa President Gianni Infantino.

I don't particularly care about this tournament, but I do hope that the Premier League sees this eight second rule and implements it with immediate effect. I'd extend it to free kicks too. I'm sick of watching players take five minutes preparing to take one, only to blaze it into the wall or the fans. It should be overturned if they still haven't taken it after 30 seconds (barring injuries/subs etc).

Right then, I think it's time for another round-up of all the main Club World Cup talking points:

While many games have seen swathes of empty seats, there have been contests where atmospheres have been elevated by passionate supporters who have filled the stands in numbers.

We have witnessed some passionate groups of supporters at the Club World Cup - none more so than the Boca Juniors faithful. 

The supporters of the Argentine club have made their presence known in Miami by producing intense atmopshere as their club held Benfica to a 2-2 draw before running Bayern Munich close in a 2-1 defeat. 

There are four Brazilian clubs in the tournament - Botafogo, Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense. Backed by their passionate support, it is no surprise that all four of them sit at the top of their groups heading into the final round of group stage fixtures. 

Fans of clubs like Moroccan side Wydad, Tunisia's Esperance and Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds have also brought the vibes to the tournament.

The apparent lack of supporters has been a hot topic during the Club World Cup and although Fifa are keen to stress that cumulative attendances have surpassed the one million mark after two rounds of matches, there's also been more than 800,000 empty seats. 

The average attendance after 32 games stands at a fairly impressive 35,995. That figure looks even better when you consider that only 3,412 fans that watched Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 victory over Ulsan HD in Orlando last week. That remains the worst attended match so far. 

But ticket sales look less impressive when you factor in the vast size of most of the stadiums, which on average have been only 58% full. 

However, one plus for the competition and Fifa is that attendances have grown during the second round of group matches, up 12% from 52% to 64%.

Will that trend continue as the event progresses? 

The expanded Club World Cup is being considered as a dress rehearsal for the men's World Cup to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.

But the attendance figures from the early stages of the Club World Cup is not great reading for Fifa and the organisers of next summer's mega event. 

More than 400,000 seats were left empty during the opening round of the tournament with the stadiums only 56.8% full. 

Mamelodi Sundowns' 1-0 defeat of Ulsan HD has been the lowest attended game of the tournament with only 3,412 in the stands. 

However, European champions Paris St-Germain's 4-0 win against Atletico Madrid attracted 80,619 while 70,248 attended Real Madrid's 3-1 win against Pachuca in Charlotte. 

Doug Roberson of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said there were several factors for the uneven interest, but "it's not because people here don't care about soccer".

Chelsea beat LAFC in front of 22,137 fans in a 3pm kick-off, but when they previously played at the stadium in Atlanta two years ago, more than 70,000 fans watched them face Newcastle in a friendly which took place at 8.15pm.

Maybe therein lies the reason why the attendances have been blowing hot and cold during the Club World Cup.

June 23 (UPI) -- Malik Tillman drew first blood before Patrick Agyemang played hero with a 75th minute game-winner to lead the United States Men's National Team past Haiti, securing a perfect 3-0 record in the Gold Cup group stage.
Brenden Aaronson and John Tolkin logged assists in the 2-1 victory Sunday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Americans outshot the Haitians 18-8, dominated possession 65% to 34.2% and held a 606-310 edge in passes.

"Overall it was a good performance," U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said. "I think we were not a clinic with the chances that we had. I think we should have scored more."
Pochettino, who is now 8-5 as coach of the Americans, said his players overcame doubt from an early error to secure the win and group-stage crown. That miscue came in the 19th minute, when a turnover from goalie Matt Freese led to an immediate equalizer.


"We scored and then had an accident that we conceded a goal," Pochettino said. "I think that created a little bit of doubt in us. I think it was tough to deal with that. But I think overall the performance was good in the first half.
"The second half was a little bit better."
The Americans' initial attack was denied during the game's first scoring sequence. Aaronson eventually regained control of the ball after his first shot was denied. The veteran winger then got the ball on his right foot and sliced a cross toward the far post. Tillman hovered into the area and finished the play with a header, which beat Haitian goalie Johny Placide. The 10th-minute score was the third of the tournament for the American center midfielder.
"Malik, it is difficult to define him," Pochettino said of Tillman. "What a player that is showing all of his talent and capacity. .... What a talented player. So pleased with him.
"He is a lovely guy. He started to find himself. When he can show it, it is welcome. I think the team is much better when he is involved in the game."
The elation from the Tillman score lasted less than nine minutes, with the Haitians capitalizing on the Americans' 19th-minute error for their equalizer.

Center back Tim Ream started that sequence when he passed back to Freese. The American goalie then mishit a short pass to his left, kicking the ball directly to Haitian winger Louicius Don Deedson. Louicius proceeded to finish with a left-footed shot just inside the far post.
The Americans manufactured several more chances, but went into the second half tied with their visitors. They appeared to earn another lead in the 64th minute, but that score was negated because Tillman hit the ball into the net with his arm.
Agyemang eventually netted the game-winner by beating Placide in the 75th minute. Tolkin sparked that score with a pass from behind midfield. Agyemang tracked down the long feed from the American left back, tapped the ball around Placide at the top of the box and used his left boot to calmly ground a shot into the right side of the net.
The American defense held up over the remainder of regulation to secure the group-stage title.
The U.S. men will take on Costa Rica in a Gold Cup quarterfinal at 7 p.m. EDT Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The winner will play in a semifinal at 6 p.m. July 2 in St. Louis. The Gold Cup final will be held at 6 p.m. July 6 in Houston.

The field at the Club World Cup will whittle down from 32 to 16 over the course of the next week as group stage finales take place across the U.S., paving the way for the knockout stages that begin on Saturday.

As expected, the round of 16 is expected to mostly feature teams from Europe and South America, though that does not mean the tournament has not been full of surprises. South American teams have combined for just one loss so far at the Club World Cup, while Flamengo is one of only a handful of teams to book their spot in the next round with a game to spare after wins against Esperance de Tunis and Chelsea.

Meanwhile, Inter Miami are in a strong position to be the only team not from those continents to crack the last 16 thanks to their surprise 2-1 win over Porto.  Most of the teams who are expected to reach the next round, though, have yet to actually clinch their spots, setting up for a dramatic final round of group stage fixtures.

Man of the match Ilkay Gündogan scores twice in 6-0 win in Atlanta

Cherki opens account; Echeverri, Haaland and Bobb also find net

Manchester City will jet into the inland heat of Orlando's Camping World Stadium for an afternoon showdown with Juventus on Thursday that will decide who claims Group G and probably swerve Real Madrid in the last 16.

Seven-nil rather than 6-0 against Al Ain would have meant a draw would be enough for the scenario but Pep Guardiola's stuttering cadre fell a strike short. The manager, though, shrugged this off.

“With one more goal, we would have two options but we only have one now,” said Guardiola. “It would be better but [more] important is that we are in the next phase. If you want to go through you have to face top teams so it does not matter.”

At a Mercedes-Benz Stadium akin in scale, football-venue-wise, to the Death Star, Guardiola went one better than his pre-match declaration and fielded a completely fresh XI that cuffed aside Al Ain, the behemoths of the Emirati game.

City entered the break 3-0 to the good, making the second stanza a hunt for the four more unanswered goals that would pull them ahead of the Italian giants in the standings.

Inside a venue with the roof on and air-conditioned to a pleasing coolness, conditions were apt for what could be characterised a duck shoot: the record 14-times Pro League victors in the sights of a Guardiola unit that wrestled throughout to find a relentless rhythm.

When Oscar Bobb gave City a 5-0 lead – the substitute weaved over from the right and slid in – five minutes of regulation game time remained.

Next, Rayan Cherki, another replacement, fired past Khalid Eisa and when, moments later, an Erling Haaland toe poke set Phil Foden up at point-blank range City's seventh should have come.

But, to Guardiola's visible disgust, Foden hit the goalkeeper's feet, and by the final whistle City remained in second place.

Even those of an Al Ain persuasion rated their hopes of even a heartening performance in the low percentages yet City were disjointed before, then after, Ilkay Gündogan's ninth-minute breakthrough.

Here, Bernardo Silva swung in a corner from the right, the Emiratis could not clear, the ball bobbled to the German, and a half-swivel took him on to his left foot with which he dinked in a ball aimed for the lurking Haaland.

Except this beat Eisa and bounced sweetly – for City – in; Gündogan's cheeky grin suggested a fluke but neither he or any teammate cared.

All evening, City never threatened to be the mesmeric pass-and-move proposition of the vintage Guardiola years.

Matheus Nunes, patrolling the right, booted one cross straight out. Rayan Aït-Nouri, in a first start at left-back, burst into the area, slalomed past defenders, and flopped over.

But class usually tells. So when Facundo Zabala hauled down Nunes and was booked, Claudio Echeverri applied a dash. From a diagonal to the right of goal the Argentinian arrowed the ball straight home, leaving Eisa a statue. Why the keeper failed to move a foot or so to his left to beat out the free kick is a mystery Sherlock Holmes might struggle to solve.

Guardiola enthused about Echeverri's first start. “I want to tell you a secret: last season, when he arrived, after every training session he practised free-kicks alone,” he said. “Hard work pays off. When the other guys don't practice, they don't score goals.”

Despite their odd bits-and-pieces mode, City could have wandered off for their interval refreshments 6-0, not 3-0, up. Josko Gvardiol's header pinged off Eisa's right post and Haaland spurned two chances you would expect him to pot. One with his left foot from the left flirted with the goal and missed. One with his right from the right was a carbon copy – again rolling wide.

But the stanza did end with the striker on the scoresheet, via the spot, after the VAR ordered the referee, Mustapha Ghorbal, to the monitor. This came after Ramy Rabia flung Manuel Akanji to the turf.

Unlike the FA Cup final when Haaland refused the responsibility – Omar Marmoush took and missed against Crystal Palace – he did step up and registered, stroking the ball low into the right corner.

As City began their second half search for more goals, Echeverri's work was over due to a “twist” in his ankle that made him a “little bit sore” Guardiola said. Foden, the star act of the opening 2-0 win over Wydad, was his replacement.

City's shape was the 4-1-4-1 that has often been Guardiola's preferred configuration across his nine years in charge. With Foden now on, those wearing white had a man who orchestrates the attack and, when Rodri entered for the last half an hour, they had their chief conductor who runs the whole show.

The Spaniard was joined by Bobb as Guardiola reached for Al Ain's jugular, the forward replacing a defender, Abdukodir Khusanov.

The three-man rearguard soon watched as Foden slid over a ball Haaland galloped onto, twice letting go piledrivers stopped by Eisa.

Early on in the opening 45 minutes Nassim Chadli roved along the right, but from a tight angle failed to beat Stefan Ortega. Now, the same. This time a dance across City's area created a straighter route to goal yet, again, his radar was wild.

Part of Gündogan's stellar career is built on his eye for a finish and he soon showed Chadli how to do the business where it counts, as nifty Silva footwork preceded a pass that put City's midfielder in. From here, regulation Gündogan stuff: two strides were followed by a dink over Eisa that this time he certainly meant.

ARLINGTON, Texas – Mauricio Pochettino smiled and shook his head in disbelief. He's been asked about Malik Tillman quite a few times during this Gold Cup, and he's running out of ways to say the same thing.

"It's difficult to define him because, what a player, no?" Pochettino said. 

Tillman scored the opening goal for the U.S. men's national team in what was ultimately a 2-1 win over Haiti to close out the group stage on Sunday at AT&T Stadium. The Americans had already clinched a spot in the knockout round last week after beating both Trinidad and Tobago and then Saudi Arabia. But winning all three games gave the squad nine points and put them at the top of Group D. 

The U.S. will recover for a week before facing Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Sunday, June 29 in Minneapolis (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

Tillman, who has started in all three Gold Cup matches so far, scored his third goal of the tournament in the 10th minute when he headed home a right-footed cross from Brenden Aaronson.

"One of the scouting reports was that the back door is open," Aaronson said. "We have quality with our wingers and are always dangerous with Jack [McGlynn], Diego [Luna] and then with me today, I just saw an overloaded back post and I just thought, ‘Yeah I'm going to hang it out back there."

Tillman was the most entertaining part of the match and used his finesse to consistently put himself in threatening positions. He could have had more goals had those other chances not been called back in the second half. 

First, there was an unintentional handball in the 64th minute. 

Moments later, Tillman collected a pass over the back line from Tyler Adams, made a 360-degree turn, and finished only to have that goal ruled offside.

And then in the 74th minute, Tillman brought the ball down with exceptional control, but his shot went wide left. Even if it had gone in, there might have been an argument for offside.

One minute later, Patrick Agyemang scored the game-winner to give the USMNT its final 2-1 scoreline. It was his fifth goal in nine games.

"To be honest, I get frustrated," Tillman admittedly told reporters after the game. "I don't know if you guys can see it, but I try to keep it more inside of me and not to show it. But yeah, I'm frustrated. Even now I'm still quite disappointed. I should have scored at least one more."

It's taken some time for Tillman to find his confidence and just get into a groove on the international stage. While he scored 16 goals in 34 appearances for PSV Eindhoven last season, he had never found the back of the net for the USMNT before the Gold Cup. Now, the 23-year-old midfielder has scored three goals in three games.

"What a player that is showing this camp his talent and capacity," said Pochettino, who recently described Tillman as one of the most talented players in the country. "The work ethic and the way he's really aggressive – he recovered a lot of balls. 

"He's always trying to help the team press, chasing back, playing in a different position. He can appear like a No. 10 in between the lines, he can be on the right or the left side, he can drop and play like a No. 8 or a No. 6. 

"What a talented player. I'm so pleased with him. So pleased. He's a lovely guy, and he's started to find himself. The team is much better when he's involved in the game."

Now, however, the stakes get higher. While Saudi Arabia and Haiti were solid opponents for a young American squad that's only played together for a couple of weeks, Costa Rica will pose a stiffer test. As will any potential mix of Mexico, Panama or Canada – teams the U.S. will likely have to face in order to win the Gold Cup. 

In those matchups, Tillman's missed opportunities could cost the U.S. So too could the mistake goalkeeper Matt Freese made when he and Tim Ream's miscommunication led to Haiti equalizing in the 18th minute.

But the USMNT has done what it's needed to do so far by winning its group and advancing to the Gold Cup quarterfinals when it could have spiraled after those embarrassing pre-tournament losses.

"The steps that we've made I think are huge," Aaronson said. "From two not great results with Turkiye and Switzerland, I mean, it's tough. You get down on yourself and stuff like that. 

"But what I see from this group is that bounce-back mentality. You come into the tournament and you could let it bother you, you could let negativity bother you. But I think that the biggest thing with this group is we tune everything out. We just keep going."

The United States men's national team beat Haiti 2-1 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday to finish the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup group stage with three wins from three games. 

Malik Tillman opened the scoring for the Americans early in the first half on Sunday. An error by U.S. keeper Matt Freese gifted the Haitians the equalizer just nine minutes later, but Patrick Agyemang put the hosts back in front with a quarter-hour left to play.

"I think we showed a great fight today," Tillman told FOX Sports' Jenny Taft afterward. "We're happy to finish the group with three wins." 

The USMNT will play Costa Rica, which finished as the runner-up to Mexico in Group A, in next weekend's quarterfinal.

Here are three quick thoughts on Sunday's match.

With the USMNT already qualified for the quarterfinals, coach Mauricio Pochettino made four changes to the starting lineup that beat Trinidad and Tobago and Saudi Arabia in the first two group stage games.

The move didn't adversely impact the Americans' cohesion; they started on the front foot for the third straight game and went ahead on a well-worked attack finished by Tillman, who scored his third goal of the tournament off a pinpoint cross from Brenden Aaronson — one of the four new starters.

Freese's gaffe disrupted that momentum and gave the physical visitors a spark, though that faded quickly as the match settled into a slog. Still, the U.S. caught a second wind in the second half; Tillman had two goals disallowed before Agyemang finally potted the winner off a beautiful pass by John Tolkin, who made his first start in place of Max Arfsten.

Tillman continues to be the most productive and impressive American this summer, during which the German-born attacker is getting his first real run of playing time since joining the program three years ago.

All three of Tillman's international goals have come in this Gold Cup. Off the field, the 23-year-old has also endeared himself to Pochettino and his staff, and the PSV man has taken full advantage of the opportunity presented by the absence of longtime first-choice wingers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah, plus (dare we mention) Gio Reyna.

The story of this summer has yet to be written for Tillman and his team, however. Now he has a chance to make an even bigger impression in the win-or-go-home contests to come. 

A tie would have been enough for the U.S. to top Group D, as the Saudis tied T&T on Saturday in a match played simultaneously. The Americans finished a perfect 3-0 in a Gold Cup group stage.

They avoided blood rival Mexico in next Sunday's quarterfinal, but the Ticos present the sternest challenge yet for Pochettino's squad. As promising as this Gold Cup has been for the U.S. so far, the real tests are still to come.

Nick Kyrgios remains sidelined on the ATP Tour, where Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Bublik are the latest champions.

Kyrgios is out of the entire grass season, with the Australian having suffered a setback in his recovery from injury.

He last made an appearance at the Miami Open in March, with Kyrgios having played just five matches in 2025 so far.

Wimbledon arrives shortly in the ATP Tour calendar, where Queen's and the Terra Wortmann Open have just concluded.

Carlos Alcaraz triumphed at Queen's, defeating Jiri Lehecka in the final, while Alexander Bublik beat Daniil Medvedev in Halle.

And Halle champion Bublik has now been discussed by his fellow professional Kyrgios after claiming his fifth ATP title.

It comes after one fan commented on X: “Peak Bublik is what everyone told us peak ‘Kyrgios' was going to be.

“I'm certain he's gonna upset a top 8 seed in R3 of Wimbledon unless he draws Sincaraz (Jannik Sinner or Alcaraz).”

The Australian responded: “This is an interesting take. But again, of course we can't just appreciate two guys going about it the way they want to. Bublik is fun to watch and I'm grateful for all the entertainment. What a result. Keep going Bublik.”

Kyrgios and Bublik have met just once on the ATP Tour so far, with that meeting arriving in Miami back in 2019.

And it was the flamboyant Australian who emerged victorious from that round of 64 meeting, winning 7-5, 6-3.

Kyrgios, 30, has also won more ATP titles than 28-year-old Bublik, boasting seven successes compared to five.

And he's also climbed higher in the world rankings at this stage of their careers, once reaching number 13 compared to Bublik's career high of 17.

A similar storyline has played out in terms of their Grand Slam singles careers, with Bublik posting his best finish with this month's French Open quarter-final run.

Kyrgios in contrast once reached the Wimbledon final, where the controversial figure lost to Novak Djokovic in 2022.

Raducanu confident in protection at events after stalker incident

Britain's Emma Raducanu has praised Wimbledon for doing "an amazing job" to prevent a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets for this month's championships.

As first reported by the BBC, the All England Club's security measures spotted the man had been red-flagged, and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot.

The man followed Raducanu to four successive tournaments in February and the 22-year-old was left in tears when she caught sight of him in the stands at the Dubai Tennis Championships. 

He was later given a restraining order by Dubai police, and his name circulated among the tennis authorities.

"Wimbledon and everyone did an amazing job. I got a notification, the police contacted me and told me everything was OK," Raducanu told BBC Sport in her first comments on the issue.

"I know that I am not the first athlete to go through this, and I probably won't be the last - not just as an athlete, but females in general."

Tennis player Boulter reveals scale of online abuse

Gambling and social media abuse of women in sport - what is going on?

Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021.

She has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home.

The Englishwoman has often had a greater security detail with her at tournaments since the upsetting incident in Dubai, and says she now feels "comfortable and safe" on tour.

"I've had great protection whenever I have been at these events recently," she continued.

"I have a lot more protection around me - especially the ones here in the UK, where it's busy and there's more spectators around.

"I feel a difference, and that reassures me and makes me feel more comfortable."

Sally Bolton, chief executive of All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) told BBC Sport they spend a lot of time on ensuring security measures are tight at Wimbledon.

In addition to screening around the ballot, there are more checks and balances when it comes to those in the queue.

Raducanu also praised Katie Boulter for "taking a stand" after her compatriot spoke to BBC Sport about the scale of online abuse she receives.

Boulter and a number of female athletes across a range of sports have called for more action to be taken against those who abuse players.

"I'm glad Katie spoke out about it because it is something that we all go through," Raducanu added.

"I try and not to read the comments or look at the messages because it makes you upset.

"It doesn't matter how many positive comments you read, you are always going to remember the more negative ones - so I just try and stay away."

Raducanu is competing at Eastbourne, one of the final grass-court events before Wimbledon begins on 30 June.

She will face American Ann Li on Tuesday.

There is no love lost between Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva. 

The tennis rivals got into a heated argument after facing off at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany on Sunday, with Sakkari saying to Putintseva: “Nobody likes you.”

The incident began when the pair shook hands following Sakkari's 7-5, 7-6 (6) win in the first round of the tournament, a grass court tune-up for Wimbledon.

There were clear tensions during the clash, and Sakkari was seemingly furious that Putintseva did not look her in the eye while shaking hands and said something to her opponent about it. 

That initiated a vigorous back-and-forth, with Putintseva offering Sakkari an incredibly sarcastic curtsy.

As both players went to shake hands with the umpire, Sakkari told Putintseva she should've made eye contact “like a human being,” to which a clearly frustrated Putintseva replied: “I was a human being – look at yourself.”

Sakkari walked over to Putintseva's bench and inaudible arguing ensued, with Sakkari eventually muttering “f–king hell” and then repeating “nobody likes you” after some more back and forth.

Finally, the umpire butted in, saying, “Ladies, please,” before Putintseva eventually left the court. 

It's unclear what prompted the no-look handshake from Putintseva, a 30-year-old from Kazakhstan, or if the whole situation was a major overreaction from Sakkari, a 29-year-old from Greece. 

“I don't think she's going to invite me for dinner for the rest of our lives, but I don't care,” Sakkari said afterwards to the on-court interviewer. “I have very good friends and I'll go to dinner with them. Let me leave it here, and just say that I have respect for her as a player, but that's it.”

Sakkari has been ranked as high as the world No. 3 by WTA, and she is currently ranked No. 85. Putintseva is ranked No. 34.

“By the way — not that I care — I shook her hand as most women do,” Putintseva posted over a photo of herself on an Instagram Story. “Clearly not according to the ‘hugging protocol' some men seem to follow.”

Sakkari will play Ekaterina Alexandrova in the next round as she gets ready for Wimbledon, which kicks off June 30.

Of all the US Open mixed doubles teams that were announced earlier this month, Carlos Alcaraz's partnership with Emma Raducanu has drawn the most interest.

After all, these are two of the biggest names in tennis at the moment, as a couple of young superstars with bright futures ahead.

For the Spaniard, he is already well on his way towards cementing his place in history.

Meanwhile, with persisting injury issues that have plagued her career ever since that US Open title in 2021, Emma Raducanu is some way behind.

That has not taken away from their budding relationship though, she assures.

Speaking ahead of their poised partnership at the US Open, Raducanu was asked to expand upon their friendship by Eastbourne reporters.

She started by remembering how they shared the stage even before New York back when she won her maiden Grand Slam title noting: ‘I've known him for years and actually in Wimbledon 2021 was kind of the first time I started getting to know him.

‘I had a good run there and then also again in the US Open in 2021. And I remember he was always playing the day before me and I was playing like the second day of the round and I would see him win.'

Raducanu continued: ‘We have a good relationship still. He's obviously overtaken me a lot, but it's nice that we have that from a while ago.

"Of course I was going to say yes." 🤩Emma Raducanu explains how Carlos Alcaraz asked her to be his US Open doubles partner 🤝 pic.twitter.com/gVHz8i6Xt0

‘I think for all of us, we really kind of value those connections that we had from when we were young because when you become a bit more known or a bit more successful, you just find yourself reverting back to people you knew from a young age because you're like, that's a real genuine connection, because it becomes very busy and you have a lot more friends but the ones that you've known for a long time mean a lot more to you.'

This comes after Alcaraz won his second Queen's title just last week.

Whilst Carlos Alcaraz is the outstanding favourite to win Wimbledon on the men's side, with few even close to his level on grass, the women's tournament is far more open.

In fact, there is no real outstanding contender, thus leaving a power vacuum for someone to fill.

However unlikely, Raducanu will of course have grand aspirations of filling that, especially given she does perform well on grass.

Last year, she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, and will have felt disappointed not to have progressed further.

This time, in the middle of a year where she has found form and fitness unlike times prior, Raducanu can feel confident that she might follow in Alcaraz's footsteps and shock the world with a title at the All-England Club.

Emma Raducanu has shed light on her friendship with Carlos Alcaraz after they signed up to play mixed doubles together at the US Open later this year. Ahead of their blockbuster link-up, the Brit even headed to Queen's over the weekend to watch the world No. 2 win his semi-final match.

Alcaraz had admitted Raducanu took a while to respond to his request to join forces on the doubles court. And the 22-year-old has now joked that she had to “keep him on his toes” before giving a response.

Last week, the five-time Major winner confirmed that he was the one who asked Raducanu to team up. “She took a while,” he jibed.

But Raducanu has explained that she needed to consult her team before making a final decision. “Gotta keep them on their toes!” she laughed.

“I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.”

The pair go way back, and Raducanu admitted Alcaraz played a role in her run to the US Open title in 2021, as she watched him make his way to the quarter-final and wanted to chase him. So it will be a full circle moment for them to team up in Flushing Meadows.

She continued: “I've known him for years and actually in Wimbledon 2021 it was like kind of the first time I started getting to know him, and I had a good run there and then also again in the US Open in 2021.

“And I remember he was always playing the day before me and I was playing like the second day of the round. And I would see him win and then I would have motivation to win and get myself into that position too.

“And I remember he beat Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round and it was like a big win, his breakout kind of win on a big stage and it was really cool to kind of, I guess, go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, but we were staying in touch for the whole time and yeah, it's nice.”

Raducanu gravitates towards those who have known her since before her US Open triumph, and it's no different with Alcaraz - even though he's gone on to become a multi-Grand Slam champion.

“We have a good relationship still. He's obviously overtaken me a lot, but it's nice that we have that from a while ago,” she said.

“I think for all of us, we really kind of value those connections that we had from when we were young because when you become a bit more known or a bit more successful, you just find yourself reverting back to people you knew from a young age because you're like, that's a real genuine connection, because it becomes very busy and you have a lot more friends but the ones that you've known for a long time mean a lot more to you.”

The British No. 1 can also relate to Alcaraz's need to disconnect from the sport. While the Spaniard is known for his yearly trips to Ibiza, Raducanu prefers more low-key activities like yoga and going on walks.

She explained: “I think in that sense, we are quite similar. We both play our best I think when we're in a good creative way, we're enjoying it. You see us smile on the court and have fun and really just lean into those positive emotions

“And I think whenever I have played with, you know, trying to channel any negativity or any of that kind of energy, I don't do so well, and other players might be different, but for me, I need to be in that kind of pretty positive and creative way.

“And I think that is in a way, when I see him play, he's always got a smile on his face and enjoying it and that's I feel like why he's able to do such crazy shots, turn points around that he's maybe not favoured to and pull out these ridiculous shots because it's like a coming from a place of curiosity. Like, what can I do with this? You know, like, can I turn this point around? It's amazing to have that on the men's side and take inspiration when I can.”

Raducanu herself enjoyed a day off on Saturday, heading to the Queen's Club to watch Alcaraz in action. But she doesn't think the world No. 2 will return the favour and travel to Eastbourne this week.

“I doubt it. I doubt it. But no, I saw some like really cool drop volleys and I was like, yes, let's save some of that! But he's got plenty to plenty of magic to bring to New York,” she laughed.

“But it was just, I was having the day off on Saturday and I was with my friends and we were like, let's go to Queen's and watch the tennis and then we went out and to the River Cafe in the evening, it was super nice evening, and then just came here on Sunday.”

Novak Djokovic's ex-coach, Boris Becker, recently made his feelings known about the Serb competing at Wimbledon. The tournament is scheduled to start on June 30 and conclude on July 13, 2025, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in London.

Djokovic was last seen in action at the French Open, where he delivered a significant performance and reached the semi-finals. He locked horns with Jannik Sinner in the second-to-last round and fell short of advancing to the finals as the Italian got the better of him and qualified for the finals with a score of 6-4, 7-5, 7-6(7).

He is now gearing up to compete at Wimbledon and recently arrived at the location. He has already stepped on the court for an intense practice session for the tournament. Following his arrival, he shared a picture of him on X and wrote:

This post drew the attention of his former coach, Becker, who couldn't contain his excitement about him competing in the event and shared a three-word message of support for Djokovic.

The German former tennis player also had a remarkable tennis career, as he became the youngest Wimbledon men's singles winner after he defeated Kevin Curren in the final of 1985.

Shortly after Novak Djokovic's quest to win his 25th Grand Slam title ended after his loss to Jannik Sinner in the semi-final, the Serb sat for a post-match press conference. Here, he revealed that the 2025 French Open could have been his last appearance at Roland Garros. Calling it a wonderful match, he said: (As quoted by tennis.com)

Talking about his wish to compete at the French Open again, he added:

Novak Djokovic has won the French Open title three times in his career, including the 2016, 2021, and 2023 iterations. Overall in the course of his career, the 38-year-old has won a total of 100 singles titles.

Joao Fonseca recorded his first tour-level grass-court win on Monday at the Lexus Eastbourne Open, where he moved past Zizou Bergs 6-7(8), 6-0, 6-3 to reach the second round.

Competing in windy conditions, the #NextGenATP Brazilian recovered from squandering three set points in the first set to triumph after two hours and 10 minutes. With his 13th tour-level win of the season, the 18-year-old became the youngest match winner at the ATP 250 since three-time champion Taylor Fritz in 2015.

First ATP Tour win on grass 🙌Fonseca comes back from a set down to defeat Bergs 6-7 6-0 6-3 in Eastbourne!@the_LTA | #LexusEastbourneOpen pic.twitter.com/alYcrVPOl6

“I am very happy to win my first match on grass, here in Eastbourne, in such a nice place and against a very good player,” Fonseca said. “After a tough tie-break, getting through mentally is very good. I am very happy for this one.”

Fonseca, who was competing in his third tour-level grass-court match, will meet top seed Fritz in the second round. The World No. 57 produced moments of magic against Bergs, highlighted by his stunning pickup to break for 4-2 in the third set. Fonseca will hope to bring that level against World No. 5 Fritz in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

British wild card Daniel Evans defeated Miomir Kecmanovic 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 and Italian Mattia Bellucci beat Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2. Evans next faces Tommy Paul and Bellucci meets Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard or Cameron Norrie.

After an action-packed Queen's tournament, Carlos Alcaraz emerged victorious from the competition on Sunday with a 7-5, 6-7, 6-2 victory over Jiri Lehecka. The Spaniard was forced to dig deep to extend his winning run to 18 matches, and he now heads into Wimbledon in flying form.

Emma Raducanu was in attendance on Saturday to watch Alcaraz, with the pair set to join forces at the US Open for mixed doubles later this year. The Brit is set to return to the court herself when she takes on Ann Li at the Eastbourne Open tomorrow night.

Raducanu will be hoping that she can overcome some recent recurring back problems to ensure that she heads into Wimbledon in good form, with the Grand Slam set to get underway in just seven days.

Emma Raducanu insisted ‘I feel safe' despite being made aware that her stalker had attempted to buy Wimbledon tickets.

In February, Dubai police imposed a restraining order on a man after he left the tennis star in tears by following her to four consecutive events.

He also sent the 22-year-old a letter and asked her for a photograph in a Dubai coffee shop. Raducanu watched from behind the umpire's chair in tears as he was removed from the stands and detained by police.

His name was circulated around the tennis authorities and a re-sweep of the Wimbledon ballot system red-flagged that he had attempted to purchase tickets for this year's Championships. The application was removed. 

Speaking to the BBC, the 2021 US Open champion said: “When I heard that, my thoughts were that everyone at Wimbledon had done an amazing job. I got a notification and the police contacted me, they assured me everything was okay. I know that I'm not the first athlete to go through this and I probably won't be the last. Not just athlete, female in general. It's just something that maybe we all have to deal with at some point. I feel okay, I feel comfortable, I feel safe. I've had great protection whenever I've been at these events.

“At the tournaments, I have a lot more protection around me, especially the ones here in the UK, where there are most spectators around. I feel a difference and that reassures me, it makes me feel more comfortable.”

Emma Raducanu is overcoming her ‘biggest phobia' to push through her back injury.

The British No. 1 is using needles as she manages an ongoing issue.

Speaking ahead of Eastbourne, Raducanu said of her back: “It's okay. I'm still managing it, to be honest. I have good days and bad days with it. I trained, I trained a fair bit last week in London and it was good.

“I was getting a lot of treatment and then woke up pretty stiff at the weekend, took a day off and then trained yesterday and today, but it needs a lot of work and it is up and down. So I'm just trying to manage it as best as I can.

“Big time, I'm doing everything, needles, soft tissue, some muscle stimulation stuff, taping, everything. But it's just ongoing, but it's okay. It seems to be okay today.”

Ahead of the French Open, Raducanu said: “At the start of the year I was so scared of needles. It was my biggest phobia. That was the only way I was going to be able to play Australia.”



Daria Kasatkina says the decision to downgrade Eastbourne to a WTA250 event ‘sucks'.

The move to make Queen's a WTA500 event came at Eastbourne's expense.

“That sucks, honestly. I don't understand this decision.” reigning champion Kasatkina said.

“I think Eastbourne is one of the oldest tournaments we've got on tour. It's like the tournament with a big history. As I remember, it was always a 500, so it's a very nice tournament, and I just didn't see the reason to downgrade to 250, honestly.

“There's always quite a good field, all the players coming here. Plus it was super convenient to go from here to London after, everything was great, I don't know. And also I honestly don't understand why, like, by the rules, it just would be two 500s in the same week.

“Also, you know Bad Homburg, it's a very good tournament as well, so I think they deserve to be 500, but, you know, not for the price of another good tournament being downgraded.

"So I think this is one of the issues, because for example, on the ATP side, there's no problem to have two 500s in the same week. I honestly don't see why it's the problem.”

It's the final week before Wimbledon and players are making their last preparations. 

There have already been some big-name withdrawals, including would-be seeds Casper Ruud and Arthur Fils. 

Qualifying matches are now underway, and the first round will start on June 30...

Emma Raducanu has spoken about how she kept Carlos Alcaraz before accepting his invite to play mixed doubles together at the US Open.

Alcaraz has spoken openly about how he was made to wait by his now-doubles partner, and Raducanu has revealed that the reason for the delay was because she wanted to speak with her team first.

She explained: “Gotta keep him on their toes! I mean, of course, I had to ask, like, my team if they wanted me to play, but for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.”

Nick Kyrgios has now responded to learning Chris Eubanks won't be part of the BBC's punditry team at Wimbledon.

The Australian speculated recently that the world No. 108 had been picked over him to feature for the Beeb, but Eubanks has since confirmed that he hasn't even held talks with the BBC about being a part of their coverage.

Speaking out about the situation, Kyrgios has tweeted: “The media makes me laugh honestly. Low key have always enjoyed Eubanks as a commentator, always going to spin what I say and turn it into some sort of rivalry or friction. I think if we were on the same panel, would be beneficial to the sport. Tennis is weird.”



Andy Roddick has talked up Carlos Alcaraz's chances at Wimbledon.

Speaking on the Tennis Channel podcast, the former US Open champion was asked about what could prevent Alcaraz from clinching the title, to which he replied: “I wouldn't bet against it. I mean, listen, anything can happen.

“(Jannik) Sinner is going to re-enter the conversation. Let's not forget about him. He's still really good. He's number one in the world. He's been the best player in the world for the last however long, especially on a hard court. So let's not get carried away with these results.”

But Carlos was the favourite at Wimbledon before Queen's, and he's the favourite after Queen's as well. I don't think anyone would argue against that.”

Novak Djokovic can breathe a sigh of relief, as reporter Tony Jones will not be part of Australian network Channel Nine's coverage of Wimbledon.

The pair clashed earlier this year and the broadcasters were forced to issue a public apology after Jones called for Djokovic to be ‘kicked out', which was interpreted to be in reference to the 2022 Australian Open.

Jones has since apologised for his comments and insisted that he ‘overstepped the mark', and he is not set to be in attendance at SW19 when play gets underway from next week.

Yulia Putintseva has released a short statement on social media after her row with Maria Sakkari at the Bad Homburg Open. Tensions paired between the two after they shook hands after Sakkari secured a 7-5 7-6 win.

Putintseva fumed at her rival after play concluded, gesturing for her to leave the court and shouting ‘leave me alone'. Sakkari responded by placing her fingers on her lips before snapping back: “Nobody likes you!”

Putintseva has now takes to Instagram to address the incident, posting a selfie with the caption which read: “By the way – not that I care – I shook her hand as most women do. Clearly not according to the ‘hugging protocol' some men seem to follow.”

Carlos Alcaraz believes that a family getaway to Cancun was key in helping him back to form.

The Spaniard went on a trip with his loved ones following his Miami Open defeat to David Goffin in March, and he feels it was important to clear his head away from the court – despite the level of hate he received for going on holiday.

He said: “I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. Instead of practice after that, I took a break and I went to Cancun with my family. And I had too much hate then, because a lot of people, you know, start to say, like, ‘What's going on with this guy that he just lost in the first round, and he didn't practice, he didn't go to the court and keep practicing just to be better?'

"And I think that was the key, just to have five, six days off, not grabbing a racket, not stepping on the court. Just go to vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what should I have done better?"



Former Australian star Pat Cash believes that Carlos Alcaraz is the favourite to land the spoils at Wimbledon.

Following his victory at Queen's, the Spaniard now heads into the competition in flying form – having not tasted defeat since April.

As a result, Cash told BBC Radio 5 Live that he believes the world No. 2 is favourite to win the entire competition.

He said: “You can't really expect better form for him to come into Wimbledon, he's obviously the player to beat.

"I wouldn't back against him winning the title at Wimbledon ... Alcaraz, red-hot favourite for sure."

Daniil Medvedev has revealed that he is hoping to avoid Alexander Bublik in the Wimbledon draw.

Following his defeat to the Kazakhstan star in the Halle Open final on Sunday night, Medvedev said: "First of all Sasha, big congrats to you and your team.

“I hope you're in Carlos' draw at Wimbledon. Please Carlos or Jannik draw at Wimbledon."

Chris Eubanks has insisted that he will not be a part of the BBC's Wimbledon coverage.

Nick Kyrgios hit out at the American star last week, insisting that he was who was replacing him for the coverage of the tournament – a decision which he labelled as ‘very strange'.

However, Eubanks has now spoken out, revealing that he has not even held talks with the BBC about being a pundit. He tweeted a confused gif before writing on X: “All jokes aside… I will not be working with BBC at Wimbledon this year.

“As far as I know, my team hasn't even spoken to anyone from BBC so I'm not sure where that came from. That said, I'm incredibly excited to be back competing at SW19.”

Thanks for following Express Sport's coverage of the day's tennis news. 

We'll be back with more tomorrow as we ramp up the build-up to Wimbledon.

Until then, take care!

Maria Sakkari told Yulia Putintseva 'nobody likes you' at the Bad Homburg Open. 

Both players were involved in a fiery spat at the net after Sakkari won their match in straight sets. 

Putintseva seemed unhappy with Sakkari's antics, while the Greek star blasted her opponent for not looking her in the eye as they shook hands. 

A largely inaudible row ended with Sakkari pointing around the stadium before yelling: "Nobody likes you!"



Alexander Bublik will climb to No. 30 in the rankings after beating Daniil Medvedev to win the Halle title.

Bublik used the momentum of his victory over Jannik Sinner to defeat Medvedev in the final.

He said afterwards: “It's tough to speak. I had such tough months since last Wimbledon to probably this summer. I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon, because I was not enjoying it anymore.

"I promised my coach that I would stay there and keep practising, and after Wimbledon we will make a decision about whether I need to take a couple of months off before trying to come back. Now this is happening. I don't know. Quarters at the French, winner here. I have no words.”

Dan Evans has accused rivals of being too excuse-happy.

The British star, never one for mincing his words, has urged tennis stars to just shake their opponent's hand and accept they were better.

Evans said: “I'm fed up with sportspeople when they lose, there's an issue. Just f****** shake the guy's hand and say, ‘Well done'.

“This day and age, somebody's never better than us. It's always, you know, if we're tired or... Just be a sportsman, be a sportswoman, shake their hand, [say] 'fair play', and let's go. Don't need to know what's happened.”

Jacob Fearnley has defended Jack Draper over his outburst at Queen's.

During his defeat against Jiri Lehecka on Saturday, Draper slammed his racket into the advertising hoardings in a fit of rage.

But British rival Fearnley has now said: “Obviously the players are under a lot of pressure and I'm sure Jack is feeling some pressure, but I think that more has something to do with the fact that he was so close to winning.

“He was 5-5 in the third, and he obviously really wants to do well in front of the British fans and he got broken in a pretty crucial moment and Jiri was serving really good, so he probably thought that it was over.

“I mean, you see players doing it all the time and then I think it was more just the situation he was in, in the match. Not necessarily to do with all the pressure of playing at home. I don't think it was anything really to do with that. I hope the board's all right.”



Carlos Alcaraz is heading into Wimbledon in excellent form. 

And he will be one of the favourites to win at the All England Club. 

With Wimbledon qualifiers getting underway tomorrow, plans are in full flow ahead of the first round. 

Wimbledon starts for good on June 30. 

Jiri Lehecka is 25th in the live rankings after a successful week at Queen's. 

He said on court after losing against Carlos Alcaraz: "It's tough for me to find some words now but I'm happy I had a chance to fight for the title today.

"Congratulations to Carlos and your team for doing a great job as always.

"Unfortunately it just wasn't enough from me today. Thanks for cheering for me the whole week and this [runner's-up prize] looks good too."

Carlos Alcaraz tells the BBC on court: "It's really special this trophy and this tournament. I'm happy to lift this trophy once again.

"Jiri, you had an incredible week and it's a nightmare to play against you. Great week, great job and keep it up for Wimbledon.

"It has been an incredible week. I came without expectations and just wanted to play good tennis and to get used to the grass. It's really special playing here every year and I can't wait to come back next year."

Carlos Alcaraz is the Queen's champion after a much less gruelling third set. 

He broke twice against the excellent Jiri Lehecka and wins 7-5 6-7 6-2. 

We'll have all the best reaction up next...



It's a big early break for Alcaraz, with Lehecka's serve causing him problems throughout this match. 

Alcaraz now leads 3-1 and is serving to go 4-1 ahead. 

Some fantastic serving from Jiri Lehecka means it's all square in the Andy Murray Arena. 

He wins the tiebreaker 7-5 and it's a final-set shootout to decide the Queen's winner!

Alcaraz is serving with Lehecka leading the second set 6-5. 

The Spaniard needs to hold serve to prolong this epic final to a tiebreaker. 

Jiri Lehecka's serving is a major weapon - but Alcaraz's own serves have been excellent. 

Five aces so far. 

Both have exchanged games in the second set, with Alcaraz about to serve at 2-3. 

A tight first set goes the way of Carlos Alcaraz!

At 5-5, the Spaniard gets the vital break as Lehecka puts a forehand into the net on break point.

Alcaraz then serves it out and is half way to his second Queen's title.



Here's the reception afforded to both finalists as they walked out on the Andy Murray Court. Jiri Lehecka will serve first...

The fans expect a Carlos Alcaraz win over Jiri Lehecka and it seems the bookies are also backing him to regain the title he won in 2023.

According to Grosvenor Sport, he's 6/25 on to prevail. Lehecka, is out at 3/1.

We are now just an hour away from the final at Queen's, Carlos Alcaraz v Jiri Lehecka.

Tennis fans can watch live free-to-air coverage of the clash, staring at 2:05pm on BBC One.

Those without television access can still watch via the BBC Sport website and BBC iPlayer.



Carlos Alcaraz has raised eyebrows by stating he'd like to kill Novak Djokovic for beating him in the Olympic Games gold medal match last summer.

The 22-year-old this week sat down with comedian Josh Berry to talk tennis. He was put on the spot by his host when asked his choices in a game of ‘kiss, marry, kill', with the choices Djokovic, Rafa Nadal, or roger Federer.

A hesitant Alcaraz laughed before saying: "I'd kill Novak. For winning that final of the Olympic Games. I could marry Rafa Nadal."

China's Wang Xinyu is emerging as Wimbledon contender after making her first ever WTA Tour singles final at the Berlin Open.

She beat World No. 20 Liudmila Samsonova 6-4 6-1 on Saturday and will play 2023 champion at SW19 Marketa Vondrousova in today's final.

After a fourth straight win against a top-20 player, the 23-year-old said: "This week has been a dream for me. I've been playing unbelievable tennis here."



Toni Nadal, the father of Rafa, has backed the big serving Ben Shelton to shatter the prospect of a Carlo Alcaraz v Jannik Sinner final at Wimbledon.

“Normally, a Sinner-Alcaraz final would be expected, but we're talking about a particular Slam, there are always some surprises,” he told Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport.

“If you find a[Ben Shelton or another great hitter on the day, important heads can fall. Grass is a treacherous surface, where the match can quickly get out of hand.”

Alexander Bublik needs to end his winless record against Daniil Medvedev to capture the Halle Open today.

Bublik, who stunned Jannik Sinner in the second round in Germany, booked his place with a 4-6 7-5 (7-5) 6-4 win over Karen Khachanov. 

The run continues \ud83d\udcabBublik comes back to defeat Khachanov 4-6 7-6 6-4 and returns to the Halle final!#TWO25 pic.twitter.com/J76cBujRFK

Carlos Alcaraz has admitted he always tried to follow Emma Raducanu's matches after the British star watched him plat at Queen's yesterday.

Asked whether he would return the favour and attend one of her games, he replied: "Well, it depends on the schedule, obviously. I have practices. I have matches.

"But I would love to if I have time. If I'm at the club or I don't have anything else to do, yeah, I would love to come and watch her. I'm watching her matches from the TV every time that I can. So watching her in real could be fun."

Cassper Ruud has become the latest seed to withdraw from Wimbledon.

The world No. 16 star has been struggling with a knee injury since the French Open, and recently pulled out of a tournament in Mallorca.

"He's back on court, but it looks like playing best-of-five sets is a bit too soon," said his manager, Tina Falster.

World No.15 Arthur Fils, Sebastian Korda, Zhizhen Zhang and Nick Kyrgios are among the big names already out. 



Welcome back to our live tennis blog as the build-up to Wimbledon continues.

Before attention turns to SW19, all eyes will be on Carlos Alcaraz today as the top seed faces Jiri Lehecka in the final at Queen's.

After kicking off the month with a memorable French Open triumph and plenty of celebrating in Ibiza, Carlos Alcaraz's dream start to the summer continued in West Kensington as the Spaniard made a typically seamless transition onto the grass with his second title at Queen's.

The world number two extended his winning streak to a career-best 18 matches, as he battled past Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7(5), 6-2 in a competitive, high-quality final.

Alcaraz was fairly comfortable throughout the tournament - barring a brief scare against compatriot Jaume Munar in the second round - and will be full of confidence heading to Wimbledon in pursuit of a historic three-peat.

Over at the WTA 500 in Berlin, it was a welcome return to form for Marketa Vondrousova, who defeated Xinyu Wang 7-6(10), 4-6, 6-2 in Sunday's final to secure her first title since winning Wimbledon in 2023.

The Czech made it through an incredibly difficult draw including Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka and Madison Keys, as well as Diana Shnaider and Ons Jabeur, before proving too strong for Wang in the decider.

It's the perfect preparation for Vondrousova as she heads to Wimbledon unseeded and dangerous, making her a nightmare first-round opponent for any of the top seeds.

Staying in Germany, Alexander Bublik was crowned champion in Halle for the second time in his career, ending a seven-match losing streak against Daniil Medvedev to prevail 6-3, 7-6 in the showpiece event. 

Having reached his maiden Grand Slam quarter-final in Paris just a few weeks ago, Bublik continued his remarkable recent upturn in form, seeing off the likes of Jannik Sinner, Tomas Machac and Karen Khachanov en route to capturing a fifth career title.

Speaking after his victory, a reflective Bublik admitted he was close to “calling it quits” after losing in the third round of Wimbledon last year. 

Finally, in Nottingham, McCartney Kessler claimed her third title in the space of 10 months after a hard-fought 6-4, 7-5 victory over Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska.

It was a first piece of silverware on the surface for the American, who has now moved up to a career-high ranking of world number 32 and secured her spot among the seeds at Wimbledon.

It was a desperately disappointing start to the grass-court season for Jasmine Paolini in Berlin as last year's Wimbledon runner-up was soundly beaten by Jabeur in her opening match.

While Jabeur has plenty of grass-court pedigree, having reached back-to-back Wimbledon finals in 2022 and 2023, she has since dropped out of the world's top 50 after a dismal 12 months on tour, so Paolini winning just four games in their Berlin clash came as a major surprise.

The Italian will be desperate for a more productive week in Bad Homburg ahead of travelling to SW19, where she has a significant chunk of ranking points to defend.

Over in Halle, Sinner looked to be feeling the after-effects of his devastating French Open final defeat as the world number one fell to a shock early exit, albeit to eventual champion Bublik.

Despite a relatively routine win over qualifier Yannick Hanfmann in the opening round, the Italian was deservedly beaten by the mercurial Russian-born Kazakhstani, marking the first time he had lost to anyone ranked outside the top 20 since the summer of 2023.

After a bruising couple of weeks, Sinner will be keen to rediscover his A-game quickly at the All England Club as he targets a maiden Wimbledon crown.

Team entries for the new-look US Open mixed doubles event were officially announced on Tuesday and they certainly didn't disappoint.

Some of the most eye-catching pairings included Alcaraz with Emma Raducanu, Sabalenka alongside Grigor Dimitrov and Jack Draper with Qinwen Zheng.

The unprecedented list of star entrants also had Sinner, Iga Swiatek, Novak Djokovic and Coco Gauff all involved.

The event - which is a revolutionary move by the United States Tennis Association in a bid to attract more of the top-ranked singles players - will take place as a standalone event before the start of the US Open on September 24th.

Lorenzo Sonego might have fallen short in his second-round clash against Alexander Zverev in Halle, but the Italian produced a remarkable passing shot that will live long in the memory.

Sabalenka showed incredible movement on the grass against Elena Rybakina to win an impressive point in the opening set of their match in Berlin.

It's one of the quieter weeks on the tennis calendar, with four tune-up tournaments taking place ahead of Wimbledon.

Nevertheless, there are still plenty of notable names in action at the WTA 500 event in Bad Homburg, as Swiatek, Jessica Pegula and Paolini all look to gain some valuable grass-court momentum.

Taylor Fritz and Daria Kasatkina are the top seeds in Eastbourne, while there's also an ATP 250 in Mallorca, which includes the likes of Ben Shelton and Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Andy Roddick has slammed the likes of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, claiming they are taking spots on the US Open mixed doubles draw that should be kept for the specialists. Despite this strong viewpoint, the former tennis star admits that including big names will only "grow the game of doubles" and should be looked upon as a positive thing.

The mixed doubles format for the final major of the year has been changed, moving forward into qualifying week and therefore allowing some of the biggest names in tennis to get some work in at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center ahead of the singles events beginning. It's brought some criticism as the likes of Alcaraz, Raducanu, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro entered their names into the draw, meaning lower-ranked players who planned to play will be set to miss out.

Speaking on Served with Andy Roddick, the American tennis icon has expressed his mixed view on the recently-announced draw, stating that while famous faces will draw viewers to the game, it is also unfair to the tennis stars who specialise in doubles.

The 42-year-old said: "Now, is it taking jobs away from doubles players who kind of run this side tour? Yeah, it is. But, if your net, most important thing is - which is the defence that I get when people are mad at me when I talk about doubles - is, ‘We have to grow the game of doubles,' there is not a better way to grow the game of doubles than to have the biggest stars on earth playing doubles, featured, ESPN prime time, in the lead-up to the US Open."

Roddick added: "This entry list, I thought it would be fine, I thought we'd have some cool names and some cool matchups, [but] this is a 12/10 with the people who are going to do this. Don't argue with me about what mixed doubles should be if you don't get excited about this.

"People were like we had to grow the game of doubles, so we can't take that away from the doubles that people don't watch regularly… that was confusing to me. Now, you get nine of the top 10 on each side, biggest stars on earth, and then some. This is going to bring more eyeballs to the game of doubles."

Roddick's opinion highlights the mixed feelings around the doubles draw for the US Open this year, with many excited to tune into some of the star-studded partnerships we are greeted with. These include Alcaraz and Raducanu, Sinner and Navarro, Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka teaming up with Nick Kyrgios.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament will be a two-day event on August 19 and 20 during the qualifying week of the final major tournament of the season.

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, the tennis default rule reared its head, two players took very different approaches to playing on a deadline, and the French Open champions had mixed fortunes.

The past week suggests that potential disqualifications will continue to be judged on the consequences of a player's actions, rather than the actions themselves.

A fortnight ago, world No. 7 Lorenzo Musetti escaped a default at the French Open. Musetti struck a ball out of frustration and accidentally hit a line judge near her shoulder. The line judge was unhurt and Musetti was allowed to continue with his quarterfinal against Frances Tiafoe, which he went on to win in four sets. The incident was reminiscent of when Novak Djokovic inadvertently struck a line judge and was defaulted from the 2020 U.S. Open — other than the fact that the person involved in the Musetti incident showed no signs of distress.

Then, at last week's HSBC Championships at the Queen's Club in London, Jakub Menšík and Corentin Moutet escaped serious punishment for potentially disqualification-worthy offences. According to the ATP rule book, “Players shall not violently, dangerously or with anger hit, kick or throw a tennis ball while on the grounds of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match (including warm-up).

“For purposes of this rule, abuse of balls is defined as intentionally or recklessly hitting a ball out of the enclosure of the court, hitting a ball dangerously or recklessly within the court or hitting a ball with disregard of the consequences.”

Menšík, the 19-year-old world No. 17 from the Czech Republic, chucked his racket to the floor during the second set of his defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut. He threw it with little force, but it slipped out of his hand and spun off the grass, into the stands. There were no spectators in the first few rows, so nobody was hurt. The chair umpire gave Menšík a code violation warning, the lightest punishment available. Two warnings lead to a point penalty.

The following day, Moutet received the same punishment for whacking a ball into the stands during his defeat to Great Britain's Jacob Fearnley. Moutet, the world No 80, was defaulted at the Adelaide International three years ago for swearing at the umpire, but escaped the ultimate punishment on Thursday. Then on Saturday, Jack Draper received a warning for smashing an advertising board with his racket after being broken by Jiří Lehečka, but he had escaped one when he hit a ball in frustration.

Whether or not a small yellow ball hit in anger hits a wall or someone's eye comes down to chance. At Wimbledon three years ago, Stefanos Tsitsipas leathered a ball into the crowd and missed a spectator by inches.

Deciding whether or not to default players based on outcomes they cannot fully control leaves tennis in a situation where it will face legitimate accusations of inconsistency the next time an umpire's decision means that someone is defaulted for a similar or even lesser offence because someone has been hurt.

At Roland Garros two years ago, doubles player Miyu Kato and her partner Aldila Sutjiadi were defaulted after Kato accidentally hit a ball kid in the neck when returning a ball to her — not even swatting it in frustration — because the ball kid was in tears.

There have been a few spicy tennis handshakes this year, but Sunday's between Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva was the most heated of all.

After Sakkari had won their first-round encounter at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany 7-5, 7-6(6), she was put out by Putintseva's curt, no-look handshake at the net.

Putintseva, the world No. 34 from Kazakhstan who is no stranger to on-court confrontations, gave Sakkari a mock bow in response, prompting Sakkari to say “just be like a human being”. Things quickly escalated and when Sakkari came over to Putintseva's side of the net, the Kazakh told her to “go f—” herself.

“F—-ing hell, I'm what?” Sakkari said in response, before adding: “Nobody likes you. When you shake hands, look at the other person in the eye.”

This brought back memories of Andy Murray saying “no one likes you on the tour, everyone hates you,” to the Czech player Lukáš Rosol in 2015, after he felt he had been barged by Rosol at a change of ends.

Sakkari was asked about the incident in her on-court interview and said: “Let me leave it here and say that I have a respect (for) her as a player but that's it.”

Putintseva, who was booed at last year's U.S. Open when she contemptuously ignored a ball girl who was passing her tennis balls, then posted a photo showing Sakkari avoiding eye contact during handshakes on her social media. Quick handshakes are not uncommon on the WTA Tour, but this level of aggravation between players most certainly is.

There's one player no woman wants to see next to her name in the Wimbledon draw this week: Markéta Vondroušová.

One year ago, Vondroušová was preparing to defend her title at the All England Club, playing through pain in her left shoulder. She lost in the first round and had surgery shortly after, missing the rest of the 2024 season. A fortnight ago, Vondroušová shocked herself at Roland Garros in Paris, and not just by winning two matches and coming within a couple of games of beating the world No. 3, Jessica Pegula, in the third round. Most importantly, she played free of pain.

Rarely has a player looked as high-spirited after a loss as the 25-year-old Czech after falling to Pegula in three sets. She was thrilled to have completed her matches and raring to get to the grass.

She showed why in Berlin last week, beating Madison Keys, Diana Shnaider, Ons Jabeur, Aryna Sabalenka and finally Wang Xinyu to win the title. It's a run that tells everyone else on the WTA Tour to watch out — even though any analyst who hadn't already circled Vondroušová's entry in red would be skating on thin ice.

She is a marvel on the organic surfaces, a finalist at Roland Garros as well as a champion at Wimbledon. She can spin the ball every which way. She's a lefty. She has a mean drop shot and a nasty, low, curling cross-court forehand that can break the sideline from virtually anywhere on the court.

She's also the world No. 72. She's got a decent chance of drawing a seed in the first round, and all 32 of them will be praying that she doesn't. When Vondroušová won it all in west London two years ago, she was the quirky unseeded player with the tattoos and the sphynx cat. She's got a dog now, too, and a game ready to do some damage at a place where she has done it before.

The four players who reached singles finals at Roland Garros had a mixed reacquaintance with grass. Sabalenka saved four match points against Elena Rybakina in the match before she fell to Vondroušová. Carlos Alcaraz went to Ibiza, toughed his way through a couple of rounds at Queen's and then found the extra gear to win the title, becoming the first man since Rafael Nadal in 2008 to win the French Open and the Wimbledon warmup in the same year.

So, how to regard last week's losses for Coco Gauff and Jannik Sinner? One a French Open champion, the other a runner-up who came within a point of winning, and neither with a terrific Wimbledon resume.

Gauff spent a week on a media tour and hanging out with friends following her Paris win. Then she showed up in Germany and played like it, losing in straight sets to eventual Berlin finalist Wang on a day when her head and heart didn't seem to be there. It was reminiscent of Alcaraz's performance at Queen's last year, when he lost to Jack Draper in the second round.

Grass is probably Gauff's worst surface, unless her serve is firing and can get her out of trouble. She's not playing a tournament this week, which means she will head into Wimbledon with just one match as preparation.

Sinner lost in Halle to the eventual champion, Alexander Bublik. Sinner handled Bublik in Paris a couple of weeks ago, but the Kazakh is a nightmare on grass when he is on. Bublik occupies the Vondroušová role in the men's draw at Wimbledon — or would have done, had he not won the Halle title and earned himself a seeding.

Sinner is a little more naturally suited to grass than Gauff, and he has made a semifinal at Wimbledon. But his first serve — key to his rise to the top of the sport and doubly so on grass — has lost some of its reliability in the past couple of weeks. Getting some reps in on that may be more helpful than a few extra competitive matches. Alcaraz spent most of the week at Queen's practicing his first delivery after almost going out of the tournament. That worked out pretty well.

Jack Pinnington Jones will be looking to do some more of this with his Wimbledon wild card.

Channel Nine tennis anchor Tony Jones has been dropped from their Wimbledon coverage following his controversial comments on Novak Djokovic in January.

The 63-year-old has been a key presenter at the Grand Slam tournament for the Australian network in the past. Instead, the channel will turn to its London-based reporters and fly other talents such as Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic in for commentary duties.

In January, Jones made remarks about Djokovic during the Australian Open that stirred controversy and led to the network offering a formal apology. While criticising the Serb, he said "kick him out" - an apparent reference to his deportation from Australia in January 2022 as a result of their Coronavirus regulations.

In comments that were slammed by the tennis world and even by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Jones said: "Novak, he's overrated. Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out... Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me."

After labelling the comments as "disrespectful," the tennis legend declined a courtside interview with the broadcaster until Jones apologised for his words. While on-air on Channel Nine, Jones said: "If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd, 'Kick him out.'

"Now, I can stand here and put whatever spin on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the COVID years when he was kicked out [over his vaccination status]. Now, that has angered Novak, which I completely understand now.

"So look, it has been an unfortunate situation. It's been one of personal angst for Novak. It's quite clearly personal angst for me as well. But I just think the priority here now is to focus on the tennis again."

Channel Nine also relayed their contrition publicly, stating: "Nine would like to apologise to Novak Djokovic for any offence caused from comments made during a recent live cross. No harm was intended towards Novak or his fans."

Serbia's ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, decried the treatment of his compatriot, saying: "Never has an Australian athlete been insulted and disrespected in such a way by the media or any public official in Serbia."

Before the commencement of this year's Australian Open, Djokovic confessed he experiences "trauma" each time he encounters Australian immigration and passport control due to his deportation from the country three years earlier. He told the Herald Sun: "The last couple of times I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration - I had a bit of trauma from three years ago.

"And some traces still stay there when I'm passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is ­approaching. The person checking my passport - 'Are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go?' I must admit I have that feeling."

Wimbledon is set to kick off next Monday, June 30, with Djokovic setting his sights on matching Roger Federer's eight-title record at the grass court championships. He reached the final last year, but was beaten in straight sets by Carlos Alcaraz 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4).

A triumph in London would see him equal Federer and also surpass Margaret Court's impressive tally of 24 Grand Slam titles, a number with which he is currently even.

Tennis

Alexander Bublik captured his first ATP Tour title of the 2025 campaign by downing Daniil Medvedev in straight sets, to claim the Halle Open for a second time in three years.

When Bublik beat Andrey Rublev in the final of the German ATP 500 event in 2023, it represented the biggest title win of the Kazakh's career. Now, his triumph signifies a continuation of some red-hot form as tennis transitions from clay to grass.

The 28-year-old defeated world No. 1 Jannik Sinner en route to this title, ending the the Italian's imperious streak of not suffering defeat to anybody other than Carlos Alcaraz since August 2024. He then dazzled with victories over Tomas Machac and Karen Khachanov, before dispatching Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (4) on Sunday. He had never beaten the Russian in six previous meetings.

Bublik prevailed in relatively straight-forward fashion, breaking former world No. 1 Medvedev just once in the match — doing so to love in the first set for a 5-3 advantage, before subsequently holding without reply to take a big advantage.

The pair traded holds throughout the second in a high-quality showing, both giving little away. Bublik, though, was forced to work in order to save a set point on serve. He and Medvedev could not be separated until the tiebreak.

The 2021 US Open champion forged 4-1 ahead thanks to a mini-break, but soon found himself on the receiving end of the type of effervescent, varied tennis Bublik has showcased in recent weeks. The world No. 45 went on to dominate from the back of the court, while showcasing deft touches to bring Medvedev forward at opportune moments. A remarkable return to six consecutive points in the tiebreak saw Bublik seal the match, dropping to the floor with his head in the hands.

His achievements of the past few weeks are barely believable after he lost motivation last year, dropping from No. 17 to No. 62, and admitted he was close to calling an end to his career.

“It's tough to speak, I had such tough months since last Wimbledon 'til this summer,” Bublik said on-court. “I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon because I was not enjoying it anymore, and I promised my coach I stay there, keep practicing and after Wimbledon will make a decision whether I need to take a couple months off before trying to come back. This is happening. I have no words.”

Ahead of his stunning French Open round-of-16 victory over Jack Draper, Bublik said he has always balanced tennis and his personal life in equal measure, a luxury sometimes not afforded to those operating at the very elite level.

But it now seems he has struck a winning balance. A Turin Challenger title, French Open quarterfinal and second Halle crown behind him, he now enters Wimbledon in perhaps the strongest form of his career. Crucially for the rest of the best in the world, he will now be seeded, meaning he can't roll up against a top player in the opening round and bamboozle them as he does done to so many in recent weeks.

And Medvedev, whose defeat ended his unbeaten record over the Halle champion, knows just what a threat he could pose at Wimbledon. “I hope you are in Carlos or Jannik's draw,” the Russian said.

Bublik will likely fancy his chances wherever he lands.

While Jannik Sinner commands the ATP rankings for another week, his rival Carlos Alcaraz is slowly gaining on him. Their contrasting results over the past week made it possible for the Spaniard to cover some ground.

Sinner's title defense in Halle came to an end in the second round against eventual champion Alexander Bublik. His early exit cost him 450 points and he has 10,430 points to his name this week. Alcaraz, meanwhile, added 450 points to his total thanks to his title-winning run at Queen's Club. His current tally stands at 9,300 points.

While Alcaraz has managed to narrow the gap, it will be a while before he has a chance to overtake Sinner. The Spaniard is the defending champion at Wimbledon, meaning he has 2,000 points to defend. A successful title defense could lay the groundwork for his eventual ascension given the massive chunk of points Sinner has to defend post Wimbledon. 

Alexander Zverev remains steady at No. 3, while Jack Draper moves up by two spots to No. 4 this week thanks to his semifinal run at Queen's Club. The Brit's rise pushed Taylor Fritz and Novak Djokovic down a spot to No. 5 and No. 6 respectively. Lorenzo Musetti is a non-mover at No. 7. 

Holger Rune is up a spot to No. 8. Daniil Medvedev returns to the top 10 in light of his runner-up finish in Halle. He's up by two places to No. 9, with Ben Shelton rounding out the region at No. 10. 

Alexander Bublik's triumph at the Terra Wortmann Open 2025 in Halle was a run for the ages. He became the first player other than Carlos Alcaraz to beat Jannik Sinner since August 2024. He also beat Daniil Medvedev in the final. His title-winning run has also secured him a seeded spot at Wimbledon.

Bublik climbed 15 spots to No. 30 in this week's ATP rankings. Former US Open champion Marin Cilic captured the title at the Nottingham Challenger over the weekend. He became the oldest player to win a Challenger tournament on grass. His victory has pushed him back inside the top 100, jumping 16 positions to No. 85. 

Gabriel Diallo is one of two players in the top 100 to record new career highs this week. He rose by three places to a new peak of No. 41, while Nishesh Basavareddy also moved up three spots to make his top 100 debut at No. 99.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

A tennis match in Germany ended in ugly scenes when an argument erupted at the net following a fixture involving former world No.3 Maria Sakkari, who told her opponent: "Nobody likes you".

In an opening-round match at the Bad Homburg Open a week out from the start of Wimbledon, Sakkari overcame Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan 7-5, 7-6(6).

Sakkari, who hails from Greece, then accused Putintseva of not looking her in the eye as they shook hands, prompting her Kazakhstani opponent to sarcastically perform a bow.

"Respect me like a human being," Sakkari said.

Putintseva shot back as she walked to her chair.

"I was being like a human being," Putintseva said. "Look at yourself."

Some inaudible arguing followed with Sakkari lurking at Putintseva's chair, before Putintseva said: "Just leave me alone".

Sakkari uttered the words "f---ing hell" while walking away, before heading back toward Putintseva after hearing another comment.

Sakkari twice told Putintseva: "Nobody likes you".

"When you shake hands, look at the other person in the eye," Sakkari added.

The chair umpire eventually interjected, saying: "Ladies, please".

Simultaneously with the umpire's comment, Putintseva performed another sarcastic bow.

During last year's US Open, Putintseva attracted backlash for disrespect she showed a ball girl.

As the ball girl tried to pass balls to Putintseva, who's now 30, the Kazakhstani did nothing but glare at the girl with her arms by her side, refusing to catch the balls.

"Who does Putintseva think she is?" German legend Boris Becker wrote at the time.

"Terrible behaviour towards the ball girl."

Former Australian star Rennae Stubbs wrote: "The disrespect and obnoxious behaviour here is unbelievable and typical from her".

Putintseva apologised on social media, but also took aim at her critics.

"Its [sic] kind of scary the way [the] world can judge someone from just a 3 second video, that someone post from one side, without seeing the rest on what was really happening," Putintseva wrote.

"I was just playing tennis and lost a tough game, which was very close (in my opinion) to turn that match around. After the game (as you can see on a pic) i [sic] got very much disappointed and was almost crying, that i didnt [sic] do better."

Wimbledon's women's and men's singles tournaments are set to begin next Monday.

Sakkari and Putintseva will both play singles tennis at the London major.

      JAMES COONEY FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA



Veteran Channel Nine sports anchor Tony Jones will not be part of the network's Wimbledon coverage this year after being involved in a controversy with Novak Djokovic during the Australian Open.

Jones has been a longtime Wimbledon presenter for the broadcaster, but he will be watching the British grand slam from Melbourne this year.

Nine will be using its London bureau during the tournament and will be flying local experts Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic over for commentary.

Jones sparked controversy in January during a broadcast of the Australian Open when he made remarks about Djokovic and his Serbian fans, including the phrase 'kick him out,' which many interpreted as referencing Djokovic's 2021 deportation from Australia.

'Novak's overrated. Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out... Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me,' he said.

Djokovic called the comments disrespectful and later boycotted a courtside interview with the broadcaster until he received a public apology from Jones.

'If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd — 'kick him out',' Jones said on Nine.

'Now, I can stand here and put whatever spin on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the COVID years when he [Djokovic] was kicked out [over his vaccination status].

'Now, that has angered Novak, which I completely understand now. So look, it has been an unfortunate situation. It's been one of personal angst for Novak.

'It's quite clearly personal angst for me as well. But I just think the priority here now is to focus on the tennis again.'

Nine also issued an apology over the incident: 'Nine would like to apologise to Novak Djokovic for any offence caused from comments made during a recent live cross. No harm was intended towards Novak or his fans.'

Serbia's ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, also expressed his 'profound concern' to Channel Nine at the time.

In a statement, the ambassador said: 'The Embassy of the Republic of Serbia considers Mr Jones' comments [to be] totally inappropriate and disrespectful.

'Never has an Australian athlete been insulted and disrespected in such a way by the media or any public official in Serbia.'

The tournament is set to start later this week, with the Serb superstar looking to match Roger Federer's record of eight titles at the event.

Sarah Michelle Gellar wants to bring back the dead for the new “Buffy” reboot series. Gellar, who reprises the role of Buffy Summers for the Hulu pilot, said during the Filming Italy Sardegna Festival that she is determined to have her fellow alums return — even if their characters already died onscreen.

“Buffy the Vampire Slayer” aired on the WB for five seasons from 1997 to 2001 before moving to UPN for two more seasons. The series landed spinoff “Angel” from 1999 to 2004. Yet the revival — which is still at the pilot stage and hasn't been greenlit to series just yet — will be different in tone from the franchise predecessors.

“It will be lighter than the last few seasons of the original,” Gellar said, as translated by Vanity Fair. “We will try to find a balance between new and old characters. My dream is to bring back everyone who has died, but space will have to be made for new stories as well.”

Those new stories will center around newcomer Ryan Kiera Armstrong's character, described in the casting announcement as an introverted high-school student who is a young Slayer. Armstrong's co-leading character is also “more Willow than Buffy,” according to TVLine. The 15-year-old Armstrong also starred in the Disney+ series “Star Wars: Skeleton Crew.”

 










The “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” revival will continue to be a genre and audience “crossover” show, as Gellar said. “One of the surprising aspects of ‘Buffy' is that it's always been a crossover series,” Gellar added. “We're trying to figure out how to modernize the themes of the series, especially what it means to feel like an outsider in a world dominated by social media. What we want to explore are the space-time boundaries that affect society today.”

Gellar executive produces the series and agreed to return after hearing Oscar winner Chloé Zhao's pitch for the show. “Every pitch I heard was just like, ‘Let's just do “Buffy” again,'” Gellar previously told Elite Daily of why she finally decided to agree to a revival. “Why? But the passion that [Zhao] came to me with, what she wanted to do with the show and the character, and why ‘Buffy' is needed now — it was the first time where I thought, ‘OK, there's a reason.'”

Gellar said that the revival has been in the works for four years. “We won't do it unless it's 100 percent right and there's 100 percent a reason,” she said. “The whole point of an antihero is to be a hero for the people who don't fit in the box, the people who aren't like everybody else. That's who I want to tell stories for.”

 










Original “Buffy” star Alyson Hannigan has hinted that she might return for the reboot. Gellar also confirmed that the series would pay tribute to late actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who played her younger sister Dawn Summers during Seasons 5 through 7. “We'll be able to do something,” Gellar said. “We'll do what's appropriate.”

Zhao is directing the pilot, with “Poker Face” scribes Nora and Lilla Zuckerman writing the 20th Television and Searchlight TV series. “Buffy” creator and writer Joss Whedon has no involvement in the reboot.

Alex Warren's “Ordinary” remains the biggest song in the world, as it notches an eighth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 and a sixth stanza atop Billboard Global Excl. U.S.


	Meanwhile, “Killin' It Girl” by j-hope, of BTS, and GloRilla launches at No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S. and No. 3 on the Global 200 and Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” hits the Global 200's top 10, bounding 11-7.

	











	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020, rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	“Ordinary” leads the Global 200 with 68.9 million streams (down 2% week-over-week) and 11,000 sold (down 5%) worldwide June 13-19.

	











	Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” holds at No. 2 in its second week on the Global 200.


	j-hope and GloRilla's “Killin' It Girl” debuts at No. 3 on the Global 200 with 55.1 million streams and 43,000 sold worldwide, following its June 13 release. The same day, BTS reunited, with j-hope performing the song live for the first time at his concert in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.


	As j-hope achieves his first Global 200 top 10 as a soloist, here's an updated count of BTS members' top 10 totals on the chart as soloists: Jung Kook (five); Jimin, JIN (three each); V (two); and j-hope and Suga (one each). BTS boasts 11 top 10s as a group.


	GloRilla likewise lands her first Global 200 top 10 with “Killin' It Girl.”


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” dips 3-4 on the Global 200, after 18 weeks at No. 1 starting last September, and ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” descends 4-5, after 12 weeks at No. 1 beginning in November.


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” jumps 11-7 on the Global 200 with 39.4 million streams (up 11%) and 1,000 sold (up 4%) worldwide. The song, which has surged on TikTok, becomes the singer-songwriter's first top 10 on the chart, marking the latest milestone in her steady career ascent.


	“Ordinary” tops Global Excl. U.S. with 50.4 million streams (down 2%) and 4,000 sold (down 8%) outside the U.S.


	“Killin' It Girl” enters Global Excl. U.S. at No. 2 with 48.6 million streams and 25,000 sold outside the U.S. The song is j-hope's second top 10 on the chart solo – here's an updated rundown of BTS members' Global Excl. U.S. top 10 totals as soloists: Jung Kook (seven); Jimin (five); JIN, V (four each); j-hope (two); and Suga (one). BTS has banked 11 top 10s as a group. GloRilla earns her first top 10 on the ranking.

	











	“Die With a Smile” keeps at No. 3 after 17 weeks atop Global Excl. U.S. starting last September; “Manchild” falls to No. 4 after debuting at No. 2; and “APT.” drops 4-5, after reigning for a record 19 weeks beginning in November.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated June 28, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 24.

The song returns to the top a week after Sabrina Carpenter's "Manchild" interrupted its reign.

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” rebounds for a third week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.


	The singer-songwriter's first Hot 100 leader returns to the top, from No. 2, a week after Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” soared in at the summit. Carpenter's second chart-topper dips to No. 2 in its second week.


	Concurrently, “Ordinary” takes over as the most-heard hit on radio, becoming Warren's first No. 1 on Billboard's Radio Songs chart. The single, which Warren co-wrote, spends a fourth week at No. 1 on the Adult Pop Airplay list and a second week at No. 1 on Pop Airplay, while reaching the top 10 (11-9) on Adult Contemporary. (“Ordinary” dethrones Doechii's “Anxiety” on Radio Songs after the latter led the past five weeks; “Anxiety” hit No. 9 on the Hot 100 in May.)


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated June 28, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, June 24. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary” tallied 20.4 million official streams (down 3% week-over-week), 61.5 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 14%) and 7,000 sold (down 2%) in the United States June 13-19.


	As the track ascends 3-1 on Radio Songs, it drops to No. 2 after seven weeks atop the Digital Song Sales chart and holds at No. 4 on Streaming Songs, following four weeks at No. 1.


	“Ordinary” is also the hottest hit on the Songs of the Summer chart for a fourth frame, having led each week since the seasonal survey made its annual return.


	This o-bservation from chart-watcher Pablo Nelson:


	“Yes, the category here is rather specific: For all the Hot 100 No. 1s whose titles are one-word adjectives – from ‘Amazed' by Lonestar to ‘Windy' by The Association – ‘Ordinary' is the first to begin with the letter ‘O.' ”


	Per that official stat, however obscure (but original!), one-word Hot 100 No. 1 titles, adjectives or not, continue to be fairly prominent in recent years, influenced by social media, among other factors. “Ordinary” is the third such leader this year, joining Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” and Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther.”


	Three one-word titles also ruled the Hot 100 in both 2024 and 2023, following two in 2022, five in 2021 and a single-year record 10 in 2020.


	Carpenter's “Manchild” descends to No. 2 in its second week on the Hot 100. It drew 21.1 million streams (down 22%), 16.8 million in radio audience (up 20%) and 3,000 sold (down 83%). It surges to the top 20 on both Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after it launched in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It rebounds for a fourth week atop  Streaming Songs (21.7 million, down 2%) and notches a fifth week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with the No. 2-peaking “Just in Case,” which keeps at No. 4, and “I'm the Problem,” which is steady at No. 6 – as Wallen logs his fifth week with at least three simultaneous top 10s this year, matching Kendrick Lamar for the most. Wallen's I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three of his current top 10s, claims a fifth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Lamar and SZA's “Luther” repeats at No. 5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. It adds a 26th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest command on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking).


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stays at No. 7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” is stationary at No. 8 after five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, remains at No. 9. It posts a record-extending 66th week in the top 10 and a record-padding 96th week on the chart overall.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” is a non-mover at No. 10, after it reached No. 2.

The legendary multihyphenate speaks with The Hollywood Reporter about her new album, 'The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two,' and why she prayed her voice would show up for it. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Barbra Streisand is having breakfast. 


	It's Wednesday afternoon, just after 1 p.m., and the legendary artist is sharing blueberries with her three beloved Coton de Tuléars. She's happy to multitask, however, as there's work to do in promoting The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, a new album of duets that drops Friday, June 27. The sequel to 2014's Grammy-nominated Partners finds Streisand sharing lyrics with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Sting, James Taylor, Hozier, Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and more.




	The roster reads like a who's who of the music business, a list that it seems only Streisand could land for one record. “Isn't it great? I'm very lucky,” Streisand tells The Hollywood Reporter over the phone from her home in Malibu. She's also counting her blessings that her voice rose to the challenge of recording 11 new songs, a feat accomplished after a grueling schedule of completing the narration for her New York Times best-selling memoir My Name Is Barbra.

	“My voice was very hoarse,” recalled the EGOT winner of the moment she entered the studio to record the first song. “I remember it was such a powerful moment. I prayed to God literally to have my voice there for me. I opened up my mouth to sing the song, and my voice was there, which was a shock to me. I can't explain that moment, really. I hope I can make you understand what that feels like. It was just an album that was meant to be.”


	Below is what an interview with Streisand is meant to be. It's full of asides, loving commentary to one of those dogs, Miss Violet, and even one “like butta” moment with Streisand spelling it out for specificity, “b-u-t-t-a.” Streisand also offers an update on her forthcoming documentary project with Frank Marshall and Alex Gibney and whether or not she'll perform live again.

	











How are you?


	I'm just splitting blueberries with my doggies, we're eating.


That sounds like a great afternoon.


	It's my morning.


Well, good morning to you. First of all, what an honor, I'm so grateful for the time.


	You're so sweet. Thank you.


With all the heaviness in the world, it was such a joy to put the new album on repeat yesterday and disappear into these duets and listen to your beautiful voice all day. How do you feel about putting out an album right now?


	I feel great about it. What are you thinking?


Just in terms of what's happening in the world. An album of love songs and duets is a nice respite from the news.


	Music does that. It brings out the warmth and the spirit and the love in the world rather than the hate. It's good timing.


Definitely good timing. It feels like you are the only living artist that could put out an album of duets and get this incredible mix of legends like Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and James Taylor with pop superstars like Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey.


	Isn't it great? I'm very lucky.


Can you talk about your creative process — how do you decide who to duet with and on which song?


	My producers, Peter Asher and Walter Afanasieff, and my longtime A&R man, Jay Landers, brought me a lot of choices. At the time, I had just finished reading my audio book [for the recording] for six weeks, five days a week, six hours a day. My voice was very hoarse, and I thought when I came to the studio to record my first song, I remember it was such a powerful moment. I prayed to God literally to have my voice there for me. I opened up my mouth to sing the song, and my voice was there, which was shock to me. I can't explain that moment, really. I hope I can make you understand what that feels like. It was just an album that was meant to be.

	











Wow. Your prayers were answered because your voice sounds so silky and stunning.


	Like butta. B-u-t-t-a.


Yes, exactly.


	It surprised me. I was never one to really warm up my voice. I just never had the energy or the theory about it. I was also too lazy and always busy. Prayer overtook that, I don't know. I can't even tell you what that felt like. I can't really explain it, but when I walked into the room with my producers and engineer, who's fantastic, it was like … they were applauding. I thought, “Oh, I must have done good here.” I did hear it in my earphones. I wondered, “Where did that come from?”


You've never done any warmups or even tricks of the trade to keep your voice in shape?


	No, I'm just too lazy. I can't explain that. I try to, and then after five minutes I'm bored and really I have to go back to the news or something that interests me. It's a gift that I'm very pleased to have.


You're obviously doing something right. This album is the second volume to Partners, which was released in 2014 and went on to earn a Grammy nomination for best traditional pop vocal album. It featured duets with only male singers. What sparked the invitation to duet with female singers on this one with Ariana, Mariah and Laufey?


	Why wouldn't I? I'm an advocate of women, and I really wanted to sing with some women on this album.


What were the conversations to get Mariah and Ariana together, and what was the recording process?


	You know what, I can't remember now. Did I do it alone? Some of the songs, I do my vocal first and then people work around me. In this case, the women wanted to do theirs, I think. Jesus, I forget things like that. Ariana is so young and powerful, she can do it fast. Mariah wanted to take her time and do it. Her process was trying it one day, and then trying it another, I think. But I was in the middle. I'm the oldest of these beautiful powerful voices.

	











	I met Mariah several times over the years, and I worked with Ariana before. She came in and joined me in Chicago the last time I sang live [at the United Center in August 2019]. We rehearsed the day before in my hotel room, and the next day we performed [the song “Enough Is Enough”]. Well, it was 70,000 people in the audience, just like the 70,000 when I sang in A Star Is Born at Sun Devil Stadium in Arizona. Can you imagine? I went onstage that first time and said, “I know this is a rock and roll concert, but I'm going to sing you a song that I just wrote for the movie called ‘Evergreen' and I hope you like it.” That was the first time I ever sang my own song.


Wow.


	It was exciting. That number, 70,000 — whoa.


Hearing you mention that performance, I can only imagine that when people read this or hear the song you recorded with Ariana and Mariah — or any of them for that matter — people will want to know if there's a chance you will perform any of the tracks live?


	I never say never. Who knows what's in store?


I read the great interview you did with David Remnick in The New Yorker so I know that you didn't forget the recording process with Bob Dylan. You said that Bob stood on his feet for three hours with you to record “The Very Thought of You.”


	That's right.


And that it was “three extraordinary hours.” Can you tell me more about your time with Dylan?


	We were all kind of scared a bit because I was told I can't bring anybody to the recording studio, not even my producers. So I was kind of scared, but thrilled to be meeting him in person for the first time. My husband wasn't allowed to come. He usually comes to my sessions. He likes to do that. Bob came with his wife. I actually gave him a copy of my book and inscribed it with something like, “You and I were 19 years old at the same time, strolling around Greenwich Village looking for work.” He was performing at the same time I was performing at the Bon Soir, my first real professional job as a singer. I wanted to be an actress, I just took those jobs and entered a talent contest before that so I could afford my apartment.

	











	It was just interesting that we have been around each other then and then years later, I think it was the ‘70s or was it the ‘80s? I forget. That's why it took me so long to write my book. I worked on it for over 10 years and had to have a researcher. “When did I do that? When did I do this? What year was that?” I have no idea. It's on the tip of my brain. [Streisand, speaking directly to her dog] What's the matter, honey? You want another blueberry, sweetheart? What was I saying?


You were talking about the book.


	Thank you. And by the way, tell the truth here. Everybody is saying the book was 992 pages but it's not, so correct it. I just looked it up the other day and it's 966 pages. I was wondering why they were saying 992? If you want to count the acknowledgements or the back of the book where they list everything? I don't know. What's that called?


The index?


	It's one of those words, but my editor was interesting. She said, “Don't put everybody's name in so they could just go to the back of the book to see if they're in it.” So whatever, the point is that it's 966 pages of story.


Well, people devoured all those pages. Hearing you talk about the book made me think of this other project you are working on about your life. I read last September that you're doing a documentary on your life with Frank Marshall and Alex Gibney. How's it coming along?


	I guess slowly because there's a lot of work to do, and they're both very busy men. I've only seen a little short reel that they showed me and my record company. But it's good. It was a good piece. I only had one interview with them, but they've been interviewing people in my life, so that's been good. I guess I haven't seen it. I only did one interview so far.

	











Back to the album. I love the video clip you posted of Paul McCartney for your duet “My Valentine.” Paul says there were “moments of terror” recording with you, I assume because of the nerves. How would you describe your time recording?


	Oh, easy. My dog is crying. Oh, no. What is it, honey? What is it? What is it? I know you want more to eat, but we finished all the blueberries. Look, there's nothing left. That's Violet. Miss Violet.


Hi, Violet.


	How would I describe it? Well, he hadn't sung his song in a long time. That was funny because he had to get used to it again. I mean, he wrote it a long time ago. For me, I just learned it. I saw it and sang it a few times. But it was so sweet to see him. He's written so many great songs and some popular, famous songs. He has a huge catalog. He's so sweet. He is a doll. Very, very sweet. I remember meeting him. Can you imagine? In England. I must've been there doing Funny Girl. Somehow he invited me to his house with his first wife, Linda. Just a lovely thing to do. See, I don't remember things. I never play my own records. I also sang one of his songs, “With a Little Help From My Friends” on one of my albums. I don't remember the name of the album but anyway, he wanted to meet me and he was very sweet to invite me over then.


You don't listen to the albums? How has your process changed now, when you put a new album like this one out in the world, do you engage with reviews, comments or any of the reception?












	Oh, I mean, I love good reviews. I love when people get the story right. Here comes my husband taking my empty cereal. Yeah, I'm going to finish my coffee, honey. What's the question, how do I engage with the reception?


Yes.


	Somebody from my record company or Jay Landers or Ken Sunshine, people who have been in my life many, many years will send me something. 


My last question: How is life in Malibu now after the fires?


	We had to leave our house. I needed to take a shower. We went a hotel. But the [fire] five years ago was the horror story. This was horrible, I mean, it shook me up between what's going on in the world now and in our country. It is very disturbing. It makes me want to get on a boat and sail away.

					By Justin Kroll 

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: After setting up her biopic project with Netflix and Chernin Entertainment, Ronda Rousey is now ready to tag in the person to take on directing duties for the film adaptation of her bestselling memoirs. Sources tell Deadline that Augustine Frizzell is set to direct the biopic based on Rousey's memoirs My Fight/Your Fight and Our Fight, which she co-wrote with her sister Maria Burns Ortiz. Chernin Entertainment is on board to produce.


	Deadline first reported the news of how this package came together, starting with Rousey working in WME's story group department to learn about screenwriting structure and technique. After going through dozens of scripts from others, she would ultimately pen the script by herself in just seven days, shocking her agents who couldn't believe she was a first-time writer. The script was soon taken to market, with Chernin moving fast to land a meeting and come on as producers.

	











	When it came to finding a director, everyone involved wanted a woman to help tell Rousey's story. After meeting several candidates, Frizzell came in and blew everyone away with her take for the film. A fan of Rousey long before she began directing TV episodes and feature films, sources say Frizzell had read both memoirs before she got the call to meet on it and knew right away this job needed to be hers. Not only is Frizzell a fan, but in her spare time she trains in Muay Thai and is well-versed in the world in which the former UFC champion came up.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Netflix also had strong ties to the director, having most recently set her to direct four of the eight episodes of the upcoming Netflix series The Boroughs. With the Duffer Brothers producing, the series created by Jeffrey Addiss and Will Matthews is a high priority for the streamer.


	The Rousey project was originally set up at Paramount in 2015, when the studio acquired rights to the first memoir My Fight/Your Fight. Following a handful of regime changes at the studio, the rights would eventually lapse, with Netflix ultimately jumping on them after exec and longtime Rousey fan Michelle Evans championed the project.


	What's interesting here, given how much time has passed since the first memoir's release, is that Rousey has written a second memoir, Our Fight, which goes into even more detail about her life. Some of those new details include suffering her first loss to Holly Holm and contemplating suicide post-fight; her history with concussions that preceded her MMA career; and her tumultuous relationship with her longtime coach Edmond Tarverdyan.


	As for Frizzell, the rising star got her big break with her directorial feature debut Never Goin' Back, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and was released later that year by A24. The film was nominated for the John Cassavetes Award at the 2019 Independent Spirit Awards.  She would also direct the pilot for the hit HBO series Euphoria., and the StudioCanal/Netflix film The Last Letter From Your Lover.


	Frizzell is repped WME.

Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona are continuing their respective indie reigns: After Arjona stole scenes in “Blink Twice” (and now appears in “Andor”), and just as Johnson is helping make box office history at A24 with “Materialists,” both actresses are adding in yet another critically acclaimed hit to their summer resume with “Splitsville.” 

The comedy was first announced in 2024 and recently premiered at Cannes 2025. Michael Angelo Covino directs and co-writes with his “The Climb” collaborator Kyle Marvin; the duo also star alongside Johnson and Arjona as their respective spouses in “Splitsville.” 

 










Yet it's the buzzy synopsis, and not just the casting, that will turn heads: Ashley (Arjona) wants a divorce from her husband Carey (Marvin), who seeks marital advice from his friends Julie (Johnson) and Paul (Covino). Yet after Carey discovers the secret to his friends' happy marriage is being open, Carey takes it a little too far, throwing all of their relationships into chaos.

Nicholas Braun, David Castaneda, and O-T Fagbenle also star. Johnson, Covino, and Marvin produce along with Emily Korteweg, Ryan Heller, Jeff Deutchman, Ro Donnelley, and Samantha Racanelli. 

The IndieWire review out of Cannes praised Marvin and Covino's script for being “consistently funny,” while cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra “stages the action with a propulsivity and creativity that makes the domestic problems feel cinematically alive.” 

The review further reads, “‘Splitsville' probably won't greatly advance the conversation around open relationships and their viability, but we're not sure that's the intention. Still, the filmmakers have created an utterly endearing tale of four people trying to negotiate their own desires in the silliest ways possible with unexpected chaos around every turn.” 

“Splitsville” was far from the only critically acclaimed film that Neon had at Cannes: Prior to the distributor garnering its sixth consecutive Palme d'Or with Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” Neon nabbed “The Secret Agent.” It also had “Alpha,” “Orwell: 2+2=5,” “Sentimental Value,” and “Splitsville” going into the festival. Neon will soon release “Fjord” and “Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo” too, both of which were at the Cannes market.

Neon is releasing “Splitsville” August 22 in theaters. Check out the trailer below.

Look at Oscar-winner Sean Baker's Letterboxd account, and the first thing you'll notice is how much he watches. The director behind “The Florida Project” and “Anora” logs an impressive array of films almost every day on the platform, ranging from current releases to obscure curios from the '70s and '80s. He has four favorites listed on his page — “The Idiots,” “Nights of Cabiria,” “Oasis,” and “Miami Connection” — but one wonders what else of the many, many films he watches most informs and represents the great director's taste.

IndieWire can exclusively unveil a list of some of Baker's favorite films, which the director curated in collaboration with Pluto TV. The list includes films released between 1960 and 1998, and ranges from a Best Picture-winning romantic comedy classic (“The Apartment”), grimy horror favorites (“Friday the 13th Part IV: The Last Chapter”), and tiny, provocative indies (“Buffalo '66”). It's far from a list of all his favorite films, but it's a starting point for some of his favorites — a pretty great launchpad for discovery.

Looking at the list, it's clear how some of the films here might have inspired Baker's work directing scrappy, humanistic independent movies. It's not a surprise, for example, that a director so interested in portraying the marginalized and working class onscreen would gravitate to a film like Ken Loach's coming-of-age tragedy “Kes,” a sensitive portrait of a neglected boy who finds an outlet through training a falcon. Other films are a bit more surprising deep cuts, like the 1983 juvenile detention center drama “Bad Boys,” or the 1986 action thriller “Runaway Train.”

Pluto TV will air a marathon of all 10 of Baker's picks on Tuesday, June 24, on their Spotlight Channel. The marathon comes during the free streamer's “Summer of Cinema” promotional campaign, and is part of Baker's partnership with the streamer's “Free Movie Weekend” initiative, which works to promote independent movie theaters from across the country by offering complimentary movie tickets on select weekends throughout June and July. The marathon will begin on 8 a.m. ET and run through 2 a.m. ET on Wednesday, June 25. Immediately afterwards, Baker's film “Red Rocket” will screen on the Spotlight Channel.  

Read on for 10 of Sean Baker's favorite films, listed in chronological order and with commentary from the director himself. 

“‘The Apartment' is a brilliantly layered exploration of loneliness and ambition,” Baker said, “where Billy Wilder's perfect balance of humor and heartbreak crafts a world that feels both timeless and painfully relatable.”

Baker: “‘Kes' is an unflinching portrait of youth, class, and escape, where Ken Loach's raw realism gives the film a heartbreaking authenticity, capturing the quiet rebellion of a boy's struggle to find freedom in a world that never lets him go.”

“‘The Harder They Come' is a raw, electrifying anthem of rebellion, where the gritty energy of reggae and the unrelenting spirit of its characters ignite a cinematic fire that still feels revolutionary and undeniably alive.” 

“‘The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' is a gritty, heart-pounding thriller that expertly captures the pulse of New York in the '70s, blending sharp dialogue with a tension that never lets up, making every moment feel like a breathless race against time. Also one of the most beautifully shot films of the 70's, in my opinion.”

“Sean Penn's performance in ‘Bad Boys' is a raw, unapologetic tour de force — he brings a depth to his character that's as disturbing as it is compelling, capturing the raw pain of youthful rebellion.”

“‘Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter' is about as bat shit crazy as the slasher genre got. The sex and violence is gratuitous, just as it should be. I was 13 when I saw this in the theater and loved every moment of it.”

“A raw, unrelenting tale of escape and survival, where the harsh, unforgiving Alaskan landscape mirrors the characters' inner turmoil — bringing together a pulse-pounding energy with a gritty realism that makes every second feel like it's teetering on the edge of chaos.”

“‘River's Edge' is a haunting snapshot of disaffected youth, where the film's stark, almost nihilistic realism pulls no punches in exploring the cold, chaotic disconnect between young people and the world around them. And it's Keanu Reeves' best performance, in my opinion.”

“‘King of New York' masters the art of stylized grit, blending slick visuals with an unrelenting atmosphere that pulls you into the dangerous pulse of the city, where every corner hides a raw, desperate story.” 

“The craftsmanship on display — especially the way Gallo uses color, framing, and offbeat humor — feels daring and meticulously thought-out. This film has aged like fine wine.”

Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona are continuing their respective indie reigns: After Arjona stole scenes in “Blink Twice” (and now appears in “Andor”), and just as Johnson is helping make box office history at A24 with “Materialists,” both actresses are adding in yet another critically acclaimed hit to their summer resume with “Splitsville.” 

The comedy was first announced in 2024 and recently premiered at Cannes 2025. Michael Angelo Covino directs and co-writes with his “The Climb” collaborator Kyle Marvin; the duo also star alongside Johnson and Arjona as their respective spouses in “Splitsville.” 

 










Yet it's the buzzy synopsis, and not just the casting, that will turn heads: Ashley (Arjona) wants a divorce from her husband Carey (Marvin), who seeks marital advice from his friends Julie (Johnson) and Paul (Covino). Yet after Carey discovers the secret to his friends' happy marriage is being open, Carey takes it a little too far, throwing all of their relationships into chaos.

Nicholas Braun, David Castaneda, and O-T Fagbenle also star. Johnson, Covino, and Marvin produce along with Emily Korteweg, Ryan Heller, Jeff Deutchman, Ro Donnelley, and Samantha Racanelli. 

The IndieWire review out of Cannes praised Marvin and Covino's script for being “consistently funny,” while cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra “stages the action with a propulsivity and creativity that makes the domestic problems feel cinematically alive.” 

The review further reads, “‘Splitsville' probably won't greatly advance the conversation around open relationships and their viability, but we're not sure that's the intention. Still, the filmmakers have created an utterly endearing tale of four people trying to negotiate their own desires in the silliest ways possible with unexpected chaos around every turn.” 

“Splitsville” was far from the only critically acclaimed film that Neon had at Cannes: Prior to the distributor garnering its sixth consecutive Palme d'Or with Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” Neon nabbed “The Secret Agent.” It also had “Alpha,” “Orwell: 2+2=5,” “Sentimental Value,” and “Splitsville” going into the festival. Neon will soon release “Fjord” and “Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo” too, both of which were at the Cannes market.

Neon is releasing “Splitsville” August 22 in theaters. Check out the trailer below.

With an archive of more than a thousand original movies produced over the last 15 years, Hallmark Channel and its stars have shared plenty of cute and funny bloopers with fans. But the outtake that Ashley Williams posted on June 22, 2025, in honor of Paul Campbell's birthday may very well take the cake as the best Hallmark blooper ever.

Williams waited over a year to share what happened as they filmed the final scene of “Falling Together” in the spring of 2024. During what was meant to be a sweet, romantic moment, Williams wrote in the caption, “a background actor… let one rip RIGHT by where Paul and I were about to kiss.” 

“It's the blooperiest of bloopers and it makes me cry laughing to this day,” she wrote, and then made matters even funnier with a smattering of puns, joking, “Paul, you are the wind beneath my wings. The air in my tires. You blow me away. Happy birthday, partner.”

Williams added narrative text over the video to ensure fans could tell exactly when the flatulence in question occurred. In a scene designed to look like one of the Alzheimer's Association's annual fundraising walks, Campbell could be heard delivering his line to Williams. 

Over the video, she pointed out in text, “Here's the fart. You really gotta listen…We both CLEARLY hear it. But the camera is still rolling so we can't react.”

Trying to stifle their laughter, Williams says through gritted teeth, “We have to kiss.” After smooching, she whispers and wheezily giggles, “Did you hear that?” and Campbell kisses her again just to disguise their laughter. 

As the camera pans out, she writes over the video, “We cut. I collapse on Paul.” 

Many fans said they were in tears over the blooper video, flooding Williams' post with comments, including one who wrote, “I'm crying from laughter watching this! 🤣” and another who called it “the best thing ever 😂”

One fan commented, “I laughed so hard and laughed even harder hearing you laugh 😂”

Someone else admitted, “you are a hoot Ashley Williams, you made me laugh so hard, I about peed myself 😂😂😂😂”

“I have no idea how you kept your composure so well,” someone else wrote. “I died laughing immediatly!!! 😂🤣”

Williams has every right to toot her own horn about the hilarious blooper from “Falling Together,” which premiered on Hallmark Channel in September. But believe it or not, it's not the only gas-induced outtake in the Hallmark archives. In 2023, a gassy horse named Noodles caused a bit of a stir during the filming of “When Calls The Heart” season 10. 

Plenty of other mishaps have been responsible for laugh-out-loud bloopers on the sets of Hallmark movies and series over the years, with stars getting tongue-tied or tripped up over what's happening on-set. 

One classic, seen above, is from the 2021 Tyler Hynes and Erin Krakow rom-com “It Was Always You,” in which he timed his invitation to dance just-right each time she took a swig of champagne, causing her to bust out laughing. 

In early June, Hallmark provided a montage of funny outtakes to “Entertainment Tonight” of Williams and Alison Sweeney filming their “To Barcelona” movies, including shots of Williams spilling Italian food on herself. 

In 2021, Williams (are you noticing a theme here?) was featured in another adorable blooper reel with her sister, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, to promote their “Sister Swap” movies.

Like anyone who's played their way through the last 30 years (or more) of Hideo Kojima's work, I've come to expect a certain degree of eccentricity from AAA gaming's most distinctive auteur. Be that as it may, Kojima's fetishistic cinephilia made “Death Stranding” — its cast partially composed of famous directors whose photorealistic likenesses are embodied by actors via performance capture — a uniquely strange experience for movie people like me. 

Heartman, a scientist who dies every 21 minutes (only to get shocked back to life by the battery pack on his chest shortly thereafter), is modeled after Nicolas Winding Refn. Deadman, a researcher whose body has been Frankensteined together from borrowed parts, is naturally made to resemble Guillermo del Toro. A character known as “The Film Director,” seen only in hologram, is a perfect scan of Jordan Vogt-Roberts, whose long-gestating “Metal Gear Solid” adaptation will probably never be seen at all. (Casting the “Death Stranding” movie that Michael Sarnoski is making for A24 will either be very easy, or very, very hard.)

It would be an understatement to say that Kojima has doubled down on that particular strangeness in his latest sequel. The “Naked Raiden” sequence from “Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty” might still be unbeatable for sheer conceptual surreality, but nothing in that game took me out quite like the early bit in “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” when the living puppet the protagonist now carries around on his waist — a perfect representation of “In the Fade” director Fatih Akin — helpfully suggests that you throw him up in the air so that he can relay the exact location of some nearby smugglers. What's next, a “Moby Dick”-inspired flashback that swaps out Captain Ahab for “Fury Road” mastermind George Miller? Of course it is. 

 










Moments like these happen every 20 minutes or so throughout this roughly 45-hour adventure (the cast of which swells to include an entire festival's worth of recognizable filmmakers, to say nothing of the beautiful performances by world-class actors like Norman Reedus, Luca Marinelli, and especially Léa Seydoux), and while the uncanniness of watching Refn get resurrected in the middle of a conversation never quite fades away, the distraction only makes it all the more impressive that Kojima is able to craft his characters into people all their own. 

And it's crucial that he can, because the power of “On the Beach” — which builds on the foundation of its predecessor to create one of the most evocative and involving console games I've ever played — depends on your affection for its motley crew of weirdos. And, for that matter, on their affection for each other. 

Where the first “Death Stranding,” a post-apocalyptic epic set in the aftermath of a cataclysmic event that saw the world of the dead bleed into the world of the living, was a story about the absence of human connection, this sequel is equally focused on the hardships of navigating it. And where the previous game's focus on isolation anticipated the COVID pandemic that arrived just a few months after its release (survivors have burrowed themselves inside underground bunkers, leaving the protagonist to fetch them packages as he moves west across the United Cities of America while bringing them all together on the same network), the Australia-set “On the Beach” points forward to a present in which the world is at risk of being undone by the same tools that promised to bring it together. 

 










As is his wont, Kojima asks a simple question in a compelling and hilariously strange fashion: “Should we have connected?” And while I can only pray that the second “Death Stranding” isn't quite as prescient as the first one, there's something all too close about its story of staring extinction in the face and searching for reasons to postpone it. Kojima's sequel may lack the “WTF is a ‘Strand' game?” novelty of the original, but it one-ups the “Death Stranding” experience on every conceivable level while delivering another uncannily timed quest about grieving the end of one world while standing at the precipice of a new one. 

If “On the Beach” does more to refine its franchise than it does to evolve it, that lack of surprise doesn't do anything to diminish the relevance of the Kōbō Abe quote that pops up along the way: “To live is to imagine ourselves in the future, and there we inevitably arrive. Yet our place in said future may not be the one we envision.” At heart, this is a fantasy about the hard work — and the teamwork — of rescuing Tomorrow from the clutches of today, and I can think of no higher praise for a batshit game I beat the same night that America fumbled its way towards World War III that its hyper-convoluted message of hope and togetherness made a lot of sense to me. 

 










If you haven't played the first “Death Stranding,” there's very little chance that it will make any sense to you, and the 17-slide recap that players can access from the main menu of “On the Beach” isn't going to make up the difference. But just to offer some context for the curious: You once play as Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus), the same immortal courier who linked America together with the help of an unborn fetus who allowed him to sense the presence of the dead (and that's arguably the most normal detail of the first game). After extending the Chiral Network across the UCA and facilitating the potential extinction of all humanity in the process, Sam illegally freed his baby friend from its artificial womb and snuck across the Mexican border in search of a place where he might raise the girl in peace. 

Alas, “On the Beach” is only a few hours old before something happens to little Lou. On the one hand, I'm obviously trying to be coy about the details of a story that's best experienced as you play through it. On the other hand, I say “something” because — until near the very end of the game — exactly what happens to Sam's one-year-old toddler is extremely unclear and seldom discussed. All I can tell you is that bad guys show up, our old pal Fragile (Seydoux) isn't able to fight them off, and Lou suddenly reverts back into the “Bridge Baby” that Sam equips on his latest mission. 

 










You see, a warp-like “Plate Gate” has opened between Mexico and Australia, and Sam has been hired by a private company — not the UCA government — to bring the Aussies onto the Chiral Network in the hope that doing so might open up more portals in the ocean of interdimensional tar that has formed between continents. And so, with the help of a rapidly expanding crew that soon grows to include Tarman, Deadman, Heartman, Dollman, Fragile, the President of the Automated Public Assistance Company, a robotic mannequin named Charlie, and a mysterious blonde girl called Tomorrow (Elle Fanning, who emerges from the tar in a chrysalis of silent trauma), Sam heads down under and begins working his way clockwise around the country. 

The circularity of the game's macro design allows for a more organic and palpably interconnected open world than the UCA offered in the original. Not only does that shape allow for a constant sense of accomplishment as you bring Australia back online (in addition to one of the most rewarding moments I've ever had playing a video game, when a climbing rope I'd casually planted at the end of the prologue helped save me from a climactic death slog more than 40 hours allow), but it also reinforces the circular nature of Kojima's storytelling, which this franchise brings to the fore with its focus on the cyclicality of life, death, and extinction. I couldn't spoil certain revelations if I tried, but it's safe to say that “On the Beach” mines a rare beauty from history's penchant for repeating itself — it's no accident that near-silent bad guy Neil Vana (Marinelli) is a dead ringer for Solid Snake, or that the boss fights against his team of ghost soldiers are largely identical to the first game's battles with tortured father figure Clifford Unger (Mads Mikkelsen). 

 










Every hard-won inch of progress in “On the Beach” is haunted by a loss of equal measure, which emphasizes — in a more literal way than most other games possibly could — the extent to which the player's journey is also their ultimate destination (the story's delicate whimper of a non-ending similarly lends itself to that feeling, albeit in less satisfying fashion). To that point, anyone who played “Death Stranding” should know to expect a whole lot of journeying. 

Trekking around the whole of Australia is significantly more fun than it was to walk across the UCA due to quality-of-life issues, delightful new innovations (including a monorail that I was obsessed with rebuilding, and a sleek black coffin you can ride like a rocket-powered surfboard), and a geographically diverse game world that is somehow even more immersive than that of the original. The improved combat system is still a sore point, if only because its elaborate arsenal and frequent invitations toward stealth are wasted on a game where charging at enemies with a shotgun works great 99% of the time, but navigating the map — and rebuilding its infrastructure — is more addictive than ever, and dominates the majority of the player's time. 

I can't tell you how many hours of sleep I lost in order to deliver “just one more package,” the unique thrill of which is deepened by two specific factors above all others. The first is the feeling that you're actually working to create a new world, a feeling again reinforced by the fact that other players can use every road, bridge, and tool you create (and vice versa). I got a little rush of dopamine every time the game informed me that another person had benefited from something I'd done, which is a remarkable sensation for a piece of entertainment to impart at a time of such egocentric selfishness, and a reward that deepens Sam's more transactional relationship with the various survivors he meets along the way (who give him new tools in exchange for the packages he delivers to them). Eventually, I found an equal joy in pouring my precious resources into mines and monorail tracks that I wasn't able to complete myself — I would happily schlep resins and “special alloys” halfway up a mountain just for the satisfaction of making life easier for someone I'd never get to meet. 

 










Which brings me to the second factor that makes the new “Death Stranding” so hard to put down: Its nagging sense of precarity. “On the Beach” is not a hard game in the traditional sense (Sam is literally immortal, and most of the boss fights are a cinch), but it's an extremely arduous one, and the player is never more than a stumble away from losing and/or destroying cargo they may never get back. While the relief of delivering packages intact is palpable enough during the journey's frictionless early stretches, it blooms into a diabolical kind of paranoia whenever Sam is stripped of his shortcuts and forced to hoof 250 kilograms of crap across an enormous mountain in whiteout conditions. To a significantly more satisfying degree than in the previous chapter, “On the Beach” subverts the typical stakes of a video game; “dying” is irrelevant, but what you're living for is always top of mind.

That inescapable sense of responsibility, along with the endorphin rush of forging relationships with strangers, allows for a singularly beautiful harmony between form and content, which is rare for a medium in which even the most heroic characters are often required to murder thousands of people (Sam only uses non-lethal ammo, as killing someone would risk a catastrophic “Voidout”). The same could be said of the original “Death Stranding,” which likewise illustrated that a “stick” could prod people into action while a “rope” could be fashioned into a noose. “On the Beach” strikes a more effective chord for its focus on the hard work of making connections in a world where people have the technology to be perfectly isolated. 

 










Without putting too fine a point on things (a rather uncharacteristic show of restraint), Kojima envisions a ruined future where colonization-minded corporations are more powerful than governments, AI is serving its own ends, and humanity's determination to forestall its own doom is imperilling the basic purpose and possibility of its survival. Like many of Kojima's stories, “On the Beach” vamps and vamps until it buries players under an avalanche of exposition during its final chapters, but the hours you spend becoming endeared to its characters — an eternally pregnant woman whose womb is frozen in time, an OBGYN who can phase her hands through matter, and, of course, a porter who's grieving the loss of the only tomorrow he ever believed in — lend backbreaking weight to Kojima's poptimistic belief that humanity has the potential to emerge stronger from its latest brush with extinction. 

So does the time you spend trudging around this spectacular game world, every detail of which betrays the human touch of its design. I awed at the raw spectacle of Kojima's Australia on a regular basis, but found myself even more impressed by the ambient beauty that he and his collaborators have suffused into every moment. Fellow porters huffing their way up a hillside; the stars twinkling above the desert sand; the layered waves of Caroline Polachek's staggeringly beautiful title song cresting over the horizon at just the right moment. (The unparalleled soundscape might be the game's most purely cinematic virtue, even more so than its cast of auteurs and fantastically well-staged cut-scenes.) Some might continue to scoff at a franchise that asks you to play as an Amazon deliveryman, but I found greater — and richer — satisfaction in this glorified walking simulator than I have in just about any other open-world video game I've ever played. 

 










“On the Beach” might argue that we can never truly escape extinction, but it makes an even more compelling case that we endure through the bridges we create between the past and the future. Tomorrow, this story insists, is never exactly what you imagined it to be. And by the time players reach the insane final battle of Kojima's latest plea, the weirdest thing about this mega-bizarre masterpiece is how convincingly it finds a silver lining in the prospect of our self-annihilation. 

“Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” will be released for the PlayStation 5 on Thursday, June 26.

EXCLUSIVE: Julie Benz (Dexter), Busy Philipps (Mean Girls), Ron Perlman (Hellboy) and Jim Rash (The Way Way Back) are to star in horror-comedy Horrified.


	The film will see a down-on-her-luck scream queen (Benz) return to the horror convention circuit for fast cash, only to find the pig-masked killer from her old franchise weaponizing her cult legacy against her friends and fans, forcing her to confront past demons and fight for survival in a blood-soaked slasher showdown.


	The project, which is due to shoot this summer, marks the feature debut of writer-director Michael Zara, a writer on three seasons of TNT drama Major Crimes.

'A Court of Thorns and Roses' author Maas will, with IMG Licensing, extend her well-loved characters beyond the pages across apparel, beauty, lifestyle, food, games and immersive fan experiences.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Sarah J. Maas, best-selling author known for her blockbuster literary franchises including A Court of Thorns and Roses, has signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with IMG Licensing.


The Hollywood Reporter can reveal that, under the multiyear deal, IMG Licensing will develop and manage a robust licensing program spanning Maas's entire fictional universe with the aim of creating new touchpoints for her fervid fan base.




	With over 70 million English copies sold worldwide and translations in 38 languages, Maas is one of the most influential authors of her generation with a knack for the “romantasy” genre. Hit books of hers also include the Throne of Glass and Crescent City series.

	Through the new partnership, Maas and IMG Licensing will extend well-loved characters and stories beyond the pages and into apparel, beauty, lifestyle, home décor, wine and spirits, food and beverage, toys and games, collectibles, cosplay, and immersive fan experiences, THR understands.


	“Representing Sarah J. Maas and her extraordinary literary worlds is an incredible honor,” said Samantha Chang, vice president at IMG Licensing. “Together, Sarah and her fans have created a cultural phenomenon that has redefined fantasy fiction.”


	She continued: “We're excited to launch a dynamic and carefully curated licensing program that offers fans meaningful new ways to celebrate the characters and stories they love.”


	Hulu's TV adaptation of ACOTAR, with Ron Moore attached, was officially scrapped earlier this year, but not to fear — the rights have been returned to Maas and she'll be shopping them around to different studios.

Hot on the heels of a series of pushes to increase film and television production in Los Angeles, the California Film Commission has announced 48 new productions that will film in the state thanks of its tax credit program — among them 43 independent features and projects from the likes of Ang Lee and Issa Rae. The announcement was the ninth such of the 2024-25 fiscal year.

“California didn't earn its role as the heart of the entertainment world by accident — it was built over generations by skilled workers and creative talent pushing boundaries,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said. “Today's awards help ensure this legacy continues, keeping cameras rolling here at home, supporting thousands of crew members behind the scenes and boosting local economies that depend on a strong film and television industry.”

The commission said that the projects will collectively generate $664 million in economic activity for the Golden State and employ roughly 6,500 workers, as well as 32,000 background performers. Those cast and crew members will take home a collective $302 million in wages. These films and television series fall under the current version of the tax credit program, which is capped at $330 million annually. Industry professionals are currently awaiting final word on whether or not the state's next budget will include the full proposed expansion to the program, which more than doubles that cap to $750 million.
 










Los Angeles County will benefit most from the awards, with over half of the productions to be shot in the area, which the commission says will help “sustain the birthplace of the iconic industry” and support “the community as it recovers from recent wildfires.” Also included in the tax credits are productions that will utilize the Bay Area (“High Priestess of Souls”), Bakersfield (“Counting by 7s”), El Dorado (“Gold Mountain”), Ventura County (“Things We Cannot Touch”), San Bernardino (“Superbloom”), and Half Moon Bay (“Sponsor”), among other locations.

“This industry is core to California's creative economy and keeping production here at home is more important than ever,” commission director Colleen Bell said. “This round of tax credits shows our commitment to supporting both indie and studio productions while spreading the economic benefits of filming across the state.”

Among the major studio projects was producer Issa Rae's “One of Them Days” sequel, which is anticipated to spend around $39 million in qualified expenditures. TriStar Pictures president Nicole Brown said that “Los Angeles was an essential backdrop” to this year's hit “One of Them Days,” which starred SZA and Keke Palmer.

“We are thrilled that Dreux and Alyssa will embark on another authentic escapade through the city's streets in the sequel through the support of California's Film and Television Tax Credit,” Brown said.

 










The next application window for film productions looking to qualify will be July 7-9 and for television productions August 25-27. For information, visit the California Film Commission website.

	It's just before 9 a.m., and the girls of Katseye are already dressed and ready for rehearsals ahead of the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards. They sometimes let out a little yawn while answering questions, but Sophia, Manon, Lara, Yoonchae, Megan, and Daniela are hyped for the week ahead as they gear up to drop their sophomore EP, Beautiful Chaos, on Friday.


	“It's us stepping into our maturity,” says Lara. “I feel like this era, we have been a lot more authentically ourselves. I don't have to put on a facade of any kind when talking to anyone anymore. I think that's a beautiful thing, and you can see that more within the album. You see more of our fire.”


	It's undeniable: Katseye is going through their biggest moment yet. Formed in November 2023, the Geffen/Hybe artists have quickly risen as the present and future of the pop girl group. The six members were handpicked after competing on the Netflix reality show Pop Star Academy: Katseye, making it to the top out of 20 finalists, chosen from nearly 120,000 hopefuls wanting to be part of a new K-pop-styled band. The Netflix series followed the top 20 finalists as they took on challenges sharpening their dance skills, vocal abilities, and star quality.  Their rise as a six-piece has been fast, and they've already built a massive following of EYEKONS who follow their every move. On their first EP, SIS (Soft Is Strong), they introduced their chemistry and delivered a hit, “Touch,” which became a mainstay on TikTok, thanks to its infectious chorus and fun-to-learn dance routine. With Beautiful Chaos, the group proves that their strong friendship and shining individuality is here to stay.

	











	“We can't fake this,” admits Sophia. “We all have that shared goal of Katseye's success and we really nurtured our friendship a lot. We got really lucky.”

	











	“We really, really, really spent so much time together and put in a lot of effort to develop our relationship with each other,” adds Lara. “This isn't something you could manufacture or develop. It's a genuine friendship with a deep bond.”

	Members of past girl groups, including Little Mix and Fifth Harmony, have frequently said that what made being in a group so difficult was having to hold in their individuality for their brand as a collective. The opposite rings true in Katseye, where each of the women's individuality and cultures are celebrated — it's part of the “global girl group” identity Hybe and Geffen set out to build when they started the search for the group.


	Lara, for example, is often photographed in a bindi or wearing attire celebrating her South Asian heritage, while Daniela, who's of Cuban descent, sings the bridge to their latest single “Gabriela” in Spanish. “We really are pushed to shine individually with our strengths,” says Sophia, who's Filipina. “We're Katseye members first, but we also shine on our own.”


Beautiful Chaos shows off the diversity in their styles and vocal versatility. There's pop, R&B, a ballad, and “Gnarly,” the polarizing campy single that kicked off a dance trend and quickly earned the group their second big hit after 2024's “Touch.” Manon says making their second EP felt “so authentic to who we are right now” in both their lyricism and the manifestation of their artistry, and it's also a “very transitional” EP for the group, as Sophia explains it.


	“We've paid a lot more attention to detail,” says Manon. “It's been a really fun experience and it feels authentic to us.”


	The five-track EP closes with what they all agree is their favorite song, “M.I.A.” It's a stadium-ready anthem, more in line with girl groups like Blackpink, the kind of track made to be sung back by a crowd. “We screamed when we heard it,” says Daniela.

	“This is exactly our taste,” adds Lara. “I think the production is fire and we really showed our individuality.”


	“Game Boy,” the girls say, is like a sequel to “Touch, and made for the fans who enjoyed that era. “It's a feel-good song and like an elevated ‘Touch,'” says Megan. “I'm excited for ‘Game Boy' because it's going to be the favorite of the Eyekons who really like our ‘Touch' era,” adds Yoonchae.


	Manon steps up to talk about their single “Mean Girls,” a slower ballad that offers love to the “dream girls, free girls,” and “even the mean girls.” On it, the girls sing: “This is why I hate the internet, you're not gonna kill my happiness.”

	











	During Dream Academy, Manon faced an unfair level of backlash from people who questioned her place in the group. Now, she's putting any narratives to rest. “A lot of us got called mean girls after the documentary dropped and all these narratives started running, so it's kind of an homage to that,” Manon says. “It's giving killing them with kindness. This song is closing a chapter.”


	“Mean Girls” also ends with the girls declaring, “God bless the T girls, and all the in-between girls.” Since their formation, Katseye has been open about their closeness to queerness — two of the members are bi — and just how much the LGBTQ community has shaped both their artistry and their fandom. But the community has also played a closer role: For a recent performance, trans designer Gigi Goode crafted custom looks for the group, and they even posted a video dancing with Vivian Wilson, Elon Musk's estranged trans daughter. (It might've been a tongue-in-cheek nod to their Tesla reference on “Gnarly.”)


	“We work a lot with the trans community all the time, whether it's fashion or music,” says Lara. “We are constantly around trans women, and I think we have so much love and respect for them. We wanted to shout them out.”


	For Beautiful Chaos, the group's studio process started with the girls being played songs and offered pre-selected verses and parts to try out. Manon says having a team guiding the creative process is helpful, but once they're in the booth, they'll “try each other's parts,” and whatever sounds best is what makes the cut. They also have a group therapist who allows them a “safe space” to work through any issues that could come up with being young adults navigating stardom together in a group.

	What rings true — and is palpable even over a Zoom call early in the A.M. — is that the women have built a sisterhood that translates through their music and online interactions. The girls finish each other's sentences and nod in agreement with each other's answers to questions, and they're on the same page when it comes to what they want Katseye to be.


	“I don't know if the ‘Oh, we're coworkers, so we can operate like that,' would really work for us,” says Lara. “I feel like the friendship, the true bond that we have is what makes this truly so fun, even if we have a bad day or something crazy happens.”

Despite the fact that it was a U.K. court that ruled Amber Heard's allegations against Johnny Depp were “substantially true,” it is also a U.K. outlet offering Depp the most in-depth interview he's given since those legal issues began. The Sunday Times‘ Jonathan Dean describes Depp as “excellent company” who speaks in an “eventually coherent ramble,” a conversation which touches on his U.S. trial, his childhood, his marriages, and the people who turned their backs on him amid his personal crisis. “Better go woke!” he hisses about his Hollywood acquaintances who committed to “playing it safe.”

Depp says the reason he wanted to go to trial (and was willing to “semi-eviscerate” himself) was because “Everyone was saying, ‘It'll go away!' But I can't trust that. What will go away? The fiction pawned around the [fucking] globe? No it won't. If I don't try to represent the truth it will be like I've actually committed the acts I am accused of. And my kids will have to live with it. Their kids. Kids that I've met in hospitals. So the night before the trial in Virginia I didn't feel nervous. If you don't have to memorise lines, if you're just speaking the truth? Roll the dice.”

Depp goes on to suggest his troubled relationship with Heard was a reflection of the troubled relationship between his own parents, which he implies was violent. However, he says “it would be dumb for me to carry any bitterness” towards his ex-wife: “Eternal hatred? You want to put curses on someone? No,” he says. (In 2013, Depp texted Paul Bettany saying he wanted to “burn Amber,” adding, “Let's drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she's dead.” He later said these were jokes inspired by Monty Python.) “I know who I am, what that was and, look, it was a learning experience,” Depp goes on to say, insisting he has “no regrets about anything.”

No bitterness, but Depp does still sound upset that his agent of 30 years testified in court that certain productions were reluctant to hire Johnny Depp because of his chronic lateness. Depp doesn't exactly refute his reputation for being “difficult” (his alleged tendency to hold up production on Pirates Of The Caribbean 5 was well-documented), but he does complain about his own stalwart loyalty not being reciprocated. “That's death by confetti, these fake [motherfuckers] who lie to you, celebrate you, say all sorts of horror behind your back, yet keep the money—that confetti machine going—because what do they want? Dough,” he says. 

“I'll tell you what hurts. There are people, and I'm thinking of three, who did me dirty. Those people were at my kids' parties. Throwing them in the air. And, look, I understand people who could not stand up [for me], because the most frightening thing to them was making the right choice. I was pre-MeToo. I was like a crash test dummy for MeToo. It was before Harvey Weinstein,” Depp continues. “And I sponged it, took it all in. And so I wanted from the hundreds of people I've met in that industry to see who was playing it safe.” Given the amount of people who have supported him—the likes of Al Pacino, Winona Ryder, Alice Cooper, Tim Burton, and more— it seems pretty safe to be on Depp's side, even in the wake of allegations that were proven “substantially true” in one court of law.

Nearly three years after beloved “American Idol” alum Willie Spence — runner-up to season 19 winner Chayce Beckham — tragically died in a car accident, his family and hometown have made sure his legacy will live on. 

On June 18, 2025, which would have been the late R&B singer's 26th birthday, the mayor of Riviera Beach, Florida, officially proclaimed the date to forevermore be Willie Spence Day at a special ceremony attended by Spence's parents, Sharon and Willie Spence Sr., according to CBS12 News. In tandem with the commemorative day, they announced the official launch of the Willie Spence Champions Foundation.

On June 18, Spence's parents were on hand at a City Council meeting — dressed in special shirts commemorating their son — as Mayor Douglas Lawson signed the proclamation making June 18 Willie Spence Day. In addition, a special tree planting ceremony was held in Spence's honor at a local park. 

The following day, combined with events celebrating Juneteenth, his parents hosted and attended Juneteenth events in Riviera Beach that specifically celebrated freedom through creativity in their son's honor, WPBF reported, including youth performances and creative workshops. In 2026, they plan to add a 5k to the mix. 

Aftewards, his mom Sharon emotionally told the station, “It was a great day. It was a moving day. It was an inspiring day. Such a wonderful day.” 

“He used to say to me, ‘Mom, I want people to be able to hear my voice all over the world,” Sharon said, tearing up. “All over the world, he said. And I do believe they do hear his voice.”

During Spence's 2021 audition, he told judge Katy Perry his primary goal was, “I just want my voice to reach the world and just share my gift.”

Spence died on the afternoon of October 11, 2022, according to NBC News, in Marion County in East Tennessee. The Tennessee Highway Patrol stated that Spence's 2019 Jeep Cherokee “left the roadway” and collided with the back of a tractor trailer that was parked on the shoulder of the interstate. Both he and the driver of the truck were wearing their seatbelts, and the truck driver was not injured. 

A few hours before his tragic death, Spence posted an Instagram video of himself in a car while in Nashville, belting out the worship song “You Are My Hiding Place.” 

In the caption, Spence simply wrote, “Lord you are my hiding place” and added two emojis — a microphone and the eyes-welling-with-tears face.

Tickets for Dolly's Vegas concerts go on sale this Wednesday, June 25.

	Ashley Iasimone



Dolly Parton is going to Las Vegas. On Monday (June 23) the country icon announced a limited engagement concert residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, set for six nights in December.


	Parton will perform on Dec. 4, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13. She'll be “weaving together seven decades of classic hits and fan favorites including ‘9 to 5,' ‘Jolene,' ‘I Will Always Love You' and ‘Coat of Many Colors,'” says a press release from her representatives.


	“To say I'm excited would be an understatement,” Parton herself said in a statement released Monday morning. “I haven't worked Vegas in years and I've always loved singing there. I'm looking so forward to the shows in The Colosseum at Caesars and I hope you are as well. See you there!”

	Tickets for Dolly: Live in Las Vegas are scheduled to go on sale via Ticketmaster on Wednesday, June 25, at 10 a.m. PT.


	Ticket options will include a range of VIP packages, with extras like a personal photo opportunity with Parton, an onstage tour, access to the singer's Rhinestone Lounge, a deluxe gift set and more.

	











	All shows will begin at 8 p.m.


	The concert dates, marking Parton's first extended run in Las Vegas since a short engagement in the early '90s — at the then-new, but now-closed, Mirage Hotel, where she performed alongside Kenny Rogers — fall during the week of the National Finals Rodeo in Vegas.


	Parton's most recent full-length album, Rockstar, was released in 2023, earning the No. 1 spot on the Top Country Albums chart and reaching No. 3 on the all-genre Billboard 200. 


	In March 2025, she released a heartfelt song in tribute to her late husband, Carl Dean (“If You Hadn't Been There“).


	Since 2024, Parton has featured on a number of projects for fellow artists, from Beyoncé (“Tyrant” and the interlude “Dolly P“) and Post Malone (“Have a Heart“) to Sabrina Carpenter (a remix of “Please Please Please“) and Mötley Crüe (a reimagined “Home Sweet Home“).

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is like a symphony — a gorgeous classical concerto where an electric guitar occasionally cuts in to shred an off-putting, yet surprisingly sick riff. As a whole, it's weird and uneven, but there's something undeniably compelling about how those disparate parts fit together.


	If there's one thing Death Stranding 2 (out June 26) isn't lacking, it's ambition. This is one of creator Hideo Kojima's (Metal Gear Solid) biggest and boldest games yet — unrelentingly building on the vision and style of its predecessor. In turn, Death Stranding 2 is a game about a lot of things — the way we perceive death and grief, how routine shapes our lives, a scathing indictment of American imperialism, a post-Covid reflection on isolation, and a warning about the dangers of AI and technology reliance. Sure, that's a lot to digest, but Kojima manages to somehow string together each discordant note into something unlike anything else in gaming (or any medium for that matter).

	











Death Stranding 2 is beautiful and messy all at once; a story that's as befuddling as it is enthralling, and a gameplay experience that's equally inventive and mind-numbingly routine at times. Those who didn't like the first Death Stranding (2019) definitely won't be converted here, but everyone else is in for one hell of a ride. It's a game of dichotomies, never content to be just one thing at any given time, and is one of the best of the year — if not the generation. 

	











Death Stranding 2 takes place roughly 11 months after the first game, and while there's a lengthy intro video to take newcomers through the preceding story, it's highly recommended to have played through at least a majority of the first game. 


	The story is set in a far future where a cataclysmic event (known as the Death Stranding) has wiped out much of humanity, leaving the survivors scattered and solitary. Paranormal creatures called beached things (BTs) infest the world, and whenever they consume a dead human, it causes what's called a Voidout — a massive atomic-level explosion. This has made post-apocalyptic delivery men called Porters, like protagonist Sam Bridges (played by Norman Reedus), essential as they can traverse the dangerous world to deliver goods, medicine, and the like.

	Taking place 11 months after the events of the original game, Sam and his daughter Lou have fled to Mexico to try to live a life of solitude and flee the commanding grip of the United Colonies of America (UCA). In the first Death Stranding, Sam reconnected the UCA through a sort of metaphysical internet called The Chiral Network. Now, as he tries to live his happy life in Mexico, Sam's life is hit with tragedy, and the UCA, once again, wants his help to spread the Chiral Network to Mexico and Australia — reuniting more of the world. 


	As it turns out, reuniting America has left the rest of the world more unstable than ever (it shouldn't be lost on anyone that the theme of returning America to “greatness” has had dire consequences for everywhere else). 


	Before going into more specifics on story and theme, it's important to note the gameplay formula and structure of Death Stranding 2 — as that jarring experience is so integrally tied to how players will experience the narrative. Truthfully, shifting back and forth between jarring tonal shifts feels true to what it's actually like to play it.


Death Stranding 2 is, at its core, a delivery simulator. As Sam reconnects Mexico and Australia, he has to make deliveries to different facilities and connect them to the network. Players start out making these deliveries on foot — inspired by the real-life traditional Japanese porters known as Bokka. But you progressively unlock more options for travel and delivery: vehicles, zip lines, catapults, monorails, teleporters, and more. Mexico serves as essentially a tutorial area to introduce the basics, before moving to Australia for the rest of the game, creating a massive streamlined delivery network. Of course, the other catch is the game's Strand system, which lets you see and use the items and objects of other players in your world, and vice versa.

	What's remarkable about Death Stranding 2, on a gameplay level, is that it hasn't really deviated from the vision of the first game — rather enhancing and refining it. The original Death Stranding's slow, methodical delivery experience wasn't for everyone, and it made the game better. But it's easy to see how that style of game is off-putting for some players; it's a slow burn in every regard. 


	While Death Stranding 2 does introduce some drastic new action elements, it's still that plodding delivery simulator at its heart, and it's honestly charming to see a sequel that refuses to make concessions to be more approachable. That's not to say, however, that Death Stranding 2 isn't better than the first game — it is, in pretty much every conceivable way.


	By and large, the sequel feels like the full realization of what Kojima Productions wanted to do with its delivery system. There's a layer of simulation to the entire game that's remarkably compelling, giving players  vastly more dynamic options for how to travel the world and complete orders. You can unearth mines to harvest resources and build a massive monorail network that allows for seamless  travel across the continent — but that's a huge time investment. Or you can simply hop on your trusty trike and travel Australia mile by mile. Fast travel has also been made drastically easier with the help of Transponders that teleport Sam, as well as his ship the DHV Magellan — which serves as a home base. 


	Those simulation elements also rear their head in environmental hazards. A portal known as a Plate Gate has appeared on both continents, causing earthquakes and shockwaves that can easily knock Sam over, or his vehicle off a cliff if players aren't careful. Meandering through the snowy mountains, you might also find yourself confronted by a sudden avalanche, fleeing for life from the thundering wall of snow. 


	The world itself also feels more vibrant and alive. Different variations of BTs stalk the wilderness, requiring adaptability to overcome. Mercenaries, bandits, and a new breed of enemy called Ghost Mechs also dot the landscape, necessitating weaponry to deal with. There are more opportunities for combat, and in turn, the shooting and weapons feel like they've been given more thoughtful implementation and tightened controls. There are also some gratuitously fun additions to combat, like a grenade that lets you capture big BTs like Pokémon to be summoned  in battle, triggering a delightful 1970s Godzilla-like soundtrack. Death Stranding 2 likes to have fun with its weird and wonderful weapons. 

	











	Simultaneously, the game affords far more ways to customize the player's experiences. Completing deliveries will rank up the various facilities you've connected, granting more bandwidth to build objects in the world and unlock new weapons or items, as well as points for the new APAS Enhancements system. This is essentially a perk tree for fine-tuning aspects of the game, like making canteens easier to fill in rivers or improving a gun's firing rate. It's an intuitive system that allows for a lot of mix and match customization, and a more tangible sense of reward for grinding out every location's levels. 


	All that being said, the controls can still feel frustratingly obstinate at times, and get in the way of the overall experience. Swapping weapons isn't as intuitive as it should be in a shooter, requiring players to open menus to sift through, then drop the guns when they're empty. There's a new dodge, but it can only be executed while aiming with a gun. Little frustrations like that are still present, and that's largely because the game is still primarily focused on the walking simulator, delivery experience. 


	However, the one aspect of Death Stranding 2 that does feel like a drastic leap forward are the bosses. These are some of the best boss battles in any modern video game — pitting you against fantastical creatures or gritty engagements that flip the rules of the game on its head. One has Sam fighting in an underwater world, with moon-like gravity, where you can make giant leaps. Another has you fighting through a crumbling Inception-like monorail system, where enemy soldiers leap between the floor and ceiling. There are so many big set-piece battles that are genuinely jaw-dropping, and the last four hours of the game contain some of the most fever dream-induced moments ever found in a video game, in the best way possible. 


	But that's what makes Death Stranding 2 so fascinating, how these big action movie moments are propped up against the majority of the game, which is largely about a meditative delivery gig. That juxtaposition feels even more important and intentional than in the first game, tying into the game's theme of routine, and how humans can normalize even the most oppressive of circumstances by simply sticking to the norm. 

	











Death Stranding 2's more refined gameplay experience stands in contrast to a story that's extremely gutsy, topical, and sometimes nauseatingly self-referential. Kojima is often referencing his past work in Death Stranding 2, and it does tread a fine line between pleasant and pompous. 


	It's genuinely difficult to go into more specifics of the story as there are some major, shocking twists early on that inform the rest of Sam's journey. This is, by far, the darkest story that Kojima has ever created — not shying away from themes of suicide, depression, grief, and more. Leading up to the release of Death Stranding 2, Kojima was quite open about how the Covid-19 pandemic influenced his interpretation of the first game's themes, and that's abundantly clear to see here. 


	There's a strong message of connection and the importance of traveling to meeting people in person. There's also a much larger emphasis on violence in this sequel, on how average people perceive it and use it, and how governments harness violence to get what they want. This manifests through both the narrative, combat, and environmental storytelling.


	Most of the cast from the first game plays a major role in Death Stranding 2, including the deliciously evil Higgs (Troy Baker), who morphs into a drastically better villain this time around. But there's also a new cast of characters introduced into the mix, all of whom have a vital role to play and a story to uncover. Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna)  is a mysterious girl who causes Timefall Rain whenever she steps outside, which has made society shun her — despite the healing secret she hides. Dollman (the likeness of Fatih Akin; voiced by Jonathan Roumie) is a particular highlight as Sam's new sidekick — a man with a tragic past whose soul now resides in a creepy little ventriloquist mannequin. 


	Remarkably, not a single major character is forgotten by Death Stranding 2's story; everyone feels like a vital piece in the tapestry of the narrative. And it's through their stories that we see most of the game's themes evoked — how their lives have been defined by America's obsession with gaining power, and how death defines the way they live. Sam's character arc, in particular, is remarkably moving in Death Stranding 2; it's a harrowing story of family, love, and sacrifice that goes to some genuinely unexpected places. 

	











	The fact that the story works at all despite its bizarre tonal shifts and erratic pacing is a testament to how strong the game's themes and characterization truly are. Big action pieces are bookended by hours of monotony. Thoughtfully human moments are filtered through surrealist imagery and ventriloquist dolls. But it's that befuddling mixture that gives the game so much of its personality. 


Death Stranding 2, even more than the first game, feels like something people will be talking about for the next decade to come. We'll be digging into its themes and messages for years, and there will undoubtedly be no shortage of debate on how brilliant, or terrible, it all is. But that's exactly why this game feels so important right now — in an ocean of sameness and trends to chase, it's undeniably its own thing. Death Stranding 2 isn't a sequel that course corrects; it doubles down and takes even bolder leaps in the opposite direction. And in an industry that's so obsessed with safe franchises, it feels refreshing to see something so large-scale that's so ballsy. 


	The caveat to that, of course, is that no one but Hideo Kojima would be given the time and money to make something like this — Death Stranding 2 is like a bizarre Frankenstein monster built as a monument to the game industry idolization of its “auteurs.” It's a game molded by the unending ambition of its creators, with little guard rails put up in the process. At times abrasive, unnerving, and wholly uncompromising, Death Stranding 2 is as emotionally exhausting as it is obtuse. But that's an undeniable piece of what makes the game so compelling, how it builds its themes to be utilized by the player's interpretations. This story and experience might mean something completely different to every player.

Jaws and Back to the Future are celebrating their 50th and 40th anniversaries, respectively, and to mark the occasion, Mattel Creations is unveiling a nostalgic Hot Wheels set inspired by the classic Universal Studios blockbusters.


	The collectibles mark Mattel's return to San Diego Comic-Con and will be available at the convention, which starts on July 24. The collection will also be available to buy online starting on the first day of the convention, exclusively at Mattel Creations' website.


	It shouldn't come as much of a surprise as to which vehicles Mattel picked for Back to the Future and Jaws, but the attention to detail makes them stand out. The Back to the Future set includes a die-cast DeLorean, as well as Doc Brown's white van, which the DeLorean rolls into. The set comes in a diorama display box.




	As for the Jaws set, it naturally includes the Orca boat and a shark (aka, Bruce) from the iconic “You're gonna need a bigger boat” scene. Like the Back to the Future set, the toys are die-cast. The set comes in a display box featuring throwback 1970s lettering, with Bruce nipping at the boat's stern. The Mattel and Universal Studios Nostalgic Film Favorites Hot Wheels collection will be available starting on July 24, with both sets retailing for $32.




	Universal has made a big push to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jaws, launching collectible toys, t-shirts, and Blu-ray discs. You can check out some of the other Jaws anniversary merch below.

With his experience with such clients as Malala Yousafzai and Michaela Coel, working across fields and in politics, he plans to "build a stronger and more connected UTA across London, Europe and beyond."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Global talent, entertainment, sports and advisory company United Talent Agency (UTA) has appointed partner Darnell Strom as its head of UTA's U.K. office in London. The executive has experience in politics, including past work with Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. At UTA, he has been a key player for its global strategy and has worked across business areas, representing such clients as Malala Yousafzai, Michaela Coel, Grace Wales Bonner, Jonathan Anderson, i-D Magazine, BBC/HBO hit Industry creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay, Jon Batiste, Karlie Kloss, Jose Andres, Whitney Wolfe Herd, and Alexis Ohanian.

	Moving from L.A. to London, “Strom will oversee UTA's extensive U.K. operation and continued expansion into key markets across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa,” the company said. The newly created role “underscores UTA's ambition to evolve London into a major international hub for the company,” following its decision to open a new London office in 2023 after the acquisition of talent and literary powerhouse Curtis Brown, the ROOF Football Agency, and consultancy firm MediaLink.




	“Strom brings both extensive experience of working at UTA, alongside deep cross-disciplinary knowledge and a global network of client relationships spanning entertainment, fashion/luxury, sports, and media,” the firm said. “His leadership will focus on strengthening integration and connectivity across UTA's European operations, unlocking new business opportunities, and driving growth throughout the region.”


	Said UTA CEO David Kramer: “This marks an exciting new chapter for UTA. Darnell has long been a connector across departments, industries, and geographies. His deep relationships and creative vision make him uniquely suited to lead this next phase of our international expansion.”

	











	Strom said London is “one of the most dynamic and creative markets in the world, and UTA has only scratched the surface of what's possible here.” He added: “I'm honored to lead our next phase of growth working with the incredible team we have in London, to build a stronger and more connected UTA across London, Europe and beyond.”


	Strom joined UTA in 2019 and previously served as head of culture & commerce. In his new role, he will work closely with UTA's London teams across the firm's music, creators, brand marketing, comedy, production arts, and advisory services units. This will include close collaboration with Curtis Brown Group and ROOF Football Agency.


	Strom began his career in politics, non-profit work, and social entrepreneurship. He served as director of the chair's office at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was then named the Florida Director of Operations for John Kerry's presidential campaign. In 2005, Strom served as deputy director of scheduling to former President Bill Clinton and was subsequently tasked with creating a program, the Clinton Foundation Millennium Network, which reflected Clinton's vision of engaging the next generation of leaders. Later, he served on President Barack Obama's White House Entertainment Council.

Meadows' 'Chork,' releasing in U.K. theaters in 2026, follows 15-year-old Kit and 11-year-old Ani as they leave their foster home and trek across the English coastline in hopes of a brighter future.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	After more than a decade-long hiatus from the big screen, Shane Meadows is making a return to cinema with a new film, Chork.


	Penned by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne and set along the east coast of England, Chork follows 15-year-old Kit and 11-year-old Ani as they leave their foster home and trek across the coastline in hopes of a brighter future. With the police in pursuit and a national search underway, Kit must use all her determination and wits to protect Ani and fulfil their mission.




	Cast by Meadows' frequent collaborator, Shaheen Baig (Adolescence, Hot Milk), the two have secured the film's lead cast with open casting calls taking place earlier in the year throughout the U.K.

	“To be returning to film after 17 years, writing alongside ‘megadude' Jack Thorne again, and working with so many gifted collaborators, has been an absolute privilege,” said Meadows. “Our story follows two beyond bright, funny as heck and mischievously ingenious young people on a ‘runaway' road trip the length of this glorious isle.”


	“Safe to say,”  he continued, “I'm beyond excited about what we've captured on their journey. I'm also hugely grateful to our partners at BBC Film, BFI, Screen Yorkshire, Hoopsa Films and Altitude for their undying trust and support throughout.”


	Meadows gained critical acclaim with features TwentyFourSeven, Dead Man's Shoes, A Room for Romeo Brass and Somers Town. His television credits include This Is England, which premiered in Toronto in 2006, The Virtues starring Stephen Graham and The Gallows Pole.

	











Chork is produced by Ben Pugh and Cathy King for 42, Lauren Dark and Amy Jackson for Unified, Meadows' Big Arty and Thorne's One Shoe Films, both of whom will also executive produce.


	The film is financed by BBC Film, BFI (awarding National Lottery funding), Screen Yorkshire (via the Yorkshire Content Fund) and Hoopsa Films.


	Executive producers are Eva Yates and Kristin Irving for BBC Film, Louise Ortega for the BFI, Caroline Cooper Charles for Screen Yorkshire, Sonny Gill and Tim Macready for Hoopsa Films, and Ali Jazayeri and Keith Kehoe for Three Picture Capital alongside Laura Jackson and Joshua Horsfield. The film was developed with BBC Film.


	Altitude will release Chork in U.K. and Irish cinemas in 2026 and will manage international sales.


	Yates, director of BBC Film, added: “The films of Shane Meadows are at the heart of contemporary British independent cinema and we are hugely excited to support his return, with a cast of exceptional new actors, his brilliant writing collaborator Jack Thorne, and an anarchic story of love, redemption and the untapped and profound potential of youth.”

Margaret Cho described her strained relationship with Ellen DeGeneres during an appearance on a new episode of The Kelly Mantle Show. The comedian said DeGeneres always treated her like a stranger when she came on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, despite the fact that they had been around each other for years. 


	“Ellen was really weird and not nice to me for most of my career,” Cho said on the show. “I opened for her in the 1980s, when she was a headliner in comedy clubs. Later, when I would do her talk show in the 2000s, she would act like we just met.” 


	She added, “And I'm like, ‘Bitch, what?' That's weird. We go way back. It's so creepy and weird.”


	Cho recalled a specific incident that stuck out to her as especially odd. David Bowie appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the day after one of his concerts, at which Cho dressed up in an elaborate “Chinese emperor outfit.” Bowie complimented the costume to DeGeneres, but the remark was edited out of the final broadcast. 

	











	“The producer, who's a really good friend of mine, had to call me and tell me, ‘I can't believe she did this, but she cut it out of the show,'” Cho explained. “‘But you need to know that he was going on and on about your outfit. God said your name. He loves you.'” She admitted she wasn't sure if it was actually a vindictive move, but added, “Still, I'm going to take it personally.”

	DeGeneres' image took a hit in 2020 following a series of reports by BuzzFeed News in which employees at her show alleged racism, sexual misconduct, and intimidation at the hands of executive producers. Three producers were fired because of it, and DeGeneres issued an on-air apology. In 2022, singer Greyson Chance, whom DeGeneres signed to her label, told Rolling Stone he had “never met someone more manipulative, more self-centered, and more blatantly opportunistic.” The Ellen DeGeneres Show ultimately ended in 2022 after 19 seasons. 

	











	The host has since addressed the controversy on tour and in a stand-up special, Ellen DeGeneres: For Your Approval, which aired on Netflix. “The Be Kind Girl wasn't kind — that was the headline,” DeGeneres said in the special. “Here's the problem, I'm a comedian who got a talk show, and I ended the show every day by saying, ‘Be kind to one another.' Had I ended my show by saying, ‘Go fuck yourselves,' people would've been pleasantly surprised to find out I'm kind.”

	“Please give it up for my beautiful cast of Sunset Blvd,” Scherzinger told the crowd in a video shared by BCEFA on Instagram. “Happy Pride, baby!”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The cast recording, Sunset Blvd: The Album, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Cast Albums chart dated Nov. 9. The album was recorded live at the Savoy Theatre in London and released Oct. 25 via The Really Useful Group/The Other Songs.


	Scherzinger, who scored four top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 as a member of The Pussycat Dolls, won her first Tony Award for best actress in a musical for her performance in Sunset Blvd. The role previously earned Glenn Close a win in the same category for the original Broadway production in 1995. Scherzinger triumphed in a stacked category that included Audra McDonald, the most awarded performer in Tony history with six wins. McDonald was nominated for Gypsy but has now lost in her last three nominations, following Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (2020) and Ohio State Murders (2023).

	











	Broadway Bares is known for blending theatrical spectacle with star appearances, but booking a pop icon like Scherzinger to perform a major hit from the 2000s added an extra layer of excitement, signaling that Scherzinger, while fully immersed in musical theater, remains proud of her Pussycat Dolls legacy.


Sunset Blvd. is scheduled to run on Broadway through July 6, 2025.

Ezra Miller reflected on the numerous controversies surrounding their career in an interview with Italian outlet Lo Speciale Giornale. In the interview, filmed during the Cannes Film Festival in May and published on June 19, Miller (who uses they/them pronouns) explained why they joined the red carpet for Lynne Ramsey's new film Die My Love. 


	“I'm working with her again,” Miller confirmed of the filmmaker. “That will likely be the first thing I do, is a film that her and I are writing together. I've been writing a lot because you can do that in solitude, which has been friendly to me… And I came to Cannes because she asked me to come. If there's anything I still believe in, in my life, it's devotion to one's people, to one's loved ones, to one's friends, to one's comrades, above all else.”


	They added, “I didn't necessarily want to go to Cannes. I had a bit of a hard time. That's a tough re-entry point. If you've been in the woods for three years, I do not recommend going straight to Cannes, where every photographer and every weirdo, every rich genocidal freak [will] be there, you know what I mean? It's not an easy re-entry.”

	The actor didn't specifically speak about their past wrongdoings, which include multiple arrests, but did reflect on what has come since. “When we go through those crucibles, if we can survive, which was up in the air for me if I'm being real, we then have that capacity to see other people in their crucibles and just to reach towards them,” Miller said. “I think that grows more and more rarefied in our world, too. Like, the capacity to do that, the desire to do that, the willingness to do that.”

	











	They added of the circumstances that have followed, “Not that I don't hold a lot of remorse and lamentation for a lot of things that I did and for a lot of things that happened in that time, but I'm really, really grateful for the lessons that came with that abyss.”


	When asked to characterize his relationship with the film industry in the interview, Miller replied, “Tentative — I'd say on tentative grounds.”

	In 2020, Miller was seen in a viral video choking and throwing an unnamed woman to the ground at a bar in Reykjavik, Iceland. In 2022, the actor was arrested in Hawaii for disorderly conduct and harassment, including at a local karaoke bar, where Miller allegedly started “yelling obscenities and became agitated when a couple began singing Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's ‘Shallow' at a karaoke bar.” Later that same night, police were called to remove Miller from the property the actor was staying at over another disturbance.


	Miller was subsequently arrested again in Hawaii and charged with second-degree assault. Later that same year, the concerned parents of Gibson Iron Eyes — a notable Standing Rock activist — accused Miller of grooming and controlling the then-18-year-old. Shortly thereafter, Rolling Stone published an exclusive report that revealed Miller had a 25-year-old mother and her three children under the age of five living at their 96-acre farm in Stamford, Vermont, which worried the children's father and people familiar with the situation.

	In a statement issued in August 2022, Miller said, “Having recently gone through a time of intense crisis, I now understand that I am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment. I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior. I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy, safe and productive stage in my life.”

	Announced just one day before the tour kicks off in Cardiff, the news reveals that English indie-pop trio London Grammar, alt-pop favorite BANKS, and viral pop star Addison Rae will each join Del Rey for select dates across the run.

	The tour begins June 23 at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, where London Grammar will open. BANKS will join Del Rey for three dates — June 26 in Glasgow, June 28 in Liverpool, and June 30 in Dublin. Rae, who recently topped charts with her debut album Addison, will open both of Del Rey's highly anticipated Wembley Stadium shows on July 3 and 4.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The social media star-turned-pop artist Rae has rapidly gained traction since releasing Addison, with her Los Angeles hometown show attracting more than 100,000 fans in the ticketing queue for a venue that holds just 2,300 people.


	Del Rey announced the support lineup with a casual Instagram post reading, “Lettttts go!” — and followed up with a birthday post celebrating her own upcoming performances. “I'm so excited to see everybody starting tomorrow on tour and for all the folks joining us. Truly, thank you, thank you, love you,” she wrote.

	











	Originally teased as a tour in support of an album called Lasso, the project has since undergone several changes. In April, Del Rey revealed the album had been renamed The Right Person Will Stay and said it “will not come on time.” 


	Despite the delay, she has released two songs from the album and teased another during her performance at Stagecoach earlier this year.


	During her debut at the 2025 Stagecoach Country Music Festival in Indio, Calif., on April 25, the 39-year-old singer revealed in her new song “57.5” that she once locked lips with a major country star. “I kissed Morgan Wallen/ I guess kissing me kind of went to his head,” Del Rey sang. “If you want my secret to success/ I suggest don't go ATVing with him when you're out west.”

	Kneecap's Glastonbury Festival set is now at the center of a political firestorm, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly opposing the Northern Irish hip-hop trio's appearance following terrorism charges against member Mo Chara.

	In comments published by The Sun, Starmer said he does not believe Kneecap should perform at the iconic festival on June 28. “No, I don't, and I think we need to come down really clearly on this,” he said. “This is about the threats that shouldn't be made. I won't say too much because there's a court case on, but I don't think that's appropriate.”

	Last Wednesday (June 18), Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh — known as Mo Chara — appeared at Westminster Crown Court, accused of displaying a Hezbollah flag and chanting “Up Hamas, Up Hezbollah” during a 2024 London concert.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Kneecap have denied the allegations, calling the charges a “carnival of distraction” in a statement previously posted to social media. “We deny this ‘offense' and will vehemently defend ourselves,” the group said. They added, “British courts have long charged people from the North of Ireland with ‘terrorism' for crimes never committed. We will fight them. We will win.”

	











	Kneecap's growing notoriety has drawn attention beyond the courtroom. At Coachella earlier this year, the trio accused organizers of censoring their pro-Palestine messaging during the livestream. They were recently removed from Scotland's TRNSMT festival due to “police safety concerns,” but their Glastonbury performance remains on the lineup — and the BBC is still planning to air it live.


	Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch joined Starmer in criticizing the group, also taking aim at the BBC. “As a publicly funded platform, the BBC should not be rewarding extremism,” she wrote on social media.


	Kneecap, whose debut album Fine Art was released in 2024, have built a reputation for blending satire, politics and Irish identity into a brash hip-hop sound. The controversy around their appearance has turned what might have been a standard festival set into one of Glastonbury's most politically charged moments in years.

James Holden discovered trance states as a child, hammering out repetitive chords for hours on the piano. For Wacław Zimpel, Polish folk music and American blues offered early glimpses of higher states of consciousness. Since those introductory ear- and mind-openers, the search for musical transcendence has guided both artists in their respective journeys. Holden began his career as a teenager playing capital-T trance music—gated chord stabs, energy-stoking snare rolls, backmasked cymbals, the whole kit and caboodle—before drifting into increasingly woolier strains of ambient techno and electronic improv, including latter-day krautrock, homages to Terry Riley, and pan-global folk music that calls to mind benevolent UFOs hovering above Stonehenge. Zimpel, a clarinetist by training, has moved through free jazz, Indian Carnatic music, and even a 2020 collaboration with Shackleton, the dubstep convert turned arpeggiator shaman. What the two men's work shares is an attentiveness to the minutiae of change, and a propensity for sequences that churn like thunderheads on the prowl.

Holden and Zimpel first linked up in 2018, recording together in the British musician's London studio on a handful of dates—connected by a string of gigs featuring the clarinetist as a member of Holden's touring ensemble, the Animal Spirits. The collaboration yielded the appropriately named Long Weekend EP, four tracks of rippling pulses and drones built up in live overdubs of reeds and modular synthesizer, one song per day. They return now with The Universe Will Take Care of You, a six-track, 51-minute album that feels bigger and more consequential in every way, folding more ideas, intensities, moods, and dimensions into its freeform sprawl.

Each of the six tracks is tagged with the date of its creation, a neat bit of marginalia that gives us some idea of how the sessions unrolled. The album begins on July 19, 2022, their third consecutive day of recording, at which point they were well and truly cooking. After a brief, breath-catching introduction that faintly recalls the vocoded lead-in to Laurie Anderson's “O Superman”—and given the title, “You Are Gods,” the reference may not be entirely coincidental—they explode into action, unleashing volley after volley of rapid-fire arpeggios that move far too fast for mere mortals to parse. (Thirty-second notes? Sixth-fourth notes? Your guess is as good as mine.) Burbling and twisting, branching and recombining, they change color as they go, arpeggios erupting out of arpeggios, like jets of water in an illuminated fountain. Holden is credited with “arpeggio clouds,” Zimpel with alto clarinet, organ, and “grains,” but which sounds belong to whom is anyone's guess—the thrill of the thing is in its overwhelming totality. Occasionally, an accidental melody asserts itself in a sequence of notes that somehow, by some miracle of filtering and timbre, breaks through the blur, but it'd be impossible to track every voice, much less every note; it's enough to let it all wash over you, a jacuzzi for the mind.

The album shifts gears on track two, “Sunbeam Path,” recorded some six weeks later, on their penultimate day of sessions. Tinged with tremolo, Zimpel's lap steel sets a luminous, liquid scene that brings to mind a particularly honeyed strain of krautrock, bent notes and erratic tape playback lending complexity to the Neu!-inspired drones. Horn-like squiggles add movement and tonal interest; the semblance of a beat eventually reveals itself inside a lattice of shakers and bells, then dissolves, returning the song to its broad, featureless ambient horizons.

The rest of the album shuttles between these two poles. “Sparkles, Crystals, Miracles” (give them credit for committing to the bit) is another wide-eyed sun salutation, kalimba-like harp plucks and strummed violin ducking through whooshing side-chain compression; the animating opposition here is that between the identifiable and the blurred, bringing to mind the tension between suggestive detail and gestural smear in some of Gerhard Richter's paintings. “Incredible Bliss,” from their first day in the studio, is an ecstatic fugue for double-piped alghoza flute and 16th-note synth chords, probably the closest thing on the album to Holden's previous work; what dazzles here is the dance between flute and synth, the way each one uses repetition to trick the other into moving forward, egging each other on as they bob rapturously in place. “Time Ring Rattles” is the album's most thrilling track, a jumble of percussive phrases that clatters like a rock tumbler gone haywire, spilling brightly colored baubles as it spins. In a coincidence that reveals the depth of their shared interests, both musicians have performed with Moroccan Gnawa ensembles, and in “Time Ring Rattles” you can hear them searching for ways to unlock some of the polyrhythmic mysteries they've absorbed in their respective travels.

The credits suggest how playful the sessions must have been: Alongside the expected instruments and sounds (bells, electric piano, alto clarinet, Prophet synth) are instruments and techniques like walnuts, “blue noise,” “bucket brigades,” teacup. For all their complexity, these tunes are never difficult; they move with fluid grace and joy, buoyed by the revelatory power of mutual surprise. Nowhere is that more evident than in the 10-minute title track, which closes the album. A halting reed loop (or, at the credits would have it, “eternal pitch-gate loops of alto clarinet”) squeaks like a screen door over a thrumming synthesizer pulse. More phrases join in—bells, breaths, rustling noises, so many brightly colored ribbons of tone that the stereo field soon resembles prayer flags fluttering in the wind, patterns upon patterns upon patterns. Zimpel has called trance “the state of mind in which time bends”; one of the ways to achieve that state, he says, is via repetition. “After many repetitions I stop thinking… and I become equally listener and player. Eventually I have the feeling that I am disappearing.” That's exactly what happens to me here: Try as I might, I find it impossible to follow the music's changes with my conscious mind, but I am borne along anyway, weightlessly.

Daryl Dixon gets around. Since closing The Book Of Carol, Dixon and his good-time buddy Carol have decided to take a Spanish holiday in the third season of this awkwardly titled Walking Dead spin-off, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride return as the gruesome twosome, Daryl and Carol, and this time they're spending the summer abroad, learning the correct way to pronounce Barcelona between headshots and dismemberments. Season three also welcomes Eduardo Noriega, Óscar Jaenada, Alexandra Masangkay, Candela Saitta, Hugo Arbués, Greta Fernández, Gonzalo Bouza, Hada Nieto, Yassmine Othman, Cuco Usín, and Stephen Merchant to the unending trudge of The Walking Dead.

Released during the season two finale of The Walking Dead: Dead City, the teaser for the new season gives us a taste of Daryl's Western phase.

﻿

Here's the synopsis:

Season three, which filmed in Spain, will follow Daryl (Reedus) and Carol (McBride) as they continue their journey to somehow return home and to the ones they love. As they struggle to find their way back, the path takes them farther astray, leading them through distant lands with ever-changing and unfamiliar conditions as they witness the various effects of the Walker apocalypse.

Hear the classical, finger-picked guitars, see the dusty streets, and wonder if in this reality Shakira is also wanted by the Spanish government for tax fraud when The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season three premieres on September 7.

During its 15-season run, Supernatural was popular at the same time as other pop culture hits. Back in the early 2010s, other major favorites were Doctor Who and Sherlock, and they often included the same fandoms.

Back when Tumblr was a staple of the rise of fandoms, a joint name for all of them was born: SuperWhoLock. The three shows aired at the same time, but on different channels and countries, as Supernatural first aired on The WB and later The CW, while Sherlock and Doctor Who were from the UK's BBC. Years later, Supernatural star Misha Collins gave fans the SuperWho crossover they didn't know they needed, sharing a photo on Instagram with Doctor Who's David Tennant.

Two decades after Supernatural's release, the show remains one of Jensen Ackles' career-defining projects.

In the photo, Collins was smiling, posing with Tennant, with the words "Super-Who?" written at the top of the picture. The two met at Heroes Dutch Comic Con, where they posed for a picture backstage. "It's weird, but the green room at @dutchcomiccon is MUCH bigger on the inside," the Supernatural star wrote in the caption.

The Heroes Dutch Comic Con featured more Supernatural stars, Jared Padalecki, who played Sam Winchester, and his wife, Genevieve Padalecki, who played the second Ruby. Meanwhile, Tennant shared the screen with Doctor Who co-star Billie Piper, who was recently revealed to be the new incarnation of the Doctor.

Collins played Destiel in Supernatural, who later became a main character after his introduction in Season 1's premiere, "Lazarus Rising." Tennant, meanwhile, played the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who, and is generally one of the most beloved incarnations of the famous character. Currently, the actor also portrays Crowley in Good Omens, which aired for two seasons and is expected to wrap the story with a film that has yet to get a premiere.

The photo went viral and fans were ecstatic about the nostalgia-filled crossover. "SUPERWHOLOCK VAGUELY MENTIONED?????" reads one comment. "This woulda done NUMBERS on tumblr in 2014," reads one of the most-liked comments. "Not the Crowley we're used to seeing next to Cas… but I'm here for it," wrote a different fan, referring to Tennant's role in Good Omens. A different person commented, "Wait, that's a different Crowley..." Supernatural had its own Crowley, the King of Hell, played by Mark Sheppard. "Close your eyes Aziraphale and Dean, the guys who do something about their feelings have reunited," joked another fan, referring to the non-canon Destiel fan-favorite pairing, and Aziraphale and Crowley from Good Omens, who finally kissed in the Season 2 finale.

There was one place David Tennant really wanted to visit when he was the one playing the Doctor.

While the SuperWho crossover came as an unexpected shock to the two fandoms, Supernatural fans have more things to celebrate. The fantasy horror series wrapped in 2020, but the lead actors have been giving encouraging words about reprising their roles in a reboot. However, if and when that happens is still unclear. Until then, fans have more to look forward to: a new Supernatural reunion on The Boys.

Jensen Ackles joined The Boys in Season 3 as Soldier Boy. The show comes from Supernatural creator Eric Kripke and features multiple actors from the fan-favorite series. With the show set to return with a fifth and final season, the explosive finale season will also bring over Misha Collins and Jared Padalecki.

Not long ago, Kripke confirmed that the three of them will share the screen. "I will confirm that Jared, Jensen, and Misha are all in the same frame together, and in the same storyline, and interacting with each other."

Monica, I think you need to proofread your articles before submitting them, or have a proofreader. There are quite a few errors in this article regarding Supernatural. I don't know if there are any regarding Doctor Who, but I spotted two Supernatural errors. Just as a heads up.

Many of The CW's Supernatural creatures use brute force, but these monsters used their wits against the Winchesters and almost defeated Sam and Dean.

One of Taylor Sheridan's best series that isn't in the Yellowstone universe is climbing up the streaming charts.

Buffy's relationship with Angel was a high point of Buffy the Vampire series, but there's one scene that fans never saw.

The Big Bang Theory introduced audiences to a lovable gang of nerds, but one of its best characters may have been hiding a dark secret.

The new action thriller series starring Jensen Ackles on Prime Video, Countdown, delivers both character drama and spectacle in a fun way.

Update: The first image reveal from the groundbreaking Vera C. Rubin Observatory will stream live in less than an hour! You can watch the live debut right here at 11 a.m. EDT today (Monday, June. 23) or on the Observatory's YouTube page. The Observatory has already offered a stunning sneak peak of the new images this morning, sharing three images of distant galaxies and nebulas. Check them out at the link above to get ready for the full debut, streaming below.

If you want to watch from home, a news conference will be streaming on YouTube in English and Spanish at 11:00 a.m. EDT today (Monday, June 23). The link to watch is posted on the observatory's website, and is also embedded above.

If you'd prefer to bask in the awe of the cosmos with friends, you may be able to attend a watch party near you — or even host one of your own. Groups will gather across the globe in planetariums and universities to admire the highly detailed images and videos as they are released. The observatory has shared links to a map of all registered watch parties, as well as a link to sign up to become a host.

During the news conference, the observatory team will introduce the Rubin Observatory before showcasing the new images and discussing their significance. Watch parties may also hear from local scientists and special guests. Be sure to check out the details of a watch party before you attend to learn about any extra programming.

The observatory, perched high on a mountain in the Chilean Andes, will peer at interstellar comets and dangerous asteroids, as well as larger objects, like twisting galaxies and exploding supernovas.

The camera will take a new high-resolution photo of the sky around every 40 seconds. The images will then be transmitted via fiber optic cables to a supercomputer in California, which will analyze the photos. When stitched together, the images can act as a time-lapse video of space, one that is planned to span 10 years.

Using its groundbreaking instruments, the observatory is expected to contribute to current understanding of widely debated phenomena, including dark energy and dark matter — two components that are thought to make up a vast majority of the universe, but remain poorly understood.

The new images could be the first of many that vastly improve our understanding of the cosmos. Whether you join a watch party or tune in from the comfort of your couch, these photos are not to be missed.

David Young disappeared from Red Bluff in 2019

RED BLUFF, Calif. - The mystery surrounding the disappearance of David Young, a man from Red Bluff, continues to haunt his family. He vanished six years ago, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions.

Young's sister, Amber, remains hopeful as she searches for answers. "I reached out to every single person I could think of who even knew who he was who had any connection with him in the last several years," she said. Amber thinks her brother might see this story and hopes it reaches him.

David Young disappeared in January 2019 at the age of 26. He left his sister's home on Orange Street in Red Bluff early one morning, taking only his cell phone. He sent Amber a final text message saying, "we deserve better and goodbye."

Amber believes Young, who was suffering from depression, became overwhelmed. "Unfortunately, he has enough skill set if he wanted to just disappear for a while he could," she said.

Young, who used to work at Walmart, is well-known in the Red Bluff community. Amber describes him as tall and slender with beautiful blue eyes. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds.

"If he can see this, it doesn't matter how much time has passed or what's happened? I love you. We love you. We want you here with us no matter what," Amber said.

Last week marked David's 33rd birthday. Amber urges anyone with information about his whereabouts to contact the Red Bluff Police Department, hoping to bring her brother back home.

The world has gotten an early preview of the Rubin Observatory's first images, which include stunning snaps of spiraling galaxies and the Trifid and Lagoon nebulae.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has unveiled a "sneak peek" of the first images taken with its powerful astronomy camera — and the results are stunning.

The exceptionally detailed images are peppered with multicolored stars and spiraling galaxies. In one photo, the observatory has captured two nebulae, filled with bright pink clouds of gas and dust.

The Rubin Observatory is a next-generation telescope equipped with the world's largest digital camera. These first preview images are a major milestone for the observatory, which will become fully operational later this year.

Introducing...your sneak peek at the cosmos captured by @NSF–@doescience Vera C. Rubin Observatory!Can you guess what regions of sky they are?This is just a peek...join us at 11am US EDT for your full First Look at how Rubin will #CaptureTheCosmos!https://t.co/1a74X2edp8 pic.twitter.com/DE3tx2RQI4June 23, 2025

Representatives for the Rubin Observatory shared the stunning night-sky snaps on social media, ahead of an official presentation at 11 a.m. ET on Monday (June 23) via the Rubin Observatory's YouTube channel.

Observatory staff didn't reveal which parts of the night sky were captured in the preview images, and instead asked social media users to guess. Some users were quick to point out that the bright pink nebulae were the Trifid and Lagoon nebulae, located in the Sagittarius constellation around 9,000 light-years from Earth.

BBC News reported that one of the other images is of the Virgo cluster. This large cluster of galaxies has more than 1,000 members. In the Virgo cluster photo, two of its spiral galaxies are clearly visible as bright blue swirls.

Researchers plan to use the Rubin Observatory's massive camera to observe the universe from Earth in never-before-seen detail. Jointly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, the Rubin Observatory is located high in the Chilean Andes, on a mountain called Cerro Pachón.

Later this year, the Rubin Observatory will begin surveying the night sky as part of a 10-year mission. By capturing images around every 40 seconds, researchers will create a time-lapse of the visible universe across space and over time. When it's finished, the Rubin Observatory will have collected the largest optical astronomy dataset in history, according to the Rubin Observatory.

—JWST spies frigid alien world on bizarre orbit: 'One of the coldest, oldest and faintest planets that we've imaged to date'

"This enormous, all-purpose dataset will bring the night sky to life, enabling scientists around the world to better understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy, create an inventory of the Solar System, map the Milky Way, explore the dynamic sky, and more," a representative from the observatory wrote on YouTube.

The Rubin Observatory's next-generation camera should help spot "planet killer" asteroids hiding in the sun's glare, and may also help settle the debate as to whether there's a ninth planet hiding in the outer solar system.

Chrissy's open shelves need to be seen to be believed – I've written about kitchens for years, but these stopped me in my tracks

Over the last five years, I've seen hundreds – if not thousands – of celebrity kitchens, all of which exhibit a quality that makes them feel unique and personal to their owners. In the case of Chrissy Teigen's marble kitchen, her 'floating' shelves are unlike anything I've ever seen before. Few features often stop me in my scrolling tracks, but the optical illusion seen in her background stole all my attention, and I think you'll be amazed, too.

The ultra-modern space, designed by Jack Arnold, features white, veined marble shelves that seamlessly blend with the splashback of the same material. She places neutral cookware on one shelf, but her bookshelf (the highest one) has the real supernatural quality.

It appears as though her books are floating above the marble shelf, creating an optical illusion that differs from anything I've ever seen before. It's kitchen storage, with a magical twist, and if you're anything like me, you'll spend a lot of time admiring its power.

This clever bracket is made from high-grade alloy metal material, which is rust-free for life. The rods are set at a 90-degree vertical angle, so you have no need to worry about the difficulty of inserting rods into the holes. It makes getting Chrissy's look simpler.

Cook multiple dishes at once with this multi-tray, silicone bakeware set. It's chic but so practical, you'll wonder, and of course, Chrissy-approved.

As expected, creating a floating kitchen shelf with the same impact as Chrissy's is an art. However, with some planning and hidden accessories (discreet wall brackets, we're looking at you), it's possible to achieve a similar aesthetic.

'To create that clean, 'floating' open shelving look in a kitchen, the key is simplicity and clever concealment,' comments Claire Garner, the director at Claire Garner Design Studio.

'Choose wall-mounted shelves with hidden brackets [such as this one from Amazon] or floating shelf systems that are anchored directly into the studs, which will give the illusion that the shelves are weightlessly suspended,' Claire explains.

The materials you use are similarly important. 'Choose materials with a slim profile, like oak or powder-coated steel, which will help to add elegance without the visual bulk,' she explains. 'When styling your shelving, aim to keep it minimal by grouping items by colour or material, and leaving a little breathing room between objects so the wall still feels light and open.'

I hope to bring this look into my kitchen sometime very soon. In the meantime, I'll keep returning to Chrissy's space as the most magical space I've seen so far this year. It's truly stunning.

Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani watched with concern as their mother Kate rose to notoriety during the pandemic, eventually getting struck off as a nurse for promoting misinformation about Covid-19.

Then, their sister Paloma was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors told her she had a high chance of survival with chemotherapy. But in 2024, seven months later, she died - having refused the treatment.

The brothers blame their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories for Paloma's death at 23 - as cancer doctors tell BBC Panorama these beliefs are becoming more mainstream.

Kate Shemirani has not responded directly to the allegations we raised, but she has publicly blamed the NHS for her daughter's death.

She and her ex-husband, Paloma's father Faramarz Shemirani, wrote to us saying they have evidence "Paloma died as a result of medical interventions given without confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent". The BBC has seen no evidence to substantiate these claims.

Paloma's elder brother Sebastian says: "My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have."

Both brothers say they contacted me about Paloma in the hope they could prevent other deaths, and they believe social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation - which the BBC has found is being actively recommended on several major sites.

"I wasn't able to stop my sister from dying. But it would mean the world to me if I could make it that she wasn't just another in a long line of people that die in this way," says Gabriel.

For Panorama and BBC Radio 4's Marianna in Conspiracyland 2 podcast, I pieced together how this young Cambridge graduate came to refuse treatment that might have saved her life, following an online trail and interviewing people close to her.

And I found that conspiracy theory influencers such as Kate Shemirani are sharing once-fringe anti-medicine views to millions - which can leave vulnerable people at risk of serious harm.

It is getting harder to fight medical misinformation because of the prominence of figures such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, who have previously expressed unscientific views - says oncologist Dr Tom Roques, vice-president of the Royal College of Radiologists, which also represents cancer specialists.

When you have a US health and human services secretary "who actively promotes views like the link between vaccines and autism that have been debunked years ago, then that makes it much easier for other people to peddle false views," he says.

"I think the risk is that more harmful alternative treatments are getting more mainstream. That may do people more active harm."

Since becoming Health and Human Services Secretary, Mr Kennedy has said he is not anti-vaccine, and that he just supports more safety tests.

Paloma and her twin Gabriel, along with Sebastian and their younger sister, grew up in the small Sussex town of Uckfield, where they were exposed to conspiracy theories at home, her brothers say.

The "soundtrack" to their school runs, Gabriel says, was conspiracy theorist Alex Jones talking about how the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged or 9/11 "was an inside job".

The brothers say it was their father who first got into conspiracy theories, which piqued their mother's interest. The children absorbed outlandish ideas, including that the Royal Family were shape-shifting lizards, says Gabriel. "As a young child, you trust your parents. So you see that as a truth," he says.

Sebastian believes their mum used her ideas as a way of controlling them. On one occasion, Kate Shemirani decided wi-fi was dangerous and switched it off at home, he says, ignoring his pleas that he had to submit GCSE coursework. "That only fed the joy that she had for using her irrational system of beliefs to control me," he says.

According to her sons, Kate Shemirani's anti-medicine views were accelerated in 2012, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Even though she had the tumour removed through surgery, she credits alternative therapies for her recovery and says online how she used a programme including juices and coffee enemas to become "cancer-free". She doesn't use the word cured.

Paloma absorbed some of these ideas, says Chantelle, one of her best friends from school. "Paloma spoke about her mum curing herself, and she believed sunscreen could cause cancer. I remember she used to get burned so badly at school," she says.

After their parents split up, Gabriel and Sebastian became estranged from their mother. But Paloma maintained contact with her, even when she went off to study at Cambridge in 2019.

"Paloma's strategy was to appease, to be sweet, to try and win the love that she hadn't been granted earlier," says Sebastian.

Messages Paloma shared with her then-boyfriend Ander Harris - and which he has shared with the BBC - reveal a relationship with her mother that had moments of love and care, but also times when Paloma saw it as toxic and abusive.

Over Christmas 2022, she told Ander her mother was blaming her for other children not coming home for Christmas. "I'm so so so sick of being abused", she wrote, suggesting with an expletive that this treatment happened all the time.

Her mother kept coming into her room and "being mean", Paloma said in one message, adding that her mother had hit her. Paloma left for a friend's house. She later shared her parting message to her mother with Ander, saying it was "the last straw. You hurt me every time I let you in and I never ever will again. I'm beyond hurt".

Back at university, Paloma seemed to be moving away from her mother's beliefs at times. Chantelle says she began eating meat and using fluoride toothpaste. But both Chantelle and Ander say she remained sceptical about the Covid-19 vaccine and refused to have it.

In late 2023, not long after graduating, Paloma began to have chest pains and breathing difficulties. She went to the hospital.

Doctors suspected a tumour, but Ander says he and Paloma, "one of the smartest people I've ever met", were hopeful at first that it would turn out not to be malignant. Paloma made light of it, nicknaming the tumour "Maria the Lung Mass", he says.

But on 22 December, Paloma and Ander went to Maidstone Hospital where doctors gave her the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Untreated, this type of cancer can be fatal, but doctors told Paloma she had an 80% chance of recovery if she had chemotherapy.

Paloma told her mother the news. Ander says Paloma still wanted her support, even though their relationship had recently been through a rough patch. Kate Shemirani said she would come to the hospital. Paloma was worried about seeing her, though, and spoke to medical staff about her concerns, her then-boyfriend says.

Evidence seen by the BBC suggests Paloma's thinking could have been influenced by her mother during the two days she was an inpatient at Maidstone Hospital.

Kate Shemirani texted Ander to say: "TELL PALOMA NOT TO SIGN [OR] VERBALLY CONSENT TO CHEMO OR ANY TREATMENT."

Ander and his own mother, who was also there, raised concerns with hospital staff about Kate Shemirani's beliefs and her relationship with Paloma.

Medical staff discussed safeguarding concerns about Paloma among themselves and wrote that they had "a concern regarding parental influence" on her. But they also thought that she did have the capacity to make her own decisions.

For advice, Paloma reached out to a former partner of Kate Shemirani called Patrick Vickers. Paloma had a good relationship with him, Ander says. He is also an alternative health practitioner.

When Paloma asked him about the "80% chance of cure" the doctors had said chemotherapy would offer, Mr Vickers said that was "exaggerated". He encouraged her to start Gerson therapy and to maybe consider chemotherapy if her symptoms did not improve after six weeks.

Mr Vickers told us that any "assertions that I played a role in her [Paloma's] death are legally inaccurate". He also shared documents with the BBC in support of Gerson therapy.

Gerson therapy involves a strict plant-based diet, along with juices, supplements and coffee enemas. Some people claim - without scientific evidence - it can be used to treat a range of cancers.

Paloma was worried about the negative side effects of chemotherapy, Ander tells me, as it can cause fatigue, sickness, hair loss and affect fertility. Nursing staff spoke to Paloma about egg-freezing and wigs when she was diagnosed.

But the charity Cancer Research UK says Gerson therapy can also have severe side effects, including dehydration, inflammation of the bowel, and heart and lung problems.

At some point during the two days in hospital, Ander says, Paloma made up her mind. She decided not to pursue chemotherapy - at least for the time being - and would try Gerson therapy to start with.

On 23 December, Kate Shemirani sent Ander a voice note giving him instructions to drive Paloma to her house, saying she had arranged doctors for her. She suggested Paloma's time with a friend she wanted to see should be limited on Christmas Day - and said in the message that they could "see her for maybe half an hour or whatever here, or they can do it on FaceTime".

Ander says he felt he could not argue. Paloma "was in fight or flight and really just wanted to be taken care of and, you know, not have to make the hard decisions", he says. "Her mum kind of swooped in and took advantage of that."

Kate Shemirani promotes ideas which she recommended to her daughter to a wider public online. A former NHS nurse in the 1980s, she calls herself "the Natural Nurse" on social media.

On her website, she sells apricot kernels for their "potential health benefits" along with nutritional supplements, and offers information and advice.

She charges about £70 for an annual membership to her site, and charges patients - including those with cancer - £195 for a consultation and personalised 12-week programme.

On social media she posts videos promoting her products and sometimes criticises "ill-informed people" for treating cancer with chemotherapy, or "pumping mustard gas into their veins" as she characterises it.

When the Covid pandemic hit in 2020, Kate Shemirani was one of many conspiracy theory influencers who found a wider audience. Her beliefs appeared to have evolved from alternative health ideas to sprawling anti-establishment conspiracy theories.

She promoted the false ideas that the pandemic was a hoax, that vaccines were part of a plan to kill lots of people, and that doctors and nurses should be punished for their part in it all.

In 2021 a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel determined that Kate Shemirani should be struck off as a nurse for promoting misinformation about the pandemic. Several social media companies also suspended her profiles for promoting misinformation. "She went into obscurity," says Sebastian.

But once Elon Musk bought X in 2022, lots of conspiracy theory accounts were reinstated, including Kate Shemirani's. She was also reinstated on Facebook and she joined TikTok.

Her audience has grown again - in the past six months she has had her content viewed more than four and a half million times across the major social media sites. I have found dozens of comments on X where she encourages people to get in touch, including those with cancer.

TikTok says it has now banned Kate Shemirani's account for violating medical misinformation policies. According to Meta, Instagram and Facebook do not allow harmful medical misinformation. X did not respond.

Paloma continued on Gerson therapy. Some of her friends noticed how she became more and more unwell.

On one video call, Chantelle says, Paloma said she had a new lump in her armpit, and her mother had told her it meant that the cancer was going out of her body. "I knew she was really struggling," she says, adding that Paloma told her she had lost control of her bodily functions.

But she says Paloma also said she felt pressured by doctors and friends to reconsider her decision to pursue alternative therapies on their own. Chantelle says she did not agree with the alternative therapy either, but wanted to be there for her friend.

Paloma had mentioned other people trying to change her mind and discussed "cutting them off", Chantelle adds. "I thought I don't want to be cut off especially when she's struggling like this."

Over the months that they spoke on the phone, Chantelle says she noticed that Kate Shemirani was "taking very good care of Paloma". But she does not think Paloma would have made the same decisions without her mother.

"I don't think her ideology was strong enough to make those decisions is my personal belief. People have different opinions about these things, but I think her mum played a massive, massive role into it," Chantelle says.

In March 2024, Paloma ended her relationship with Ander. Other friends and family felt that Kate Shemirani was isolating Paloma from them.

Gabriel says he asked to meet Paloma not long after she was diagnosed but his sister said she could not go out because of the "bad air". Their mother had convinced her that the "damp air" would cause her to become more ill, he says.

Sebastian and Gabriel were so worried that Gabriel started a legal case. He was not arguing Paloma did not have capacity, but he wanted an assessment of the appropriate medical treatment for her.

But events overtook them and the case ended without a conclusion in July - because Paloma had died.

Gabriel only learned of his sister's death several days afterwards, in a phone call from their lawyer. He had to break the news to his brother. "It's like being burnt alive and you feel the searing pain every time it comes out of your mouth," Gabriel says.

Sebastian says he blamed himself. "I haven't come to terms with that at all," he says.

When Ander heard, "I broke," he says. "I was just, like, screaming and crying at the top of my lungs."

Paloma had suffered a heart attack caused by her tumour. She was taken to hospital, but after several days, her life support was switched off.

An inquest is due to begin next month to establish the circumstances surrounding Paloma's death.

Kate Shemirani has promoted a range of unproven theories on social media and fringe political podcasts about how she believes Paloma was murdered by medical staff - and that this was followed by a cover up. The BBC has not seen evidence to support these claims.

Paloma's death was devastating for her family and loved ones. But for Sebastian and Gabriel, it is also a warning of the potential consequences for people who believe anti-medicine conspiracy theories like their mother's.

The ex-BBC and Sky journalist says he is "responding positively" to treatment and is "feeling well".

Chantelle began on a Royal Cornwall Hospital clinical trial and had the all-clear 18 months later.

Tim Strugnell, 76, says he feels as if his life has changed after taking part in clinical trials.

The Reverend Matthew Simpkins says the disease has not shown up on his last five scans.

It was an unofficial Supernatural/Doctor Who crossover during Heroes Dutch Comic Con, with Misha Collins and David Tennant checking in.

Earlier today, we had a chance to cover what Jared Padalecki had to share during Heroes Dutch Comic Con about filming the fifth and final season of Prime Video's The Boys and his upcoming in-development CBS medical drama. But that was far from the only cool thing to come out of the con this weekend and hit social media. For example, where else but at a pop culture convention or fan event could you find the Tenth/Fourteenth Doctor and Castiel spending some green room time together? That's right, Supernatural star Misha Collins and Doctor Who star David Tennant had a chance to enjoy some hanging-out time during the big event, and Collins was kind enough to post a look.

"It's weird, but the green room at [Heroes Dutch Comic Con] is MUCH bigger on the inside," read the caption to Collins' Instagram post, which included a selfie of Tennant and Collins together:

Back in April, we had a chance to pass along some of what went down when Supernatural and The Boys co-stars Collins, Padalecki, and Jensen Ackles made their way to Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Minneapolis" – including insights into Ackles' upcoming Prime Video series, Countdown, and Padalecki's experience filming the final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's Prime Video series. Collins also offered a behind-the-scenes look at the shenanigans that go on behind the scenes, like what happens when Collins leaves his phone in the green room during the fan event and Ackles gets his hands on it. "Jensen got into my phone again in the green room. Do I never learn? (The last image is an 8X10 photo that was sitting on the table. He doctored it with a red Sharpie. )," Collins wrote as the caption to his social media posts, including the evidence of Ackles' mischief:
