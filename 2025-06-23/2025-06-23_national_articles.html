Schnall was ejected in the first inning after an argument with home plate umpire Angel Campos. He said his ejection wasn't justified and he was wrongly accused of bumping an umpire who appeared to trip and fall to the ground when he came over to break up the commotion. JCoastal Carolina Chanticleers head coach Kevin Schnall reacts after being ejected during the first inning against the LSU Tigers at Charles Schwab Field. "If you guys watch the video, there was a guy who came in extremely aggressively, tripped over Campos' foot, embarrassed in front of 25,000, and goes, ‘Two-game suspension' and says, ‘Bumping the umpire,'" Schnall said. I shouldn't be held accountable for a grown man's athleticism. If that warranted an ejection, there would be a lot of ejections. As umpires, it's your job to manage the game with some poise and calmness and a little bit of tolerance." The NCAA said Schnall was arguing balls and strikes, which was heard on the broadcast. Since LSU won Game 2 and the College World Series, Schnall's suspension would start in the 2026 season. The NCAA said Schnall and first-base coach Matt Schilling engaged in "prolonged arguing," which triggers a two-game suspension. Schnall said he couldn't hear Campos' initial warning when he was arguing balls and strikes. "As a head coach, it's your right to get an explanation for why we got warned," Schnall said. When I came out, I got told it was a warning issued for arguing balls and strikes, and I said it was because you missed three. If that warrants an ejection, I'm the first one to stand here like a man and apologize." Coastal Carolina athletic director Chance Miller said Sunday night the ejections "altered the trajectory of a must-win game for our team." "These decisions were made with an alarming level of haste, without an attempt at de-escalation, and deprived our student-athletes of the leadership they have relied on throughout a historic postseason run," Miller said. In the biggest moment of the college baseball season, our program and its student-athletes deserved better." Coastal Carolina head coach Kevin Schnall, center left, screams at the umpires after being ejected in the first inning against LSU in Game 2 of the NCAA College World Series baseball finals in Omaha, Neb., Sunday, June 22, 2025. Miller implored the NCAA to re-evaluate its training methods and how it assigns and reviews umpires in championship settings. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Brooke Hess-Homeier) SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. (AP) — Divers searched a section of Lake Tahoe on Monday for one person still missing after seven others were killed when a boat capsized during a powerful weekend thunderstorm that whipped up high waves, authorities said. Ten people were on board the 27-foot (8-meter) gold Chris-Craft vessel when it flipped Saturday afternoon near D.L. Bliss State Park on the lake's southwest edge, U.S. Coast Guard officials said. Two people were rescued immediately and taken to a hospital in unknown condition. Six bodies were recovered later Saturday and a seventh body was found Sunday evening, according to the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office. Their names won't be released until family members are notified, Sgt. Winds topped 35 mph (56 kph) and waves swelled more than 8 feet (2.5 meters). “We weren't expecting it to be so strong,” Chyba said Monday. He said temperatures in the area were 15 to 25 degrees below normal for this time of year, which could have contributed to the unstable air mass. Eight-foot waves on Tahoe is “pretty significant,” Chyba said. Lake Tahoe is a popular summer recreation destination for boaters, kayakers and paddleboarders. El Dorado County sheriff's deputies continued searching Monday with help from other agencies from California and neighboring Nevada, Parker said. The storm Saturday cleared out within about two hours. Chris Williams, a party boat operator with Tahoe Sports, was one of four company captains on the lake Saturday when the weather turned. “We braved the weather and came back during some severe wave heights that have never been seen on Lake Tahoe,” Williams told the San Francisco Chronicle. “We were pushing the vessels to their maximum capabilities while making sure to keep all clients safely aboard.” Video obtained by KCRA-TV showed moored boats at a nearby marina crashing into one another amid strong gusts.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's strike on Iran, the pushback from both lawmakers and Trump's call for a regime change. The War on Terror led to regime change in Iraq and a briefly democratic Afghanistan — at least until former President Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal. More recently, a separate conflict between Israel and Iran saw the U.S. step in to help destroy nuclear facilities — but observers should pause before making any apples-to-apples comparisons between the two eras. The image of then-White House chief of staff Andrew Card whispering in President George W. Bush's ear during an elementary school reading event that the Twin Towers had been hit by terrorists began a continuing three decades of U.S. involvement in the Middle East. The Middle East and the world writ-large was a different place back then, Heritage Foundation senior China and National Security Policy studies fellow Steve Yates told Fox News Digital. Yates previously served in the Bush administration as a top national security affairs adviser to then-Vice President Dick Cheney. More recently, he co-chaired the 2016 RNC's platform subcommittee on national security. Presidents George Bush, left and Donald Trump, right. "And I think that my perceptions of things have changed a great deal, in no small part, because I've had as a primary focus, among all other things in the world, what's happening with China." "None of those things were factors in the early 2000s. "Frankly, I am a supporter of President Trump and what he's been trying to do. In the Middle East, American intervention during the War on Terror led to dictator Saddam Hussein being deposed, and a decades-long ground war ensued. Iran, at the time, was led by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — a more prominent president. Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei has become the more prominent global figure as of late, over current President Masoud Pezeshkian. And, while the War on Terror led to boots on the ground, Yates noted Trump has been clear that he wants Mideast allies and their Western-friendly neighbors to carry their "fair share" of risk and responsibility for what happens in the region — which has been marked by conflicts since the time of Jesus Christ. They haven't asked for American boots on the ground. Yates foreshadowed that Trump has made clear he is ready to use "decisive American force" if necessary to prevent Iranian nuclear proliferation. "That is a definable objective… That is not a war of occupation or trying to ‘remake Iran in our image' as some [have] characterized Iraq, whether fairly or unfairly." "So I think that the president has navigated this with deeper logic than most people give credit." The question at this time in history is more whether "the Old World" will act on their shared interest in supporting a non-nuclear Iran or similar outcome in a meaningful way. He referenced the "EU-3" — Germany, Great Britain and France, the three largest European economic powers — and said they had previously been a "moderating force" in negotiations that allowed Tehran to "mitigate sanctions" and go back on promises made. Israel's decisive response to October 7 only underscored that point. "I still have a lot of gratitude and respect for my colleagues back in the Bush administration. "And I would give President Trump pretty high marks on how he's balanced equities — keeping true to his definition of what America First means, but also true to standing by allies in times of need."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Iran has been considered a political risk to America since the 1979 revolution, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that it cannot be allowed to possess nuclear weapons. But whether Trump's strikes will achieve his stated aim of destroying Iran's nuclear program is unclear. It doesn't help that his plan around the attacks has felt haphazard. Trump said Iran had a two-week deadline before he would authorize a strike — then attacked only two days later. Even just before the bombs were dropped Trump was telling the press that targeting nuclear facilities may not even be an option, saying “I may or I may not do it.” Trump stated in his 2024 election victory speech that he was “not going to start a war,” yet he has now hinted on social media that regime change could be next. Trump could be accused of simply being chaotic here. Trump has a history of being intentionally unpredictable when it comes to foreign policy, known as the unpredictability doctrine. You make your opponent unsure of what they are facing and unable to make decisions in response, leaving you to take the advantage. But foreign policy is not business, and a strategy that works with corporations may backfire on the world stage. While nobody knows exactly what will happen next, what can we work out about the implications of Trump's actions now given what has worked (or hasn't) before in terms of nuclear arms control? Countries may consider military strikes on nuclear facilities when they feel that the other side won't cooperate in negotiations. For example, Israel, believing that Iraq would never be serious about a diplomatic solution, bombed an Iraqi enrichment facility at Osirak in 1981 to stymie the nuclear program. The preventive attack did serious damage to the facility, and Israel claimed they had disrupted Iraq's ability to produce a nuclear weapon by destroying the facility before it became functional. They also deliver results faster than diplomatic options, which can take a lot of time and do not come with any guarantee of a solution. But while Trump may like to think that a few strikes will do the job, using bombs now could create problems for any future US strategy toward Iran — whatever that strategy turns out to be. To work properly, a military attack should completely destroy the target facilities to ensure they cannot work. While Iraq did not go on to develop nuclear weapons after Osirak, it still had sufficient resources to maintain a plan. In fact, some experts argue that the attack only encouraged Iraq to pursue this. While there is evidence of physical damage after Trump's strikes, whether this is enough damage to undermine Iran's nuclear capability remains uncertain. It's also unclear how many nuclear facilities are left outside of the three that were bombed. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently cautioned that there could be clandestine facilities that we just do not know about. Trump himself has claimed there are “many targets left,” which indicates that Iran still has at least part of an operational program. In 2010, America tried to disrupt the Iranian program in a cyberattack using a computer worm called Stuxnet against the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. So it's possible that the recent bombings could slow down Iran's progress, but it won't eliminate the overall and long-term risks. It also will not affect Iran's ability to retaliate with conventional weapons. Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has already said that the US “must receive a response to their aggression.” Iran has also publicly stated that it is considering a “proportionate” responses. This could potentially look like a repeat of Iran's response to the 2020 assassination of General Qasem Soleimani in which Trump ordered a drone strike against the Iranian leader. Responding to Soleimani's death, Iran launched a retaliatory attack against two US air bases in Iraq. The incentive for Iran to retaliate is even greater this time. There is now an even higher chance that Iran will fight back this time because it is already fighting, and it could use that war as an opportunity to target the US. If Iran doesn't show signs of giving in and continues its nuclear ambitions, Trump may be forced to take further action. If he doesn't, it would look like Iran has won, even with three facilities destroyed. While suggesting that regime change could be in the cards, Trump has also talked about a diplomatic solution, and this is what many other states would prefer. Negotiations have also convinced countries, such as Ukraine, to give up their nuclear arsenals. Trump was clearly hoping that the attacks might soften Iran up for negotiations if he decided to go down that road. He said the attacks should be taken as a sign for Iran to “make peace” or face “far greater” attacks in the future. When Trump initially threatened strikes, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that such a move would “undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage” to US-Iran relations. Iran has now repeated this line, saying the impact of the strikes will have “everlasting consequences.” There's no evidence that Iran would allow itself to be forced into negotiating through threats alone. The solution in Ukraine worked because it was based on a peaceful and collaborative process, not because it was done under duress. It is also worth remembering — as Iran certainly will — that Trump is the one responsible for the failure of a previous diplomatic solution. This agreement — between Iran and the US, China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and Germany — aimed to restrict Iran's nuclear ambitions through demands, such as getting rid of its medium-enriched uranium and not build heavy-water reactors. In return, these countries would reduce their economic sanctions on Iran. Trump said this was a “one-sided deal” that “didn't bring peace, and it never will” and pulled out in 2018. Whatever misgivings he had about the deal, it means the US will find it hard to introduce new diplomatic measures now. Trump's perceived lack of commitment reduces the chance that Iran would be willing to talk cooperatively with the US and its allies. This is especially the case when that someone has just bombed them and is now talking about regime change. Whatever Trump has planned next, his decision to carry out strikes has radically limited both his options and the chances of de-escalation. Based on what we've seen in previous attempts at arms control and conflict resolution, Trump may have unnecessarily inflamed the conflict, left the US open to Iranian retaliation, ruined the option of future diplomacy, and provoked Iran into developing a nuclear weapon. This is a strategy that has a high chance of exploding at some point — if not now in terms of an Iranian escalation, then in the future in the form of a revitalized nuclear program. And six other big questions about the bombing, explained. Two charts that show how the attack on Minnesota lawmakers is part of a dangerous trend. Donald Trump brings America into Israel's war on Iran. Democrats can no longer paper over their party's core contradiction.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter. • Response to US strikes: Iranian military officials and members of parliament have vowed that the US will pay a price for its strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump alluded to the possibility of regime change in Iran in a social media post Sunday. There has been no word yet from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. • Iran-Israel conflict enters 11th day: Both countries have continued to trade strikes. Israel said it launched an attack at “the heart of Tehran,” including Iran's notorious Evin prison and access routes to the Fordow nuclear facility, while several waves of Iranian missile attacks were reported in Israel. A Doha resident and father of two told CNN that loud explosions rocked the city, but Qatari authorities did not give any warning to citizens to take shelter. “Our kids were totally taken by surprise and didn't know what to do when we scrambled them to shelter. There was no warning from Qatar authorities to take shelter. There appear to be a lot of outgoing fire and intercepts,” he said. Qatar's defense ministry said its air defenses “successfully” intercepted a missile attack targeting the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, adding that the attack did not results in any deaths or injuries. Iran has launched a “powerful and destructive missile attack” on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in response to the US striking its nuclear facilities, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement. “The Islamic Republic of Iran, relying on Almighty God and the faithful, proud people of Iran, will never leave any aggression against its territorial integrity, sovereignty, or national security unanswered,” the statement read. US personnel at the embassies in Qatar and Bahrain are in “duck and cover” positions as Iran launches retaliatory missiles toward Qatar and Iraq, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The US is tracking multiple missiles fired from Iran toward US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, according to two officials familiar with the matter. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine are in the Situation Room, according to a White House official. A senior official said earlier that White House and Defense Department officials were monitoring potential attacks threats to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. An official briefed on the matter also said missiles have been launched by Iran on the US-run Al Udeid Air Base. American officials have been preparing for the likelihood that Iran could target US facilities in the wake of this weekend's strikes. France's foreign minister condemned Israel's strike on Iran's notorious Evin prison, known for housing political prisoners including two French nationals. “The strike aimed at Evin Prison in Tehran put in danger two of our nationals, Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, hostages for the past three years. It's inacceptable,” Jean-Noël Barrot said in a post on X. Kohler, a 40-year-old teacher, was on holiday in Iran with her partner, Jacques Paris, in May 2022 when they were stopped by authorities and arrested on suspicion of espionage. In October 2022, Iranian state television broadcast a forced confession from the pair that saw Kohler unveil herself as an agent working for France's intelligence services, the DGES. French authorities and nongovernmental organizations including Amnesty International have repeatedly said the pair were coerced into making false confessions and have called for their immediate liberation. Barrot said in his social media post Monday he had demanded an update on their safety and called for “consular access as soon as possible.” Moscow's partnership with Tehran is “unbreakable,” Russian's deputy foreign minister said Monday, adding that Iran has the right to self-defense. Iran “is acting within the framework of the implementation of the right to self-defense, this is an absolutely legitimate and correct presentation,” Sergei Ryabkov told reporters, Russian state news agency TASS reported. “We interact with Iran in many areas,” the senior diplomat said, answering a question about whether Iran had requested military assistance from Russia. “It is clear that it would be irresponsible on my part to disclose the content of those contacts that are ongoing, including today, taking into account all the circumstances,” he added. Ryabko's comments come after Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored the Kremlin's support for Tehran earlier in the day during a meeting with Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Moscow. Taking a swipe at the United States' actions, he said: “We see that they are trying to deal with Iran, they are trying, at least, in the language of ultimatums. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran did not start or want war but would not leave what he called “aggression” against the country unanswered. “We will stand by the security of this beloved nation and respond to every wound on Iran's body with faith, wisdom and determination,” he said on X. American officials have been preparing for the likelihood that Iran could target US facilities in the wake of this weekend's strikes. Iran launched several waves of missiles that were reported in Israel. According to Israeli national emergency service MDA, crews have been dispatched to reported impact sites across the country following a barrage of missiles from Iran. Authorities “are closely and continuously monitoring the situation, assessing developments in coordination with regional and international partners,” the statement added. Qatar's airspace shutdown coincides with Iran's threats to retaliate against the United States, following US strikes on its nuclear facilities over the weekend. Citing the US warning earlier Monday, the UK government said in a statement:”Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that British nationals in Qatar shelter in place until further notice,” adding they provide further updates “as the situation develops.” CNN's Andrew Potter and Kara Fox contributed reporting to this post. Iran's air defense systems were activated to intercept “hostile targets” in Ahvaz city, in the southwest region of the country, state-affiliated Fars News Agency reported today. “An explosion was heard in western Ahvaz, outside the urban area, and simultaneously, air defense systems were activated against hostile targets,” Fars said. The state-run IRIB network also reported that Ahvaz's air defenses had been activated, without providing more details. Israel launched a fresh new wave of attacks at the “heart of Tehran” and hit Iran's notorious Evin prison earlier today. More on the prison: Security forces at the Evin detention center are known for their long record of human rights abuses. Political activists, journalists and musicians are among those who have been incarcerated at the facility. The Israeli military attacked Iran's notorious Evin prison on Monday, according to Israel's defense minister and Iranian state news. French national carrier Air France has suspended all scheduled flights to Tel Aviv until July 14, citing the security situation as Iran and Israel continue to trade attacks. Today, Air France flights to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia from Paris were both canceled. Air France said affected customers will be offered the option to postpone their flights or receive a reimbursement. However, that rally proved short-lived as oil futures have since gone into the red. ET, US crude was down about 1% to $73.15 a barrel. Brent, the world benchmark, also fell about 1% after having surged Sunday night. “EVERYONE, KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post as US markets opened on Monday. Each day about 20 million barrels of oil flow through the narrow waterway. “Traders have seen a lot of false alarms when it comes to geopolitical disruption risk in the oil market,” he said. “Unless there's a material interruption in gulf energy, production, or flows, I think any further spikes will be contained.” He still plans to attend the NATO summit in The Hague this week, though two officials cautioned that his travel plans could change if something major arises. Trump also warned “everyone” today to keep oil prices down. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier Monday warned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz — a move that could have disastrous consequences for global oil markets. Yvette Shmilovitz was killed in an attack on the Israeli city of Petah Tikva on June 16, the authorities said in a statement. She is survived by her three granddaughters and four great-grandchildren, authorities said. As of Monday, at least 24 people have been killed in Israel, according to the country's government office. The Israeli military said it has thwarted “dozens” of Iranian drones in recent days using “advanced electronic warfare systems.” The decision by US President Donald Trump to order strikes against three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday sparked a wave of anti-US sentiment in Iran, with many calling for retaliation. Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran 11 days ago and the two countries have been striking each other daily since, leaving hundreds of people dead.</p>

He breaks down whether Clark's rising stardom is making her a target on the court and what it means for her future in the WNBA. An awkward on-air silence occurred during ESPN's broadcast of the Indiana Fever-Las Vegas Aces game on Sunday after analyst Rebecca Lobo said, "That's what makes America great." "They disagree with you," play-by-play announcer Pam Ward said to her partner Lobo. Rebecca Lobo speaks during an event celebrating Connecticut Huskies head coach Geno Auriemma's all-time NCAA basketball wins record at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion on Nov. 20, 2024 in Storrs, Connecticut. "They do, and I disagree with them," Lobo responded. That's what makes America great, right Pam Ward?" After asking that question, there was a long silence between the two before Lobo said, "I should rephrase that," to which Ward responded, "Yes." Ward, then, suggested Lobo say "difference of opinion," which she agreed. She even said "sorry about that" before continuing to call the game. After going 0-for-7 in the loss to the Golden State Valkyries last Thursday, Clark was just 1-for-10 in Las Vegas. Clark went 7-of-20 from the field with four made free throws for a total of 19 points. Meanwhile, three-time league MVP A'ja Wilson and her 24 points for the game started taking over on their home court in crunch time. Teamed up with Jackie Young (19 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals) and Chelsea Gray (18 points, three rebounds, three assists), Wilson and the Aces outscored the Fever 31-20 in the fourth quarter to run away with the victory. While Clark was struggling with her jumper in this game, the Fever were seeing great contributions from the game's leading scorer, Aliyah Boston, who had 26 points on 12-of-19 shooting, and Kelsey Mitchell, who had a big chunk of her 20 points in the fourth quarter to keep Indiana in the game. Former WNBA player and current analyst Rebecca Lobo calls the game on July 25, 2023 at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago. However, after Mitchell's three-pointer tied things at 69 apiece with five minutes to play, the Aces strapped in and started to pull away, thanks to some key baskets from Young, Wilson and Gray.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's strike on Iran, the pushback from both lawmakers and Trump's call for a regime change. The impact of the border crisis under the Biden administration likely added fuel to the fire of an Iranian sleeper cell threat domestically, according to a former top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who briefly led Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Following the strike on Iranian nuclear sites by the U.S. on Saturday, DHS issued a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning about the risk of domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed or inspired perpetrators. "Definitely," former acting ICE director and Fox News contributor Jonathan Fahey said when asked if the Biden border crisis likely made matters worse domestically. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conduct an arrest as part of President Donald Trump's wide-ranging immigration crackdown in Chicago on Jan. 26, 2025. "I think one thing that's really concerning about that: One, they weren't doing any really meaningful vetting in the last administration. The second part of it is, you know, we have probably 2 million known gotaways come through the last administration, and the people that went through the non-ports of entry, we knew they went through but nobody caught them, so we have no idea who went through," he added. Fahey noted that other countries were likely paying close attention to the heavy flow of people crossing into the country illegally. "But the thing that's concerning is all of our adversaries knew at the time that we basically, in all intents and purposes, had an open border. "Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks," it continued. Iranians shout anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli slogans as one of them holds a portrait of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during an anti-Israeli rally to condemn Israeli attacks on Iran, after Tehran's Friday prayers in Tehran, Iran, on June 20, 2025. Other national security experts also doubled down that the releases and gotaways during the Biden administration continued to pose a risk. "We don't know where those thousand Iranians are and who knows how many others got across the border. We missed an opportunity when they caught and released those thousand. We just simply let them go, which is gross negligence on the part of the Biden administration," former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker told Fox News Digital. Border czar Tom Homan also sounded the alarm about gotaways on "Sunday Morning Futures" right after the Iran strikes. "We don't know who they are, where they came from, because they got away because border patrol is so overwhelmed with the humanitarian crisis that Biden created. Over two million people crossed the border and got away. And that's what created the biggest national security vulnerability this country's ever seen," Homan said. When it comes to known releases, the Trump administration released nobody in May, compared with roughly 62,000 releases under the Biden administration last May, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against President Donald Trump bombing the nation's three nuclear sites. The Strait of Hormuz is a key water route for oil and gas, with any disruption likely leading to higher gas prices in the U.S. A quarter of the world's oil passes through the strait, which is roughly 100 miles long and 21 miles wide. The press secretary's comments mirror Secretary of State Marco Rubio‘s statements, also warning Iran against closing the strait. “It's not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change?? ?” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday. Leavitt further explained that Trump was raising questions about the future of Iran if it continues on its quest for nuclear weapons. “The President was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking,” Leavitt explained. “If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks — we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know — but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night.” Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security team later Monday afternoon behind closed doors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tony Illenden crouches outside Northern Illinois University's Husky Hail Hunter to scoop hail into a bag while in a hailstorm during a Project ICECHIP operation Friday, June 6, 2025, in Levelland, Texas. LEVELLAND, Texas (AP) — Dozens of researchers are chasing, driving and running into storms to collect fresh hail, getting their car bodies and their own bodies dented in the name of science. They hope these hailstones will reveal secrets about storms, damage and maybe the air itself. Northern Illinois University's Husky Hail Hunter members Joey Toniolo, right, and Tony Illenden, back left, pick up hail while in a hailstorm during a Project ICECHIP operation Friday, June 6, 2025, near Morton, Texas. It's peak hail season across the Great Plains, and dozens of researchers studying the extreme weather are chasing, driving and running into storms to collect fresh hail. Here's what happens to them after they've been collected. It's pushing midnight on a Friday in a Texas Walmart parking lot, and at least 10 vans full of students and full-time scientists are gathering after several hours of rigorous storm chasing. Hailstones are in coolers in most of these vehicles, and now it's time to put them to the test. So far after more than 13 storms, the biggest they found is 139 millimeters (5.5 inches), the size of a DVD. But on this night they are smaller than golf balls. The hail is put on a vertical device's white holder. Jake Sorber, a meteorologist at the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, squeezes a hand grip about a foot above it and another white block comes crashing down, crushing the ice to smithereens. “That tells us about its strength,” Giammanco said. It's all about trying to get good statistics on how strong the typical hailstone is. On this night, Gaimmanco and colleagues are finding the day's hail is unusually soft. It's surprising, but there's a good theory on what's happening. So we start off with an embryo, and then you've got different growth layers,” said Central Michigan University scientist John Allen. Less cold air from climate change could conceivably mean harder hail in the future, but more research is needed to see if that's the case, Giammanco said. “Damage from a hailstone is not just dependent on how fast and the exact amount of energy it has. It's how strong are these hailstones,″ Giammanco said. ”So a really soft one is not actually going to damage your roof very much, especially an asphalt shingle roof. But a really strong one may crack and tear that asphalt shingle pretty easily.” Mostly researchers grab hail to test after it falls, wearing gloves so as not to warm or taint the ice balls too much. But to collect pristine hail and get it cold as soon as possible, there's SUMHO, a Super Mobile Hail Observatory. Most of these pristine hailstones go directly to a cold lab in Colorado, where they are sliced with a hot wire band saw. Tony Illenden turns to place a bag of hail he collected into a cooler in the backseat of the Northern Illinois University's Husky Hail Hunter during a Project ICECHIP operation Friday, June 6, 2025, in Levelland, Texas. Scientists will also figure out what's in the hail besides water. Past research has found fungi, bacteria, peat moss and microplastics, all of which helps researchers know a bit more about what's in the air that we don't see. After weeks of collecting these ice balls, Central Michigan student Sam Baron sampled the fruit of his labors. “It tastes like an ice cube,” Baron said. “It's like the good ice that they serve at restaurants.” Members of Project ICECHIP gather in the Walmart parking lot to measure, weigh and crush hail during an operation late Friday, June 6, 2025, in Levelland, Texas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The border wall between the US and Mexico is, of course, a barrier meant to prevent human migrants from crossing into America as they seek work, family, or refuge from violence. It's also a significant barrier to ranging wildlife. The border wall, a centerpiece of President Donald Trump's agenda, cuts through a rugged, unique ecosystem home to hundreds of native species, from jaguars and pumas to black bears and deer. We know the wall is impassable for many species, potentially lowering their chance of survival. How exactly the border affects this rich ecosystem, however, has largely been a mystery. A new study, among the first of its kind, finally offers some answers — by essentially spying on animals near the border. For the research, ecologist and lead author Ganesh Marín, then a doctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, set up 85 motion-sensing cameras in northeastern Sonora, Mexico, along and south of the US border in Arizona and New Mexico. Over roughly two years, from 2020 to 2022, the cameras captured hundreds of hours of footage, including more than 21,000 clips with mammals, said Marín, a National Geographic Explorer and postdoctoral scientist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Partners. “This place is so special because you see these tropical species, like ocelots and jaguars, at the same time as beavers and black bears,” Marín told me earlier this year when I was reporting on borderland jaguars. In this clip, for example, a young puma, or mountain lion, makes a chirping sound, likely calling for its mother. Or check out this jaguar approaching the camera. Scientists first detected this cat in 2020 and can identify him by his markings. Marín's cameras detected another jaguar, as well, called Valerio. He was seen by cameras multiple times in a protected area known as Cuenca Los Ojos just south of the border in Sonora. The camera traps caught black bears and their cubs… Marín found that large mammals, such as black bears and deer, as well as some smaller herbivores, spend less time near the border than in other, more remote stretches of his study region. That may be because they have trouble crossing a highway that runs roughly parallel to the border in Sonora, according to Marín and his co-author, John L. Koprowski, a biologist at the University of Wyoming. The study adds to a growing body of research showing that the border and infrastructure around it is disrupting wild animal communities. ﻿The wild reason why bird advocates are releasing these reviled insects from the sky. You may not know about it either, but the program helps keep people — and animals — in good health. What most of us get wrong about animal instincts. This is what happens when you put a clownfish in hot water. Ganaderos han matado jaguares desde hace mucho tiempo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Block Island Wind Farm turbine operates, Dec. 7, 2023, off the coast of Block Island, R.I., during a tour organized by Orsted. Americans' support for green energy tax credits and renewable energies like wind and solar power has decreased in recent years, according to a new poll, driven by a softening in support from Democrats and independents. The poll results coincide with sweeping changes President Donald Trump's Republican administration is making to regulations related to energy and climate change, including slashing the federal workforce in these departments. And although Democrats and independents have weakened their support for some green energy initiatives, there has not been an increase in support for Trump's energy policies. The poll found only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults — including only 1 in 10 Democrats and about 2 in 10 independents, along with three-quarters of Republicans — approve of the way Trump is handling climate change, which largely tracks with his overall approval rating. Only one-quarter of Republicans supported this policy in 2022, and that hasn't changed measurably. “As far as the pollution goes ... the vehicles nowadays put out very little emissions to the air,” said JD Johnson, a 62-year-old Democrat from Meadowview, Virginia, who somewhat opposes tax credits to purchase an electric vehicle. That's partly because he sees the electric vehicle manufacturing process as energy intensive and believes gasoline-powered vehicles have made improvements with the pollutants they emit. “For solar panels, in all honesty, I don't think they're that efficient yet,” said Glenn Savage, 78, a left-leaning independent from Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I'd rather see them pour money into research and try to get the solar panels more efficient before they start giving tax breaks to the public. Scientists say transitioning to renewable energies and ditching fossil fuels that release planet-warming emissions are essential to protect the planet. Billions of dollars in project grants for clean technologies awarded during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration have been canceled by the Trump administration, and the offshore wind sector has been stunted by Trump's executive order that paused approvals, permits and loans for wind energy projects. When people are concerned about the economy and their personal finances, environmental issues are sometimes prioritized less, said Talbot Andrews, an assistant professor in the department of government at Cornell University who was not involved in the poll. “I think it makes people anxious to think about increased taxes or increased spending on environmental issues when the cost of eggs are going through the roof,” Andrews said. Despite a decline in support for expanded renewable energies, the new poll shows that only about one-third of U.S. adults think offshore drilling for oil and natural gas should be expanded in the U.S., and only about one-quarter say this about coal mining. In both cases, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to support expanding these energy sources. Trump has sought to open up national monuments for oil drilling, but more U.S. adults oppose than support auctioning off more public space for oil drilling. Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults favor this, while 4 in 10 are opposed. Republicans are much more likely than independents or Democrats to be in support. The blue and white logo is well recognized, and experts say the program has long had bipartisan support until recently. The poll found three-quarters of Democrats support providing consumer rebates for efficient home appliances, compared with 6 in 10 Republicans. Patrick Buck, 54, from Chicago, describes himself as a liberal Republican and is a fan of the consumer rebates for energy-efficient appliances. “It seems to work in terms of transforming what people have in their houses, because a lot of people have a lot of old appliances and just can't afford new ones,” he said. The Trump administration has announced plans to roll back rules and policies related to limiting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, such as rules that limit pollution from power plants and blocking California's efforts to phase out cars that run on gas. The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO members are bending over backward to get in President Donald Trump‘s good graces ahead of a summit that will invite questions about how much they contribute to their own self-defense. But after Trump's abrupt departure from last week's G7 summit in Canada, new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the former Dutch prime minister, is not relying on defense targets alone to please the president. Rutte, for example, has implemented Department of Government Efficiency-like spending cuts at NATO that echo the Pentagon‘s own efforts to streamline operations. Although most NATO secretary generals try to introduce reforms, there is “definitely” a sense of urgency this year because of Trump, according to Kathleen McInnis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It's safe to say that the NATO headquarters is taking a hard look at efficiencies because they want to make sure, be able to make the case to not just President Trump, but other heads of state and government, that they are being wise and efficient with the allocation of resources for NATO common budgets, and the headquarters, and things like that,” McInnis told the Washington Examiner. The concluding communique, too, is expected to be similarly short at only five paragraphs and will emphasize defense spending and Russia as a “direct threat,” but not a pathway to membership for Ukraine. NATO leaders, more broadly, have a strong sense of how the summit will go under Trump, given this will be his fifth as president. “This will be the fifth time we have watched this movie,” said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, so “there's some understanding about what his priorities are.” There will be practical consequences for Ukraine after Trump did not meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky last week during the G7. That directive has since been delayed because of disagreements over how to deal with the Kremlin. On the conflict with Russia and Ukraine's aspirations of joining NATO, Rizzo conceded: “Looking back at last year's summit, where the statement was that Ukraine's bridge to NATO is going to be short and well lit — well, it seems like that bridge is actually very long and dimly lit.” Max Bergmann, the director for CSIS's Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program, downplayed concerns about Trump's commitment to NATO and multilateralism after his early departure last week from the G7, arguing “Europeans were already rattled” following statements from the administration on its desire to deprioritize Europe and NATO from the likes of Vice President JD Vance. “Trump's departure from the G7 was sort of seen as perhaps necessary, given the events in Iran, but also a sign of Trump not caring that much,” Bergmann told the Washington Examiner during a briefing call with his think tank. At the same time, there are hopes that Trump's expressions of frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead him to drive a harder line with the Kremlin, particularly as momentum builds in the Senate for sanctions on Moscow. “The fact is, unless Putin can pull off a miracle and prove to Trump that he can give the Americans everything they want out of Iran without going to war, Trump will still be pulled back along with the American Senate and others into a confrontational relationship with Vladimir Putin,” said Benjamin Jensen, director of the CSIS Futures Lab. “But I think it's better to really look at those larger structural conditions and the fact that even a smaller U.S. presence with intelligence support, long-range fires, and logistics still will help — with the new defense plans that were developed — Europe defend itself against an emboldened Russia.” Under that framework, NATO member states are working together to build their domestic industrial bases, encourage coproduction, and share best practices to spend 3.5% on hard defense capabilities, with the remaining 1.5% to be spent on other security-related needs and so-called “resilience” costs. Examples related to infrastructure are constructing bridges that can withstand the weight of tanks, cybersecurity, and space. While Estonia, Greece, Poland, Turkey, and the U.S. are already close to spending 3.5% of their GDP on hard defense capabilities, Spain has undermined the 3.5% proposal, with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez advising his counterparts last week that his country “cannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP.” “This effort builds on the hundreds of billions of dollars in spending increases already achieved across the alliance since 2017 thanks to President Trump's diplomacy in his first term,” the administration official told reporters during a press call.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? No, this is another, much less-known example of massive growth these past several years. The surge is, by all accounts, due to a regulation that took effect in 2021 focused on groups called organ procurement organizations (OPOs). For some time now, critics have argued that OPOs are massively underusing deceased donor organs. One report from 2019 estimated that every year 28,000 usable organs (mostly badly needed kidneys but also pancreata, hearts, livers, etc.) are removed from deceased donors but never used; another put the number at 75,000. This, when the national waitlist for organs is more than 100,000 people long. OPOs are not paid to collect these organs per se: They are entitled to 100 percent reimbursement of costs they report related to retrieving, preserving, and delivering organs, with ultimate payment coming from Medicare or transplant centers (which in turn charge Medicare and other insurers). This system, critics have long charged, does not provide enough incentive to procure harder-to-retrieve organs from patients who may be older or have certain medical conditions. To get OPOs to collect more organs, the Trump administration in 2019 issued an executive order calling for new rules governing how the organizations are certified by the federal government, rules that were finalized two years later. This was high stakes: If an OPO loses certification, it has to shut down, and another OPO gets its territory. In addition to organs recovered from deceased donors and transplanted, pancreata recovered and used for research would count toward recertification as well. I've long been fascinated by this trend, which OPO critics call the “pancreas loophole” and OPO defenders describe as a perfectly legal response to overly onerous regulations. The numbers represent thousands of real, physical human pancreata, taken from real, recently deceased donors, that wouldn't have been taken from those bodies without this regulation. I've tried in recent months to make sense of how this happened, and what it means. There is still plenty that remains unknown about the fate of these pancreata (if you work at an OPO or research center and know more details, please email me). Its basic purpose is to excrete enzymes, hormones, and other compounds to both 1) help the body digest food and 2) regulate blood sugar levels. The latter function is performed by the islets of Langerhans, cells in the pancreas (named after their discoverer, 19th-century German researcher Paul Langerhans) that secrete two different hormones: insulin (to lower blood sugar) and glucagon (to raise it). In Type 1 diabetes, the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin is impaired and thus blood sugar levels are dangerously elevated; in some kinds of Type 2 diabetes, the body develops resistance to insulin's effects. Typically, people with diabetes deal with this through injecting insulin directly, a process that has become much more sophisticated in recent decades as finger pricks and needles have given way to insulin pumps that can directly measure and adjust blood sugar levels. But even with advanced care, diabetes carries lifelong medical consequences, so researchers have long sought a more permanent fix: What if you could replace or supplement the faulty islet cells in patients with diabetes with healthy islet cells? This is a proven treatment (915 occurred in 2023) and when done it works well, essentially curing the recipient's diabetes. But there are major downsides: you have to undertake major abdominal surgery with a small but real chance of failure, and if that succeeds, you have to remain on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of your life to prevent organ rejection. For that reason, physicians generally rule that the costs of a pancreas transplant outweigh the benefits for most people with diabetes. Living with an insulin pump is better than risking surgery and having a permanently compromised immune system. Very few of the 38 million Americans living with diabetes, then, are going to be candidates for a pancreas transplant. This math changes, however, if the patient in question also needs a kidney transplant. In these cases, since the patient is already going to have surgery and be on immunosuppressants, throwing in a new pancreas to the surgery and curing their diabetes in the same operation that cures their kidney failure begins to look like an attractive option. It's far less invasive, and can be done with local anesthesia and without an overnight hospital stay (though, skeptics argue, often less effective than whole pancreas transplantation too). If the islet cells come from a deceased donor, it does mean a lifetime of immunosuppression, but in “autograft” procedures, which use a subset of still-healthy islets from one's own impaired pancreas, immunosuppression isn't necessary. Islet cell transplantation, though, remains little-used and mostly experimental in the US. Part of the reason why is regulatory: While pancreases are legally “organs,” and therefore excluded from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA has asserted its authority to also regulate islet cells as human tissues and to require premarket approval before they can be transplanted into a patient, just like a drug would. FDA's requirements have unsurprisingly slowed the islet cell transplant field down. In 2012, 111 were performed, but the number has steadily fallen ever since. It's orders of magnitude rarer than a whole-pancreas transplant. But islet cell transplants have some champions, including politicians. In 2004, Congress passed, and George W. Bush signed, the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act. It was sponsored by Rep. George Nethercutt Jr. (R-WA), who said he was driven by his daughter's diabetes to try to expand access to islet cell transplants so patients could “live without being dependent on insulin injections.” Nethercutt's bill sought to speed up research progress by, among other measures, ensuring adequate supply of pancreata for scientists. The law includes a provision stating, “Pancreata procured by an organ procurement organization and used for islet cell transplantation or research shall be counted for purposes of certification or recertification.” That meant that when regulators in 2019 were reconfiguring certification rules for OPOs to encourage them to effect more transplants, they had to include a carve-out for pancreata used for islet cell research. That rule's changes applied for evaluations of organ procurement organizations starting in August 2022. In the years 2018 through 2021, OPOs collected around 500–600 pancreata for research each year. It's important to note that there are no indications that the pancreata being collected by OPOs for research are cutting into the supply of pancreata for donation. The share of dead people whose pancreata are suitable for transplant is incredibly low, because of the exacting standards for donor age and health. “Only a certain number of donors are going to be young enough (probably less than 50, maybe less than 45) and lean enough (maybe less than 30 BMI, probably less than 27 or 28),” Jonathan Fridell, a transplant surgeon and director of the pancreas transplant program at IU Health in Indianapolis, told me. “We're still going to look at the people that are older, still look at the people that are heavier, but the likelihood that they're going to have a transplantable pancreas is lower.” There are thus plenty of non-transplantable pancreata left over that could be used for research once the prime ones are taken away for surgery. The problem with the surge in research pancreata, then, isn't that it's taking pancreata away from recipients who need them. By racking up large numbers of pancreata for research, OPOs are improving the grades they receive from federal regulators, and avoiding the risk of losing certification and having to turn over territory to another OPO. But the research pancreata provide a way around that incentive. Using data obtained from the organ procurement transplant network, we are able to calculate which tier each OPO would be in with and without their research pancreata based on their performance in 2023. The year that is actually binding for OPOs and determines whether they will be decertification is 2024, for which data does not yet exist, but the 2023 data gives us some indication of which OPOs are using pancreata to save themselves. For two OPOs, including research pancreata meant they went from tier 3, which would result in decertification, to tier 2: Donor Network of Arizona, which covers that whole state; and OneLegacy, which includes most of Southern California including Los Angeles and Orange counties. Another, Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates, went from tier 2, where it could face pressure to improve performance, to tier 1, suggesting it excels. Its CEO, Prasad Garimella, earned $1.1 million in total compensation in 2023, the last year for which public IRS filings are available. An over fivefold increase, in one year — and no wonder, given its existence was at stake. (In response to a request for comment, OneLegacy stated, “When recovering organs for transplant, OneLegacy will allocate pancreata to reputable islet cell research agencies only if they are not viable for transplant into patients. Over 99.6% of pancreata recovered by OneLegacy for research between 2018-2022 were allocated to two National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIH-NIDDK) laboratories.”) But unless something changes with the way the government evaluates these pancreata, some major OPOs will avoid dire consequences for the sole reason that they started collecting hundreds of pancreata for research. And what are you going to do about it? In a listserv thread discussing the new rules, leaked to the Senate Finance Committee, an OPO employee wrote, “If you have a donor with only a pancreas for research, that is an organ donor for the Donor Rate. OPOs ought to start a pancreas for research program immediately.” But there's a question that remains unanswered: Where did all these thousands of pancreata go? It is clear that the vast majority of research pancreata did not go into islet transplants. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asks OPOs for data on organs recovered every year, and in August 2024 clarified that it would only count pancreata as “‘used' for research if they are accepted for use in bona fide islet cell research conducted by a qualified researcher, such as research approved by the National Institutes of Health.” It then asked OPOs to resubmit their data, clarifying which organs were for islet cell research specifically. Once they did, the number of reported pancreata fell dramatically: Some OPOs, like Legacy of Hope in Alabama, now reported zero pancreata for research; before the guidance narrowed qualifying purposes, Legacy of Hope had claimed 226 pancreata. But even after the change in guidance, we're left with smaller numbers that are still much too big to be explained by bona fide islet cell transplants. There simply were not 1,812 islet cell transplants in the US in 2023, but there were 1,812 pancreata credited as donated for islet cell research. Research by David Goldberg, Erin Tewksbury, and Matthew Wadsworth has shown that the number of pancreata reported as recovered by OPOs also swamps the number that the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP), a consortium that collects and extracts islet cells from pancreata, reports receiving from these OPOs. The main answer they received was “we don't know.” In other words, OPOs themselves don't keep track. “Many of these OPOs,” the report continues, “have sent pancreata to biobanks and other institutions or facilities that hold pancreata for an unknown period to be used for purposes that may be undefined or nonexistent.” Put another way: These pancreata could, for all the OPOs or the Senate knows, be sitting on a freezer somewhere, not transplanted into anyone. Greg Segal, an activist advocating for reform to the pancreas loophole, testified before a House committee that staff at one OPO, joked “that they're conducting research on the efficacy of garbage disposal A versus garbage disposal B” when disposing of pancreata. “When CMS issued clarifying guidance in 2024 limiting this metric to pancreata used for islet cell research, OPOs responded immediately and worked with the agency to validate data and ensure compliance.” Jedd Lewis, CEO of the Organ Preservation Alliance and a decades-long veteran of the transplant field, notes that CMS's rule neglected to define what it means to use a pancreas for research, despite many OPOs and industry experts specifically flagging the problem for CMS before that rule took effect. And CMS's new guidance last year did little to solve the problem, he argues. “Last years' memos simply identified the scope of pancreas donations that OPOs would be judged on as those for ‘islet cell research.' But CMS didn't define what that actually means …and on its face it's a huge scope of research,” Lewis wrote in an email. “There are so many … ways that researchers are looking at how those cells function: studying the pancreas whole, slicing it into thin sections, isolating the individual islet cells, even breaking the cells into the component parts.” That's all valuable research, he argues, and clearly relates to islet cells, even if the pancreata are never actually used in islet cell transplants. Wadsworth, a coauthor on the study finding a surge in research pancreata and CEO of the LifeConnection OPO in northwest Ohio, concedes that counting pancreata that did not produce islet cells for transplant may technically be legal. “I worked with this surgeon early on in my career who said ‘just because you can do something doesn't mean you should,' Wadsworth noted. LifeConnection, Wadsworth says, was able to comply with the spirit of the CMS regulations by finding counties in its jurisdiction where low numbers of organs were being procured, and working on fixing the problem hospital-by-hospital. One irony of the controversy is that most OPOs, and their representatives, don't believe that research pancreata should count for their evaluations. Inclusion of pancreata for research in the data utilized for the numerator may skew comparisons of OPOs in that category and potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions.” But both the OPOs and their regulator, CMS, were bound by the 2004 law requiring that research pancreata, at least that for islet cell research, must count for these evaluations. We are running out of time to fix this problem. If nothing changes, OPOs will be evaluated on the basis of data they've submitted now, including hundreds of pancreata that were never used for islet cell transplants. Whether you think that reflects OPOs complying in good faith, or subverting the system, it's not a policy anyone should think makes much sense. Simply repealing the provision restricting how OPOs can be evaluated would be simplest — but even better would be pairing it with a legal change that could help islet transplantation research far more than the 2004 has to date. They count as treatments with biological tissue ““If islet cells are solely organs, because they are a subpart of the pancreas, which is an organ under transplant law, then the FDA should not have jurisdiction,” Gail Javitt, a veteran lawyer working on FDA regulatory issues at the firm Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, told me. Legally clarifying that islet cells are organs, not cellular therapies, and that they are excluded from FDA oversight then, could go a long way to promoting the treatment. Last Congress, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rep. Matthew Rosendale (R-MT) each introduced bills making this change, with exclusively Republican co-sponsors. But this need not be a partisan issue at all, and if you paired this provision with a repeal of the 2004 law permitting OPOs to count pancreata for research as part of its transplant metrics, you could arrive at a close to ideal system. They would not be able to get higher ratings by recovering pancreata for research that might just languish on a shelf. This does require Congress to make a small change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressional Democrats and some Republicans have cried foul over President Donald Trump's ordered bombing of Iran‘s nuclear facilities on Saturday. Graham justified his decision Sunday in an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC's Meet the Press. “What do you say to your fellow members of Congress who say that President Trump should have gotten congressional approval before taking this action?” Welker asked. “No, he was within his Article II authority,” Graham replied. “Congress can declare war or cut off funding. We can't be the commander in chief. Graham said Congress could vote to eliminate funding for the president's actions but noted that it is the president's discretion to make such a decision. He also highlighted that other presidents made similar decisions regarding bombings and that when it comes to military actions, Congress is responsible for declaring war. “If you don't like what the president does in terms of war, you can cut off the funding,” Graham said. We've declared war five times in the history of America. Welker referenced previous military conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, when presidents sought congressional authority. Graham rationalized that those were different and referenced recent times in which the president authorized military strikes without asking for congressional authority. “Well, there's a lot of actions where the president didn't go to Congress,” Graham told Welker. “This was something that had to be done quietly. When asked about “boots on the ground,” Graham dismissed such a thought and said he believed it would not come to that. Rather than the U.S. deploying its own troops, Graham predicted a persistent Israeli military offensive. “Israel is not going to live this way anymore. They're going to go after the heart of this regime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The administration is relying on the president's authority under Article II of the Constitution, two senior administration officials told CNN, which says he has power to direct US military forces in engagements necessary to advance American national interests abroad. The administration relied, in part, on memos about war powers written by the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel under previous administrations of both parties. “The president is clearly well within his Article II powers here,” one former senior US official told CNN. But that's not a view held by many legal experts or universally endorsed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers, who point to the Constitution's unambiguous statement that only Congress can declare war, the absence of a law akin to the Iraq War-era Authorization for Use of Military Force and — critically — a lack of an imminent threat to the United States. Related article How Trump quietly made the historic decision to launch strikes in Iran In 1973, responding to the disastrous war in Vietnam, Congress overrode President Richard Nixon's veto to pass an important piece of legislation, the War Powers Resolution, that sought to rein in presidents regarding the use of military force. “The War Powers Act requires advance consultation with Congress, ‘whenever possible,' before entering US troops into hostilities,” Somin added. The Supreme Court has been generous in approving Trump's expansive use of power, most notably its immunity ruling last year. That view has also contributed to the analysis, a senior White House official said. “This isn't some technical rulemaking,” said Chris Anders, senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “If applied to Iran,” Anders said, it wouldn't meet that test. “The use of bombing runs against facilities that have been standing there for years, perhaps decades, and were not about to be part of a sudden attack on the United States.” A senior Justice Department official said if this conflict continues for an extended period, the administration may have to go to Congress for approval, but maintained that “bombing three nuclear sites” does not rise to the level of needing congressional approval. Bush's use of force against Panama to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega, President Barack Obama's use of air strikes in Libya and Trump's actions in his first term against Syria and Iran. “The commander in chief can take actions to protect American interests around the world,” John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, told CNN. “They've been threatening our forces in the region for years.” Related article Hegseth and Caine play dueling roles as key architects of Iran strike The Trump White House has relied less on those experts than previous administrations, current and former US officials say. His Justice Department has previously broadly embraced the idea of wide presidential power. Enforcing anything against Trump may be impossible through the legal system, as courts have been skeptical of who has the right to sue him and whether such debates should be left for the political branches to address. If they were to bring a lawsuit, the courts would not intervene,” Bolton said. Bipartisan concerns, however, won't move the needle on their own without help from leadership, which is unlikely based on Saturday's comments from House Speaker Mike Johnson. “The President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight's necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties,” Johnson said in a social media post. Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are seeking to reassert Congress' authority over military action with a co-sponsored war powers resolution. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said on “Fox News Sunday” that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing for a vote “as soon as possible” on a resolution so “all members of the Senate have to declare whether or not the US should be at war with Iran.” Related article Trump administration briefed top Republicans before Iran strikes, but not Democrats Some lawmakers and legal experts are looking at the second Iraq War as precedent for congressional action — and also a warning to review the intelligence. “We are in yellowcake uranium-land,” a former national security official said, referring to botched intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Democratic and Republican administrations have repeatedly stretched the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which authorized the Iraq War, as legal authority for military action in locations outside of Iraq. An earlier AUMF that authorized action against al Qaeda and associated groups also has been used beyond what was conceived in the post-9/11 era. “But that was when Congress took its constitutional and institutional responsibilities seriously.” The ACLU's Anders says there's still time for Congress to act on a bipartisan basis, suggesting public hearings to air the Trump administration's military and legal justifications. Congress could also look at restricting funds for such actions without its buy-in. “One advantage that comes to the executive branch when it goes to Congress and asks for authorization that there's a clear examination of what the United States is getting into, so there's much more of a national buy-in,” Anders said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When a crowd rushed at the gunman to try to stop him from shooting, he then detonated his explosive device, killing himself and others at the church while wounding dozens more, according to the Associated Press. No group or organization has claimed responsibility for the attack as of Sunday. “A suicide attacker affiliated with the Daesh (IS) terrorist group entered the Saint Elias church in the Dweila area of the capital Damascus where he opened fire, then blew himself up with an explosive belt,” according to a statement from Syria's interior ministry. Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa called the attack cowardly and said that it ran counter to the virtues that bring people together. “This cowardly act goes against the civic values that brings us together,” Mostafa said. According to eyewitnesses of the attack, at least two other people were involved. “We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.” “On behalf of @POTUS and the American people, we would like to express our condolences to the victims, families, and individuals impacted by the terrorist attack today at Mar Elias church in al-Duwaileh,” said Tom Barrack, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy for Syria, in a social media post on X. On behalf of @POTUS and the American people, we would like to express our condolences to the victims, families, and individuals impacted by the terrorist attack today at Mar Elias church in al-Duwaileh. These terrible acts of cowardice have no place in the new tapestry of… “These terrible acts of cowardice have no place in the new tapestry of integrated tolerance and inclusion that Syrians are weaving,” he added. “We continue to support the Syrian government as it fights against those who are seeking to create instability and fear in their country and the broader region.” Geir O. Pedersen, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, expressed “outrage at this heinous crime” and categorized it as a terrorist attack on the church.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — At 4-foot-11, Kristin Chenoweth always wanted to play basketball. Chenoweth's performance aired live on ABC shortly before tipoff of the season's final game. “Let me just say, if they had anxiety medication for Thunder fans, I'd be taking it,” Chenoweth, dressed in a Thunder sweatshirt, told The Associated Press after her soundcheck at the arena on Sunday. Chenoweth's Thunder fandom has been no secret since the franchise's early years, though she also has professed at times to liking the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks as well. That said, the Thunder are clearly her top choice — so much so that she once told the Tulsa World she spent three hours bedazzling a Thunder hat. She went to Oklahoma City University after growing up in Broken Arrow, about 115 miles northeast of where the Thunder play. She even dressed the pup up once in a Thunder outfit. “I was a cheerleader in high school in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and I loved football, but my favorite was basketball. I like how much of a team player you've got to be. Chenoweth has sung the anthem at a few Thunder games in the past, sometimes alone and at least once with children from her Chenoweth Broadway Bootcamp. That camp is part of the arts and education fund that she founded to cultivate “young artistic expression by enriching children's lives through the power of education, entertainment and experience.” “I've had some pretty big moments in my life in the entertainment field, but this one, I don't know why, makes me nervous,” Chenoweth said. “I just am very honored that they asked. I mean, we have come so far. Of course I want us to win. But the NBA didn't hire me for this, so I'm Thundering it up.” And the anthem — which the soprano finished with her own flair — is a tough song to perform, she said. Singing the words written by Francis Scott Key about the defense of Fort McHenry is a duty she takes seriously. “Actually thinking about what he saw, it's really important for me to remember the words and talk about what they meant then and what they mean to us now,” Chenoweth said. And in 2009, she won an Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy series for her work on ABC's “Pushing Daisies.” She returns to Broadway this fall, playing Jackie Siegel in ”The Queen of Versailles.” “I still have the desire,” Chenoweth said. “I think really what inspires me lately is young talent. And there's nothing better than watching a budding talent whether it's basketball or a singer, an artist, it's my jam.</p>
