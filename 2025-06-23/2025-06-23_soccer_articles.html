                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's military action raises questions for football body Infantino and council to decide if Iran can play in Mexico There are no provisions within Fifa's regulations to prevent Iran from playing their group matches in the US, despite the country being subject to military action by the Trump administration and Iranian citizens being under a travel ban that prevents them from entering the country. The ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A could Iran avoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico. If Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow. Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.</p>

Group B leaders Botafogo, fresh off a shocking win over Paris Saint-Germain, are riding high with momentum. On the other side, anything less than a win for Atletico Madrid, and their tournament dreams are done. Led by a relentless midfield and a backline that can frustrate even the flashiest of attacks, Atletico will look to impose their physical style early and disrupt Botafogo's rhythm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are back in action Monday night with a chance to advance to the FIFA Club World Cup knockout stage. Messi is expected to play as Inter Miami faces Brazilian club Palmeiras at Hard Rock Stadium, with one foot practically in the next round. Inter Miami can advance with a win, draw or a loss – but would need some help with the latter option. Also playing at the same time in Group A: FC Porto (Portugal) vs. Al Ahly (Egypt) at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. If Inter Miami concludes the group stage with a win or draw against Palmeiras, both clubs will advance to the Round of 16. Stay tuned here for live updates from USA TODAY Sports during both Group A matches. The Inter Miami-Palmeiras match is available on TBS and TruTV in English, and available to live stream on DAZN. The Porto-Al Ahly match is also available to live stream on DAZN. His status will be confirmed when Inter Miami announces its starting lineup an hour before the match. Botafogo plays Atletico Madrid, while Paris Saint-Germain will face MLS side Seattle Sounders at 3 p.m. We'll have the results of those matches here, when they conclude. Botafogo leads the group, while PSG and Atletico each have three points through two games.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stevie Nicol believes fans are struggling to back the Club World Cup as attendances remain relatively low. Thirty-two teams from practically every continent on the planet -- from River Plate in South America to Urawa Red Diamonds in Asia -- would test their mettle against the presumed European heavyweights. Meanwhile, the three World Cup hosts face off in their final competitive matches before next summer's extravaganza. Both competitions were expected to serve as a dry run for next summer's main event, giving organizers plenty of data, the better to discern dos and don'ts. If these tournaments were designed to give fans a veritable buffet of club and international competition, the early signs are that there is a point where U.S. spectators push themselves away from the table and say, "I've had enough." And with teams playing more matches than ever before, the players might not have a great appetite for yet another competition after a grueling 2024-25 club season. While a match between reigning UEFA Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain and LaLiga's Atlético Madrid drew 80,619 fans to Pasadena's Rose Bowl, an evening encounter involving South Korean side Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa drew a paltry 3,412 fans to Orlando's Inter&Co Stadium. Even better-attended games have suffered from poor optics. A match between Chelsea and LAFC drew 22,137 fans who were all but swallowed up in Atlanta's 71,000-capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On Thursday, FIFA announced an average attendance of 34,773. The Gold Cup has had its share of poorly attended games as well. A doubleheader involving Haiti and Saudi Arabia, followed by a match between Costa Rica and Suriname, drew just 7,736 fans to San Diego's Snapdragon Stadium. Games involving the USMNT, which Concacaf usually counts on to bolster attendance, haven't gotten fans excited either. The match between the U.S. and Trinidad and Tobago drew just 12,610 on a picture-perfect afternoon at San Jose's PayPal Park. Thursday's USMNT match in Austin, Texas against Saudi Arabia drew even fewer; just 11,727. Keep in mind that these numbers are "tickets distributed" and don't necessarily reflect the number of actual fans in the venue. But what about for the rest of football? Is it simply a case of an oversaturated market? Or could it be that the U.S. market is simply not buying what FIFA and Concacaf are selling? With additional reporting by Lizzy Becherano, Rob Dawson, Cesar Hernandez, Gab Marcotti and James Olley. The Club World Cup might have "World Cup" right there in the name, but make no mistake, this competition lacks the two characteristics that make FIFA's showpiece quadrennial event an "I remember when ..." cultural phenomenon: history and cachet. So iconic is the Jules Rimet trophy to sporting culture that it's been stolen. The Club World Cup has been in existence for only 25 years, and up until this summer, it was an annual event pitting each continent's champions against one another; and with European clubs winning 16 of 20 of those editions, it began to feel like a glorified midseason training camp for the Champions League holders. The expansion of the field to 32 clubs changes that calculus, but the overarching sentiment remains: this is not a competition that players grew up dreaming of playing in, nor is it one that shaped viewers' fandom. And when tickets to the Club World Cup are priced like they're tickets to the World Cup, it shouldn't come as a surprise that stadiums are bereft of all but the most die-hard of fans. High-profile coaches and players including Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Erling Haaland, Kevin De Bruyne and Robert Lewandowski, have raised concerns over the demands being placed on players by the tournament after a long season. The interest from broadcasters and sponsors was tepid. FIFA eventually got what it wanted: a $1 billion broadcast rights fee from DAZN and a $1 billion prize money package that was so large clubs couldn't say no. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Several ESPN writers covering the tournament noted a lack of signage promoting the competition in host cities, and few have managed to find sports bars airing games. There is also an acknowledgment from the tournament organizers that they are competing against some heavyweight U.S. sports. There was golf's U.S. Open on opening weekend, then hockey's Stanley Cup Final, and also the NBA Finals. In terms of soccer, MLS is on a 10-day pause to mark the start of the Club World Cup but will return to action this week, while the NWSL's regular season only just went on hiatus to observe the Women's Euros. This made planning around the games a challenge, and left FIFA making some uncomfortable tradeoffs. Because FIFA wanted matches to be broadcast in primetime in Europe and Africa, half of the 48 group-stage games had kickoff times of 3 p.m. local time or earlier, with 17 of those 24 matches happening on weekdays. There is also the question of whether to stage matches in smaller, soccer-specific stadiums or larger venues. Yet there is an admission on FIFA's part that more needs to go into reaching out to local markets. James Olley reacts to Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC at the Club World Cup. Then there's the presence of agents from Customs and Border Protection. CBP posted on social media saying it would be "suited and booted" at the tournament opener between Inter Miami and Al Ahly, only for the post to eventually be taken down, but CBP said it would be providing security at the Club World Cup. The Inter Miami supporters group The Siege canceled its pregame tailgate, stating that the "mixed messaging makes it hard for us to promote a gathering in good conscience; knowing rights could be potentially infringed." FIFA utilized a concept called dynamic pricing that measures demand from fans to help set prices. If demand is high, the price goes up. Count FIFA president Gianni Infantino as a fan. But what Infantino is overlooking is that it leaves fans who paid a premium feeling like they've been duped. FIFA entered into a partnership with Miami-Dade College that provided faculty and students a promotion for the Miami-Al Ahly game. With the purchase of one $20 ticket, individuals with the MDC code could receive up to four complimentary tickets. The Seattle Sounders tried to placate fans who paid full freight during a pre-sale period by giving them two free tickets to their match against Botafogo, but not every fan was so fortunate. One FIFA source said that part of the reason why crowds have looked sparse at kickoff is that fans are waiting until the last minute to buy tickets, when prices would go down. The atmosphere was good, too," said one club official from a participating team. "It is different from when we've been on tours, and I think that has to do with how they distributed the tickets. "People see big crowds at U.S. sporting events -- the NFL, the NBA, whatever -- but they often don't realize a lot of work goes into it. Matches featuring the tournament's lightweights tend to draw poorly, which is why the Gold Cup makes heavy use of doubleheaders. Concacaf has already distributed nearly 50,000 tickets to the final. FIFA and Concacaf engaged in some collaboration in terms of venues, hence the segmentation that saw most Club World Cup games held on the east coast while the Gold Cup matches took place mostly in the central and pacific time zones. Concacaf also uses dynamic pricing, although its effectiveness is an open question. In terms of pricing, Concacaf uses several criteria, including demand, competition, participating federations and day of the week, among others. When asked if Concacaf was concerned about the attendance for the U.S. matches, a Concacaf spokesperson said via email, "We thank all fans who have come out to support their national teams in the 2025 Gold Cup opening games." He pointed to a "huge saturation of soccer" that is dividing fans' attention. "We've heard from members how expensive prices have gotten at an event like the Gold Cup," Wurm said. "And I think that definitely is keeping some people away. We are working with U.S. Soccer on some things to try and lower prices, and we're always working towards advocating for that. But yeah, the cost is obviously a barrier. I mean, the cost of everything has gone up so much recently that you have less wiggle room for an expense like that." Whitney Zaleski, who helps with operations for the American Outlaws, added, "There's so much soccer going on, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just kind of is what it is at this point. Leading up into the World Cup, we're just going to keep getting busier." This summer is perfectly illustrating the point at which American fans can't consume all of that soccer and start picking and choosing where to invest their time and money.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All four teams can still qualify for last 16 Joao Neves finds himself in space after the cross from Achraf Hakimi but he just can't get enough purchase on the ball. Atletico's corner causes havoc in the box and Giuliano Simeone's strike is well saved by the chest of John. Changes for Seattle as Ryan Kent and Jesus Ferreira make way for Danny Musovski and Kalani Kossa-Rienzi. PSG do step on it with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia sprinting down the left wing to then find Desire Doue in the box. You expect him to bury his effort but it's a fine block. PSG are coasting through this game with their one goal lead at the moment. You get the feeling they could double that lead if they decide to up the intensity. Giuliano Simeone is tripped in the box but he stays on his feet. If he goes down there then the referee has a decision to make. Antoine Griezmann tries to play a give-and-go with Rodrigo de Paul but the Argentine just couldn't quite find the return pass. A corner for Atletico now after some strong defending from Alexander Barboza but John punches clear. The Ligue 1 champions win a corner early in this second half and Nuno Mendes' delivery ends in a free-kick for Seattle. An attacking change for Atletico at the break as Conor Gallagher makes way for Antoine Griezmann. Both sets of players are out on the pitch as they second half is moments away from getting going. For those of you interested, here is how Group B looks at the end of the first half. "The pitches aren't great at all. It holds the ball up," said Bellingham. It's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully it's something that someone will look at, going into next year." Let's see how the two pitches are tonight. All square at the break as Atletico require three to go through.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You may think that this Club World Cup is an American affair. Seventy of these — 14 per cent — were from Brazil. Some countries sell oil, grain or circuit boards to the wider world; Brazil exports footballers. This, though, is only a footnote to the bigger story. The four Brazilian teams have played eight matches between them so far. They have won six of these, drawn two and lost zero. Each tops their group after two rounds of games. It's not because they've only had easy fixtures, either. “No one has defended better against us this season,” an admiring Luis Enrique, PSG's head coach, said after that match. The results have been greeted with a mixture of humour and excitement back in Brazil. “The Europeans are sending a petition to FIFA,” went one typically catty gag doing the rounds on Brazilian WhatsApp. Writing in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, former Brazil international Tostao — usually a fairly sober observer of the game — allowed himself to dream, just for a sentence: “Can you imagine the euphoria and pride if a Brazilian team ends up becoming champion?”. Take a long view of football history and this may appear quite normal. When FIFA first dreamt up expanding that fixture into a Club World Cup in 2000, Brazil's representatives continued to thrive. The next two trophies went to Sao Paulo and Internacional. In 2010, Internacional were knocked out by Congolese side TP Mazembe. Santos were hammered by Barcelona a year later. Gremio, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Fluminense have all lost to European teams in the final. Before this current tournament began, no Brazilian club had beaten a European side in a competitive match since 2012, when Corinthians famously overturned Chelsea in the Club World Cup final. You could write a book on the factors underpinning that drift. The short version is that European football — the top leagues at least — left the Brazilian domestic game behind in a number of areas, from commercialisation and investment to infrastructure and tactical innovation. It is no coincidence that Brazil's most recent World Cup win came in 2002. In the first instance, a little context is probably due before we get too excited. Fluminense also made extremely heavy work of beating South Korea's Ulsan in a match they were losing with 25 minutes of the 90 to go. Flamengo fans were thrilled with the win over Chelsea but dedicated watchers of the Premier League may not have viewed it as quite such a coup. Even Botafogo's result against PSG came with a minor caveat: Luis Enrique rested several key players that day. None of which is to say it isn't an eye-catching pattern, or not worth zooming in on. Indeed, even those involved have been struck by the novelty of it all. “I'm surprised by these results,” Flamengo manager Filipe Luis said after the match against Chelsea, where he played for one season a decade ago. There are three circumstantial factors at play during this Club World Cup. One is the climate: Brazilian clubs are more accustomed to playing under a roasting sun. “We're used to it,” Botafogo right-back Vitinho said last week. “I hope that it works in our favour.” Another is that its teams are midway through their season, which runs from January until December. Compared to the European sides, many of whom look exhausted at the end of a long campaign at domestic and continental levels, there is a level of freshness there. There has been scant evidence to suggest that the European sides are truly phoning it in, but are they committing to the tournament with every last drop of energy? For the Brazilian clubs, like many others from outside Europe, this is a priority. “You can see the teams are playing every game like it's a final,” Filipe Luis said on Friday. There are wider trends at work here, too. A number of the country's big clubs — Flamengo and Palmeiras in particular — have gone to great lengths to become more professional and stable. Their training facilities are every bit as good as those found at the best European teams; their marketing departments have finally found a way to leverage the colossal fanbases that exist in a country the size of Brazil (ie, larger than the contiguous United States). In 2021, Brazil's government passed a law that introduced a new ownership model for its football clubs, promising to make them more corporate, more sustainable and even — whisper it quietly — profitable. In has come foreign investment: John Textor, the co-owner of Crystal Palace, acquired Botafogo; Red Bull has put significant resources into Bragantino; the City Football Group added Bahia to its roster of clubs. As recently as 15 years ago, most Brazilian clubs' squads were filled with players at the bookends of their careers: youngsters destined to move to European sides and veterans in the twilight years, in many cases having returned home from those same leagues. The very best young players do still leave but clubs can afford to sign and pay others who are in their prime. The midfielder Gerson, bought by Flamengo from France's Marseille for €15million (£12.8m/$17.2m at current rates) in December 2022 at age 25, is the most obvious example of this trend, but far from the only one. Nor is it just a question of quality. “You look at the Palmeiras squad and they have two or even three high-level players in every position,” Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said on Sunday, before his MLS team's group game tonight (Monday) against the Sao Paulo side. Alongside the spending has come greater openness to new ideas. A wave of foreigners has freshened up the domestic managerial scene, challenged old notions. Four of the past six Brazilian championships have been won by teams with Portuguese coaches. Little wonder that public opinion over the possibility of a non-Brazilian manager of the national team softened considerably over that time frame, leading to the recent appointment of Italy's Carlo Ancelotti. Brazil has begun to dominate the Copa Libertadores, South America's Champions League equivalent, like never before. For Brazil, though, it's a signal that they are doing something right. So too is the growing ease with which they can scout and sign youngsters from other nations on their continent. “They clearly have an economic strength that the rest of the countries do not,” Mascherano, who is Argentinian, said. There are some who see huge potential, just waiting to be harnessed by good governance, and the right global TV deal. Botafogo owner Textor has been bullish in his championing of the Brazilian game. Working conditions for coaches have improved but there is still a culture of short-termism and churn. Not even the most one-eyed Botafogo fan thinks their team are better than PSG. “I think there's an elite in football, formed of eight or 10 teams,” Flamengo coach Filipe Luis said last week. Renato Gaucho, his Fluminense counterpart, echoed that view. “There's no way we can compete with the European teams financially,” he said on Saturday. “They can buy the best players and build incredibly strong teams. But football matches are decided on the pitch. The Brazilian people should be really proud of what our clubs are doing at this Club World Cup.” Jack Lang  is a staff writer for The Athletic, covering football.</p>

The final round of group stage games at the FIFA Club World Cup kicks off with this Group B clash, which sees Atlético Madrid in need of a win against table-topping Botafogo as they chase a place in the round of 16. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are. Atlético bounced back from a thrashing in its first game at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, with a professional 3-1 win over MLS outfit Seattle Sounders. The Brazilian team shocked newly crowned Champions League winner PSG with a 1-0 victory on Friday to go to the top of Group B. Atlético Madrid play Botafogo on Monday, June 23, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Igor Jesus's first-half strike was enough for Botafogo to grab a headline-grabbing 1-0 win over European champion PSG last Friday.

Wydad fans also set off the smoke bombs during last Wednesday's match against Manchester City in South Philly. A representative from FIFA told CBS News Philadelphia that smoke bombs are not allowed at their events. Lincoln Financial Field also has a strict bag policy. Fans are permitted to bring the following kinds of bags into the stadium: clear bags within a certain measurement range, a one-gallon clear plastic freezer bag or a small clutch-style bag that is around the size of a hand. Juventus defeated Wydad in Sunday's group stage match, 4-1. The FIFA Club World Cup, which is in the city a year before Philly hosts 2026 World Cup matches, will resume on Tuesday when Esperance de Tunis takes on Chelsea. Soccer fans from all over the world have invaded Philadelphia since the FIFA Club World Cup began last week. Tom Ignudo is a digital content producer at CBS Philadelphia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>June 23 (UPI) -- Malik Tillman drew first blood before Patrick Agyemang played hero with a 75th minute game-winner to lead the United States Men's National Team past Haiti, securing a perfect 3-0 record in the Gold Cup group stage. Brenden Aaronson and John Tolkin logged assists in the 2-1 victory Sunday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. "Overall it was a good performance," U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said. I think we should have scored more." Pochettino, who is now 8-5 as coach of the Americans, said his players overcame doubt from an early error to secure the win and group-stage crown. That miscue came in the 19th minute, when a turnover from goalie Matt Freese led to an immediate equalizer. "I think that created a little bit of doubt in us. I think it was tough to deal with that. "The second half was a little bit better." Aaronson eventually regained control of the ball after his first shot was denied. Tillman hovered into the area and finished the play with a header, which beat Haitian goalie Johny Placide. "Malik, it is difficult to define him," Pochettino said of Tillman. "What a player that is showing all of his talent and capacity. I think the team is much better when he is involved in the game." The American goalie then mishit a short pass to his left, kicking the ball directly to Haitian winger Louicius Don Deedson. Louicius proceeded to finish with a left-footed shot just inside the far post. The Americans manufactured several more chances, but went into the second half tied with their visitors. They appeared to earn another lead in the 64th minute, but that score was negated because Tillman hit the ball into the net with his arm. Tolkin sparked that score with a pass from behind midfield. The U.S. men will take on Costa Rica in a Gold Cup quarterfinal at 7 p.m. EDT Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The Gold Cup final will be held at 6 p.m. July 6 in Houston.
