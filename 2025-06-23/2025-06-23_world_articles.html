State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce has sparked condemnation after a reporter unearthed an interview in which she said the U.S. is the best country on Earth “next to Israel,” in yet another show of U.S. leaders' capitulation to Israel under a president who ran on the slogan “America First.” The interview occurred in May, but the clip spread across social media on Sunday after it was posted by independent journalist Ken Klippenstein on X. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “My work obviously speaks for itself, which is a reflection of my love for the United States, as I said in that interview, the greatest country on Earth. The assertion by certain anonymous users online is a typically out-of-context and absurd effort to create fake news for clicks and to smear,” she said. It's absurd for a spokesperson for one of the most powerful agencies in the world to complain about their comments being misconstrued, especially when social media posts have been directly quoting her. The clip was posted with context by Klippenstein. The context surrounding Bruce's comment doesn't change its nature at all, with the remark coming in response to a question about her professional background as a conservative writer and Fox News correspondent. “We have an obligation and a duty to make sure that people understand why Israel matters, why the Jewish people matter and why it is the responsibility of every person on this planet to recognize that,” Bruce went on. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has seemingly swayed Trump's opinions on U.S. involvement in the Middle East massively, with Trump changing his tune on war with Iran in recent months, reports have said — leaving some commentators asking about whatever happened to “America First.” War with Iran is extremely unpopular among the American public. Polling conducted around the time Israel launched its latest round of unprovoked strikes on Iran on June 13 found that 60 percent of Americans oppose U.S. involvement, with just 16 percent saying they support it. Majority opposition was seen across all party affiliations, with 53 percent of Republicans also opposing war. War with Iran may prove extremely costly — at a time when the Trump administration is threatening to cut welfare benefits for tens of millions of Americans under the guise of saving money. Israel is already estimated to be spending billions of dollars on the war.

Police were called Sunday morning to Rockwell Park in Bristol for a burglary complaint and were told by parks employees that someone was in the chimney. Firefighters responded to the scene and got the man out after having to remove parts of the chimney and building, causing $5,000 to $10,000 worth of damage, police said. The Bristol man, who was not injured, was arrested and charged with burglary, trespassing and criminal mischief. He was released on bond and ordered to appear in court on 7 July. The man got stuck near the flue of the chimney of Mrs Rockwell's Pavilion, a building named after a benefactor of the park. Locks on the doors to the bathrooms are on new timers and automatically lock at 10pm every night, said Erica Benoit, community engagement coordinator for Bristol Parks, Recreation, Youth and Community Services. The dog was unharmed, police said. “If he had just contacted police in the first place, we might have been able to avoid the situation.”</p>

Walking through Providence, Rhode Island, it's hard to miss the flyers posted on storefronts, bulletin boards, and lamp posts rallying passersby with a defiant call to action: Let's Fight Trump's Fascism! For months, popular assemblies such as these — in Providence, Detroit, and Richmond, Virginia — have been diligently laying the groundwork for resisting Trump's agenda and building self-governance. In Providence, organizers with the General Assembly tabled at last weekend's No Kings demonstration, which drew thousands. Some members help operate a hotline for reporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sightings, a key part of deportation defense efforts that helps alert communities to raids, and makes large-scale, coordinated responses — like those in Los Angeles — more likely to materialize. These gatherings offer a space for anti-fascist and progressive forces to coordinate, strategize, and make decisions together to build power that can be leveraged against the U.S. government. “We need regularly scheduled radically-democratic meetings to organize, coordinate, mobilize in active defense of our friends, neighbors, and loved ones,” the Providence General Assembly (PGA) writes in its mission statement, “and to fight to create the type of communities and world we want through our collective actions.” Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. At a Providence assembly attended by Truthout in March, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming for newcomers. Attendees were greeted at the door by PGA organizers and directed to a table stocked with name tags, free masks, snacks, printed meeting agendas, and informational pamphlets. To open the meeting, two facilitators welcomed the semicircle of about 75 people, guiding them through a preset agenda crafted by the Providence General Assembly's coordinating committee, a group open to anyone who's attended at least one gathering. Voices from across the room spoke up during the announcement period and open forum, with attendees raising hands to share updates, concerns, or reflections. Five working groups — Mutual Aid, Community Defense, Unhoused Solidarity, Class Struggle, and Anti-Imperialism — briefly summarized their recent efforts in report-backs. Anti-Imperialism was collaborating with Jewish Voice for Peace Rhode Island's campaign to divest from Israel bonds. Several members had brought forward this proposal through the PGA's formal decision-making process, which asks sponsors to submit proposals 24 hours in advance of the assembly and introduce them formally during the meeting, where it is then debated and discussed, and finally voted on. A lively 20-minute discussion of the May Day demonstration followed, with time set aside for clarifying questions, suggested amendments, and objections. One participant voiced concern about whether there was enough time to pull the event together. Another sponsor invoked the memory of Providence's 2006 May Day demonstration, which had drawn hundreds of immigrant workers into the streets. Similar people's assemblies that have taken root in cities like Detroit, Michigan, and Richmond, Virginia, signal the rise of a national movement for self-governance in response to growing authoritarianism in the United States. Hundreds joined the first People's Assembly in Detroit on January 26, rallying around one clear and urgent goal. “We have a solid stance against ICE, that is the bottom line,” said Ame, a Detroit-based organizer who helped launch the initiative and withheld their last name because of privacy concerns. Meanwhile, a third working group called Migra Watch patrols local neighborhoods and attends court hearings, monitoring ICE activity on the ground. When they witness an arrest, they try to collect the individuals' contact information in order to alert their families and help secure legal support. “We want to make sure that ICE and all the agencies working with them know they're not welcome here,” Ame said. On June 11, assembly organizers rallied outside of the McNamara Federal Building in downtown Detroit after several asylum seekers were detained following their court hearings due to expanded “expedited removal” policies. On June 8, assembly organizers attended a Detroit Public School's Community District Board meeting to demand that the board take a stand in support of Maykol, a student who was detained by ICE. “Maykol was 3.5 credits away from graduating,” said Ame. “The board made the statement, but he still got detained so we've been fundraising, noticing that people who have lawyers are less likely to get deported.” Assemblies in Richmond have conducted visualizations and thought experiments about what large-scale self-governance could look like. A spokesperson for the Richmond People's Assembly, who goes by the moniker Ezra, explained that while voting and electoral strategies can sometimes lead to short-term improvements, they ultimately disempower communities by transferring power to officials who rarely bear the consequences of the policies they impose. To pursue these goals, Richmond held its first citywide assembly on January 18, drawing a crowd of more than 500 people. Since then, they've organized community CPR classes, “swap parties” with free clothing and other goods, community discussions with potlucks, block parties, and more. “We felt like we couldn't start at the citywide level without it just becoming an organization of organizers.” The goal is to engage residents who aren't already politically active — to avoid replicating the racial, class, and age conformity that can sometimes characterize grassroots organizing efforts. “[The assemblies are] definitely still mostly folks who are already in organizing circles,” they said, “and that's something we're actively trying to push past.” Organizers with Detroit's assembly also promoted the strategy of supporting neighborhood assemblies in a piece they wrote for Left Voice, highlighting the need to support workers and community members at sites where ICE raids happen, like schools and hospitals (as opposed to solely forming “roaming squads” that may be disconnected from impacted communities). In Richmond, organizing efforts also extend beyond the neighborhood level by hosting quarterly city-wide gatherings, which offer workshops, informal socializing, and shared meals in addition to an assembly. “That flow of energy from a meeting setting into these more open forum workshops was really appealing to people,” Ezra reflected. This structure is designed to keep power decentralized by preventing a person or small group from wielding a disproportionate amount of influence over others. This spokescouncil model, Ezra explained, draws inspiration from international examples of direct democracy — most notably Rojava, a multiethnic, feminist movement involving more than 4 million people in North and East Syria. These communes manage society's core needs through dedicated committees for self-defense, food, water, education, electricity, heating oil, health, and garbage collection. Similarly, every committee is represented by co-spokespeople who meet with their counterparts across the region, forming a federated structure of grassroots governance. In Syria, years of grassroots organizing — door-knocking and deep conversations with neighbors about their shared struggles — helped build up social acceptance for revolutionary ideologies among the Kurdish population. So when many of Assad's forces withdrew from North and East Syria in 2012, amid the chaos of the Syrian Civil War, communities were ready to self-organize. Without access to formal municipal power as in Rojava, assemblies in Richmond have conducted visualizations and thought experiments about what large-scale self-governance could look like. At the citywide gathering in April, the assembly used a recent water crisis in the city as a springboard for discussing current power structures in Richmond, and to imagine what it would take to build infrastructure capable of managing water for hundreds of thousands of people. Turning such ambitious visions into reality requires scaling up our movements. “People often say that this is relational work, and that is true, but it is only true so far as your relationships are in community, are in dialogue with structure,” they said. “There is a dialectic between relationship and structure that allows for organization. At a late-March assembly in Providence, participants similarly grappled with the dual challenge of building meaningful relationships while resisting the pull of subcultural insularity. While many assembly-goers agreed on the importance of building connections, they emphasized that relationships would develop organically within the working groups themselves and through shared struggle approached with sincerity, curiosity, and joy. It was a collective and cathartic act symbolizing a vision shared by all three assemblies: the dismantling of oppressive systems and the creation of liberatory structures in their place, of a world where people live without the constant fear of displacement, deportation, and state violence Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Live coverage: Iran's Fordow nuclear site hit again, state media says Donald Trump has doubled down on claims “monumental damage” had been done to Iran's nuclear sites, as the head of the UN's nuclear agency said that while he anticipated “very significant damage” at the underground Fordow site, the agency had not been able to assess it. “Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran, as shown by satellite images,” he said in a social media post. “Obliteration is an accurate term!” Pentagon officials have characterised the damage to the sites – at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan – as “severe”. The images appeared to confirm that Iranian authorities had preemptively removed some material from the site, possibly including its uranium stockpile – or parts of it. On Monday, Israeli jets struck Fordow in order to obstruct its access routes, the IDF said. According to briefings from unnamed US and Israeli officials to American and Israeli media, Fordow had been heavily damaged but not destroyed. Speaking in Vienna, Grossi said that given the “explosive payload utilised and the extreme vibration sensitive nature of centrifuges, very significant damage is expected to have occurred.” He added, however, that “at this time, no one, including the IAEA, is in a position to have fully assessed the underground damage.” Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had earlier said Tehran was still “calculating the damage”. Whether or not Iran had managed to remove technology and uranium from the attacked sites is likely to be a key question in the coming days and weeks. “We are going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel and that's one of the things that we're going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” the US vice-president, JD Vance, told ABC's This Week on Sunday, referring to the stockpile of uranium theoretically sufficient to make nine or 10 atomic weapons. Other images showed what appeared to be two distinct clusters of holes in a ridge at the site, caused by the entry of the dozen bunker-busting Massive Ordinance Penetrators dropped by US B2 Spirit stealth bombers. According to Joseph Rodgers, deputy director and fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Project on Nuclear Issues, the US bunker busters appeared to have targeted ventilation shafts at the Fordow facility. If this ends here, it's a really incomplete strike,” Lewis told NPR, echoing other experts who pointed to Iran's continued retention of enriched uranium as the key issue. In a lengthy thread on social media, Lewis expanded his point: “This means Iran has retained 400kg [of 60% highly enriched uranium], the ability to manufacture centrifuges, and one, possibly two underground enrichment sites. “That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA's calculation, although Iran insists it does not seek nuclear weapons.” “If the strike leaves the current regime, or something very much like it, in power with a nuclear option then it will have been a strategic failure. What does it say when two of the most amazing military operations in modern memory are still unable to fully eliminate Iran's nuclear programme?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla's much-publicized robotaxi service began this weekend — but only in one neighborhood in Austin, Texas, only for a select group of the company's fans and only with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat. It was a far more modest rollout for robotaxis than Tesla CEO Elon Musk had promised. While other companies have already achieved and surpassed this initial test, Tesla fans still cheered the unassuming launch as a game-changing first step. Musk has promised since 2019 that Tesla was on the verge of providing a wide-ranging ride-hailing service that would change the basic way riders get around, including the promise that Tesla owners would profit from renting their cars to the service. Last fall, Musk debuted a prototype for a “Cybercab” without a steering wheel or pedals, and he said the service would greatly change the financial outlook for Tesla, making it the most valuable company on the planet. A small number of company-owned cars were used and they were existing Model Y vehicles — not Cybercabs, which are not yet allowed on roads, let alone produced on a mass scale. It was not even the most extensive robotaxi service in Austin — a joint effort between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been up and running in Austin since March. But the Austin test pressed on regardless. The rides were made available to a select group of Tesla fans, according to Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an effusive Tesla bull, and Joey Klender, who writes for the site Teslarati.com. Klender and a member of Ives' team took multiple rides in a Tesla Model Y robotaxi on Sunday. “We took a route through a park with dirt roads and traffic cones, yet the car was able to navigate perfectly and picked us up right at our exact location,” Ives said in the note. “To really put it into perspective, there was a moment where we drove up a narrow road going up a hill with cars parked on both sides with oncoming traffic and people opening their car doors into the road and the Robotaxi masterfully maneuvered.” But it was not all smooth sailing, with multiple videos showing the car making mistakes. A separate YouTuber posted a video in which the robotaxi kept driving past its destination for several minutes as he tried to get it to pull over so he could get out. All the rides on Sunday, no matter the distance, cost $4.20, a favorite number of Musk based on its association with marijuana. Musk and his fans have insisted the service will rapidly be expanded to other cities and will dramatically change the financial performance of Tesla. But the EV maker is playing a game of catch up. Waymo, a unit of Google parent Alphabet, has been providing paid rides since 2020, and now provides more than 250,000 rides a week to paying riders in Austin, Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco. General Motors pulled the plug on its own self-driving car hailing service in December, citing the “considerable” resources needed and “an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.” It also had an accident in which one of its robotaxis in San Francisco hit a pedestrian and dragged the woman along the road for 20 feet. The woman had already been hit by a human-driven car before she was struck by GM's robotaxi. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov on June 23 was formally named a suspect in a high-profile illegal land grab case, becoming the highest-ranking official in Ukrainian history to face such charges while in office. "I will stay in this position," he said.Chernyshov, who heads the new National Unity Ministry in charge of returning refugees, is a close ally of President Volodymyr Zelensky. He raised eyebrows in Ukraine after leaving the country days before law enforcement revealed a massive corruption scheme and detained two of his former close associates — Maksym Horbatiuk and Vasyl Volodin. According to the anti-corruption agency, during his time as Development of Communities and Territories Minister in 2020-2022, Chernyshov and his associates undervalued land plots by five times to benefit the developer, which Ukrainian media identified as Serhii Kopystyra, which allegedly cost the state Hr 1 billion ($24 million). In exchange, NABU says the developer gave kickbacks to Chernyshov and his accomplices with "significant" discounts on apartments in his existing buildings, totaling over Hr 14.5 million ($346,000). Ukrainian news site Ukrainska Pravda reports this took place between 2021-2022. Most of the illegally obtained apartments have been seized. Chernyshov arrived back in the country on June 22 after suspicions mounted in Ukraine that he was on the run and avoiding detention. "The rumors of me not returning is nothing but manipulation. Chernyshov said he was targeted by a "smear campaign" but said he didn't know who could be behind it.Chernyshov said that he came back on his own accord and denied that anyone had asked him to return. He arrived at NABU offices on June 23, after the agency summoned him to be charged. Upon leaving the bureau, Chernyshov wrote on Facebook that he had a “constructive chat” with detectives and will cooperate with the organization. An investigation into Chernyshov and two of his associates took place last year after suspicions arose, according to Ukrainska Pravda, with the agency obtaining a warrant to search Chernyshov's home. However, sources in anti-corruption agencies told Ukrainska Pravda that the head of NABU, Semen Kryvonos, blocked police searches due to his close relationship with Chernyshov, who was his boss when Kryvonos headed the State Architecture Inspection, an agency that subordinated to Chernyshov's former ministry. He added that the allegations against Horbatiuk and Volodin look "quite serious" but that it was for law enforcement to decide if their detention is justified. He became the national unity minister in December 2024, a ministry created from scratch. He is widely believed to have a personal friendship with Zelensky. According to a report by Ukrainska Pravda, Chernyshov was among only a handful of guests invited to celebrate Zelensky's birthday during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 — and the only member of the Cabinet of Ministers in attendance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on June 23 called for urgent measures to prevent rising oil prices amid escalating tensions with Iran. The post comes after global oil prices surged on June 13 following a series of Israeli air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The surge in oil prices risks undermining Western attempts to curb Russia's war funding, as the Kremlin relies heavily on oil revenues to sustain its invasion of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that a price surge could further embolden the Kremlin. On June 21, the U.S. joined Israel in conducting airstrikes that targeted three nuclear facilities in Iran — Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. The operation triggered a strong response from Tehran, which threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a key global oil transit route. U.S. Vice President JD Vance responded on June 22 that any Iranian attempt to shut the strategic waterway would "destroy their own economy." The strait is a vital chokepoint for global energy supplies, with nearly a fifth of the world's oil passing through it daily. The mechanism restricts Western firms from shipping or insuring Russian oil sold above that threshold. The Russian Finance Ministry has relied heavily on energy revenues to sustain defense spending, which hit record highs this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Montreal memorial for the victims of Air India Flight 182, in Lachine, Que., on June 23, 2022.Christinne Muschi/The Globe and Mail Her mother, Vijaya, was murdered in the bombing of Air India Flight 182. Today is the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism, which has been recognized since 2005 as a day to “remember and honour every Canadian whose life was cut short or forever changed by a terrorist attack.” What Canadians might not realize is that we commemorate this on June 23 for a reason. On that day, in 1985, Air India Flight 182 - flying from Montreal to London on its way to Delhi and Mumbai – exploded over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people aboard, including 268 Canadians. It remains the deadliest terror attack in Canadian history. Forty years later, we mark this grim anniversary at a time of geopolitical tensions and in the aftermath of another horrific Air India crash two weeks ago, in Ahmedabad, India. The bombing of Flight 182 is often presented as a distant tragedy – one that occurred over the ocean and left no survivors, at a time when there was no 24-hour news cycle or social media. But Flight 182 also represents the tragedy of distance: too many Canadians simply didn't feel connected to an explosion involving a foreign airline carrying many hyphenated Canadians who did not look like them. How families are building a digital archive to commemorate the Air India bombing It took 15 years for charges to be laid in relation to the bombing, another five years for a trial to end with stunningly light consequences, and another five for an official apology by then-prime minister Stephen Harper. A federal inquiry's report spoke of a “cascading series of errors,” yet it still excluded expert testimony that alluded to the racist structures that perpetuated harm against victims' families. But this was an act of homegrown terror – a plot that authorities now blame on a group of Khalistani militants living in Canada. I do not have the luxury of forgetting. My father went on to remarry a woman who had lost her husband, K. Lakshmanan, and daughter, Preethi, in the same bombing. Yet, despite these intersections, it took me a long time to engage more fully with this history. Liberal MP sponsors petition to open a new Air India bombing investigation As journalist Kim Bolan wrote: “I wish that all Canadians could have seen the absolute devastation... to have understood the magnitude of the calamity.” How can we comprehend a tragedy we cannot see? These revelations should challenge Canadians' sense of identity – and force us to reflect on what it really means to belong here. As younger Canadians grow more removed from the bombing, there is a real risk that it will fade entirely from our collective memory. Wreckage of bombed Air India aircraft should be on display, say victims' families The story of Flight 182 represents a stark warning against sacrificing human rights and justice for political expediency. This dark chapter should be discussed in Canadian schools, museums and other public spaces to foster the discourse that leads to institutional introspection and accountability, and placed in the context of other difficult histories that have shaped our country. Forty years after Flight 182, Canada now has a choice: Will we finally learn from our history, or are we destined to repeat it?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. HUSSEIN AGHA spent more than 25 years as a Senior Associate at St. Antony's College, University of Oxford, and has been involved in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations for more than three decades. ROBERT MALLEY is a Lecturer at Yale University's Jackson School of Global Affairs. He served in the Biden administration as Special U.S. Envoy for Iran and in the Obama administration as White House Middle East Coordinator. To many outside the Middle East, the American and Israeli war with Iran reads like a linear narrative: the two allies' formidable militaries and intelligence agencies arrayed against their adversary, poised to prevail, on the cusp of indisputable, decisive triumph. The fight and its expected outcome are viewed through the prism of familiar antecedents: Hitler's Germany overwhelmed, defeated, willing to acquiesce to the victor's demands; Japan following suit. History, to them, advances in a straight line, swiftly heading to safe shores, and one had better choose the correct side or be left adrift. To those who know the Middle East, such thoughts make little sense. The region has its own favored antecedents. Israel invaded South Lebanon in 1982 and forced the Palestine Liberation Organization's exile to Tunisia. In the 1980s, Washington's support for Afghan mujahideen helped drive out Soviet forces. After Washington's victory in the 1990-91 Gulf War, Osama bin Laden and his followers made the United States their primary target. Twenty years later, the Taliban returned to power. Darkness rapidly descended; the peaceful demonstrations and lofty values that inspired them became distant memories. The regime of Egypt's deposed president, Hosni Mubarak, eventually gave way to an even more brutal autocrat. The overthrow of Yemen's government hatched Houthi dominance; the fall of Libya's Muammar al-Qaddafi yielded bedlam, instability, and violence. It slips sideways and lands in the most unexpected of places. It might emerge, triumphant, as the uncontested regional hegemon. Israeli dreams of regime change may be unfulfilled, but chaos could reign. To all who saw Iran as a behemoth, were daunted by its deterrence and paralyzed by its threats, these are days of reckoning. The time lag between the immediate result and what happens as a result of that result may stretch: “Mission Accomplished” may go on for days, weeks, months, even years. That is true only until the next. Success generates reactions that yield its opposite. The closer Israel gets to total triumph, the closer it will be to complete uncertainty, to perils unleashed by pent-up humiliation, anger, and fury. That sort of victory is not a safe place. For Israelis, the temptation to act was irresistible. They waited decades for the opportunity to take down their foes, immediate or remote, real or imagined. But the United States and European countries should know better. Jews did not forget their attachment to the Holy Land after 2,000 years of exile. With memories so profound and vistas so far-reaching, much that is viewed as crucial today will be of little interest to the future. They could entail a revamping of Iran's “axis of resistance” no less thorough than the one Israel wreaked by force. Over the years, flush with a sense of power, Iran built up its conventional arsenal, believing it could deter and challenge Israel in an arena over which the Jewish state had long enjoyed mastery. The three saw these achievements as indices of potency, overlooked how vulnerable these feats had made them, how weakness sprang from apparent strength. There is a reason why they initially embraced more mobile, elusive methods of guerrilla groups. When they deviated into trying to match their enemy, they went astray and lost the plot. It may not be long before more Palestinians, Lebanese, Iranians, and others motivated by their cause—desperate, friends or family members wiped out, craving revenge, with darkness as their sole horizon—resort to unconventional forms of warfare, at times well planned, at others impromptu, today's more lethal and technologically adept versions of yesterday's hijacked planes and buses, hostage takings, and suicide attacks. Israeli achievements in technical intelligence, cyberattacks, pager detonations, precision killings, mass civilian carnage, and more, may point the way to methods that will be employed by all and sundry. It takes time for history to reach its destination, and not before it sets out on many false trails. The years that lie ahead will not reflect tidy plans and rigorous policy prescriptions. They will be shaped by instinct and emotion, inspired by raw, deeply-rooted yearnings for historical redress and vengeance. This is not a world built by or for Americans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. In 1980, Xi Zhongxun, a major Chinese Communist Party heavyweight and the father of the current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, visited one of the premier tourist attractions of central eastern Iowa: the Amana Colonies, a German heritage site founded on communitarian principles, now known for beer and crafts. At 67 years old, Xi was leading a delegation of provincial governors to the United States. It was a historic moment in China's opening to Western business and investment. Xi was also launching the Special Economic Zones—areas designed to attract foreign businesses—that would symbolize China's new relationship with the outside world. Yet he would sometimes go quiet as if he were preoccupied and could come across as reserved and distant. His reaction was so strong that it seemed as if he “became a different guy,” according to a U.S. foreign service officer. That change probably occurred because Xi saw in the heritage site a frightening possibility. Here was a community built on collectivist and utopian principles that had decided 88 years after its founding to disband. At the time, a few years after the death of Mao Zedong, Xi and his comrades were worried that what they had built with all their sacrifices would not endure. From Xi's position as governor of Guangdong, it did not look good. New economic ties with the outside world could help stem the tide and create prosperity, but fears of Western ideological infiltration were especially palpable in Guangdong because of its proximity to the British colony. His son Xi Jinping has now inherited that mission. Inspired by his father, the son dreams of no less than breaking the cycles of dynastic collapse that have marked Chinese history for millennia. And they provide essential context for understanding what Xi Jinping is trying to achieve today and whether he will succeed in the future. After his release from a Nationalist prison when he was 15 years old, Xi did not rekindle his enthusiasm for revolution by reading Karl Marx. As he later told his son, it was a novel, The Young Wanderer, by Jiang Guangci, that he found most inspiring. Its protagonist experiences one disaster after another and concludes that “the more pain that evil society brought me, the more powerfully did my resistance develop.” But ideology not only motivated Xi and helped him explain why the party deserved devotion. When the party persecuted him, which it did on numerous occasions, it was because differences of opinion were understood as manifestations of ideological heresy. That is why even though it was a novel that inspired Xi to stay with the revolution in 1928, it was yet another novel, Liu Zhidan, that got him purged in 1962. Mao concluded that Xi's decision to allow a woman cadre to write the book—a fictionalized narrative of a leading revolutionary from the Northwest—was a manifestation of “class struggle.” Xi was dispatched into the political wilderness for 16 years. After Mao's death in 1976, leaders recognized that the Cultural Revolution was such a failure that the party would have to change in its aftermath. When Xi returned to work in Beijing in 1981, he faced a new question: how to maintain a sense of idealism and conviction when no one could explain what communism really was anymore, a reality that even Xi acknowledged. Yet he was also afraid of what might happen if that new economic model caused people to lose faith in the party's ideological commitments. He worried about how China would change with the arrival of Western investment, the introduction of market mechanisms, and the use of material inducements to encourage hard work. Xi wanted to give space to new voices that could justify the party's new economic direction, or even provide new ideas about how to achieve limited political reforms, but he was afraid of chaos and wanted the loudest critics to stop creating problems for him. There was always the risk that he could be associated with more strident calls for change and earn the ire of his superiors. It was a recipe for confusion and dysfunction. Finally, there were consequences for the party elite itself. In 1987, after student protests, Deng purged General Secretary Hu Yaobang from the leadership. The party accused Hu of “bourgeois liberalization.” Xi, his close associate, was said to have “gone even further” than Hu, according to Yang Shangkun, a Politburo member. The real problem was that balancing reform and opening with conservative principles had proved to be a near-impossible task. Xi Jinping faces the same problem of balancing growth with ideology that his father did, but he has his own approach to solving it. He has tried to avoid the dramatic zigzags that marked the Deng period even as he has attempted to be flexible with limited course corrections. The problem for him is that the “struggle” he demands of his people is an inherently ambiguous notion. Xi Jinping's “middle path” approach could achieve the best of both worlds by using growth to facilitate greater security and stability (and vice versa), or it could simply be a recipe for muddling through. Party leaders might have done a better job with thorny ideological debates if they had evaluated different approaches dispassionately. Xi served premier Zhou Enlai in the 1950s and early 1960s and then General Secretary Hu Yaobang during the 1980s. In other words, he witnessed firsthand the relationships between the Chinese paramount leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping and their most significant deputies. Xi would have seen how party politics at the very top was about much more than executing the senior leader's wishes. The implementers were told to pursue multiple goals at the same time without clear guidance about which mattered more or how to achieve them. Commands would often include two contradictory orders separated by a “but”: make sure the campaign is thorough, they were told, but avoid going too far too fast. Setbacks might mean losing authority to someone else. If a deputy reported too much to them, they could feel overwhelmed and bogged down by details. But not enough communication could lead them to suspect that underlings were trying to run the country themselves. Private, frank meetings between leaders and their lieutenants were extremely rare, and even then there was no guarantee that they would reach a durable understanding. When deputies got it wrong, their bosses stripped them of power—or worse. This was an almost impossible situation for deputies to navigate. Xi watched as Mao regularly humiliated Zhou Enlai. On one occasion in 1958, Zhou, after an excruciating self-criticism that lasted several hours, plaintively admitted to Xi that Mao had criticized him once again. Xi promised to share the blame with Zhou. He was shaken by how the experienced Zhou, who understood Mao better than most, could nevertheless face devastating setbacks. Xi thought Mao's personality cult during the Cultural Revolution was disastrous. But Hu thought he had Deng's complete trust. When Deng said that he was planning to retire in 1986, Hu made a fatal mistake. He agreed that Deng should go, which in turn led Deng to conclude that Hu was eager to push him out. In the aftermath, it became clear to Xi that the party was less inclined to resolve the problems inherent in its leadership system than it was to repeat them. Like Mao and Deng before him, Xi Jinping has arrogated to himself great power. If the jealousies and insecurities that come with succession politics are dangerous, then it is no surprise that Xi has not picked a successor. A named successor might create more than one center of authority in the party, and Xi does not want to risk the instability that might result if he has to purge such a figure. If too much daylight between a leader and his deputies is a problem, then we can understand Xi's decision to concentrate control in his own hands, as he did when he undermined Li Keqiang, the premier at the time, by restricting Li's latitude to make decisions about the economy. Sooner or later, Xi will be tempted to pick and test a successor. As he ages, he may lose energy and want to focus on bigger issues, which will mean delegating more authority to others. The same problems that tormented his father could reappear. It was a fitting coda to a life that had been marked by constant worry about an existential question: Would younger and future generations accept the continuing legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party? Yet his children saw something else, as well. They witnessed the same tragedy but lived very different lives. One of Xi's children, Heping, committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution. Another came to associate with veteran pro-reform officials and intellectuals. Others made a lot of money in business ventures. Indeed, he was convinced that his ordeal was worse than what many others suffered during the Cultural Revolution, since he was the son of a leader who had been purged earlier than most senior revolutionaries. Nevertheless, he has spoken with great pride of the toughness these horrific experiences inculcated in him. And he has asserted that his ideals and convictions are unshakable precisely because he went through a period of confusion before recognizing that only the party's path was the right one. With that in mind, he followed his father into politics. But will future generations feel the same way as their parents? Some will inevitably be proud to accept that task. But others may hear Xi Jinping's call not as a rallying cry but as a weary echo of the past. Many young Chinese people might be more interested in living less ardent lives than what Xi demands of them. The Xi family story raises questions about just how these young people can be won over. A message of suffering and struggle can indeed be meaningful for some—but for others, it may only lead to alienation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It comes as Mr Trump authorised strikes on Iran's three nuclear bases, Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, on Saturday night in a stealth mission he hailed “a spectacular military success”. Israeli officials said they believed Iran's heavily-fortified nuclear site at Fordow sustained serious damage from the strikes but had not been completely destroyed. On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, claimed Israel was “close” to wiping out Iran's nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles. Air raid sirens are ringing through central Israel early this morning, as the military works to intercept Iranian missiles. 🚨Sirens sounding across central Israel due to a missile launch from Iran🚨 Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Moscow as he embarks on a campaign to “rally the world against Israel”, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Mr Araghchi earlier slammed the US's attack, calling it an “outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation” of international law. “Approximately 20 (Israeli airforce) fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes using over 30 munitions on military targets in Iran,” the Israeli army wrote on Telegram. In another early sign of risk aversion, Bitcoin slid below $100,000 for the first time since May and Ether sank sharply as cryptocurrencies posted broad-based declines. Market reaction had been generally muted since Israel's initial assault on Iran earlier this month: Even after falling for the past two weeks, the S&P 500 is only about 3 per cent below its all-time high from February. But moves stand to get bigger if Iran responds to the latest developments with steps such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage for oil and gas shipments, or attacking US forces in the region, market watchers say. Traders are preparing for another surge in crude prices even as it's unclear where the crisis goes from here. That rise is expected to restart on Monday, after the US assault dramatically raised the stakes in a region that accounts for a third of global oil output. Donald Trump has stopped short of saying that the goal of US strikes was to topple the government in Tehran, but he said “regime change” would happen if its leaders were “unable to make Iran great again”. Hawks within the Israeli establishment, and many ordinary Israelis, would love to see Khamenei dead, arguing that he is a legitimate target whose removal would eliminate one of the gravest threats to the Jewish state. But many analysts believe assassinating Khamenei would be a perilous gamble – one that could easily misfire by paving the way for an even more hardline successor. Khamenei may be no peacemaker, but he did place a fatwa effectively banning Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It is unclear whether the ruling has survived in its original form, and many in Israel set little store by it. The assassination of 10 senior Iranian generals may already have strengthened the regime's fundamentalist wing, even as it has dealt a serious blow to its military command structure. Mr Iravani told the UN Security Council: “The United States, a permanent member of this Council... has now once again resorted to illegal force, waged a war against my country, under a fabricated and absurd pretext: preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.” “We will take all measures necessary,” Mr Iravani told the meeting. In a post on his Truth Social network, Donald Trump has said: “It's not politically correct to use the term, “Regime Change,” but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? Just hours ago, Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth stressed that Washington was not seeking to topple the Iranian government or force “regime change”. But Mr Grossi noted that no one had been able to assess the underground damage at Fordow. He added that “armed attacks on nuclear facilities should never take place and could result in radioactive releases with grave consequences within and beyond the boundaries of the State which has been attacked”. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has warned against yet “another cycle of destruction” and retaliation following the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, which he said marked a “perilous turn” in the region. A powerful explosion was heard in central Isfahan at 10:48 pm local time as air defence activity intensified across multiple Iranian cities, Iranian media reported. Air defence activity also intensified in Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz and Ahvaz late on Sunday, according to Iranian media. Isfahan is home to one of Iran's major nuclear facilities that was targeted in the American strikes. John Healey, the Defence Secretary, said UK Armed Forces protection was at its “highest level” amid fears that the US action could escalate into a wider conflict. It is understood UK bases across the Middle East have increased security since the US action in the early hours of Sunday morning, with personnel on high alert for drone attacks as well as conventional rockets and missiles. “No one... is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.” At the Isfahan site, Mr Grossi continued, “additional buildings were hit overnight with the US confirming their use of cruise missiles.” “Affected buildings include some related to uranium conversion processes. At Natanz, a “fuel enrichment plant has been hit, with the US confirming it used ground-penetrating munitions.” Several explosions were heard in the northwestern city of Tabriz around 10 pm local time following an Israeli attack, Iranian state media reported. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has arrived in Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin following a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israel is “close” to destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities and stock of ballistic missiles. He vowed not to be dragged into a “war of attrition with Iran”, saying: “When we achieve our objectives, the fighting will stop.” However, senior members of Donald Trump's administration on Sunday issued a more conservative assessment of the damage inflicted on Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said its capabilities had been “degraded” and “set back” but stopped short of saying they had been outright destroyed. Similarly, JD Vance, the US vice president, said last night's strikes on three Iranian facilities had “substantially delayed” Iran's ability to develop of a nuclear weapon “by many, many years”. Danny Danon criticised António Guterres after the UN secretary general said he was “gravely alarmed” by the US bombing Iran's nuclear sites. “It was very disappointing because the secretary general failed in his remarks to mention the threat of a nuclear Iran,” he said. He knows diplomacy has failed for the last decades, and should thank the US for bringing stability and bringing peace through power.” “You don't have a radical regime which threatens to destroy member states of the UN,” he said, adding: “Today I think we have historic days.” Danny Danon, speaking shortly before an emergency security council meeting: “[Iran] threatens every capital in the West with its growing arsenal of ballistic missiles. He warned Tehran: “Under this, any further attacks against our civilians will be met with overpowering, righteous force, unlike your actions against our civilians” Authorities are preparing for a possible attack after Donald Trump bombed Iran's nuclear facilities on Sunday morning local time, with security being increased at places of worship in major cities. Police in Washington, DC, New York and other major American cities said they had increased their presence outside places of worship on Sunday following the US air strikes. The White House has reportedly been monitoring possible Iranian sleeper cells in the US, which could be ordered by Tehran to launch an attack in retaliation for the damage inflicted on its nuclear programme. Donald Trump has lashed out at a Republican congressman who claimed his bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities was unconstitutional. Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president accused Thomas Massie, a representative for Kentucky”, of “grandstanding” and failing to recognise “what was so brilliantly achieved last night in Iran”. “He's a simple-minded ‘grandstander' who thinks it's good politics for Iran to have the highest level nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘Death to America' at every change they get,” he said, labelling the Republican “weak” and “ineffective”. “Massie should drop his fake act and start putting America First, but he doesn't know how to get there - he doesn't have a clue!” Iranian police have arrested an alleged Israeli agent in a suburb of Tehran. “With intelligence oversight and control in real and online platforms... police officers succeeded in identifying and arresting a mercenary of the Israeli regime in Parand,” said Colonel Ali Zanganeh, the police commander of Robat Karim district. The United Nations is expected to hold an emergency security council meeting at 3pm EDT (8pm BST) after the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Hezbollah has condemned US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and expressed “confidence” in Iran's ability to “make America and Israel taste defeat.” Hezbollah said the US was seeking through the “criminal aggression to achieve what Israel had failed to accomplish and compensate for its disgraceful failure in achieving its goals against Iran's painful and devastating missiles.” The US secretary of state was asked about reports that Iran had removed stockpiles from the Fordow facility ahead of American air strikes last night. “No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it because you really can't move anything right now, and they can't move anything right now inside of Iran,” Mr Rubio told CBS' “Face the Nation”. Iran still has a stockpile of enriched uranium despite US strikes last night on its nuclear sites, an adviser to its supreme leader has claimed. “Even if nuclear sites are destroyed, game isn't over, enriched materials, indigenous knowledge, political will remain,” said Ali Shamkhani, a close ally of ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Seven Revolutionary Guard members and two conscript soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes on two military centres in central Yazd province this afternoon, Iranian forces announced. “Seven Revolutionary Guard personnel and two conscript soldiers achieved martyrdom, and several others were wounded, with treatment of these dear ones underway,” the unit said. Iranian air defences are targeting Israeli aircraft over central Isfahan province, state media reported. “Isfahan air defence operations against hostile aircraft began an hour ago,” Tasnim news agency said. “Following the detection, identification and tracking of several hostile Israeli aircraft in Isfahan's airspace, air defences immediately activated and are destroying these targets.” New York is on “high alert” after the US struck three nuclear sites in Iran, according to the state's governor, Kathy Hochul. “We are not aware of any specific or credible threat to New Yorkers,” Ms Hochul said in a statement. “However, given New York's distinctive global profile, we are taking this situation extraordinarily seriously.” The Department of Homeland Security has warned the US was facing a “heightened threat environment” and could face attacks or cyberattacks by Iran. “The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilising to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence,” it said on Sunday. Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz have urged Iran to return to the negotiating table following US air strikes last night. We affirm our support for the security of Israel.We have consistently been clear that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon and can no longer pose a threat to regional security. Earlier today, the United States has conducted targeted military strikes against nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Donald Trump ordered US defence secretary Pete Hegseth to strike Iran on Saturday, Fox News reported. Tom Cotton, the Republican senator, warned Iran that retaliating would result in “military force” that made Saturday night's air strikes “look like child's play”. For years, successive US administrations used sanctions and threats to keep Iran in line. But his intervention in the Middle East could now trigger an Iranian response with attacks on American interests – including 40,000 US troops in the region. Tehran launched barrage after barrage of missiles and rockets in retaliation, but the terrifying forecasts of thousands dead in Israel never materialised. At the same time, Iran had given away some of its secrets last year when it launched its own strikes on Israel. That was a fatal mistake, according to Fred Fleitz, who served on the national security council during Mr Trump's first term. “It gave Israel a chance to retaliate and probe Iran's defences,” he said. This may be Mr Trump's biggest gamble so far, but he acted only when the odds had started to turn his way. The strait is a key passage through which 20 per cent of global oil and gas demand flows. Iran's security body will now make the final decision on whether to proceed with the plan, state television reported this afternoon. It comes after America's leading general said the US military had inflicted “extreme damage and destruction” on Iran's three most critical nuclear sites. Donald Trump has claimed Republicans are unified “like we have never seen before” in his first public statement since revealing details of US strikes late on Sunday. The US president wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Great unity in the Republican Party, perhaps unity like we have never seen before. “Now let's get the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill done. Iran's Fordow nuclear facility has not been destroyed despite Donald Trump's claim that it was “totally and completely obliterated”, according to reports. US and Israeli officials told The New York Times that the heavily-fortified site, which is located deep underground, had been severely damaged but not destroyed by the 12 “bunker-busting bombs” dropped on it by US bombers last night. The Pope has warned that “war does not solve problems” following US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities last night. “War does not solve problems; on the contrary, it amplifies them and inflicts deep wounds on the history of peoples, which take generations to heal,” Leo XIV, who was born in Chicago, said in a statement. War does not solve problems; on the contrary, it amplifies them and inflicts deep wounds on the history of peoples, which take generations to heal. Authorities are on the alert for a terrorist attack on US soil following the strikes last night, JD Vance has said. “We know that some of those people were on the terrorism watch list. JD Vance said the US strikes last night had “substantially delayed [Iran's] development of a nuclear weapon”. “But again, our goal is that they're never able to develop a nuclear weapons programme.” Mr Vance, a key conduit to a restive part of the Maga base and one of the administration's most effective communicators, says last night's actions show that to be nonsense. Two thoughts this morning:The operation last night is an incredible testament to American pilots and other service members, from General Caine and General Kurilla on down. “While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team,” he posted on X. Iran will commit “economic suicide” if it blocks off the Strait of Hormuz in response to US strikes, Marco Rubio has said. The US secretary of state, asked on Fox News if he expected Tehran to close off the strait to disrupt global oil supplies, said: “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the Strait of Hormuz for their oil. “If they do that, it will be another terrible mistake. “It's economic suicide for them if they do it, and we retain options to deal with that, but other countries should be looking at that as well. It would hurt other countries' economies a lot more than ours.” Mr Rubio said the move would be a “massive escalation that would have to merit a response not just by us, but from others.” Lindsey Graham, one of Mr Trump's most hawkish senators, said the president was well within his authority to order strikes. “He was within his Article II authority, Mr Graham told NBC's ‘Meet the Press with Kristen Welker'. We've declared war five times in the history of America. Speaking to Fox News this morning, Marco Rubio said the US was “not looking for war in Iran” but blamed Tehran for not negotiating with Donald Trump. Iranian retaliation would be “the worst mistake they've ever made...we can fly in and out of Iran at will,” Mr Rubio warned. “We're not looking for war in Iran but if they attack us then I think we have capabilities they haven't even seen yet,” he added. Mr Rubio said Iran's nuclear programme had been “degraded” and “set back from a technical standpoint” but stopped short of saying it had been destroyed outright. Mr Bolton, who has been a frequent critic of his former boss, told CNN that the US president made the “right decision for America”, calling Iranian leadership “very vulnerable” and “in trouble”. While he suggested Iran would be wary of taking on the US, he said it could seek to close the Strait of Hormuz to damage global shipping, strike US military or civilians, damage oil infrastructure, or launch terrorist attacks around the world. In that situation, Mr Trump would have no choice but to use “brutal force against the Iranian regime”, he said. Iran's top security body will now make the final decision on whether to close the shipping lane, state TV reported this afternoon. Such a move could temporarily restrict US warship's ability to exit the Persian Gulf and lead to the disruption of global oil supply, causing a sharp spike in prices. US strikes on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility left six craters in the ground where American bombs likely entered before hitting their target, a new picture released by Maxar Technologies shows. Grey dust and debris can also be seen scattered down the mountainside after US “bunker buster” bombs were dropped overnight. JD Vance, the vice president, said the media was to blame for “fake division” over Donald Trump's decision to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. “While the media has attacked the president's senior team relentlessly, and tried to sow fake division, last night would have been impossible without perfect coordination and discretion from the president's national security team,” he said. His comments come after Mr Trump suggested Tulsi Gabbard, his intelligence chief, was “wrong” to suggest Iran was not close to building a nuclear weapon. There has also been division amongst Mr Trump's supporters about whether the US should attack Iran. Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, two influential media personalities who supported the president's re-election bid, said it would be wrong to do so. Two thoughts this morning:The operation last night is an incredible testament to American pilots and other service members, from General Caine and General Kurilla on down. Israel has launched a fresh round of strikes against Iranian targets in the centre and south of the country, according to state news. “But our view has been very clear that we don't want a regime change. He has said repeatedly during this interview that Iran faces a choice: if it gives up its nuclear weapons programme then it can have a relationship with Washington. JD Vance, US vice president, said he won't be drawn into whether the president had new intelligence that necessitated a strike, but he says it would have been irresponsible not to attack Fordow. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, “There's, of course, an open question about whether they were weeks away, whether they were months away, but they were way too close to nuclear weapon for the comfort of the president of the United States, which is why he took this action.” “Now there's another element here too Kristen, which is that we had a narrow window of opportunity, we might not have been able to carry out this attack six months down the road.” Failing to strike now, might have made a future attack impossible. “It would have been irresponsible, I think, for the president not to take the action that he did, which is why Fordow was destroyed last night,” he said. US forces “employed approximately 75 precision guided weapons during this operation” and more than 125 aircraft, he said. In the wake of the attack, he said: “Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian retaliation or proxy attack, which would be an incredibly poor choice. Meanwhile, seven B-2 bombers “proceeded quietly to the East with minimal communications”, he continued. “Once over the land the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex tightly timed manoeuvre… all done with minimal communications,” Gen Caine continued. At around 5pm EST, a US submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles at Isfahan, a nuclear site, he said. “The US employed several deception tactics including decoys as the fourth and fifth generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude, and high speed, sweeping in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface to air missile threats,” he said. The US military inflicted “extreme damage and destruction” on Iran's three most critical nuclear sites, America's top general said. Decoy warplanes were sent West, while the real strike group headed East, before unloading the US's most devastating bombs on Iran's enrichment facilities, while submarines fired Tomahawk missiles. “Initial assessments indicate that all three Iranian nuclear sites sustained extreme damage and destruction”,” he said, referring to the three sites targeted - Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Celebrating its “overwhelming” success, Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, said the US completed its mission to “destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear programme”. Seeking to now de-escalate the situation, he said the US was seeking peace not war and warned Iran against a retaliatory attack. Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the US had executed a “deliberate and precise strike against three Iranian nuclear facilities” in “Operation Midnight Hammer”. “This operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. Gen Caine said “very few people in Washington” knew “the timing or nature of this plan.” Donald Trump “seeks peace and Iran should take that”, Pete Hegseth continued. He praised US Central Command, “who did a phenomenal job”, thanking “every American involved in this operation” who “performed flawlessly” along with the US' allies in the Middle East. “This was a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we could be ready when the president of the United States called,” Mr Hegseth said. He said the mission was to “destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear programme” and called it “an incredible and overwhelming success”. Many presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear programme. I accept your challenge that there is a risk of escalation. “And that's why all our focus has been on de-escalating, getting people back around to negotiate what is a very real threat. We were given due notice, as we would expect, as close allies to the US, and we have been moving assets to the region to make sure that we're in a position to protect our own interests, our personnel and our assets, and, of course, those of our allies.” The Guards also said they would continue to target Israel, which has been hit by multiple waves of missile and drone attacks since it struck Iran on June 13. Sir Keir Starmer will chair a meeting of Cobra to oversee Britain's response to the US bombing of nuclear sites in Iran. Sir Keir Starmer once again emphasised that the Government's focus was on de-escalation and diplomacy in response to the US strikes on Iran. The Prime Minister refused to comment on what might happen next or how Nato would respond if Iran attacked US bases. Instead, he sought to reassure the public that that “all necessary measures” to protect UK interests and military personnel had been taken. Speaking directly to Britons in the Middle East, he said: “I urge all citizens to make contact with the Foreign Office so we can facilitate whatever support is needed.” The Israeli army said today it had “other goals” in Iran and intended to continue its military offensive. Donald Trump deployed B-2 bombers to strike Iran's three principal nuclear sites overnight, in what he called a “very successful attack”. The world is bracing for Iran's retaliation after its foreign minister warned there would be “everlasting consequences”. Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, said that Iran's disruptive spying operations in the UK were “already at a significant level”, with hardly a week going by without an Iranian cyber attack on the UK's infrastructure. He said: “I think it would be naive to say that wouldn't potentially increase but again, there's a choice here for Iran. “There is a better course of action for Iran to take here and I think they should consider that.” The UK has already declared Iran and any agents acting on its behalf as a security threat under new laws that force them to register their activities in the UK or face five years in jail. It has opened a booking portal and urged all UK nationals to register their presence now. It said those with greatest need will be prioritised for flights. British nationals plus their non-British immediate family members travelling with them are eligible. The Foreign Office said all passengers must hold a valid travel document. Non-British immediate family members will require valid visas or permission to enter the UK or remain that was granted for more than six months. It said it would contact those who are allocated a seat on the flight directly and British Nationals should not make their way to the airport unless they are contacted. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “We are in active conversations about chartering aircraft to get people out. That's not possible at the minute from Israel, because airspace is, of course, closed.” Satellite images from Fordow on Friday and Saturday showed queues of trucks lining up at the site. Iran's foreign minister is heading to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin tomorrow in the wake of US strikes on Tehran's nuclear facilities. His visit to Russia will raise significant concerns over what kind of support Moscow is willing to offer Tehran at this moment, which could include sending defence materials, getting involved directly militarily or throwing diplomatic weight behind Iran. Overnight, Donald Trump deployed B-2 bombers to strike Iran's three principal nuclear sites, in what he called a “very successful attack” that “obliterated” Tehran's uranium enrichment sites. Mr Araghchi earlier said there would be “everlasting consequences” for the US strikes. “We have to respond based on our legitimate right to defend ourselves,” Iran's foreign minister has just said in the wake of the US strikes. Abbas Araghchi, speaking at a press conference, said diplomacy was no longer an option “in this case”. “There is no red line that they have not crossed and the most dangerous one was last night, they crossed a very big red line by attacking nuclear facilities,” Mr Araghchi said. Speaking in Istanbul, Abbas Araghchi said that Donald Trump's decision to bomb Iran had not only “betrayed” Tehran, but deceived his own nation. He said attacking a nuclear facility is an “unforgivable violation” of international law and once again emphasised that Iran “reserves all options to defend its security”. Iran's missile barrage early this morning wounded at least 86 people, including children. Other missiles hit Haifa in the north and Ness Ziona, south of Tel Aviv, where rubble littered the roads and whole streets had their windows blown out. The Israeli military announced that it had recovered the bodies of three hostages in Gaza more than 20 months after they were abducted by Hamas militants. Ms Keidar, 71, Mr Samerano, 22, and Mr Levinson, 19, were all killed during Hamas's attacks on southern Israel in Oct 7, 2023 and their bodies were taken to Gaza. Ahead of Donald Trump's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, his defence chiefs would have war-gamed possible retaliation. Washington has put its 40,000 troops deployed in the Middle East, including in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, on high alert amid escalating tensions. Now that America has attacked key Iranian nuclear sites with what is reported to be six bunker buster munitions, US defence chiefs will be bracing for a response. The international nuclear watchdog has said it is convening an emergency meeting tomorrow. There are nuclear safety fears following the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, however the IARA has reported no increased radiation levels on Sunday. “Khamenei is responsible for an unpatriotic project that, in addition to costing countless lives, has cost the Iranian people at least two trillion dollars—and now, it has all gone up in smoke,” Maryam Rajavi wrote in a statement. The NCRI, founded in 1981, is a broad coalition of Iranian organisations and individuals which aim to establish a democratic republic of Iran. “We support the prevention of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. They'll want to know what this means, and I do want to give them reassurance that whilst the British government the UK, has not been involved in these attacks, we have been making extensive preparations for all eventualities.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has backed Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran. Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, the future of Israel depends on it. At least 16 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles at the country following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said in a statement that it had “evacuated 16 people to hospital, including a 30-year-old man in moderate condition.” Iran's foreign ministry has also issued a statement condemning the US strikes and vowing to defend Iran “by all force and means”. “Iran's nuclear programme is a grave threat to international security. An Iranian parliament member from central Qom, where the Fordow nuclear site is, located, has downplayed damage to the facility and threatened retaliation against US forces. He added:“Trump should order mass production from coffin-making companies as soon as possible to transfer the bodies of American military personnel stationed in the region.” The Israeli military said it launched a fresh series of strikes this morning targeting military sites including missile launchers in western Iran. The air force began “a series of strikes toward military targets in western Iran”, a military statement said, adding it had “struck missile launchers ready to launch toward Israeli territory, soldiers in the Iranian Armed Forces, and swiftly neutralised the launchers that launched missiles toward Israeli territory a short while ago”. Donald Trump was elected on a promise to avoid foreign wars and international entanglements. On Saturday night, he sent B-2 bombers into action to obliterate what was left of Iran's nuclear programme, using the sort of deep-penetrating weapons that Israel lacks. Insiders said this was not a departure from his campaign pledge but a reminder that American power is based on the idea of “peace through strength”. He is still a leader who puts deals ahead of military action, said one former official speaking before the strikes, but one who recognises that the best deals come when adversaries are negotiating from a weakened position. He had sent a signal of his intent on Thursday. “Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” was the quote read by Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary. At least 11 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said. Iran's state TV announced this morning that it launched 30 missiles against Israel after the US, its closest ally, bombed several Iranian nuclear sites. “These live images you are seeing are of a new salvo of Iranian missiles fired on the occupied territories,” said a presenter on air, referring to Israel. Citing “sources”, a presenter said that “30 missiles have been launched at Israel from Iran”. “I wish to convey to President Trump and the American people my profound appreciation for their leadership, determination and their clear stand with Israel throughout this campaign and tonight particularly against the Iranian regime,” he said. In breaking news, Iran has reportedly launched ballistic missiles targeting central and northern Israel. Explosions have been heard over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Sirens are sounding and everyone is urged to take shelter immediately. The statement called the strikes a “flagrant violation of international law” and “a direct threat to international peace and security”. The group also said that it has “complete confidence in Iran's ability to defend its sovereignty and the interests of its people, and to confront this aggression”. Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, has become the highest level Iranian official to speak out following the US strikes, saying that his country “reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people”. “The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences. The Israeli Defense Force also announced that it shot down two drones from Iran a short while ago. The drones had triggered sirens in Israel's southern Arava region. Drones take many hours to travel so these were likely sent before the US launched strikes against Iran. Gideon Saar, Israel's foreign minister, has commended President Trump and said that he “wrote his name in letters of gold in the history books” after the US strikes against Iran. Mr Saar also complimented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's “extraordinary leadership” in initiating the attack against Iran last week. The B-2 bombers which struck Iran's nuclear sites flew non-stop for roughly 37 hours from their base in Missouri, a US official told The New York Times. They refuelled several times in mid-air en route to Iran. There is “no danger” to Iranians living near the Fordow nuclear facility, Iranian authorities have said. Earlier, another Iranian official previously said that the Fordow had “long been evacuated and has not suffered any irreversible damage”. Saudi Arabia's Nuclear and Radiological Regulatory Commission has also issued a statement saying that “no radioactive effects were detected in the Gulf states”. Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said in a social media post on Saturday: “We will work unceasingly to protect the American homeland.” Mitch McConnell, the former Republican Senate leader and a regular critic of Donald Trump, praised the US president's decision to strike Iran. “She's wrong,” the US president said on Friday, speaking to media en route to his Bedminster golf course in New Jersey. Mr Trump has assembled an unusual team for his White House and Cabinet, drawing on close loyalists, Fox News presenters and veterans of Capitol Hill. But with tensions boiling over in the Middle East he has made the unusual move of sidelining two key national security figures, relying instead on old friends and military insiders. It means Ms Gabbard, the national intelligence director, and Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, both surprise picks who had impressed Mr Trump with lively performances on Fox News – have found themselves on the outside of discussions. Donald Trump has said Iranian retaliation will be met with “far greater” force. Following US strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: “ANY RETALIATION BY IRAN AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MET WITH FORCE FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WAS WITNESSED TONIGHT.” “There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control – with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region, and the world,” he said. He called on UN member states to de-escalate and “avoid a spiral of chaos”. Bernie Sanders announced the news of Donald Trump's strikes on Iran live at a political rally. I learned about Trump's unconstitutional attack on Iran at a large rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Speaking on stage, Mr Sanders said: “This is a statement from Donald Trump...We have completed a very successful attack on three nuclear sites in Iran etc.” Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi's political bureau, said that “Washington must bear the consequences,” in a short post on social media. The Houthis are a close ally of Iran and have helped launch attacks against Israel since 2023. Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management System detected abnormal thermal activity near the Fordow facility this evening. According to the New York Times the B2 bombers dropped at least six 30,000-pound bunker busters on Fordow, citing an anonymous US official. “If peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Donald Trump has threatened to launch further strikes on Iran if it does not immediately make peace. He added: “There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days. Earlier, Mr Trump said the US had attacked Iran's enrichment sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. If they do not, “future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier,” he says, Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.” Donald Trump is flanked by JD Vance, his vice president, Marco Rubio, secretary of state, and Pete Hegseth, defence secretary, as he starts his speech, warning Iran of more strikes if it does not make peace. He called Israel's alliance with the US “unshakeable” and said that in bombing Iran's nuclear facilities, “America has been truly unsurpassed”. “It has done what no other country on earth could do. History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world's most dangerous regime, the world's most weapons,” Mr Netanyahu said. He also praised Trump's leadership as a “pivot of history” that can “lead the Middle East and beyond to a future of prosperity and peace”. “President Trump and I often say peace through strength. First comes strength, then comes peace and tonight President Trump and the United States acted with a lot of strength,” Mr Netanyahu said. Mr Bannon, a key voice in Mr Trump's Maga movement and a former White House chief strategist, said he doubled the US president would want to get entangled in a protracted conflict in the Middle East. “We have now become a combatant in this war between Israel and the Persians. I guess you say it's now a broader war, although it looks like the president is trying to keep this to a very tactical strike,” he said on his “War Room” podcast. In the US, “an overwhelming majority of the people don't want to get involved in any of this,” he said, adding: “Now, we're involved.” Democrat firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran is “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment”. The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment. “He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. Donald Trump just spoke to Reuters by phone and threatened more strikes. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Republican congresswoman, sent a reminder of Mr Trump's political jeopardy while US planes were still in Iranian airspace. ”Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” she posted before the president announced strikes. Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war.There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.Israel is a nuclear armed nation.This is not our fight.Peace is… ”Let us join together and pray for the safety of our US troops and Americans in the Middle East,” she wrote on social media. “Let us pray that we are not attacked by terrorists on our homeland after our border was open for the past 4 years and over 2 million gotaways came in.” Iranian state television has allegedly said that every American citizen and military personnel in the region is now a target. Unverified footage shared on social media shows a Iranian state news television presenter with a graphic behind him of the Middle East, where red flags appear to mark possible military targets. Addressing Donald Trump directly, the presenter allegedly said: “You started it, and we will end it,” according to unverified translations of his remarks. The US dropped six “bunker-busting bombs”, otherwise known as GBU-47s, on Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, according to Fox News. The weapons, each of which weighs 15 tons, were carried by American B-2 stealth bombers, which were deployed to the Middle East earlier today. The mullahs' misguided pursuit of nuclear weapons must be stopped,” Mr Thune said in a statement. “As we take action tonight to ensure a nuclear weapon remains out of reach for Iran, I stand with President Trump and pray for the American troops and personnel in harm's way.” After Donald Trump approved an operation to strike Iran, US defence chiefs will now be bracing for Iranian retaliation. The US has in recent days repositioned aircraft carriers to the Middle East in what defence secretary Pete Hegseth called a “defensively postured” manoeuvre. Nothing hurts a government more than the price of oil, and this narrow stretch of water between Oman and Iran is vital in the global supply. A host on Iran's state TV news declared following the US air strikes: “Mr Trump, you started it, and we will end it.” The broadcaster displayed a graphic of US bases in the Middle East which are said to be within firing range of Iran. A US official has said American forces in the region are prepared for a retaliation by Iran and are not planning further strikes. Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, reportedly spoke following US air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Me Fetterman, a staunch support of Israel, said in a post on X: “As I've long maintained, this was the correct move by @POTUS [Donald Trump]. “Iran is the world's leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities. “There are no materials in these three nuclear sites that cause radiation,” IRNA, the Iranian state-affiliated media channel said, quoting an official. Donald Trump is not planning additional US strikes on Iran and is hopeful today's attack will see Tehran return to the negotiating table, sources told US media. Despite the president's hope for a diplomatic solution to prevent further escalation, American forces in the Middle East are said to be prepared for retaliation by Iran. But headlines around the world suggested that Mr Trump had just announced a 14-day window for Iran to come to the table, glossing over the fact that his actual words suggested a decision could still be made sooner than that. Concerned officials in the West Wing quietly started briefing out that anything could still happen any time. Mr Trump himself clarified the position on Friday when asked when he might take action: “I'm giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum.” Mike Johnson, the US House speaker, has said that the US's strikes against Iran serve “as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that president Trump means what he says”. He added that the decision to launch an attack on Iran was “America First policy in action”, seeking to quell dissent among isolationists within Mr Trump's Maga base. Donald Trump will meet with his National Security Council tomorrow, CNN reported. In a post on X, the network's chief White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins said: “President Trump returns to the White House tomorrow and has a national security meeting on his schedule at 6pm in the Oval Office.” Iran has not launched any missile attacks on Israel so far tonight, marking a rare quiet period since hostilities first broke out a week ago. Simone Ledeen, the former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East in Mr Trump's first administration, said: “It's a really powerful message to China and Russia and whoever else thinks that the US has gone weak and that Trump is just about making deals.” She also pointed out that Mr Trump had not given Iran 14 days of breathing space. But the reality is that he already given Iran 60 days to reach a deal. Democrats and Republicans have been left divided over Donald Trump's decision to strike Iran. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican congressman, posted on X: “support the president.” The president's decision was also supported by John Fetterman, a Democratic senator, who said “Iran is the world leading sponsor of terrorism and cannot have nuclear capabilities”. Meanwhile, Ro Khanna, the California Democrat who is tipped as a future leader of the party, called for Congress call a vote to “prevent America To another endless Middle East war”. Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defence minister, has said Donald Trump took a “bold decision”. Mr Trump had spent Friday night and much of Saturday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. He didn't speak to his travelling press pool at any point. His announcement that strikes had been conducted arrived three hours later. Gabriel Noronha, a state department Iran adviser during Mr Trump's first term, said the president had gone way beyond simply focusing on the key site of Fordow. The US's 30,000lb GBU-57F/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb, or “Mop”, can penetrate around 60 metres underground before exploding. With weapons-grade uranium suspected of being manufactured at the site and hazardous raw materials, experts warned a strike could have severe effects. Donald Trump has reposted the message “Fordow is gone” on his site Truth Social. The US president earlier said America had completed “our very successful strikes” on three nuclear bases. Mr Trump said Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan had been hit. The decision to bomb Iran comes after the US moved four B-2 stealth jets to its military base in Guam on Saturday morning. The B-2 is designed for long-range missions and is the only aircraft capable of delivering the 30,000-lb “Massive Ordnance Penetrator” (Mop) precision-guided bunker busters that could be used to destroy Iran's underground nuclear plant at Fordow. It is not yet clear which munitions the US has used to strike Iran's three nuclear sites. Iran has pledged to retaliate if it joined the Israeli assault and the US has already begun removing key personnel from Embassy in anticipation of a strike. Trump's decision to enter the conflict comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran. The strikes have moved to systematically eradicate the country's air defences and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. bunker buster bomb  offered the best chance of destroying heavily-fortified sites connect Ed to the Iranian nuclear program buried deep underground. Donald Trump said the US has completed a “very successful” attack on Friday. “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and [Isfahan],” he wrote. “All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. There is not another military in the World that could have done this.</p>
