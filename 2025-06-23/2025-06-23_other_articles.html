                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During its 15-season run, Supernatural was popular at the same time as other pop culture hits. Back in the early 2010s, other major favorites were Doctor Who and Sherlock, and they often included the same fandoms. Years later, Supernatural star Misha Collins gave fans the SuperWho crossover they didn't know they needed, sharing a photo on Instagram with Doctor Who's David Tennant. Two decades after Supernatural's release, the show remains one of Jensen Ackles' career-defining projects. The two met at Heroes Dutch Comic Con, where they posed for a picture backstage. The Heroes Dutch Comic Con featured more Supernatural stars, Jared Padalecki, who played Sam Winchester, and his wife, Genevieve Padalecki, who played the second Ruby. Collins played Destiel in Supernatural, who later became a main character after his introduction in Season 1's premiere, "Lazarus Rising." Currently, the actor also portrays Crowley in Good Omens, which aired for two seasons and is expected to wrap the story with a film that has yet to get a premiere. "This woulda done NUMBERS on tumblr in 2014," reads one of the most-liked comments. A different person commented, "Wait, that's a different Crowley..." Supernatural had its own Crowley, the King of Hell, played by Mark Sheppard. "Close your eyes Aziraphale and Dean, the guys who do something about their feelings have reunited," joked another fan, referring to the non-canon Destiel fan-favorite pairing, and Aziraphale and Crowley from Good Omens, who finally kissed in the Season 2 finale. There was one place David Tennant really wanted to visit when he was the one playing the Doctor. While the SuperWho crossover came as an unexpected shock to the two fandoms, Supernatural fans have more things to celebrate. The fantasy horror series wrapped in 2020, but the lead actors have been giving encouraging words about reprising their roles in a reboot. However, if and when that happens is still unclear. Jensen Ackles joined The Boys in Season 3 as Soldier Boy. With the show set to return with a fifth and final season, the explosive finale season will also bring over Misha Collins and Jared Padalecki. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

Buffy's relationship with Angel was a high point of Buffy the Vampire series, but there's one scene that fans never saw. The Big Bang Theory introduced audiences to a lovable gang of nerds, but one of its best characters may have been hiding a dark secret.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chrissy's open shelves need to be seen to be believed – I've written about kitchens for years, but these stopped me in my tracks When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Over the last five years, I've seen hundreds – if not thousands – of celebrity kitchens, all of which exhibit a quality that makes them feel unique and personal to their owners. In the case of Chrissy Teigen's marble kitchen, her 'floating' shelves are unlike anything I've ever seen before. Few features often stop me in my scrolling tracks, but the optical illusion seen in her background stole all my attention, and I think you'll be amazed, too. She places neutral cookware on one shelf, but her bookshelf (the highest one) has the real supernatural quality. It appears as though her books are floating above the marble shelf, creating an optical illusion that differs from anything I've ever seen before. It's kitchen storage, with a magical twist, and if you're anything like me, you'll spend a lot of time admiring its power. Bake, steam and strain all in one lightweight pan with this chic Dutch oven. Cook multiple dishes at once with this multi-tray, silicone bakeware set. It's chic but so practical, you'll wonder, and of course, Chrissy-approved. However, with some planning and hidden accessories (discreet wall brackets, we're looking at you), it's possible to achieve a similar aesthetic. 'To create that clean, 'floating' open shelving look in a kitchen, the key is simplicity and clever concealment,' comments Claire Garner, the director at Claire Garner Design Studio. 'Choose wall-mounted shelves with hidden brackets [such as this one from Amazon] or floating shelf systems that are anchored directly into the studs, which will give the illusion that the shelves are weightlessly suspended,' Claire explains. 'Choose materials with a slim profile, like oak or powder-coated steel, which will help to add elegance without the visual bulk,' she explains. 'When styling your shelving, aim to keep it minimal by grouping items by colour or material, and leaving a little breathing room between objects so the wall still feels light and open.' Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups. I hope to bring this look into my kitchen sometime very soon. In the meantime, I'll keep returning to Chrissy's space as the most magical space I've seen so far this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani watched with concern as their mother Kate rose to notoriety during the pandemic, eventually getting struck off as a nurse for promoting misinformation about Covid-19. Doctors told her she had a high chance of survival with chemotherapy. But in 2024, seven months later, she died - having refused the treatment. The brothers blame their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories for Paloma's death at 23 - as cancer doctors tell BBC Panorama these beliefs are becoming more mainstream. Kate Shemirani has not responded directly to the allegations we raised, but she has publicly blamed the NHS for her daughter's death. She and her ex-husband, Paloma's father Faramarz Shemirani, wrote to us saying they have evidence "Paloma died as a result of medical interventions given without confirmed diagnosis or lawful consent". The BBC has seen no evidence to substantiate these claims. Paloma's elder brother Sebastian says: "My sister has passed away as a direct consequence of my mum's actions and beliefs and I don't want anyone else to go through the same pain or loss that I have." Both brothers say they contacted me about Paloma in the hope they could prevent other deaths, and they believe social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation - which the BBC has found is being actively recommended on several major sites. "I wasn't able to stop my sister from dying. But it would mean the world to me if I could make it that she wasn't just another in a long line of people that die in this way," says Gabriel. For Panorama and BBC Radio 4's Marianna in Conspiracyland 2 podcast, I pieced together how this young Cambridge graduate came to refuse treatment that might have saved her life, following an online trail and interviewing people close to her. And I found that conspiracy theory influencers such as Kate Shemirani are sharing once-fringe anti-medicine views to millions - which can leave vulnerable people at risk of serious harm. When you have a US health and human services secretary "who actively promotes views like the link between vaccines and autism that have been debunked years ago, then that makes it much easier for other people to peddle false views," he says. Since becoming Health and Human Services Secretary, Mr Kennedy has said he is not anti-vaccine, and that he just supports more safety tests. Paloma and her twin Gabriel, along with Sebastian and their younger sister, grew up in the small Sussex town of Uckfield, where they were exposed to conspiracy theories at home, her brothers say. So you see that as a truth," he says. Sebastian believes their mum used her ideas as a way of controlling them. On one occasion, Kate Shemirani decided wi-fi was dangerous and switched it off at home, he says, ignoring his pleas that he had to submit GCSE coursework. "That only fed the joy that she had for using her irrational system of beliefs to control me," he says. According to her sons, Kate Shemirani's anti-medicine views were accelerated in 2012, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. "Paloma spoke about her mum curing herself, and she believed sunscreen could cause cancer. But Paloma maintained contact with her, even when she went off to study at Cambridge in 2019. Messages Paloma shared with her then-boyfriend Ander Harris - and which he has shared with the BBC - reveal a relationship with her mother that had moments of love and care, but also times when Paloma saw it as toxic and abusive. Chantelle says she began eating meat and using fluoride toothpaste. In late 2023, not long after graduating, Paloma began to have chest pains and breathing difficulties. Doctors suspected a tumour, but Ander says he and Paloma, "one of the smartest people I've ever met", were hopeful at first that it would turn out not to be malignant. But on 22 December, Paloma and Ander went to Maidstone Hospital where doctors gave her the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Untreated, this type of cancer can be fatal, but doctors told Paloma she had an 80% chance of recovery if she had chemotherapy. Ander says Paloma still wanted her support, even though their relationship had recently been through a rough patch. Kate Shemirani said she would come to the hospital. Evidence seen by the BBC suggests Paloma's thinking could have been influenced by her mother during the two days she was an inpatient at Maidstone Hospital. Ander and his own mother, who was also there, raised concerns with hospital staff about Kate Shemirani's beliefs and her relationship with Paloma. Medical staff discussed safeguarding concerns about Paloma among themselves and wrote that they had "a concern regarding parental influence" on her. But they also thought that she did have the capacity to make her own decisions. For advice, Paloma reached out to a former partner of Kate Shemirani called Patrick Vickers. Paloma had a good relationship with him, Ander says. When Paloma asked him about the "80% chance of cure" the doctors had said chemotherapy would offer, Mr Vickers said that was "exaggerated". He encouraged her to start Gerson therapy and to maybe consider chemotherapy if her symptoms did not improve after six weeks. He also shared documents with the BBC in support of Gerson therapy. Gerson therapy involves a strict plant-based diet, along with juices, supplements and coffee enemas. Some people claim - without scientific evidence - it can be used to treat a range of cancers. Paloma was worried about the negative side effects of chemotherapy, Ander tells me, as it can cause fatigue, sickness, hair loss and affect fertility. Nursing staff spoke to Paloma about egg-freezing and wigs when she was diagnosed. But the charity Cancer Research UK says Gerson therapy can also have severe side effects, including dehydration, inflammation of the bowel, and heart and lung problems. At some point during the two days in hospital, Ander says, Paloma made up her mind. She decided not to pursue chemotherapy - at least for the time being - and would try Gerson therapy to start with. On 23 December, Kate Shemirani sent Ander a voice note giving him instructions to drive Paloma to her house, saying she had arranged doctors for her. She suggested Paloma's time with a friend she wanted to see should be limited on Christmas Day - and said in the message that they could "see her for maybe half an hour or whatever here, or they can do it on FaceTime". Paloma "was in fight or flight and really just wanted to be taken care of and, you know, not have to make the hard decisions", he says. On her website, she sells apricot kernels for their "potential health benefits" along with nutritional supplements, and offers information and advice. She charges about £70 for an annual membership to her site, and charges patients - including those with cancer - £195 for a consultation and personalised 12-week programme. On social media she posts videos promoting her products and sometimes criticises "ill-informed people" for treating cancer with chemotherapy, or "pumping mustard gas into their veins" as she characterises it. When the Covid pandemic hit in 2020, Kate Shemirani was one of many conspiracy theory influencers who found a wider audience. She promoted the false ideas that the pandemic was a hoax, that vaccines were part of a plan to kill lots of people, and that doctors and nurses should be punished for their part in it all. In 2021 a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel determined that Kate Shemirani should be struck off as a nurse for promoting misinformation about the pandemic. Several social media companies also suspended her profiles for promoting misinformation. But once Elon Musk bought X in 2022, lots of conspiracy theory accounts were reinstated, including Kate Shemirani's. Her audience has grown again - in the past six months she has had her content viewed more than four and a half million times across the major social media sites. I have found dozens of comments on X where she encourages people to get in touch, including those with cancer. TikTok says it has now banned Kate Shemirani's account for violating medical misinformation policies. According to Meta, Instagram and Facebook do not allow harmful medical misinformation. But she says Paloma also said she felt pressured by doctors and friends to reconsider her decision to pursue alternative therapies on their own. Chantelle says she did not agree with the alternative therapy either, but wanted to be there for her friend. Paloma had mentioned other people trying to change her mind and discussed "cutting them off", Chantelle adds. Over the months that they spoke on the phone, Chantelle says she noticed that Kate Shemirani was "taking very good care of Paloma". But she does not think Paloma would have made the same decisions without her mother. "I don't think her ideology was strong enough to make those decisions is my personal belief. People have different opinions about these things, but I think her mum played a massive, massive role into it," Chantelle says. Other friends and family felt that Kate Shemirani was isolating Paloma from them. Gabriel says he asked to meet Paloma not long after she was diagnosed but his sister said she could not go out because of the "bad air". He was not arguing Paloma did not have capacity, but he wanted an assessment of the appropriate medical treatment for her. But events overtook them and the case ended without a conclusion in July - because Paloma had died. Gabriel only learned of his sister's death several days afterwards, in a phone call from their lawyer. "It's like being burnt alive and you feel the searing pain every time it comes out of your mouth," Gabriel says. "I haven't come to terms with that at all," he says. "I was just, like, screaming and crying at the top of my lungs." Paloma had suffered a heart attack caused by her tumour. Kate Shemirani has promoted a range of unproven theories on social media and fringe political podcasts about how she believes Paloma was murdered by medical staff - and that this was followed by a cover up. The BBC has not seen evidence to support these claims. Paloma's death was devastating for her family and loved ones. But for Sebastian and Gabriel, it is also a warning of the potential consequences for people who believe anti-medicine conspiracy theories like their mother's. Chantelle began on a Royal Cornwall Hospital clinical trial and had the all-clear 18 months later. Tim Strugnell, 76, says he feels as if his life has changed after taking part in clinical trials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: BBC, CW, TV | Tagged: doctor who, Supernatural It was an unofficial Supernatural/Doctor Who crossover during Heroes Dutch Comic Con, with Misha Collins and David Tennant checking in. Earlier today, we had a chance to cover what Jared Padalecki had to share during Heroes Dutch Comic Con about filming the fifth and final season of Prime Video's The Boys and his upcoming in-development CBS medical drama. But that was far from the only cool thing to come out of the con this weekend and hit social media. For example, where else but at a pop culture convention or fan event could you find the Tenth/Fourteenth Doctor and Castiel spending some green room time together? That's right, Supernatural star Misha Collins and Doctor Who star David Tennant had a chance to enjoy some hanging-out time during the big event, and Collins was kind enough to post a look. "It's weird, but the green room at [Heroes Dutch Comic Con] is MUCH bigger on the inside," read the caption to Collins' Instagram post, which included a selfie of Tennant and Collins together: Back in April, we had a chance to pass along some of what went down when Supernatural and The Boys co-stars Collins, Padalecki, and Jensen Ackles made their way to Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead: Creation Minneapolis" – including insights into Ackles' upcoming Prime Video series, Countdown, and Padalecki's experience filming the final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's Prime Video series. "Jensen got into my phone again in the green room. Jensen got into my phone again in the green room.</p>
