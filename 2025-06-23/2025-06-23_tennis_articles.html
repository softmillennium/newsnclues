                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain's Emma Raducanu has praised Wimbledon for doing "an amazing job" to prevent a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets for this month's championships. He was later given a restraining order by Dubai police, and his name circulated among the tennis authorities. I got a notification, the police contacted me and told me everything was OK," Raducanu told BBC Sport in her first comments on the issue. Gambling and social media abuse of women in sport - what is going on? Raducanu shot to worldwide fame when she won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021. She has previously been the victim of a stalker, with another man given a five-year restraining order in 2022 after he walked 23 miles to her home. The Englishwoman has often had a greater security detail with her at tournaments since the upsetting incident in Dubai, and says she now feels "comfortable and safe" on tour. "I have a lot more protection around me - especially the ones here in the UK, where it's busy and there's more spectators around. Sally Bolton, chief executive of All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) told BBC Sport they spend a lot of time on ensuring security measures are tight at Wimbledon. Raducanu also praised Katie Boulter for "taking a stand" after her compatriot spoke to BBC Sport about the scale of online abuse she receives. Boulter and a number of female athletes across a range of sports have called for more action to be taken against those who abuse players. "It doesn't matter how many positive comments you read, you are always going to remember the more negative ones - so I just try and stay away." Raducanu is competing at Eastbourne, one of the final grass-court events before Wimbledon begins on 30 June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no love lost between Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva. The tennis rivals got into a heated argument after facing off at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany on Sunday, with Sakkari saying to Putintseva: “Nobody likes you.” Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva got heated during their handshake in Bad Homburg 😳Watch the full clip here and read more from @Tennis below 👇 https://t.co/Xi8KegqHOu pic.twitter.com/wvS84NILKu There were clear tensions during the clash, and Sakkari was seemingly furious that Putintseva did not look her in the eye while shaking hands and said something to her opponent about it. That initiated a vigorous back-and-forth, with Putintseva offering Sakkari an incredibly sarcastic curtsy. As both players went to shake hands with the umpire, Sakkari told Putintseva she should've made eye contact “like a human being,” to which a clearly frustrated Putintseva replied: “I was a human being – look at yourself.” “I don't think she's going to invite me for dinner for the rest of our lives, but I don't care,” Sakkari said afterwards to the on-court interviewer. Let me leave it here, and just say that I have respect for her as a player, but that's it.” “By the way — not that I care — I shook her hand as most women do,” Putintseva posted over a photo of herself on an Instagram Story. Sakkari will play Ekaterina Alexandrova in the next round as she gets ready for Wimbledon, which kicks off June 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Of all the US Open mixed doubles teams that were announced earlier this month, Carlos Alcaraz's partnership with Emma Raducanu has drawn the most interest. After all, these are two of the biggest names in tennis at the moment, as a couple of young superstars with bright futures ahead. Meanwhile, with persisting injury issues that have plagued her career ever since that US Open title in 2021, Emma Raducanu is some way behind. That has not taken away from their budding relationship though, she assures. Speaking ahead of their poised partnership at the US Open, Raducanu was asked to expand upon their friendship by Eastbourne reporters. She started by remembering how they shared the stage even before New York back when she won her maiden Grand Slam title noting: ‘I've known him for years and actually in Wimbledon 2021 was kind of the first time I started getting to know him. 🤩Emma Raducanu explains how Carlos Alcaraz asked her to be his US Open doubles partner 🤝 pic.twitter.com/gVHz8i6Xt0 ‘I think for all of us, we really kind of value those connections that we had from when we were young because when you become a bit more known or a bit more successful, you just find yourself reverting back to people you knew from a young age because you're like, that's a real genuine connection, because it becomes very busy and you have a lot more friends but the ones that you've known for a long time mean a lot more to you.' This comes after Alcaraz won his second Queen's title just last week. In fact, there is no real outstanding contender, thus leaving a power vacuum for someone to fill. However unlikely, Raducanu will of course have grand aspirations of filling that, especially given she does perform well on grass. This time, in the middle of a year where she has found form and fitness unlike times prior, Raducanu can feel confident that she might follow in Alcaraz's footsteps and shock the world with a title at the All-England Club.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has shed light on her friendship with Carlos Alcaraz after they signed up to play mixed doubles together at the US Open later this year. And the 22-year-old has now joked that she had to “keep him on his toes” before giving a response. But Raducanu has explained that she needed to consult her team before making a final decision. “Gotta keep them on their toes!” she laughed. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.” The pair go way back, and Raducanu admitted Alcaraz played a role in her run to the US Open title in 2021, as she watched him make his way to the quarter-final and wanted to chase him. So it will be a full circle moment for them to team up in Flushing Meadows. She continued: “I've known him for years and actually in Wimbledon 2021 it was like kind of the first time I started getting to know him, and I had a good run there and then also again in the US Open in 2021. “And I remember he beat Stef [Tsitsipas] in the third round and it was like a big win, his breakout kind of win on a big stage and it was really cool to kind of, I guess, go through that tournament together and then I kept going through the US Open, but we were staying in touch for the whole time and yeah, it's nice.” Raducanu gravitates towards those who have known her since before her US Open triumph, and it's no different with Alcaraz - even though he's gone on to become a multi-Grand Slam champion. He's obviously overtaken me a lot, but it's nice that we have that from a while ago,” she said. “I think for all of us, we really kind of value those connections that we had from when we were young because when you become a bit more known or a bit more successful, you just find yourself reverting back to people you knew from a young age because you're like, that's a real genuine connection, because it becomes very busy and you have a lot more friends but the ones that you've known for a long time mean a lot more to you.” This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. While the Spaniard is known for his yearly trips to Ibiza, Raducanu prefers more low-key activities like yoga and going on walks. She explained: “I think in that sense, we are quite similar. “And I think whenever I have played with, you know, trying to channel any negativity or any of that kind of energy, I don't do so well, and other players might be different, but for me, I need to be in that kind of pretty positive and creative way. “And I think that is in a way, when I see him play, he's always got a smile on his face and enjoying it and that's I feel like why he's able to do such crazy shots, turn points around that he's maybe not favoured to and pull out these ridiculous shots because it's like a coming from a place of curiosity. You know, like, can I turn this point around? It's amazing to have that on the men's side and take inspiration when I can.” Raducanu herself enjoyed a day off on Saturday, heading to the Queen's Club to watch Alcaraz in action. But she doesn't think the world No. 2 will return the favour and travel to Eastbourne this week. But no, I saw some like really cool drop volleys and I was like, yes, let's save some of that!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic's ex-coach, Boris Becker, recently made his feelings known about the Serb competing at Wimbledon. The tournament is scheduled to start on June 30 and conclude on July 13, 2025, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in London. Djokovic was last seen in action at the French Open, where he delivered a significant performance and reached the semi-finals. Following his arrival, he shared a picture of him on X and wrote: This post drew the attention of his former coach, Becker, who couldn't contain his excitement about him competing in the event and shared a three-word message of support for Djokovic. Shortly after Novak Djokovic's quest to win his 25th Grand Slam title ended after his loss to Jannik Sinner in the semi-final, the Serb sat for a post-match press conference. Here, he revealed that the 2025 French Open could have been his last appearance at Roland Garros. Calling it a wonderful match, he said: (As quoted by tennis.com) Talking about his wish to compete at the French Open again, he added: An English Honors graduate, Nancy is a journalist at Sportskeeda covering US Olympic sports. She has a total experience of 4 years, having previously worked as a Marketing Executive for BYJU'S before finding her footing at SK. While she cherished each of her victories, her favorite Olympic moment happens to be the retired athlete's 10th medal at the Games. She also writes poems and plans on publishing a book.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joao Fonseca recorded his first tour-level grass-court win on Monday at the Lexus Eastbourne Open, where he moved past Zizou Bergs 6-7(8), 6-0, 6-3 to reach the second round. Competing in windy conditions, the #NextGenATP Brazilian recovered from squandering three set points in the first set to triumph after two hours and 10 minutes. First ATP Tour win on grass 🙌Fonseca comes back from a set down to defeat Bergs 6-7 6-0 6-3 in Eastbourne! “I am very happy to win my first match on grass, here in Eastbourne, in such a nice place and against a very good player,” Fonseca said. “After a tough tie-break, getting through mentally is very good. 57 produced moments of magic against Bergs, highlighted by his stunning pickup to break for 4-2 in the third set. Fonseca will hope to bring that level against World No. British wild card Daniel Evans defeated Miomir Kecmanovic 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 and Italian Mattia Bellucci beat Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world number two extended his winning streak to a career-best 18 matches, as he battled past Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7(5), 6-2 in a competitive, high-quality final. Alcaraz was fairly comfortable throughout the tournament - barring a brief scare against compatriot Jaume Munar in the second round - and will be full of confidence heading to Wimbledon in pursuit of a historic three-peat. The Czech made it through an incredibly difficult draw including Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka and Madison Keys, as well as Diana Shnaider and Ons Jabeur, before proving too strong for Wang in the decider. It's the perfect preparation for Vondrousova as she heads to Wimbledon unseeded and dangerous, making her a nightmare first-round opponent for any of the top seeds. Having reached his maiden Grand Slam quarter-final in Paris just a few weeks ago, Bublik continued his remarkable recent upturn in form, seeing off the likes of Jannik Sinner, Tomas Machac and Karen Khachanov en route to capturing a fifth career title. Speaking after his victory, a reflective Bublik admitted he was close to “calling it quits” after losing in the third round of Wimbledon last year. Finally, in Nottingham, McCartney Kessler claimed her third title in the space of 10 months after a hard-fought 6-4, 7-5 victory over Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska. It was a desperately disappointing start to the grass-court season for Jasmine Paolini in Berlin as last year's Wimbledon runner-up was soundly beaten by Jabeur in her opening match. While Jabeur has plenty of grass-court pedigree, having reached back-to-back Wimbledon finals in 2022 and 2023, she has since dropped out of the world's top 50 after a dismal 12 months on tour, so Paolini winning just four games in their Berlin clash came as a major surprise. The Italian will be desperate for a more productive week in Bad Homburg ahead of travelling to SW19, where she has a significant chunk of ranking points to defend. After a bruising couple of weeks, Sinner will be keen to rediscover his A-game quickly at the All England Club as he targets a maiden Wimbledon crown. Team entries for the new-look US Open mixed doubles event were officially announced on Tuesday and they certainly didn't disappoint. The unprecedented list of star entrants also had Sinner, Iga Swiatek, Novak Djokovic and Coco Gauff all involved. Sabalenka showed incredible movement on the grass against Elena Rybakina to win an impressive point in the opening set of their match in Berlin. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of notable names in action at the WTA 500 event in Bad Homburg, as Swiatek, Jessica Pegula and Paolini all look to gain some valuable grass-court momentum. Taylor Fritz and Daria Kasatkina are the top seeds in Eastbourne, while there's also an ATP 250 in Mallorca, which includes the likes of Ben Shelton and Felix Auger-Aliassime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, the tennis default rule reared its head, two players took very different approaches to playing on a deadline, and the French Open champions had mixed fortunes. 7 Lorenzo Musetti escaped a default at the French Open. The line judge was unhurt and Musetti was allowed to continue with his quarterfinal against Frances Tiafoe, which he went on to win in four sets. Then, at last week's HSBC Championships at the Queen's Club in London, Jakub Menšík and Corentin Moutet escaped serious punishment for potentially disqualification-worthy offences. According to the ATP rule book, “Players shall not violently, dangerously or with anger hit, kick or throw a tennis ball while on the grounds of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match (including warm-up). He threw it with little force, but it slipped out of his hand and spun off the grass, into the stands. There were no spectators in the first few rows, so nobody was hurt. Then on Saturday, Jack Draper received a warning for smashing an advertising board with his racket after being broken by Jiří Lehečka, but he had escaped one when he hit a ball in frustration. Whether or not a small yellow ball hit in anger hits a wall or someone's eye comes down to chance. At Wimbledon three years ago, Stefanos Tsitsipas leathered a ball into the crowd and missed a spectator by inches. Deciding whether or not to default players based on outcomes they cannot fully control leaves tennis in a situation where it will face legitimate accusations of inconsistency the next time an umpire's decision means that someone is defaulted for a similar or even lesser offence because someone has been hurt. At Roland Garros two years ago, doubles player Miyu Kato and her partner Aldila Sutjiadi were defaulted after Kato accidentally hit a ball kid in the neck when returning a ball to her — not even swatting it in frustration — because the ball kid was in tears. There have been a few spicy tennis handshakes this year, but Sunday's between Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva was the most heated of all. After Sakkari had won their first-round encounter at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany 7-5, 7-6(6), she was put out by Putintseva's curt, no-look handshake at the net. 34 from Kazakhstan who is no stranger to on-court confrontations, gave Sakkari a mock bow in response, prompting Sakkari to say “just be like a human being”. Things quickly escalated and when Sakkari came over to Putintseva's side of the net, the Kazakh told her to “go f—” herself. “F—-ing hell, I'm what?” Sakkari said in response, before adding: “Nobody likes you. This brought back memories of Andy Murray saying “no one likes you on the tour, everyone hates you,” to the Czech player Lukáš Rosol in 2015, after he felt he had been barged by Rosol at a change of ends. Sakkari was asked about the incident in her on-court interview and said: “Let me leave it here and say that I have a respect (for) her as a player but that's it.” Putintseva, who was booed at last year's U.S. Open when she contemptuously ignored a ball girl who was passing her tennis balls, then posted a photo showing Sakkari avoiding eye contact during handshakes on her social media. Quick handshakes are not uncommon on the WTA Tour, but this level of aggravation between players most certainly is. There's one player no woman wants to see next to her name in the Wimbledon draw this week: Markéta Vondroušová. One year ago, Vondroušová was preparing to defend her title at the All England Club, playing through pain in her left shoulder. A fortnight ago, Vondroušová shocked herself at Roland Garros in Paris, and not just by winning two matches and coming within a couple of games of beating the world No. Rarely has a player looked as high-spirited after a loss as the 25-year-old Czech after falling to Pegula in three sets. She showed why in Berlin last week, beating Madison Keys, Diana Shnaider, Ons Jabeur, Aryna Sabalenka and finally Wang Xinyu to win the title. It's a run that tells everyone else on the WTA Tour to watch out — even though any analyst who hadn't already circled Vondroušová's entry in red would be skating on thin ice. She can spin the ball every which way. She has a mean drop shot and a nasty, low, curling cross-court forehand that can break the sideline from virtually anywhere on the court. She's got a decent chance of drawing a seed in the first round, and all 32 of them will be praying that she doesn't. The four players who reached singles finals at Roland Garros had a mixed reacquaintance with grass. So, how to regard last week's losses for Coco Gauff and Jannik Sinner? Then she showed up in Germany and played like it, losing in straight sets to eventual Berlin finalist Wang on a day when her head and heart didn't seem to be there. It was reminiscent of Alcaraz's performance at Queen's last year, when he lost to Jack Draper in the second round. Grass is probably Gauff's worst surface, unless her serve is firing and can get her out of trouble. She's not playing a tournament this week, which means she will head into Wimbledon with just one match as preparation. Sinner lost in Halle to the eventual champion, Alexander Bublik. Sinner handled Bublik in Paris a couple of weeks ago, but the Kazakh is a nightmare on grass when he is on. Sinner is a little more naturally suited to grass than Gauff, and he has made a semifinal at Wimbledon. But his first serve — key to his rise to the top of the sport and doubly so on grass — has lost some of its reliability in the past couple of weeks. Getting some reps in on that may be more helpful than a few extra competitive matches. Alcaraz spent most of the week at Queen's practicing his first delivery after almost going out of the tournament. Jack Pinnington Jones will be looking to do some more of this with his Wimbledon wild card.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Channel Nine tennis anchor Tony Jones has been dropped from their Wimbledon coverage following his controversial comments on Novak Djokovic in January. Instead, the channel will turn to its London-based reporters and fly other talents such as Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic in for commentary duties. In January, Jones made remarks about Djokovic during the Australian Open that stirred controversy and led to the network offering a formal apology. While criticising the Serb, he said "kick him out" - an apparent reference to his deportation from Australia in January 2022 as a result of their Coronavirus regulations. In comments that were slammed by the tennis world and even by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Jones said: "Novak, he's overrated. While on-air on Channel Nine, Jones said: "If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd, 'Kick him out.' "Now, I can stand here and put whatever spin on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the COVID years when he was kicked out [over his vaccination status]. It's been one of personal angst for Novak. It's quite clearly personal angst for me as well. Channel Nine also relayed their contrition publicly, stating: "Nine would like to apologise to Novak Djokovic for any offence caused from comments made during a recent live cross. No harm was intended towards Novak or his fans." Serbia's ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, decried the treatment of his compatriot, saying: "Never has an Australian athlete been insulted and disrespected in such a way by the media or any public official in Serbia." Before the commencement of this year's Australian Open, Djokovic confessed he experiences "trauma" each time he encounters Australian immigration and passport control due to his deportation from the country three years earlier. He told the Herald Sun: "The last couple of times I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration - I had a bit of trauma from three years ago. "And some traces still stay there when I'm passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is ­approaching. Wimbledon is set to kick off next Monday, June 30, with Djokovic setting his sights on matching Roger Federer's eight-title record at the grass court championships. He reached the final last year, but was beaten in straight sets by Carlos Alcaraz 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). A triumph in London would see him equal Federer and also surpass Margaret Court's impressive tally of 24 Grand Slam titles, a number with which he is currently even.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Bublik captured his first ATP Tour title of the 2025 campaign by downing Daniil Medvedev in straight sets, to claim the Halle Open for a second time in three years. Now, his triumph signifies a continuation of some red-hot form as tennis transitions from clay to grass. 1 Jannik Sinner en route to this title, ending the the Italian's imperious streak of not suffering defeat to anybody other than Carlos Alcaraz since August 2024. He then dazzled with victories over Tomas Machac and Karen Khachanov, before dispatching Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (4) on Sunday. He had never beaten the Russian in six previous meetings. Bublik prevailed in relatively straight-forward fashion, breaking former world No. 1 Medvedev just once in the match — doing so to love in the first set for a 5-3 advantage, before subsequently holding without reply to take a big advantage. He and Medvedev could not be separated until the tiebreak. 45 went on to dominate from the back of the court, while showcasing deft touches to bring Medvedev forward at opportune moments. "I was close to calling it quits after Wimbledon" His achievements of the past few weeks are barely believable after he lost motivation last year, dropping from No. Ahead of his stunning French Open round-of-16 victory over Jack Draper, Bublik said he has always balanced tennis and his personal life in equal measure, a luxury sometimes not afforded to those operating at the very elite level. But it now seems he has struck a winning balance. A Turin Challenger title, French Open quarterfinal and second Halle crown behind him, he now enters Wimbledon in perhaps the strongest form of his career. Crucially for the rest of the best in the world, he will now be seeded, meaning he can't roll up against a top player in the opening round and bamboozle them as he does done to so many in recent weeks. And Medvedev, whose defeat ended his unbeaten record over the Halle champion, knows just what a threat he could pose at Wimbledon. “I hope you are in Carlos or Jannik's draw,” the Russian said. Bublik will likely fancy his chances wherever he lands.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A tennis match in Germany ended in ugly scenes when an argument erupted at the net following a fixture involving former world No.3 Maria Sakkari, who told her opponent: "Nobody likes you". In an opening-round match at the Bad Homburg Open a week out from the start of Wimbledon, Sakkari overcame Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan 7-5, 7-6(6). Sakkari, who hails from Greece, then accused Putintseva of not looking her in the eye as they shook hands, prompting her Kazakhstani opponent to sarcastically perform a bow.

Maria Sakkari and Yulia Putintseva in an ugly altercation. Sakkari uttered the words "f---ing hell" while walking away, before heading back toward Putintseva after hearing another comment. Simultaneously with the umpire's comment, Putintseva performed another sarcastic bow. During last year's US Open, Putintseva attracted backlash for disrespect she showed a ball girl. Putintseva apologised on social media, but also took aim at her critics. "Its [sic] kind of scary the way [the] world can judge someone from just a 3 second video, that someone post from one side, without seeing the rest on what was really happening," Putintseva wrote. "I was just playing tennis and lost a tough game, which was very close (in my opinion) to turn that match around. After the game (as you can see on a pic) i [sic] got very much disappointed and was almost crying, that i didnt [sic] do better." Wimbledon's women's and men's singles tournaments are set to begin next Monday. Sakkari and Putintseva will both play singles tennis at the London major.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veteran Channel Nine sports anchor Tony Jones will not be part of the network's Wimbledon coverage this year after being involved in a controversy with Novak Djokovic during the Australian Open. Jones has been a longtime Wimbledon presenter for the broadcaster, but he will be watching the British grand slam from Melbourne this year. Nine will be using its London bureau during the tournament and will be flying local experts Todd Woodbridge, Alicia Molik, Sam McClure and Jelena Dokic over for commentary. Jones sparked controversy in January during a broadcast of the Australian Open when he made remarks about Djokovic and his Serbian fans, including the phrase 'kick him out,' which many interpreted as referencing Djokovic's 2021 deportation from Australia. Boy, I'm glad they can't hear me,' he said. Djokovic called the comments disrespectful and later boycotted a courtside interview with the broadcaster until he received a public apology from Jones. 'If I could turn back time, right, and I know we've all got PhDs in hindsight, I think the one thing where I overstepped the mark, and this is certainly what's really sort of angered Novak Djokovic and his camp, is the last comment I made in that back and forth with the crowd — 'kick him out',' Jones said on Nine. 'Now, I can stand here and put whatever spin on that, but it can only be interpreted as a throwback to the COVID years when he [Djokovic] was kicked out [over his vaccination status]. 'Now, that has angered Novak, which I completely understand now. Nine also issued an apology over the incident: 'Nine would like to apologise to Novak Djokovic for any offence caused from comments made during a recent live cross. No harm was intended towards Novak or his fans.' In a statement, the ambassador said: 'The Embassy of the Republic of Serbia considers Mr Jones' comments [to be] totally inappropriate and disrespectful. 'Never has an Australian athlete been insulted and disrespected in such a way by the media or any public official in Serbia.'</p>
