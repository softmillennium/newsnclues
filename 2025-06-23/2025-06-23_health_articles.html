                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the leading cause of cancer-related death, lung cancer remains a noteworthy hazard to human health. NSCLC is the most prevalent subtype, accounting for nearly 85% of all lung cancer cases. Although targeted therapy and immunotherapy have improved the efficacy of NSCLC treatment, therapeutic resistance and poor patient response indicate the urgent need to find more effective therapies. Researchers from the Department of Radiation Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, published their summary (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2024.0470) on the application and future prospects of bsAbs in the treatment of NSCLC in Cancer Biology & Medicine. This study underscores the promising role of bsAbs in improving antitumor efficacy and overcoming treatment resistance. Furthermore, bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (bsADCs) combine the precise targeting capability of bsAbs with cytotoxic payload delivery, enabling selective tumor cell killing upon target engagement.According to pivotal clinical trials, bsAbs demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor efficacy and a manageable safety profile in NSCLC patients, providing a robust solution for those resistant to targeted therapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Dr. Xiangjiao Meng, a leading researcher in the study, underscores the promising antitumor role of bsAbs in NSCLC: "Primary and secondary treatment resistance has severely compromised the prognosis and survival of NSCLC. The bsAbs holds promise for overcoming therapeutic resistance and improving survival prognosis in NSCLC. " Through gaining a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms of action of bsAbs and reviewing the latest clinical trial evidence, clinicians are enabled to fully understand this emerging therapeutic approach, thereby advancing the clinical adoption of bsAbs in the treatment of NSCLC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lower blood sugar and increased fat burning – without negatively affecting appetite or muscle mass. These are some of the most promising effects of a new potential drug treatment for people with type 2 diabetes and obesity, according to a new study published in the journal Cell by researchers from Karolinska Institutet and Stockholm University. The new drug, which is taken in tablet form, has a completely different mechanism of action than the well-known GLP-1-based drugs, such as Ozempic, which is administered via injections. GLP-1 drugs affect hunger via signals between the gut and the brain, but often have side effects such as loss of appetite, reduced muscle mass, and gastrointestinal problems. The new substance instead activates metabolism in skeletal muscle. In animal studies, the treatment has shown good effects on both blood sugar control and body composition, but without the side effects associated with today's GLP-1-based drugs. An initial phase I clinical trial involving 48 healthy subjects and 25 people with type 2 diabetes shows that humans also tolerate the treatment well. Our results point to a future where we can improve metabolic health without losing muscle mass. Muscles are important in both type 2 diabetes and obesity, and muscle mass is also directly correlated with life expectancy." The drug substance is based on a molecule-a type of β2 agonist that the researchers have developed in a laboratory. "This drug represents a completely new type of treatment and has the potential to be of great importance for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Our substance appears to promote healthy weight loss and, in addition, patients do not have to take injections," says Shane C. Wright, assistant professor at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at Karolinska Institutet, who is one of the researchers behind the study. This new type of drug not only works on its own, but can also work in combination with GLP-1, thanks to their different mechanisms of action. "This makes them valuable both as a stand-alone treatment and in combination with GLP-1 drugs," says Shane C. Wright.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have found that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound found in cannabis, could help reduce problematic behaviors in autistic boys. The results provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and limitations of CBD as a therapeutic intervention for autism. Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In more severe cases, these behaviors can also include self-injury or aggression. While existing treatments can help manage these symptoms, there is a pressing need for effective and safe interventions to address the diverse needs of autistic individuals. Some prior studies have suggested that CBD could help reduce problematic behaviors in children with autism. However, no controlled clinical trials have addressed safety, tolerability and efficacy of this treatment approach until now. In the trial, autistic boys with severe behavior problems aged 7–14 years were split into two groups. One received eight weeks of daily CBD then eight weeks of placebo, separated by a four-week "washout" period in which no treatment was given. The other group received placebo first, then CBD. Behavioral assessments were completed before and after each treatment phase. The study's findings suggest that while CBD may have some benefits in reducing problematic behaviors in autistic children, its effectiveness is not universally established, and more research is needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential. The study, published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, was led by UC San Diego School of Medicine distinguished professors Doris Trauner, M.D., in the Departments of Neurosciences and Pediatrics, and Igor Grant, M.D., in the Department of Psychiatry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many doctors abandon a potentially life-saving medical scanning technology soon after training, because systemic barriers prevent it from becoming part of their routine practice, a study has found. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) enables doctors to perform rapid bedside scans using a portable device. This can quickly reveal life-threatening problems – including heart failure, fluid in the lungs, or internal bleeding – that can often be treated if identified in time. Although thousands of doctors in the UK are now trained to use POCUS, research, including the new study, shows that many do not continue to use it in practice after completing their training. Shock to Survival, a framework jointly produced by the British Cardiovascular and Intensive Care Societies, for example, highlights the critical role that the technology can play in diagnosing and managing conditions such as cardiogenic shock. Evidence from Prevention of Future Deaths reports similarly indicates that point-of-care cardiac ultrasound has been underutilised in assessing critically ill patients with shock, and that this has led to cases where opportunities for timely, potentially life-saving intervention were missed. The new study, by researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Exeter, and Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, identifies six "vicious cycles" that explain why POCUS is being underused. The root causes include limited expert support and workplace cultures that discourage less experienced clinicians from scanning. Researchers found that these factors created patterns of behaviour that inhibited the use of POCUS, even in settings where equipment and training opportunities were available. "POCUS is being underused internationally, but it still feels like a problem that many people are unaware exists," lead author Professor Riika Hofmann, from the University of Cambridge, said. "A lot of time and money is being spent on training, but if the working culture of hospitals doesn't support it, that investment risks being wasted." Unless we address this at the level of underlying culture, it won't be used as intended, and lives could be lost." Failure to utilize POCUS in the assessment of critically ill patients may contribute to missed opportunities for timely, potentially life-saving intervention. Our study seeks to address those concerns directly." The researchers conducted interviews and focus groups with clinicians involved in the national Focused Intensive Care Echocardiography (FICE) training programme, which supports healthcare professionals to use POCUS to assess heart function in patients with serious circulatory compromise. The participants included a range of professionals, from those just beginning to develop their scanning skills to those with extensive experience, as well as others involved in delivering or supporting its use in clinical practice. Although the research revealed some practical barriers to using point-of-care ultrasound, such as difficulties scanning particular types of patient, the standout finding was that these challenges tended to interlink and reinforce one another. One loop, for example, stems from the fact that trainees' early efforts to use POCUS did not always produce high-quality scans. This fed scepticism among experienced clinicians about how much they should be using the technology, which in turn dented the trainees' confidence and made them reluctant to use it. With few trained specialists available and limited protected learning time, trainees often struggled to get expert feedback on their scans. This limited their progress and, as a result, the development of a bigger pool of experts who could support future trainees. In some departments, scanning was not part of routine care and senior staff were resistant to its use. Trainees also worried about "treading on the toes" of senior colleagues who saw scanning as their responsibility. Without encouragement, they backed away from using POCUS, reinforcing the very norms that discouraged them in the first place. To help break these cycles, the researchers propose three practical steps that could improve POCUS uptake without adding strain to overstretched health services. "These are scalable, sustainable solutions that could work even in very busy hospitals," Hofmann said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide. In a study published in the prestigious journal Nature Cancer, researchers led by Professor Cédric Blanpain, MD/PhD, WELBIO researcher, director of the Stem Cells and Cancer Laboratory, and professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, discovered that inflammation induced by cancer-associated mutations leads to the reprogramming of mutated cells into cell states essential for tumor initiation. They discovered that cellular reprogramming events leading to cancer formation occur differently in different regions of the prostate. The ULB researchers discovered that cellular reprogramming mediated by inflammatory activation was associated with the most severe cases of prostate cancer in human. It is exciting to see that the cellular reprogramming identified in the mouse model correlates with more aggressive prostate cancers in men, suggesting that the reprogramming markers we identified could serve as a predictive biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer." Dr. Chen Jiang, first author of the article Using molecular profiling during prostate tumor initiation, the researchers identified that inflammatory activation is a key regulator of cellular reprogramming and tumor initiation. Pharmacologically blocking inflammation prevents cellular reprogramming and prostate tumor initiation. "By identifying the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular reprogramming required for prostate tumor formation, our results pave the way for new therapeutic approaches targeting inflammation-induced reprogramming, which could prevent the formation of prostate cancers and potentially other cancers," comments Professor Cédric Blanpain, the director of this study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blocking these pathways with currently available drugs effectively killed melanoma cells. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. Remarkably, blocking these pathways effectively halted or killed melanoma cells cultured in lab dishes. Two types of drugs accomplished this: antibiotics-originally designed to block bacterial protein synthesis machinery, which closely resembles the machinery found in mitochondria-and specialized energy-production inhibitors. Importantly, non-cancerous skin cells remained mostly unaffected, highlighting the safety and specificity of these treatment approaches. This discovery identifies melanoma's excessive reliance on mitochondrial energy as its Achilles' heel, revealing a therapeutic vulnerability that we can exploit with existing drugs. By pairing mitochondrial blockers with today's standards of care, we may cut off a major escape route that cancers use to resist therapy and come back." Jeovanis Gil, PhD, senior author of Lund University, Sweden Dr. Gil added that the mitochondrial-protein signature his team discovered can be measured in routine biopsy material and could serve as a biomarker to identify patients most likely to benefit from mitochondrial-targeted add-on therapies. By enabling clinicians to match treatments to each patient's tumor biology, these findings mark a step forward for precision medicine in melanoma. Moreover, because mitochondrial rewiring fuels resistance across many cancers, success in melanoma could open the door to similar personalized combination strategies in other hard-to-treat cancers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After isolating a new class of molecules from Aspergillus flavus, a toxic crop fungus linked to deaths in the excavations of ancient tombs, the researchers modified the chemicals and tested them against leukemia cells. A promising cancer-killing compound that rivals FDA-approved drugs and opens up new frontiers in the discovery of more fungal medicines. "Fungi gave us penicillin," says Sherry Gao, Presidential Penn Compact Associate Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE) and in Bioengineering (BE) and senior author of a new paper in Nature Chemical Biology on the findings. "These results show that many more medicines derived from natural products remain to be found." Aspergillus flavus, named for its yellow spores, has long been a microbial villain. After archaeologists opened King Tutankhamun's tomb in the 1920s, a series of untimely deaths among the excavation team fueled rumors of a pharaoh's curse. Decades later, doctors theorized that fungal spores, dormant for millennia, could have played a role. Later investigations revealed the tomb contained A. flavus, whose toxins can lead to lung infections, especially in people with compromised immune systems. Now, that same fungus is the unlikely source of a promising new cancer therapy. The therapy in question is a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides, or RiPPs, pronounced like the "rip" in a piece of fabric. "Purifying these chemicals is difficult," says Qiuyue Nie, a postdoctoral fellow in CBE and the paper's first author. In part, this is because past researchers misidentified fungal RiPPs as non-ribosomal peptides and had little understanding of how fungi created the molecules. "The synthesis of these compounds is complicated," adds Nie. "But that's also what gives them this remarkable bioactivity." To find more fungal RiPPs, the researchers first scanned a dozen strains of Aspergillus, which previous research suggested might contain more of the chemicals. By comparing chemicals produced by these strains with known RiPP building blocks, the researchers identified A. flavus as a promising candidate for further study. This novel approach - combining metabolic and genetic information - not only pinpointed the source of fungal RiPPs in A. flavus, but could be used to find more fungal RiPPs in the future. The researchers named these molecules, which have never been previously described, after the fungus in which they were found: asperigimycins. Even with no modification, when mixed with human cancer cells, asperigimycins demonstrated medical potential: two of the four variants had potent effects against leukemia cells. Another variant, to which the researchers added a lipid, or fatty molecule, that is also found in the royal jelly that nourishes developing bees, performed as well as cytarabine and daunorubicin, two FDA-approved drugs that have been used for decades to treat leukemia. To understand why lipids enhanced asperigimycins' potency, the researchers selectively turned genes on and off in the leukemia cells. "This gene acts like a gateway," says Nie. "It doesn't just help asperigimycins get into cells, it may also enable other 'cyclic peptides' to do the same." Like asperigimycins, those chemicals have medicinal properties - nearly two dozen cyclic peptides have received clinical approval since 2000 to treat diseases as varied as cancer and lupus - but many of them need modification to enter cells in sufficient quantities. Knowing that lipids can affect how this gene transports chemicals into cells gives us another tool for drug development." Qiuyue Nie, postdoctoral fellow in CBE and paper's first author "These compounds block the formation of microtubules, which are essential for cell division." Notably, the compounds had little to no effect on breast, liver or lung cancer cells - or a range of bacteria and fungi - suggesting that asperigimycins' disruptive effects are specific to certain types of cells, a critical feature for any future medication. In addition to demonstrating the medical potential of asperigimycins, the researchers identified similar clusters of genes in other fungi, suggesting that more fungal RiPPS remain to be discovered. "This is an unexplored region with tremendous potential." The next step is to test asperigimycins in animal models, with the hope of one day moving to human clinical trials. "Nature has given us this incredible pharmacy," says Gao. Nie, Q., et al.  (2025) A class of benzofuranoindoline-bearing heptacyclic fungal RiPPs with anticancer activities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Beckham, an insurance agent in Victoria, Texas, had seen friends suffer so badly from shingles that she wanted to receive the first approved shingles vaccine as soon as it became available, even if she had to pay for it out-of-pocket. Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. After getting her Zostavax shot, she said, "I felt really relieved." She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as a pneumonia shot, an RSV vaccine to guard against respiratory syncytial virus, annual flu shots and all recommended covid-19 vaccinations. Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated. Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, California, has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella as a child, in case her immunity to measles had waned. For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody foresaw. The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt. On June 9, Kennedy fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and later replaced them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. The phrase "Vaccines are not just for kids anymore" has become a favorite for William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Or they're recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels. More good news: Vaccines to prevent respiratory syncytial virus in people 60 and older are performing admirably. RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. Because the FDA first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided "the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context," said Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open. In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider. The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they're at higher risk of severe illness (from, say, heart disease). As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine whether the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination. More than 80% said they were "very "or "somewhat confident" about MMR, shingles, pneumonia, and flu shots. Although the covid vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety. Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines. Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. "People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated," said Pascal Geldsetzer, an epidemiologist at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study. "It's hard to know whether this is cause and effect," he said, "or whether they're less likely to develop dementia anyway." Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren't eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible. The team also found reduced rates of dementia after shingles vaccines were introduced in Australia and other countries. "We keep seeing this in one dataset after another," Geldsetzer said. In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect. By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group. How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. But, he added, "I'm now convinced there's something real here." Shingrix, now recommended for adults over 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial. And "if you needed another reason to get this vaccine," Schaffner said, "here it is."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers estimate that more than 1 billion people globally live with migraine, a neurological condition causing severe, chronic headaches that are often accompanied by other issues such as nausea and light sensitivity. The number of migraine headaches a person has each month varies depending on their situation and overall health. Those with chronic migraine can experience them for 15 or more days each month. Migraine headaches also range in severity and length of time, normally lasting anywhere between four to 72 hours. Currently, migraine is treated through medications and lifestyle changes to help stop migraine triggers from occurring, such as stress, poor sleep, certain foods, and environmental factors like strong smells, loud noises, or bright light. “Despite new advancements, there is still an unmet need in migraine treatment, imposing a substantial burden on patients,” Simone Braca, MD, a neurology resident and clinical research fellow at the Headache Centre of the University of Naples in Italy, told Medical News Today. Braca is the lead author of a new study recently presented at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025 that has found that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist medications used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity may help cut a person's monthly migraine days by about half. Braca said they decided to study the potential impact of GLP-1s on migraine based on previous work done by their research team, which suspected that a derangement in intracranial pressure control plays a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. “Since GLP-1R agonists are known to greatly modulate and reduce intracranial pressure, we therefore hypothesized that these drugs could be effective in migraine,” he said. Additionally, researchers also discovered that study participants experienced a drop in their Migraine Disability Assessment Test scores by 32 points. “(This) means that they saw their migraine-related burden drastically reduced, adding a nuanced view on their quality of life improvement beyond the raw number of headache days,” Braca said. “If confirmed by subsequent larger, multicenter, randomized, and controlled studies, GLP-1 agonists may represent a novel class of drugs for migraine prevention,” he continued. MNT spoke with Hsinlin Thomas Cheng, MD, PhD, senior neurologist in the Department of Neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, about this study. Using GLP-1 agonists may provide dual benefits in regulating CSF pressure and weight control, thereby reducing migraine frequency.” Luis Felipe Tornes, MD, neurologist and director of the epilepsy program at Miami Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, told MNT he was cautiously enthusiastic about this research's findings. “These patients were dealing with at least 15 headache days a month, and on average, they had 11 fewer days after taking the medication for just three months. And the effect didn't seem to be from weight loss — it may be helping by reducing intracranial pressure, which opens up a whole new way to think about treating migraines.”— Luis Felipe Tornes, MD MNT also spoke with Hao Huang, MD, a neurologist at Hackensack University Medical Center and assistant professor of Neurology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine in New Jersey, about this research. Erica Diebold tells the story of her relationship with chronic migraine. Saxenda (liraglutide) is a brand-name drug used for weight management in certain people. Ozempic (semaglutide) is a prescription injection that helps manage blood sugar levels and lower risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with type 2… In this edition of Medical Myths, we investigate 11 misconceptions about weight loss.</p>
