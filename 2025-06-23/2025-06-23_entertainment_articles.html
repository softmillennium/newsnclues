Gellar, who reprises the role of Buffy Summers for the Hulu pilot, said during the Filming Italy Sardegna Festival that she is determined to have her fellow alums return — even if their characters already died onscreen. “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” aired on the WB for five seasons from 1997 to 2001 before moving to UPN for two more seasons. Related Stories IndieWire Wins Four Southern California Journalism Awards, Including Best Website David S. Goyer: ‘I'd Be Crazy to Say It Wasn't Weird' to Work on ‘The Sandman' Amid Neil Gaiman Allegations “It will be lighter than the last few seasons of the original,” Gellar said, as translated by Vanity Fair. “We will try to find a balance between new and old characters. My dream is to bring back everyone who has died, but space will have to be made for new stories as well.” Those new stories will center around newcomer Ryan Kiera Armstrong's character, described in the casting announcement as an introverted high-school student who is a young Slayer. Armstrong's co-leading character is also “more Willow than Buffy,” according to TVLine. What we want to explore are the space-time boundaries that affect society today.” Gellar executive produces the series and agreed to return after hearing Oscar winner Chloé Zhao's pitch for the show. “Every pitch I heard was just like, ‘Let's just do “Buffy” again,'” Gellar previously told Elite Daily of why she finally decided to agree to a revival. That's who I want to tell stories for.” Original “Buffy” star Alyson Hannigan has hinted that she might return for the reboot. Gellar also confirmed that the series would pay tribute to late actress Michelle Trachtenberg, who played her younger sister Dawn Summers during Seasons 5 through 7. “We'll be able to do something,” Gellar said. Zhao is directing the pilot, with “Poker Face” scribes Nora and Lilla Zuckerman writing the 20th Television and Searchlight TV series. “Buffy” creator and writer Joss Whedon has no involvement in the reboot.

Concurrently, “Ordinary” takes over as the most-heard hit on radio, becoming Warren's first No. The single, which Warren co-wrote, spends a fourth week at No. 1 on the Adult Pop Airplay list and a second week at No. (“Ordinary” dethrones Doechii's “Anxiety” on Radio Songs after the latter led the past five weeks; “Anxiety” hit No. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.

As the track ascends 3-1 on Radio Songs, it drops to No. 2 after seven weeks atop the Digital Song Sales chart and holds at No. 4 on Streaming Songs, following four weeks at No. Per that official stat, however obscure (but original! 1 titles, adjectives or not, continue to be fairly prominent in recent years, influenced by social media, among other factors. “Ordinary” is the third such leader this year, joining Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” and Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther.” 2 in its second week on the Hot 100. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after it launched in May as Wallen's fourth No. It rebounds for a fourth week atop  Streaming Songs (21.7 million, down 2%) and notches a fifth week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. 2-peaking “Just in Case,” which keeps at No. 4, and “I'm the Problem,” which is steady at No. 6 – as Wallen logs his fifth week with at least three simultaneous top 10s this year, matching Kendrick Lamar for the most. Wallen's I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three of his current top 10s, claims a fifth week at No. Lamar and SZA's “Luther” repeats at No. 5 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest command on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking). Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stays at No. 7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” is stationary at No. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. It posts a record-extending 66th week in the top 10 and a record-padding 96th week on the chart overall.

Barbra Streisand is having breakfast. It's Wednesday afternoon, just after 1 p.m., and the legendary artist is sharing blueberries with her three beloved Coton de Tuléars. She's happy to multitask, however, as there's work to do in promoting The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, a new album of duets that drops Friday, June 27. The sequel to 2014's Grammy-nominated Partners finds Streisand sharing lyrics with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Sting, James Taylor, Hozier, Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande and more. The roster reads like a who's who of the music business, a list that it seems only Streisand could land for one record. I'm very lucky,” Streisand tells The Hollywood Reporter over the phone from her home in Malibu. She's also counting her blessings that her voice rose to the challenge of recording 11 new songs, a feat accomplished after a grueling schedule of completing the narration for her New York Times best-selling memoir My Name Is Barbra. 'Wise Guy: David Chase and the Sopranos' Director Alex Gibney on Tony's Maybe-Death “I remember it was such a powerful moment. I opened up my mouth to sing the song, and my voice was there, which was a shock to me. I can't explain that moment, really. It's full of asides, loving commentary to one of those dogs, Miss Violet, and even one “like butta” moment with Streisand spelling it out for specificity, “b-u-t-t-a.” Streisand also offers an update on her forthcoming documentary project with Frank Marshall and Alex Gibney and whether or not she'll perform live again. I'm just splitting blueberries with my doggies, we're eating. That sounds like a great afternoon. Well, good morning to you. First of all, what an honor, I'm so grateful for the time. With all the heaviness in the world, it was such a joy to put the new album on repeat yesterday and disappear into these duets and listen to your beautiful voice all day. How do you feel about putting out an album right now? An album of love songs and duets is a nice respite from the news. It feels like you are the only living artist that could put out an album of duets and get this incredible mix of legends like Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and James Taylor with pop superstars like Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey. Can you talk about your creative process — how do you decide who to duet with and on which song? My producers, Peter Asher and Walter Afanasieff, and my longtime A&R man, Jay Landers, brought me a lot of choices. At the time, I had just finished reading my audio book [for the recording] for six weeks, five days a week, six hours a day. My voice was very hoarse, and I thought when I came to the studio to record my first song, I remember it was such a powerful moment. I opened up my mouth to sing the song, and my voice was there, which was shock to me. I can't explain that moment, really. I was never one to really warm up my voice. I was also too lazy and always busy. Prayer overtook that, I don't know. I can't even tell you what that felt like. I can't really explain it, but when I walked into the room with my producers and engineer, who's fantastic, it was like … they were applauding. I wondered, “Where did that come from?” You've never done any warmups or even tricks of the trade to keep your voice in shape? I try to, and then after five minutes I'm bored and really I have to go back to the news or something that interests me. It's a gift that I'm very pleased to have. This album is the second volume to Partners, which was released in 2014 and went on to earn a Grammy nomination for best traditional pop vocal album. It featured duets with only male singers. What sparked the invitation to duet with female singers on this one with Ariana, Mariah and Laufey? I'm an advocate of women, and I really wanted to sing with some women on this album. What were the conversations to get Mariah and Ariana together, and what was the recording process? You know what, I can't remember now. Some of the songs, I do my vocal first and then people work around me. In this case, the women wanted to do theirs, I think. Jesus, I forget things like that. Ariana is so young and powerful, she can do it fast. Mariah wanted to take her time and do it. Her process was trying it one day, and then trying it another, I think. But I was in the middle. I'm the oldest of these beautiful powerful voices. I met Mariah several times over the years, and I worked with Ariana before. She came in and joined me in Chicago the last time I sang live [at the United Center in August 2019]. We rehearsed the day before in my hotel room, and the next day we performed [the song “Enough Is Enough”]. Well, it was 70,000 people in the audience, just like the 70,000 when I sang in A Star Is Born at Sun Devil Stadium in Arizona. I went onstage that first time and said, “I know this is a rock and roll concert, but I'm going to sing you a song that I just wrote for the movie called ‘Evergreen' and I hope you like it.” That was the first time I ever sang my own song. Hearing you mention that performance, I can only imagine that when people read this or hear the song you recorded with Ariana and Mariah — or any of them for that matter — people will want to know if there's a chance you will perform any of the tracks live? I read the great interview you did with David Remnick in The New Yorker so I know that you didn't forget the recording process with Bob Dylan. You said that Bob stood on his feet for three hours with you to record “The Very Thought of You.” And that it was “three extraordinary hours.” Can you tell me more about your time with Dylan? We were all kind of scared a bit because I was told I can't bring anybody to the recording studio, not even my producers. So I was kind of scared, but thrilled to be meeting him in person for the first time. My husband wasn't allowed to come. He usually comes to my sessions. He likes to do that. Bob came with his wife. I actually gave him a copy of my book and inscribed it with something like, “You and I were 19 years old at the same time, strolling around Greenwich Village looking for work.” He was performing at the same time I was performing at the Bon Soir, my first real professional job as a singer. I wanted to be an actress, I just took those jobs and entered a talent contest before that so I could afford my apartment. It was just interesting that we have been around each other then and then years later, I think it was the ‘70s or was it the ‘80s? That's why it took me so long to write my book. I worked on it for over 10 years and had to have a researcher. What year was that?” I have no idea. It's on the tip of my brain. [Streisand, speaking directly to her dog] What's the matter, honey? You want another blueberry, sweetheart? You were talking about the book. Everybody is saying the book was 992 pages but it's not, so correct it. I was wondering why they were saying 992? It's one of those words, but my editor was interesting. She said, “Don't put everybody's name in so they could just go to the back of the book to see if they're in it.” So whatever, the point is that it's 966 pages of story. Well, people devoured all those pages. Hearing you talk about the book made me think of this other project you are working on about your life. I read last September that you're doing a documentary on your life with Frank Marshall and Alex Gibney. I guess slowly because there's a lot of work to do, and they're both very busy men. I've only seen a little short reel that they showed me and my record company. I only had one interview with them, but they've been interviewing people in my life, so that's been good. I only did one interview so far. I love the video clip you posted of Paul McCartney for your duet “My Valentine.” Paul says there were “moments of terror” recording with you, I assume because of the nerves. How would you describe your time recording? I know you want more to eat, but we finished all the blueberries. Well, he hadn't sung his song in a long time. I mean, he wrote it a long time ago. For me, I just learned it. But it was so sweet to see him. He has a huge catalog. I must've been there doing Funny Girl. Just a lovely thing to do. See, I don't remember things. I never play my own records. I also sang one of his songs, “With a Little Help From My Friends” on one of my albums. I don't remember the name of the album but anyway, he wanted to meet me and he was very sweet to invite me over then. You don't listen to the albums? How has your process changed now, when you put a new album like this one out in the world, do you engage with reviews, comments or any of the reception? I love when people get the story right. Yeah, I'm going to finish my coffee, honey. Somebody from my record company or Jay Landers or Ken Sunshine, people who have been in my life many, many years will send me something. My last question: How is life in Malibu now after the fires? We had to leave our house. I needed to take a shower. This was horrible, I mean, it shook me up between what's going on in the world now and in our country. It makes me want to get on a boat and sail away.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: After setting up her biopic project with Netflix and Chernin Entertainment, Ronda Rousey is now ready to tag in the person to take on directing duties for the film adaptation of her bestselling memoirs. Sources tell Deadline that Augustine Frizzell is set to direct the biopic based on Rousey's memoirs My Fight/Your Fight and Our Fight, which she co-wrote with her sister Maria Burns Ortiz. Chernin Entertainment is on board to produce. Deadline first reported the news of how this package came together, starting with Rousey working in WME's story group department to learn about screenwriting structure and technique. After going through dozens of scripts from others, she would ultimately pen the script by herself in just seven days, shocking her agents who couldn't believe she was a first-time writer. The script was soon taken to market, with Chernin moving fast to land a meeting and come on as producers. When it came to finding a director, everyone involved wanted a woman to help tell Rousey's story. After meeting several candidates, Frizzell came in and blew everyone away with her take for the film. A fan of Rousey long before she began directing TV episodes and feature films, sources say Frizzell had read both memoirs before she got the call to meet on it and knew right away this job needed to be hers. Following a handful of regime changes at the studio, the rights would eventually lapse, with Netflix ultimately jumping on them after exec and longtime Rousey fan Michelle Evans championed the project. What's interesting here, given how much time has passed since the first memoir's release, is that Rousey has written a second memoir, Our Fight, which goes into even more detail about her life. As for Frizzell, the rising star got her big break with her directorial feature debut Never Goin' Back, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and was released later that year by A24.

Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona are continuing their respective indie reigns: After Arjona stole scenes in “Blink Twice” (and now appears in “Andor”), and just as Johnson is helping make box office history at A24 with “Materialists,” both actresses are adding in yet another critically acclaimed hit to their summer resume with “Splitsville.” The comedy was first announced in 2024 and recently premiered at Cannes 2025. Michael Angelo Covino directs and co-writes with his “The Climb” collaborator Kyle Marvin; the duo also star alongside Johnson and Arjona as their respective spouses in “Splitsville.” Yet it's the buzzy synopsis, and not just the casting, that will turn heads: Ashley (Arjona) wants a divorce from her husband Carey (Marvin), who seeks marital advice from his friends Julie (Johnson) and Paul (Covino). Yet after Carey discovers the secret to his friends' happy marriage is being open, Carey takes it a little too far, throwing all of their relationships into chaos. Nicholas Braun, David Castaneda, and O-T Fagbenle also star. Still, the filmmakers have created an utterly endearing tale of four people trying to negotiate their own desires in the silliest ways possible with unexpected chaos around every turn.” “Splitsville” was far from the only critically acclaimed film that Neon had at Cannes: Prior to the distributor garnering its sixth consecutive Palme d'Or with Jafar Panahi's “It Was Just an Accident,” Neon nabbed “The Secret Agent.” It also had “Alpha,” “Orwell: 2+2=5,” “Sentimental Value,” and “Splitsville” going into the festival. Neon will soon release “Fjord” and “Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo” too, both of which were at the Cannes market. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With an archive of more than a thousand original movies produced over the last 15 years, Hallmark Channel and its stars have shared plenty of cute and funny bloopers with fans. Williams waited over a year to share what happened as they filmed the final scene of “Falling Together” in the spring of 2024. During what was meant to be a sweet, romantic moment, Williams wrote in the caption, “a background actor… let one rip RIGHT by where Paul and I were about to kiss.” “It's the blooperiest of bloopers and it makes me cry laughing to this day,” she wrote, and then made matters even funnier with a smattering of puns, joking, “Paul, you are the wind beneath my wings. In a scene designed to look like one of the Alzheimer's Association's annual fundraising walks, Campbell could be heard delivering his line to Williams. You really gotta listen…We both CLEARLY hear it. But the camera is still rolling so we can't react.” Trying to stifle their laughter, Williams says through gritted teeth, “We have to kiss.” After smooching, she whispers and wheezily giggles, “Did you hear that?” and Campbell kisses her again just to disguise their laughter. Many fans said they were in tears over the blooper video, flooding Williams' post with comments, including one who wrote, “I'm crying from laughter watching this! 🤣” and another who called it “the best thing ever 😂” “I have no idea how you kept your composure so well,” someone else wrote. Williams has every right to toot her own horn about the hilarious blooper from “Falling Together,” which premiered on Hallmark Channel in September. Plenty of other mishaps have been responsible for laugh-out-loud bloopers on the sets of Hallmark movies and series over the years, with stars getting tongue-tied or tripped up over what's happening on-set. One classic, seen above, is from the 2021 Tyler Hynes and Erin Krakow rom-com “It Was Always You,” in which he timed his invitation to dance just-right each time she took a swig of champagne, causing her to bust out laughing. In early June, Hallmark provided a montage of funny outtakes to “Entertainment Tonight” of Williams and Alison Sweeney filming their “To Barcelona” movies, including shots of Williams spilling Italian food on herself.</p>

'A Court of Thorns and Roses' author Maas will, with IMG Licensing, extend her well-loved characters beyond the pages across apparel, beauty, lifestyle, food, games and immersive fan experiences.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Sarah J. Maas, best-selling author known for her blockbuster literary franchises including A Court of Thorns and Roses, has signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with IMG Licensing.


The Hollywood Reporter can reveal that, under the multiyear deal, IMG Licensing will develop and manage a robust licensing program spanning Maas's entire fictional universe with the aim of creating new touchpoints for her fervid fan base.




	With over 70 million English copies sold worldwide and translations in 38 languages, Maas is one of the most influential authors of her generation with a knack for the “romantasy” genre. Hit books of hers also include the Throne of Glass and Crescent City series.

	Through the new partnership, Maas and IMG Licensing will extend well-loved characters and stories beyond the pages and into apparel, beauty, lifestyle, home décor, wine and spirits, food and beverage, toys and games, collectibles, cosplay, and immersive fan experiences, THR understands.


	“Representing Sarah J. Maas and her extraordinary literary worlds is an incredible honor,” said Samantha Chang, vice president at IMG Licensing. “Together, Sarah and her fans have created a cultural phenomenon that has redefined fantasy fiction.”


	She continued: “We're excited to launch a dynamic and carefully curated licensing program that offers fans meaningful new ways to celebrate the characters and stories they love.”


	Hulu's TV adaptation of ACOTAR, with Ron Moore attached, was officially scrapped earlier this year, but not to fear — the rights have been returned to Maas and she'll be shopping them around to different studios.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They sometimes let out a little yawn while answering questions, but Sophia, Manon, Lara, Yoonchae, Megan, and Daniela are hyped for the week ahead as they gear up to drop their sophomore EP, Beautiful Chaos, on Friday. “I feel like this era, we have been a lot more authentically ourselves. It's undeniable: Katseye is going through their biggest moment yet. The six members were handpicked after competing on the Netflix reality show Pop Star Academy: Katseye, making it to the top out of 20 finalists, chosen from nearly 120,000 hopefuls wanting to be part of a new K-pop-styled band. Their rise as a six-piece has been fast, and they've already built a massive following of EYEKONS who follow their every move. On their first EP, SIS (Soft Is Strong), they introduced their chemistry and delivered a hit, “Touch,” which became a mainstay on TikTok, thanks to its infectious chorus and fun-to-learn dance routine. With Beautiful Chaos, the group proves that their strong friendship and shining individuality is here to stay. “This isn't something you could manufacture or develop. Members of past girl groups, including Little Mix and Fifth Harmony, have frequently said that what made being in a group so difficult was having to hold in their individuality for their brand as a collective. Lara, for example, is often photographed in a bindi or wearing attire celebrating her South Asian heritage, while Daniela, who's of Cuban descent, sings the bridge to their latest single “Gabriela” in Spanish. “We really are pushed to shine individually with our strengths,” says Sophia, who's Filipina. Beautiful Chaos shows off the diversity in their styles and vocal versatility. There's pop, R&B, a ballad, and “Gnarly,” the polarizing campy single that kicked off a dance trend and quickly earned the group their second big hit after 2024's “Touch.” Manon says making their second EP felt “so authentic to who we are right now” in both their lyricism and the manifestation of their artistry, and it's also a “very transitional” EP for the group, as Sophia explains it. “We've paid a lot more attention to detail,” says Manon. The five-track EP closes with what they all agree is their favorite song, “M.I.A.” It's a stadium-ready anthem, more in line with girl groups like Blackpink, the kind of track made to be sung back by a crowd. Yungblud Confronts His Insecurities on 'Idols': This 'Was Almost My Last Chance' Lola Young Sets Release Date for New Album ‘I'm Only F-cking Myself' The Band Camino Preview New Album ‘NeverAlways' With Double Song Release “I think the production is fire and we really showed our individuality.” “It's a feel-good song and like an elevated ‘Touch,'” says Megan. “I'm excited for ‘Game Boy' because it's going to be the favorite of the Eyekons who really like our ‘Touch' era,” adds Yoonchae. During Dream Academy, Manon faced an unfair level of backlash from people who questioned her place in the group. “A lot of us got called mean girls after the documentary dropped and all these narratives started running, so it's kind of an homage to that,” Manon says. But the community has also played a closer role: For a recent performance, trans designer Gigi Goode crafted custom looks for the group, and they even posted a video dancing with Vivian Wilson, Elon Musk's estranged trans daughter. (It might've been a tongue-in-cheek nod to their Tesla reference on “Gnarly.”) For Beautiful Chaos, the group's studio process started with the girls being played songs and offered pre-selected verses and parts to try out. ‘The Onion' Mocks Congress' ‘Cowardice' in ‘New York Times' Full Page Editorial Carol Kaye Declines Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction What rings true — and is palpable even over a Zoom call early in the A.M. — is that the women have built a sisterhood that translates through their music and online interactions. “I feel like the friendship, the true bond that we have is what makes this truly so fun, even if we have a bad day or something crazy happens.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the fact that it was a U.K. court that ruled Amber Heard's allegations against Johnny Depp were “substantially true,” it is also a U.K. outlet offering Depp the most in-depth interview he's given since those legal issues began. The Sunday Times‘ Jonathan Dean describes Depp as “excellent company” who speaks in an “eventually coherent ramble,” a conversation which touches on his U.S. trial, his childhood, his marriages, and the people who turned their backs on him amid his personal crisis. “Better go woke!” he hisses about his Hollywood acquaintances who committed to “playing it safe.” And my kids will have to live with it. Depp goes on to suggest his troubled relationship with Heard was a reflection of the troubled relationship between his own parents, which he implies was violent. However, he says “it would be dumb for me to carry any bitterness” towards his ex-wife: “Eternal hatred? You want to put curses on someone? (In 2013, Depp texted Paul Bettany saying he wanted to “burn Amber,” adding, “Let's drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she's dead.” He later said these were jokes inspired by Monty Python.) “I know who I am, what that was and, look, it was a learning experience,” Depp goes on to say, insisting he has “no regrets about anything.” No bitterness, but Depp does still sound upset that his agent of 30 years testified in court that certain productions were reluctant to hire Johnny Depp because of his chronic lateness. Depp doesn't exactly refute his reputation for being “difficult” (his alleged tendency to hold up production on Pirates Of The Caribbean 5 was well-documented), but he does complain about his own stalwart loyalty not being reciprocated. “That's death by confetti, these fake [motherfuckers] who lie to you, celebrate you, say all sorts of horror behind your back, yet keep the money—that confetti machine going—because what do they want? There are people, and I'm thinking of three, who did me dirty. Those people were at my kids' parties. And, look, I understand people who could not stand up [for me], because the most frightening thing to them was making the right choice. I was like a crash test dummy for MeToo. It was before Harvey Weinstein,” Depp continues. And so I wanted from the hundreds of people I've met in that industry to see who was playing it safe.” Given the amount of people who have supported him—the likes of Al Pacino, Winona Ryder, Alice Cooper, Tim Burton, and more— it seems pretty safe to be on Depp's side, even in the wake of allegations that were proven “substantially true” in one court of law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly three years after beloved “American Idol” alum Willie Spence — runner-up to season 19 winner Chayce Beckham — tragically died in a car accident, his family and hometown have made sure his legacy will live on. On June 18, 2025, which would have been the late R&B singer's 26th birthday, the mayor of Riviera Beach, Florida, officially proclaimed the date to forevermore be Willie Spence Day at a special ceremony attended by Spence's parents, Sharon and Willie Spence Sr., according to CBS12 News. A post shared by City of Riviera Beach Florida (@cityofrivierabeach) On June 18, Spence's parents were on hand at a City Council meeting — dressed in special shirts commemorating their son — as Mayor Douglas Lawson signed the proclamation making June 18 Willie Spence Day. In addition, a special tree planting ceremony was held in Spence's honor at a local park. The following day, combined with events celebrating Juneteenth, his parents hosted and attended Juneteenth events in Riviera Beach that specifically celebrated freedom through creativity in their son's honor, WPBF reported, including youth performances and creative workshops. Aftewards, his mom Sharon emotionally told the station, “It was a great day. During Spence's 2021 audition, he told judge Katy Perry his primary goal was, “I just want my voice to reach the world and just share my gift.” Spence died on the afternoon of October 11, 2022, according to NBC News, in Marion County in East Tennessee. A few hours before his tragic death, Spence posted an Instagram video of himself in a car while in Nashville, belting out the worship song “You Are My Hiding Place.” In the caption, Spence simply wrote, “Lord you are my hiding place” and added two emojis — a microphone and the eyes-welling-with-tears face.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is like a symphony — a gorgeous classical concerto where an electric guitar occasionally cuts in to shred an off-putting, yet surprisingly sick riff. As a whole, it's weird and uneven, but there's something undeniably compelling about how those disparate parts fit together. If there's one thing Death Stranding 2 (out June 26) isn't lacking, it's ambition. This is one of creator Hideo Kojima's (Metal Gear Solid) biggest and boldest games yet — unrelentingly building on the vision and style of its predecessor. Sure, that's a lot to digest, but Kojima manages to somehow string together each discordant note into something unlike anything else in gaming (or any medium for that matter). Those who didn't like the first Death Stranding (2019) definitely won't be converted here, but everyone else is in for one hell of a ride. Death Stranding 2 takes place roughly 11 months after the first game, and while there's a lengthy intro video to take newcomers through the preceding story, it's highly recommended to have played through at least a majority of the first game. This has made post-apocalyptic delivery men called Porters, like protagonist Sam Bridges (played by Norman Reedus), essential as they can traverse the dangerous world to deliver goods, medicine, and the like. Now, as he tries to live his happy life in Mexico, Sam's life is hit with tragedy, and the UCA, once again, wants his help to spread the Chiral Network to Mexico and Australia — reuniting more of the world. As it turns out, reuniting America has left the rest of the world more unstable than ever (it shouldn't be lost on anyone that the theme of returning America to “greatness” has had dire consequences for everywhere else). Before going into more specifics on story and theme, it's important to note the gameplay formula and structure of Death Stranding 2 — as that jarring experience is so integrally tied to how players will experience the narrative. Death Stranding 2 is, at its core, a delivery simulator. Players start out making these deliveries on foot — inspired by the real-life traditional Japanese porters known as Bokka. ‘FBC: Firebreak' Is a Supernatural Co-Op Shooter That Leans Into the Jokes ‘007 First Light' Ditches Franchise Lore for a Whole New James Bond Woodkid Says Hideo Kojima Changed ‘Death Stranding 2' Because It Wasn't  'Polarizing' What's remarkable about Death Stranding 2, on a gameplay level, is that it hasn't really deviated from the vision of the first game — rather enhancing and refining it. But it's easy to see how that style of game is off-putting for some players; it's a slow burn in every regard. While Death Stranding 2 does introduce some drastic new action elements, it's still that plodding delivery simulator at its heart, and it's honestly charming to see a sequel that refuses to make concessions to be more approachable. That's not to say, however, that Death Stranding 2 isn't better than the first game — it is, in pretty much every conceivable way. There's a layer of simulation to the entire game that's remarkably compelling, giving players  vastly more dynamic options for how to travel the world and complete orders. You can unearth mines to harvest resources and build a massive monorail network that allows for seamless  travel across the continent — but that's a huge time investment. Those simulation elements also rear their head in environmental hazards. Meandering through the snowy mountains, you might also find yourself confronted by a sudden avalanche, fleeing for life from the thundering wall of snow. The world itself also feels more vibrant and alive. Different variations of BTs stalk the wilderness, requiring adaptability to overcome. Mercenaries, bandits, and a new breed of enemy called Ghost Mechs also dot the landscape, necessitating weaponry to deal with. There are also some gratuitously fun additions to combat, like a grenade that lets you capture big BTs like Pokémon to be summoned  in battle, triggering a delightful 1970s Godzilla-like soundtrack. Death Stranding 2 likes to have fun with its weird and wonderful weapons. This is essentially a perk tree for fine-tuning aspects of the game, like making canteens easier to fill in rivers or improving a gun's firing rate. It's an intuitive system that allows for a lot of mix and match customization, and a more tangible sense of reward for grinding out every location's levels. Swapping weapons isn't as intuitive as it should be in a shooter, requiring players to open menus to sift through, then drop the guns when they're empty. Little frustrations like that are still present, and that's largely because the game is still primarily focused on the walking simulator, delivery experience. One has Sam fighting in an underwater world, with moon-like gravity, where you can make giant leaps. Another has you fighting through a crumbling Inception-like monorail system, where enemy soldiers leap between the floor and ceiling. But that's what makes Death Stranding 2 so fascinating, how these big action movie moments are propped up against the majority of the game, which is largely about a meditative delivery gig. Death Stranding 2's more refined gameplay experience stands in contrast to a story that's extremely gutsy, topical, and sometimes nauseatingly self-referential. It's genuinely difficult to go into more specifics of the story as there are some major, shocking twists early on that inform the rest of Sam's journey. This is, by far, the darkest story that Kojima has ever created — not shying away from themes of suicide, depression, grief, and more. There's also a much larger emphasis on violence in this sequel, on how average people perceive it and use it, and how governments harness violence to get what they want. This manifests through both the narrative, combat, and environmental storytelling. Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna)  is a mysterious girl who causes Timefall Rain whenever she steps outside, which has made society shun her — despite the healing secret she hides. Remarkably, not a single major character is forgotten by Death Stranding 2's story; everyone feels like a vital piece in the tapestry of the narrative. And it's through their stories that we see most of the game's themes evoked — how their lives have been defined by America's obsession with gaining power, and how death defines the way they live. Sam's character arc, in particular, is remarkably moving in Death Stranding 2; it's a harrowing story of family, love, and sacrifice that goes to some genuinely unexpected places. Big action pieces are bookended by hours of monotony. Thoughtfully human moments are filtered through surrealist imagery and ventriloquist dolls. We'll be digging into its themes and messages for years, and there will undoubtedly be no shortage of debate on how brilliant, or terrible, it all is. But that's exactly why this game feels so important right now — in an ocean of sameness and trends to chase, it's undeniably its own thing. Death Stranding 2 isn't a sequel that course corrects; it doubles down and takes even bolder leaps in the opposite direction. The caveat to that, of course, is that no one but Hideo Kojima would be given the time and money to make something like this — Death Stranding 2 is like a bizarre Frankenstein monster built as a monument to the game industry idolization of its “auteurs.” It's a game molded by the unending ambition of its creators, with little guard rails put up in the process. But that's an undeniable piece of what makes the game so compelling, how it builds its themes to be utilized by the player's interpretations. This story and experience might mean something completely different to every player. ‘The Onion' Mocks Congress' ‘Cowardice' in ‘New York Times' Full Page Editorial Carol Kaye Declines Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction As the industry struggles with layoffs, cancellations, and a lack of innovation — it feels so rare to see games like Death Stranding 2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Holden discovered trance states as a child, hammering out repetitive chords for hours on the piano. Since those introductory ear- and mind-openers, the search for musical transcendence has guided both artists in their respective journeys. Holden began his career as a teenager playing capital-T trance music—gated chord stabs, energy-stoking snare rolls, backmasked cymbals, the whole kit and caboodle—before drifting into increasingly woolier strains of ambient techno and electronic improv, including latter-day krautrock, homages to Terry Riley, and pan-global folk music that calls to mind benevolent UFOs hovering above Stonehenge. Zimpel, a clarinetist by training, has moved through free jazz, Indian Carnatic music, and even a 2020 collaboration with Shackleton, the dubstep convert turned arpeggiator shaman. Holden and Zimpel first linked up in 2018, recording together in the British musician's London studio on a handful of dates—connected by a string of gigs featuring the clarinetist as a member of Holden's touring ensemble, the Animal Spirits. The collaboration yielded the appropriately named Long Weekend EP, four tracks of rippling pulses and drones built up in live overdubs of reeds and modular synthesizer, one song per day. They return now with The Universe Will Take Care of You, a six-track, 51-minute album that feels bigger and more consequential in every way, folding more ideas, intensities, moods, and dimensions into its freeform sprawl. The album begins on July 19, 2022, their third consecutive day of recording, at which point they were well and truly cooking. After a brief, breath-catching introduction that faintly recalls the vocoded lead-in to Laurie Anderson's “O Superman”—and given the title, “You Are Gods,” the reference may not be entirely coincidental—they explode into action, unleashing volley after volley of rapid-fire arpeggios that move far too fast for mere mortals to parse. Burbling and twisting, branching and recombining, they change color as they go, arpeggios erupting out of arpeggios, like jets of water in an illuminated fountain. Occasionally, an accidental melody asserts itself in a sequence of notes that somehow, by some miracle of filtering and timbre, breaks through the blur, but it'd be impossible to track every voice, much less every note; it's enough to let it all wash over you, a jacuzzi for the mind. The album shifts gears on track two, “Sunbeam Path,” recorded some six weeks later, on their penultimate day of sessions. Tinged with tremolo, Zimpel's lap steel sets a luminous, liquid scene that brings to mind a particularly honeyed strain of krautrock, bent notes and erratic tape playback lending complexity to the Neu!-inspired drones. Horn-like squiggles add movement and tonal interest; the semblance of a beat eventually reveals itself inside a lattice of shakers and bells, then dissolves, returning the song to its broad, featureless ambient horizons. “Sparkles, Crystals, Miracles” (give them credit for committing to the bit) is another wide-eyed sun salutation, kalimba-like harp plucks and strummed violin ducking through whooshing side-chain compression; the animating opposition here is that between the identifiable and the blurred, bringing to mind the tension between suggestive detail and gestural smear in some of Gerhard Richter's paintings. “Time Ring Rattles” is the album's most thrilling track, a jumble of percussive phrases that clatters like a rock tumbler gone haywire, spilling brightly colored baubles as it spins. In a coincidence that reveals the depth of their shared interests, both musicians have performed with Moroccan Gnawa ensembles, and in “Time Ring Rattles” you can hear them searching for ways to unlock some of the polyrhythmic mysteries they've absorbed in their respective travels. The credits suggest how playful the sessions must have been: Alongside the expected instruments and sounds (bells, electric piano, alto clarinet, Prophet synth) are instruments and techniques like walnuts, “blue noise,” “bucket brigades,” teacup. For all their complexity, these tunes are never difficult; they move with fluid grace and joy, buoyed by the revelatory power of mutual surprise. More phrases join in—bells, breaths, rustling noises, so many brightly colored ribbons of tone that the stereo field soon resembles prayer flags fluttering in the wind, patterns upon patterns upon patterns. Zimpel has called trance “the state of mind in which time bends”; one of the ways to achieve that state, he says, is via repetition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since closing The Book Of Carol, Dixon and his good-time buddy Carol have decided to take a Spanish holiday in the third season of this awkwardly titled Walking Dead spin-off, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Season three also welcomes Eduardo Noriega, Óscar Jaenada, Alexandra Masangkay, Candela Saitta, Hugo Arbués, Greta Fernández, Gonzalo Bouza, Hada Nieto, Yassmine Othman, Cuco Usín, and Stephen Merchant to the unending trudge of The Walking Dead. Season three, which filmed in Spain, will follow Daryl (Reedus) and Carol (McBride) as they continue their journey to somehow return home and to the ones they love. As they struggle to find their way back, the path takes them farther astray, leading them through distant lands with ever-changing and unfamiliar conditions as they witness the various effects of the Walker apocalypse.
