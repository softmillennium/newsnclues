                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin bulls proved they are ready to buy dips to $100,000 and below. Bitcoin's bounce from the $100,000 shows buyers are committed to the overarching bull trend. Select altcoins have broken below respective support levels, suggesting further weakness for mid-caps in the near term. Bitcoin (BTC) has held above the psychological support of $100,000, but the strength of each will determine whether or not the bullish trend remains intact. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes sounded positive in a post on X, saying that Bitcoin's weakness shall pass, leaving no doubt about its safe haven status. Bitcoin's relative stability compared to the top US stocks during the current geopolitical crisis shows it is maturing as an asset class. Bitwise Europe Head of Research André Dragosch shared a chart on X, showing Bitcoin's 60-day realized volatility at 27-28%, lower than the S&P 500 Index (SPX) at roughly 30%, the Nasdaq 100 at about 35% and the “Magnificent 7” technology stocks close to 40%. The failure to break out to a new high has not created panic among institutional investors, who continue to buy Bitcoin. CoinShares reported on Monday that Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed inflows of $1.1 billion for the trading week ending Friday. Inflows, despite a fall in the spot price, show that investors were buying on weakness, the report added. Could sellers pull Bitcoin back below $100,000, or will buyers succeed in pushing the price higher? How are altcoins likely to behave? Buyers are expected to defend the 50-day SMA with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to 5,580. This negative view will be invalidated if the price bounces off the 20-day EMA and rises above 6,060. That sets the stage for a retest of the all-time high at 6,147. If that happens, the index could march to 100.54 and, after that, to the 102 resistance. If bears want to retain control, they will have to successfully defend the moving averages and swiftly pull the price below the immediate support at 98.48. If they do that, the index could retest the crucial support at 97.60. The bulls tried to start a relief rally but are facing selling at higher levels. If they can pull it off, the pair may tumble to $93,000. Sellers are expected to mount a strong defense in the zone between the downtrend line and the all-time high of $111,980. Ether (ETH) rebounded off the $2,111 support on Sunday, indicating solid demand at lower levels. If the price turns down from $2,323, it heightens the risk of a break below $2,111. The ETH/USDT pair may then collapse to $1,754. Buyers are likely to have other plans. If they succeed, it suggests that the $2,111 level is likely to act as a new floor. The pair could then rally to $2,738. The bears are unlikely to give up easily and will try to halt the relief rally at the 20-day EMA ($2.15). The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($2.26), extending its stay inside the $2 to $2.65 range for some more time. BNB (BNB) broke below the $634 support on Saturday, indicating that the range-bound action has resolved in favor of the bears. That increases the possibility of a drop to the strong support at $580. If they do that, the pair could ascend to $675. Buyers are trying to start a recovery, which could face selling at the breakdown level of $140 and then at the 20-day EMA ($147). Instead, if buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA, it signals solid demand at lower levels. Related: Is XRP price going to crash again? Dogecoin (DOGE) has been oscillating inside a large range between $0.14 and $0.26, indicating buying on dips and selling near the overhead resistance. The bulls will try to start a bounce off $0.14, but the relief rally is likely to face strong selling at the 20-day EMA ($0.17). If they succeed, the pair could descend to $0.10. Cardano (ADA) continued its slide and fell near the $0.50 support on Sunday. Buyers are expected to aggressively defend the $0.50 level, as a break below it will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern. The ADA/USDT pair could then plunge to $0.40. The first sign of strength will be a close above the 20-day EMA. Hyperliquid (HYPE) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($32.63) on Saturday and again on Sunday, indicating solid buying at lower levels. If they manage to do that, the HYPE/USDT pair could retest the strong support at $30.50. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto's bouncing back, and Solana is getting a lot of people talking. As more big players get involved and the idea of a Solana ETF picks up steam, experts are starting to rethink where things might go. Some are even asking the big question: Could Solana actually hit $500 next year as some bullish Solana price prediction forecasts It's a bold call, but in crypto, big moves aren't off the table. Solana's been getting a major credibility boost lately, thanks to some big-name financial partners. Major banks like HSBC, Bank of America, and even government-backed groups like the Monetary Authority of Singapore are starting to work with a company called R3, which just teamed up with the Solana Foundation. It shows they trust Solana's speed, low fees, and ability to handle big traffic. That kind of real-world use could give Solana more staying power—and possibly boost its value down the line. Another big reason people are feeling good about Solana right now is the growing chance that Solana-based ETFs could get approved in the U.S. Some analysts think there's now a 90% chance these ETFs get the go-ahead by summer 2025. Some of these ETFs might even let investors earn rewards through staking, which means they could make passive income while holding their investment. If the ETFs launch, they could bring in a wave of money from both big firms and everyday investors. Ethereum's entrenched infrastructure, developer depth, and widespread institutional backing provide it with a durable moat. That said, Solana's edge in transaction speed and cost-efficiency makes it a compelling alternative for real-time applications, consumer-facing protocols, and tokenized asset platforms. In the evolving landscape, both chains are likely to coexist—each excelling within its own strategic vertical. Where are those tens of billions in capital needed to pump Solana coming from? Engineered to modernize the $190 trillion global remittance sector, RTX offers a compliant crypto-to-fiat bridge built for scale. Unlike Solana, whose upside is increasingly constrained by its sheer size (it's harder to pump big caps, after all), RTX enters with institutional-grade ambition and open runway—positioning it as a high-conviction, early-stage alternative with asymmetric growth potential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Shakes Off Market Chaos as Traders Pile Into Even Riskier Assets: Analysis The Federal Reserve held rates steady for the fourth meeting in a row at 4.25%-4.5%, maintaining its wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty about tariff impacts and Middle East tensions. Gold sits near $3,388 per oz as investors hedge their bets while oil's sizable dip today removes one inflation concern from the Fed's radar and shows markets don't really see a global escalation at least in the short term. But this is crypto, and while institutions might tread carefully deciding where to invest, retail traders pile into high-risk, high-reward meme coins that seem immune to macroeconomic factors. The move represents a critical test of the psychologically important $100,000 level that has captivated market participants, strengthening its position as a solid support stop. The Relative Strength Index at 58 indicates mild bullish momentum without approaching overbought territory (above 70). This "goldilocks" reading suggests Bitcoin has room to run higher without triggering immediate profit-taking. The RSI measures whether an asset is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30). When RSI drops below 30, it often signals that sellers have exhausted themselves, setting up potential rebounds. Bitcoin currently trades above its 50-week EMA (approximately $86,000 based on the chart) but faces resistance from multiple timeframe convergences. Ethereum's weekly chart tells a more constructive story, with the second-largest cryptocurrency trading at $2,285 after a major price jump in April. The RSI at 47 sits in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This middling reading often precedes directional moves, as it shows the market has digested recent gains without excessive selling pressure. Traders view sub-50 RSI during uptrends as potential buying opportunities. This low ADX reading after a strong move typically indicates accumulation before the next leg higher, particularly when price holds above key moving averages. Current price action is trading around $2,245, far below the 20/50 EMA cluster near $2,480–$2,525. It's worth noting that institutional algorithms often target these levels. That's enough for a 14.5% spike since yesterday's dip, showcasing the raw power of meme coin momentum when conditions align. In other words, yes, people are selling a lot, but not as much as a few days before, which means there are less sellers in play and a recovery could be starting. However, the ADX at 36 signals a strong trending environment. This is typical of volatile meme coins that trend hard in both directions. The bearish trend is still in play, but the lower ADX in comparison to previous days may signal exhaustion from bears. Despite its correction, Fartcoin is showing remarkable strength with a 13% surge from yesterday's low to $1.10, driven by a combination of technical factors and on-chain dynamics that suggest more upside ahead. The RSI at 38 shows a sharp recovery from oversold conditions. This is still bear territory, but shows momentum improving from extreme lows without yet reaching neutral (50). This low reading after a sharp decline often marks accumulation zones where smart money positions before the next trending move. Combined with the price bounce, it suggests a trend reversal could be developing but is not yet confirmed. The successful bounce from $0.90 support demonstrates buying interest at key technical levels known as “Fibonacci levels,” These are basically natural price zones that form between the lowest and highest point of a price movement. So, in other words, bears are struggling to take prices below that zone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin prices dropped below $100,000 this weekend, briefly trading below that crucial level as global markets responded to the latest developments in the conflict between Iran and Israel. The world's most valuable digital currency by total market value approached $98,400 on Sunday, June 22, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. Jacob Joseph, Senior Research Analyst at CoinDesk Data, commented on this decline, stating via email that “This movement has coincided with escalating geopolitical tensions involving the U.S., Israel, and Iran.” “Investor sentiment appears to have become more cautious amid uncertainty over potential U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, which has likely contributed to the broader retreat seen in risk assets,” he continued. Marc P. Bernegger, cofounder of crypto fund of funds AltAlpha Digital, offered a similar take, indicating that “Escalating geopolitical issues, particularly in the Middle East, were cited as a trigger for market uncertainty.” “Tensions between Israel and Iran may have prompted capital flight from risk assets like Bitcoin, pushing prices below the $100,000 psychological support level,” he clarified through emailed commentary. “This followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which triggered a sharp selloff across crypto markets,” he said through email. Last year, 20 million bpd moved through this straight on average, which amounted to approximately 20% of petroleum liquids consumed by the global market, according to an analysis conducted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “If disrupted, oil prices could spike, driving inflation higher,” Kwok noted. “In times of conflict, forecasting future risk becomes nearly impossible, so capital flows to traditionally safer assets. “Temporary supply disruptions rarely result in lasting inflation unless prolonged.” “Past events, like COVID's initial crash, show that such dips can offer compelling long-term buying opportunities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$103,462.15 is quickly responding to developments in the Middle East. After briefly sinking to $99,500, bitcoin has bounced back 2.9% in the last hour and is now trading at $102,400. The Middle Eastern nation carried out missile strikes against American bases in multiple Gulf countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The attack on Qatar resulted in no casualties or injuries, according to a Qatari official. Gold, a traditional haven assets, barely inched higher at around $3,380, while crude oil prices plummeted 4% during the day. Good sign," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, noted in an X post. "Generally when it comes to war and other external factors that disrupt things globally, there tends to be heavy short-term dips which later rebound depending on the severity as well as how things are communicated," said Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics firm Nansen. "So far I'd say we are seeing the situation play out similarly here." "Smart money still seems to be going a bit more risk off," he said, adding that exchanges saw some notable outflows, suggesting opportunistic investors bought the dip in prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Payments and financial services technology provider Fiserv is entering the stablecoin business. The company plans to launch a digital asset platform that includes a new stablecoin (FIUSD) that will be added to Fiserv's banking and payments infrastructure by the year's end, according to a Monday (June 23) press release. “FIUSD presents Fiserv customers with access to a new, more efficient and interoperable digital asset service for their banking and payment flows,” the release said. Offering the coin across Fiserv's network, which includes relationships with roughly 10,000 financial institutions and 6 million merchant locations worldwide, will “provide instant scale for FIUSD while creating a digital asset network that clients can use to build new products and services,” per the release. Fiserv intends to use stablecoin infrastructure from Paxos and Circle with the goal of making it interoperable with several stablecoins, and it will be available to Fiserv clients through the Solana blockchain, according to the release. “Together with our other cloud-native banking and merchant platforms, we believe FIUSD will provide our clients with the efficiency and optionality they need to thrive in the evolving banking and payments ecosystem,” Georgakopoulos said in the release. “By creating blockchain-based currencies that are pegged to fiat money, these retailers could sidestep traditional payment processors, reduce transaction fees and accelerate settlement times.” “The timing of this venture is no coincidence,” PYMNTS wrote in May. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Chrous One CIO Xavier Meegan launched Frachtis, a $20 million crypto-native pre-seed fund. Meegan led over 40 investments during his tenure at Chorus One. Now at Frachtis, his focus is on supporting technical crypto-native founders and supporting early-stage decentralized AI, infrastructure, middleware, and consumer applications. “Frachtis was created to support technical founders who are deeply committed to building exceptional and innovative crypto products,” Meegan said. Frachtis is structured as a solo general partner fund, supported by an advisory and investment committee. Brian Crain (Founder and CEO, Chorus One), Felix Lutsch (Head of Ecosystem, Symbiotic), Erwin Dassen (Head of Generative AI, Chorus One), and Mel Tsiaprazis (former COO, Bitstamp) are all on the committee. Meegan believes the crypto market is entering a consumer applications era, where the next wave of winners will come from projects that build real-world applications on existing blockchain infrastructure.

Frachtis has already invested in eight early-stage projects, including DeFi middleware project Turtle Club and decentralized AI infrastructure protocols Hyve and Bless. The fund's strategy focuses on crypto-native teams that leverage decentralized architecture from inception. The fund's launch reflects growing investor interest in decentralized infrastructure, AI, and consumer-facing crypto applications, as venture capital continues to target the next stage of blockchain adoption.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite heightened geopolitical tension risks, crypto proves its mettle with steady inflows and strong ETF performance. Digital asset investment products recorded their tenth straight week of inflows, bringing in $1.24 billion last week, according to data from CoinShares. The inflows come at a time of heightened geopolitical tension, particularly following Israel's military action against Iran. The move sparked fears of wider conflict, leading to a sharp selloff across financial markets, including crypto. Despite the volatility, institutional interest in digital assets remained firm. CoinShares' Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that inflows were strongest early in the week but later slowed. This marks its second week of positive inflows, even as prices experienced a correction. CoinShares highlighted that many investors took advantage of the dip to increase their positions, underscoring Bitcoin's growing appeal as a macroeconomic hedge. Notably, US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) played a central role in this flow, attracting $1.02 billion in net inflows. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out with $1.23 billion in weekly inflows, bringing the total assets under its management to more than $74 billion. Meanwhile, short-Bitcoin products saw minor outflows of $1.4 million, suggesting a drop in bearish sentiment. CoinShares reported that the digital asset saw $124 million in new inflows last week, pushing its total to $2.2 billion since mid-April. Meanwhile, market observers have linked ETH's inflow rise to several key factors, including the recent Pectra upgrade and increasing institutional interest in the crypto. Other altcoins also showed resilience by attracting modest inflows last week. Solana saw $2.78 million in new capital, while XRP brought in $2.69 million, reflecting continued but cautious appetite for alternative Layer 1s.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $100,000, reaching a low of around $98,200, before reversing the trend and rising above $101,000 on Monday. Major altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are paring losses while offering signs of recovery, underpinned by renewed sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market. US President Donald Trump ordered strikes on three main Iranian nuclear sites on Saturday, unleashing mayhem in global markets, which saw Bitcoin price drop below the $100,000 mark, its lowest point since May 8. The strikes dimmed hopes for a potential ceasefire, as reported by Reuters. Volatility in the market is likely to remain elevated, with traders treading cautiously. Inflows into digital asset financial products, including spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), extended the bullish streak, reaching $1.24 billion last week. CoinShares reported that year-to-date inflows have hit a record $15.1 billion. Ethereum posted its ninth consecutive week of inflows, bringing the total inflow for this period to slightly above $2.2 billion. According to QCP Capital's Monday market update, "BTC's reclaim of $100k this morning suggests that the weekend drawdown was macro-driven, with investors turning to crypto as a hedge while awaiting equity futures to open." Key monitoring levels, especially for intraday traders, include the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $99,212, which is set to serve as support, and the 50-day EMA at $102,954, a former support level that has been flipped into resistance. Ethereum's price shows subtle signs of a minor recovery on Monday, steadying during the European session, buoyed by support at $2,111 and buy-the-dip initiatives. Closing above these levels will likely boost ETH's bullish structure. Meanwhile, the leading cross-border money transfer token, XRP, shows signs of weakness despite reclaiming ground slightly above support at $2.00. If downside risks intensify, traders may want to prepare for the possibility of losses extending to lows last seen in April, such as $1.80 and $1.61. Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together, the two organizations are combining forces to expand hands-on learning, host blockchain-related events, and explore creating a full blockchain academy in the state. The goal is clear: give students more chances to learn real skills tied to crypto and Web3, and help Maryland stay competitive as tech moves fast. While many schools are still figuring out how to bring blockchain into the classroom, Capitol Tech is going all-in through this move. While blockchain education is still catching up to the technology itself, it's gaining ground, especially as demand grows not just for coders, but for people who understand how crypto works in finance, policy, and security. And for students trying to get ahead in this area, learning now is a good move. It is moving into workshops and short-term programs, many of which are tied to real projects or startup ideas. Some people even highlight the hottest upcoming crypto presales, where new tokens are introduced before they hit major exchanges. Understanding these early-stage launches, how they work, and what makes one more promising than another is becoming a valuable skill on its own. For Maryland, this partnership could also help attract more tech-focused talent to the state. In 2022, the demand for skilled professionals in the blockchain field rose by 552%, and that was three years ago, when crypto wasn't as popular as today. MDBA's mission has always been to push blockchain innovation forward across the DMV area: D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. It does that by working with lawmakers, running public education efforts, and making sure the technology is understood, not just hyped. This move also comes as other universities nationwide and worldwide begin experimenting with blockchain programs. A few large universities now offer full degrees in blockchain, while others include it as part of business or tech majors. Capitol Tech's approach focuses on practical experience and partnerships, which could give students a clearer edge when it's time to enter the job market. Training students now, while the space is still growing, makes them more prepared for what's ahead. For Capitol Tech students, this partnership is more than just a logo swap or guest lecture series. It's a chance to get involved with the tech as it changes and to explore new ways of building a future in crypto, blockchain, and beyond. Maryland might not be the first state you think of when it comes to crypto innovation, but moves like this are putting it on the map.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Given the concerns over tariffs and a potential global trade war, a growing number of investors have suggested that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) might eventually replace the U.S. dollar and become the global reserve currency. First of all, it's debatable whether Bitcoin has the right characteristics to be a true reserve currency. According to the Federal Reserve, money must serve three critical functions. And it must be a unit of account. Bitcoin does not yet meet all three of these essential criteria. Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. While Bitcoin is a store of value, it is not yet a popular medium of exchange for making everyday transactions. When was the last time that you used Bitcoin to pay for anything? Moreover, Bitcoin is not yet used as a unit of account. When you walk into a supermarket, for example, the goods on the shelves are priced in dollars, not Bitcoin. Even though Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin to be a digital currency, it really trades more like a global commodity these days. People buy and hold Bitcoin, they don't spend it. However, it is highly unlikely, to say the least. In 2025, discussion is building about Bitcoin replacing the dollar. The prospect of a global trade war, combined with an out-of-control U.S. debt load of $37 trillion, has some investors thinking that nations around the world will eventually turn their back on the U.S. dollar. A good example is the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the tariff situation gets out of hand, there is a major trade war, and top trading nations decide to meet in some far-flung foreign capital to discuss moving away from a dollar-based international financial system. Even then, it's unlikely that they would decide on Bitcoin as the new global reserve currency. That's due to one key factor: People, companies, and governments are hoarding their Bitcoin. A new report from digital asset bank Sygnum highlights the problems caused by Bitcoin hoarding. It now holds close to 3% of all Bitcoin. According to Sygnum, once Strategy holds 5% of all Bitcoin worldwide, it will become impossible for Bitcoin to ever become a global reserve currency. Similarly, a new report from Gemini and Glassnode highlights that 30% of all Bitcoin in the world is now held by just 216 centralized entities. These include corporations, cryptocurrency exchanges, Wall Street banks, ETF investment firms, asset management firms, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. So, a digital currency that was originally designed to be as decentralized as possible, embraced by billions of people around the world, is becoming highly centralized at a rapid pace. The good news, if you're a Bitcoin investor, is that it probably does not matter if Bitcoin ever becomes the global reserve currency. It's not just crypto enthusiasts who have embraced Bitcoin. It's now corporations, Wall Street banks, and even sovereign governments. It's hard not to be bullish on Bitcoin, even if the original vision of early crypto pioneers to replace the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin never materializes. Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn't one of them. Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $664,089! Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 994% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 172% for the S&P 500.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Switch to the United States site for products available in your region. The NFT market experienced a slight downturn last week, with total sales dipping by 4.3% to $90,678,150. Despite this decline, the market remains dynamic, showcasing notable shifts in blockchain-specific performance and buyer-seller activity. Ethereum-based NFTs continued to dominate the market but saw an 8.26% drop in sales, while Solana and Bitcoin-based NFTs demonstrated resilience and growth. Solana-Based NFTs: Sales increased by 6.39%, reaching $19.4 million, highlighting the platform's growing appeal among collectors and investors. Several NFT collections stood out this week, reflecting diverse buyer preferences and blockchain-specific strengths: Guild of Guardians (Immutable X): This gaming-focused collection saw a 6.62% increase in sales, totaling $3.31 million. These collections highlight the varied interests of NFT buyers, ranging from iconic Ethereum-based collectibles to emerging gaming NFTs on Immutable X. Ethereum continues to lead the NFT market, commanding a 78% share of total sales. Its dominance is driven by its established infrastructure, widespread adoption, and high-profile collections like Cryptopunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Flow and Immutable X: Each hold 6% of the market. The competition among blockchains is intensifying as platforms like Solana and Bitcoin demonstrate growth in sales and user activity. 2021 Trading Volume: Surged to $17 billion, a staggering 21,000% increase from 2020's $82 million. Wallet Adoption: Expanded significantly, with 2.5 million wallets holding or trading NFTs compared to just 89,000 in 2020. This week's priciest NFT sale was Bored Ape Yacht Club #7,398, which sold for $325,387. These high-value sales reflect the ongoing demand for rare and unique digital assets, even amid fluctuating market conditions. This uptick in participation suggests that the market remains vibrant, with new entrants and existing participants actively engaging in trading. Accurately measuring NFT trading volume is crucial for understanding market trends. Platforms like Nonfungible.com employ methodologies that exclude bot transactions and wash trading, providing a more reliable estimate of genuine market activity. This approach often results in lower transaction volume estimates compared to other sources, such as Chainalysis. By focusing on authentic transactions, these methodologies offer valuable insights into the true state of the NFT market, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. The NFT market's future remains promising, driven by innovation in blockchain technology, expanding use cases, and increasing mainstream adoption.

Web3 Harbour, in collaboration with PwC Hong Kong, will launch five action groups in August on stablecoins, funds and other critical segments

In a call to action for greater investment to accelerate the development of blockchain infrastructure, industry group Web3 Harbour and accounting firm PwC Hong Kong released the “Hong Kong Web3 Blueprint” on Monday, capitalising on recent momentum in the city.

Highlighting the “transparency, security, and user empowerment” of decentralisation, the blueprint seeks to leverage what it calls “Web3 superpowers” through the development of “five key enablers”: talent, market infrastructure, standards, regulation, and funding and economic contribution. It calls on participants to focus on open finance, trade finance, capital markets, asset management and carbon markets.

The report was put together with input from Web3 Harbour members and other industry stakeholders. Web3 Harbour chairman Gary Liu, formerly CEO of the Post, said greater private-public collaboration was among its goals, but it was primarily a guide for where the private sector should focus its efforts.

“This is us laying out what the private sector is going to be focused on so that Web3 technologies and virtual or decentralised assets become truly part of the financial infrastructure here in Hong Kong,” Liu said.

Stablecoins keep their value steady by being pegged to a reference asset, typically backed one-to-one with fiat currency such as the US dollar.</p>
