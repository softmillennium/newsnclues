                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the weekend, OpenAI removed all promo materials related to its $6.5 billion buddy-buddy partnership with Apple design legend Jony Ive and their still unannounced AI-centric device. On July 20, California federal Judge Trina L. Thompson granted a temporary restraining order against OpenAI that forced it to remove all mentions of Ive's design company, “io.” You can still find the bromance video of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Ive—who helped bring us products like the iMac and iPhone—on YouTube through unofficial uploads. A page on OpenAI's site that previously talked up its partnership with Ive now reads: “This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name “io.” We don't agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.” iyO also makes “hardware and software allowing users to do everything they currently do on a computer, phone, or tablet without using a physical interface.” Which is to say, it's an AI device company. Jony Ive and several other ex-Apple staff founded io in 2023. Since then, it poached some big-name Apple design stars, though the company hadn't released any real products in that time. It's a device that claims to replace apps by letting users talk in natural language to a chatbot that then computes for you. It requires an audiologist to make an impression of your ear and costs $1,000 for a version with Wi-Fi connectivity or even more for a version with LTE. The device maker claimed in its lawsuit it is manufacturing an initial batch of 20,000 units and is still looking to raise more funds. iyO claimed it sought some investment from OpenAI and LoveFrom, though Altman told them in March that it was “working on something competitive so will respectfully pass.” “Indeed, the parties had a series of meetings with representatives of OpenAI's principal, Sam Altman, and designers from LoveFrom Inc., a design studio founded by Jony Ive, about the prospect of iyO and OpenAI working together.” For its part, OpenAI said in response to the lawsuit it had decided not to pursue any collab or funding with iyO. The name “io” derives from a tech term referring to “input/output,” such as the “IO ports” like USB or HDMI you may find on a typical PC. Rugolo complained that OpenAI had previously sued a separate artificial intelligence company, Open Artificial Intelligence, over a similar trademark claim. At the very least, this lawsuit offers a few more slim details about what Ive and Altman have in store. In its response to iyO's claims, OpenAI said, “io is at least a year away from offering any goods or services, and the first product it intends to offer is not an in-ear device like the one Plaintiff is offering.” OpenAI further suggested whatever spins out of io will be a “general consumer product for the mass market.” There are more hearings surrounding this trademark case slated for the months ahead. The lawsuit offers yet another glimpse into the high-stakes world of AI wearable startups and just how hard it is to come up with a device that can match the versatility of an iPhone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One month ago, the messaging app Telegram summarily beheaded the online industry of Chinese-language crypto scam services: It banned virtually all accounts related to the first and second most popular marketplaces for vendors offering money laundering, stolen data, and a variety of other illicit wares to the vast criminal enterprises carrying out investment scams from compounds across Southeast Asia. Before Telegram banned the two markets' channels and usernames on May 13, they had together enabled a staggering $35 billion in transactions, much of which represented money laundering by crypto scam operations that steal billions from Western victims and force tens of thousands of people to carry out scams in forced labor compounds across Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. In terms of sales, Tudou is now enabling around $15 million a day in crypto payments, close to the $16.4 million Haowang was facilitating daily, according to Elliptic. But it was clear that these people wouldn't just give up, that they would transfer to different marketplaces,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic's cofounder. Unless these marketplaces are actively pursued, they will continue to flourish.” Elliptic shared posts with WIRED from Tudou Guarantee—now by some measures the biggest black market on the internet—which show examples of money laundering services, offers of scam website development, and vendors selling stolen personal data that scammers use for targeting. WIRED reached out to Tudou Guarantee for comment via an administrator's Telegram account but didn't receive a response. Before they were taken down by Telegram, Xinbi Guarantee and Haowang Guarantee displayed similar posts offering explicitly illegal services in all those categories and more. Like the newly ascendant Tudou Guarantee, those other “Guarantee” marketplaces didn't directly sell services, but instead offered escrow and deposit features that prevent vendors from defrauding customers. When WIRED asked Telegram in May about a report from Elliptic that focused on Xinbi Guarantee's criminal offerings, Telegram responded with a broad purge: It banned not only Xinbi's accounts but also those of Haowang Guarantee, the much larger market that had persisted for three years, enabled around $27 billion in transactions, and sold scam industry services as explicit as the batons and shackles used to imprison forced laborers in scam compounds. In a statement sent to WIRED at the time, Telegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn wrote that “communities previously reported to us by WIRED or included in reports published by Elliptic have all been taken down,” and added that “criminal activities like scamming or money laundering are forbidden by Telegram's terms of service and are always removed whenever discovered.” Xinbi Guarantee has, in fact, rebuilt at new accounts without even rebranding. It still hasn't faced new account bans, despite Telegram itself stating that the market's content violated its terms of service. “The channels in question predominantly involve users from China, where rigid capital controls often leave citizens with little choice but to seek alternative avenues for moving funds internationally,” the statement reads. "We assess reports on a case-by-case basis and categorically reject blanket bans—particularly when users are attempting to circumvent oppressive restrictions imposed by authoritarian regimes. “We've been researching these marketplaces for nearly two years now, and they're not about helping people achieve financial autonomy,” Robinson says. “These are marketplaces that primarily facilitate money laundering for the proceeds of fraud and other illicit activity." Erin West, a former prosecutor who now leads the nonprofit Operation Shamrock, an organization focused on disrupting crypto scam operations, states her accusation against Telegram more simply. Telegram's seemingly inconsistent approach to banning crypto-scam black markets may have less to do with its principles of “financial autonomy” than with trying not to run afoul of the US government, says Jacob Sims, a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Asia Center. In early May, the US Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network officially labeled Huione Group a “primary money laundering concern.” Sims argues that designation, which referred directly to Haowang Guarantee but not Tudou Guarantee, may have spurred Telegram to take action—and that it may take another similar move at the government level to push Telegram to act again. “Ultimately, last month's crackdown shows how disruptive Telegram can be when it does cooperate, but it also shows how fast the scammers are going to adapt,” Sims says. “There's no real legal culpability that tech companies have for what happens on their platform unless there's a specific case brought to their attention by law enforcement. And so, until that changes, I just don't know what incentive they have to be proactive.” Updated at 2:30 pm ET, June 23, 2025: Clarified the period during which Haowang Guarantee had approximately 296,000 users.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A startup called AllSpice.io successfully bet that electrical hardware engineering teams need their own collaboration platform, too. It allows hardware teams to collaborate on the types of documents they traditionally work in — documents that don't easily translate over Slack and email — like PCB files and electronic CAD files, both of which are used to design circuit boards. Engineers can use AllSpice to single out and comment on design aspects in these types of documents, the same way software engineers can comment on specific lines of code through GitHub. Kyle Dumont, co-founder and CTO of AllSpice, told TechCrunch that the startup has been able to find success because they haven't tried to build a new end-to-end collaboration platform but rather fill the gap between the software solutions that hardware teams were already using. “The teams that we were talking to had really integral tools already in their workflows,” Dumont said. In early tests, AllSpice not only focused on what their users commented on, both good and bad, but also what didn't get mentioned at all, Valentina Ratner, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “Some of the most valuable things that we learned were maybe the things that people didn't need or didn't want,” Ratner said. Ratner said that hardware design doesn't translate through email chains and PDFs, and by the end of Ratner's time at Amazon, she was spending the majority of her time building an internal collaboration tool to solve this problem for Amazon. The company started to see growing demand from enterprises, pivoted, and has since landed customers such as Blue Origin, Bose, and Sam Altman's Tools for Humanity, among others. The startup just raised a $15 million Series A round led by Rethink Impact with participation from L'attitude Ventures, Gingerbread Capital, and DNX Ventures, in addition to existing investors. AllSpice is also launching its new AI agent tool that helps validate engineers' designs and spot mistakes. “We've seen huge demand to find out how our hardware, [and] AI tools, can help make their teams more effective, catch these design errors, and that's exactly what we're targeting for this product,” Dumont said. The company is purposefully launching this new AI agent just in closed beta for now, with an emphasis on working with their existing partners, Ratner said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xbench, a new benchmark developed by the Chinese venture capital firm HSG, or HongShan Capital Group, might help to sidestep that issue. That's thanks to the way it evaluates models not only on the ability to pass arbitrary tests, like most other benchmarks, but also on the ability to execute real-world tasks, which is more unusual. This week the company is making part of its question set open-source and letting anyone use for free. The team has also released a leaderboard comparing how mainstream AI models stack up when tested on Xbench. (ChatGPT o3 ranked first across all categories, though ByteDance's Doubao, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok all still did pretty well, as did Claude Sonnet.) Development of the benchmark at HongShan began in 2022, following ChatGPT's breakout success, as an internal tool for assessing which models are worth investing in. Since then, led by partner Gong Yuan, the team has steadily expanded the system, bringing in outside researchers and professionals to help refine it. One is similar to traditional benchmarking: an academic test that gauges a model's aptitude on various subjects. Xbench's methods for assessing raw intelligence currently include two components: Xbench-ScienceQA and Xbench-DeepResearch. ScienceQA isn't a radical departure from existing postgraduate-level STEM benchmarks like GPQA and SuperGPQA. DeepResearch, by contrast, focuses on a model's ability to navigate the Chinese-language web. Ten subject-matter experts created 100 questions in music, history, finance, and literature—questions that can't just be googled but require significant research to answer. Scoring favors breadth of sources, factual consistency, and a model's willingness to admit when there isn't enough data. A question in the publicized collection is “How many Chinese cities in the three northwestern provinces border a foreign country?” (It's 12, and only 33% of models tested got it right, if you are wondering.) On the company's website, the researchers said they want to add more dimensions to the test—for example, aspects like how creative a model is in its problem solving, how collaborative it is when working with other models, and how reliable it is. To assess models' real-world readiness, the team worked with experts to develop tasks modeled on actual workflows, initially in recruitment and marketing. For example, one task asks a model to source five qualified battery engineer candidates and justify each pick. Another asks it to match advertisers with appropriate short-video creators from a pool of over 800 influencers. The website also teases upcoming categories, including finance, legal, accounting, and design. The question sets for these categories have not yet been open-sourced. ChatGPT-o3 again ranks first in both of the current professional categories. For marketing, Claude, Grok, and Gemini all perform well. “It is really difficult for benchmarks to include things that are so hard to quantify,” says Zihan Zheng, the lead researcher on a new benchmark called LiveCodeBench Pro and a student at NYU. Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and his most vocal supporters have been using disinformation, fake videos, and mental gymnastics to try to spin the US military's bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites as a complete and total victory that signals the end of a war instead of the beginning. But rather than relying on information from his own intelligence agencies, satellite imagery, or on-the-ground reporting, Trump instead posted on Truth Social a screenshot of an X post from an anonymous account that claims to conduct open source intelligence investigations. Trump followed this up by claiming in a press conference that Fordow had been “completely and totally obliterated.” It immediately became clear that the triumphant declarations were likely premature, with Trump's own military officials pushing back against his assessment. “It would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there,” said General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump's early declarations of success on Truth Social set the tone, though—and appear to have inspired others. Fox News host Sean Hannity, among the loudest proponents for bombing Iran in recent weeks, posted the same phrase the account Trump screenshotted did—”Fordow is gone”—on his Instagram account, alongside a video of a massive explosion. (After WIRED published this story, Hannity appeared to have deleted the post.) Hannity's post, which remains on the platform, had been viewed more than 5 million times as of Monday morning. That same video and other obviously fake videos have been shared widely on platforms like X, Facebook, and TikTok, with accounts also claiming they show explosions at Fordow. In some cases, users on X asking Grok to verify the footage have been told by X's AI-powered chatbot that the footage is real—even though it is not. “Obliteration is the accurate term,” Trump wrote on Sunday evening in a Truth Social post. Trump's effort to frame the bombing as a decisive end to Iran's nuclear ambitions, while heavily disputed by arms control experts, was picked up by supporters who claimed the bombing raid had effectively ended any potential conflict. “People are celebrating the end of war.” Pro-Trump commentator Ben Shapiro hailed Trump's actions as historic on his YouTube channel: “President Trump was never going to start world war three … he played this absolutely perfectly … President Trump was not dragged into a war, he managed this with absolutely stunning professionalism.” However, just hours later, Trump raised the possibility of an extended military engagement in Iran when he suggested replacing the current leadership in a post on Truth Social. Trump's suggestion came after his own vice president, secretary of defense, and secretary of state had all declared that the bombing raid had nothing to do with regime change. A MAGA cohort had warned for weeks that any attempt to replace the Iranian government would lead to a protracted war that would see US troops on the ground in the Middle East getting involved. A top-down regime change is engineered by elites and the intel community. Kirk was mocked by other right-wing influencers for his U-turn. “Oh now it's TOP DOWN US led regime change that your [sic] against,” influential podcasters Keith and Kevin Hodge, wrote on X in response to Kirk. While some of the loudest opponents to engaging in military activity in Iran—such as Tucker Carlson—have yet to comment on Trump's suggestion of regime change, many have criticized the weekend's incidents. “American troops have been killed and forever torn apart physically and mentally for regime change, foreign wars, and for military industrial base profits,” US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote in a lengthy diatribe on X after the bombings. Meanwhile, Alex Jones, the school-shooting conspiracist and Pizzagate conspiracy promoter who filed for bankruptcy in 2022, said Trump's regime change comments would drag US troops into the conflict. “Now Trump joins in, essentially calling for regime change, that's called sleepwalking us into total war, not what we voted for,” Jones said on his Infowars show on Sunday night.

A page on OpenAI's site that previously talked up its partnership with Ive now reads: “This page is temporarily down due to a court order following a trademark complaint from iyO about our use of the name “io.” We don't agree with the complaint and are reviewing our options.” iyO also makes “hardware and software allowing users to do everything they currently do on a computer, phone, or tablet without using a physical interface.” Which is to say, it's an AI device company. Jony Ive and several other ex-Apple staff founded io in 2023. Since then, it poached some big-name Apple design stars, though the company hadn't released any real products in that time. It's a device that claims to replace apps by letting users talk in natural language to a chatbot that then computes for you. It requires an audiologist to make an impression of your ear and costs $1,000 for a version with Wi-Fi connectivity or even more for a version with LTE. The device maker claimed in its lawsuit it is manufacturing an initial batch of 20,000 units and is still looking to raise more funds. iyO claimed it sought some investment from OpenAI and LoveFrom, though Altman told them in March that it was “working on something competitive so will respectfully pass.” “Indeed, the parties had a series of meetings with representatives of OpenAI's principal, Sam Altman, and designers from LoveFrom Inc., a design studio founded by Jony Ive, about the prospect of iyO and OpenAI working together.” For its part, OpenAI said in response to the lawsuit it had decided not to pursue any collab or funding with iyO. The name “io” derives from a tech term referring to “input/output,” such as the “IO ports” like USB or HDMI you may find on a typical PC. Rugolo complained that OpenAI had previously sued a separate artificial intelligence company, Open Artificial Intelligence, over a similar trademark claim. At the very least, this lawsuit offers a few more slim details about what Ive and Altman have in store. In its response to iyO's claims, OpenAI said, “io is at least a year away from offering any goods or services, and the first product it intends to offer is not an in-ear device like the one Plaintiff is offering.” OpenAI further suggested whatever spins out of io will be a “general consumer product for the mass market.” There are more hearings surrounding this trademark case slated for the months ahead. The lawsuit offers yet another glimpse into the high-stakes world of AI wearable startups and just how hard it is to come up with a device that can match the versatility of an iPhone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fordow, a centerpiece of Iran's nuclear program and a uranium enrichment facility, was one of three sites struck by US bombs this weekend. Natanz, another enrichment facility, as well as an important nuclear research facility near the city of Isfahan, which operates three small research reactors, were also attacked. It is unclear just how much nuclear material has been destroyed thus far. A political executive at Iran's state TV network said Sunday that all three sites had been evacuated before the attacks began. Experts also told WIRED that satellite imagery of Fordow from last week showed a lot of activity at the site, including trucks driving in and out. Grossi told the IAEA board Monday that Iranian roreign minister Abbas Araghchi had sent a letter to him on June 13 claiming that the country would “adopt special measures to protect nuclear equipment and materials.” “In my response, that same day, I indicated that any transfer of nuclear material from a safeguarded facility to another location in Iran must be declared to the agency as required under Iran's safeguard agreement, and I expressed my readiness to work with Iran on this matter,” Grossi said. Grossi told The New York Times that he believed that Iran had moved much of its stockpile of enriched nuclear fuel. The idea of attacking facilities working to develop nuclear power might immediately bring to mind the worst images of disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima. But experts say that even if the strikes hit crucial materials, bombing uranium enrichment sites is not likely to yield a large-scale nuclear catastrophe. Despite concerns about widespread radiation, the IAEA maintains that it doesn't “expect that there will be any health consequences for people or the environment outside the targeted sites,” Grossi said in a previous update issued Sunday. Uranium enrichment facilities contain toxic gases and chemicals, similar to what would be stored at any large industrial chemical plant. The IAEA did report in January that it had found a small amount of substantially more enriched uranium at the Fordow site.) Wolfsthal compares the damage that strikes on sites like Natanz can cause as analogous to a car accident. “You have a collision with your car or an accident, you might have a fire, it might even explode. There's a chance, he adds, that the attacks on Isfahan could have damaged casks holding uranium hexafluoride gas, a radioactive chemical compound, which could spread around the area. But damage from such an explosion is likely to be limited in scope. "It's just a big, heavy gas molecule, so it's not going to go very far," Emily Caffrey, the director for the Health Physics Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told ABC News. (Research reactors, like the ones at Isfahan, use much less fuel than commercial reactors and operate at much lower temperatures, making them less dangerous in the event of an accident.) In comments delivered a day before the US strikes, Grossi said that a strike on the plant “could result in a very high release of radioactivity to the environment.” The Israeli government said last week that its own strikes had hit Bushehr, but Israeli officials later walked back these claims. There is also a larger, more long-term environmental threat at hand: the chance that Iran takes final steps following these attacks to actually build a nuclear weapon. “It is not lost on anybody that Israel and the United States both have nuclear weapons and have attacked Iran, that does not,” Wolfsthal says. North Korea, which has nuclear weapons, is sitting pretty. “One thing is certain, and this is the simple truth: We will not be safer if there are more nuclear weapons in more states around the world,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two U.S. senators have requested that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate Spotify due to allegations that the company bundled its music streaming and audiobook services into a more expensive subscription without obtaining user consent, while also reducing royalty payments to creators in the process. On Friday, June 20, U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn and Ben Ray Luján wrote a letter to the FTC, claiming that Spotify converted standard premium subscriptions into higher-cost bundled subscriptions without informing consumers. They also highlighted that existing U.S. regulations permit digital music providers to pay a reduced music royalty rate if the subscription is bundled with other legitimate offerings. This change has reportedly caused publishers to lose $230 million in the first year, according to Danielle Aguirre, executive vice president of the National Music Publishers' Association. In a statement shared with Variety, a Spotify spokesperson noted that users were notified a month in advance about the price increase and the platform offers “easy cancellations as well as multiple plans for users to consider.” New York State wants more nuclear power in a big way AllSpice's platform is the GitHub for electrical engineering teams TikTok parent ByteDance is shutting down its short-lived book publisher US insurance giant Aflac says customers' personal data stolen during cyberattack Japanese shipping firm NYK acquires Kadmos, a salary payment platform for seafarers</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok parent ByteDance's book publisher 8th Note Press is closing up shop, according to a report from The Bookseller. Through its #BookTok community, TikTok has become an irreplaceable engine for publishers to drive book sales; even self-published authors have found unprecedented success by capturing a viral moment on TikTok. ByteDance took the next logical step in 2023, figuring that if the app was revolutionizing book sales, then it may as well cash in on selling its own books. While authors were drawn to 8th Note Press because it seemed like its affiliation with TikTok could drive sales, the press is now telling writers that it will shut down and give them their publication rights back. It's not clear why ByteDance has shut down the press after such a short lifespan. The company has not responded to TechCrunch's request for comment, nor has it responded to requests from any other outlets thus far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aflac, one of the largest insurance companies in the United States, says hackers stole an unknown quantity of its customers' personal information from its network during a cyberattack earlier this month. Aflac, which provides supplemental insurance to individuals whose expenses are not covered by their primary providers, said it was not yet known how many customers are affected by the data breach but that the personal data includes customers' claims, such as Social Security numbers and health information. Aflac said its systems were not affected by ransomware, but attributed the breach to an unspecified cybercrime group known to be targeting the U.S. insurance industry. An Aflac spokesperson, who did not provide their name, declined to answer TechCrunch's questions when reached by email on Monday. John Hultquist, the chief analyst for Google's threat intelligence unit, said last week that the unit was “aware of multiple intrusions” in the U.S. that bear the hallmarks of activity linked to Scattered Spider, a loose-knit collective of hackers and tactics that rely on social engineering tactics and sometimes threats of violence to target company help desks and call centers in order to gain access to their networks. The hackers are also reportedly behind the recent intrusions at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies, which disclosed cyberattacks this month, with disruption ongoing.

A new report claims that Chinese AI juggernaut DeepSeek is helping China's military and intelligence operations, and may have even used shell companies to help procure Nvidia chips that are otherwise covered by export restrictions that prevent their sale to China, according to Reuters. A senior State Department official told Reuters," We understand that DeepSeek has willingly provided and will likely continue to provide support to China's military and intelligence operations, adding the effort goes "above and beyond" open-source access to DeepSeek's AI models. It is claimed DeepSeek has access to "large volumes" of Nvidia's H100 chip, which has been covered by Washington export restrictions since 2022. It is alleged by the official in the interview that DeepSeek tried to use Southeast Asia shell companies to get around the restrictions, but wouldn't be drawn on whether it was successful in its endeavours. The news is a continuing sign that Chinese companies are trying their level best to skirt U.S. export restrictions to get their hands on Nvidia's coveted hardware. It follows reports of Chinese companies flying hard drives to Malaysia in suitcases to try and train AI models using Nvidia hardware in rented servers, a phenomenon Malaysia is now investigating. Notably, it is claimed that the number is much smaller than the 50,000 chips alleged by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang in January. Perhaps understandably, Reuters was not able to verify the number of H100 chips DeepSeek may or may not have, but Nvidia denies the claim. "Our review indicates that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100," Nvidia told Reuters. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most important elements for these lightweight clamshells are normally whether it can load webpages fast, has a long-enough battery, and if it has a quality display for your average Netflix and chill session. With its latest update, Google and Lenovo are asking consumers if they are willing to drop more money on a Chromebook that's more powerful to potentially run a few AI apps on-device. The $650 Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 doesn't have your average low-end chip made for lightweight PCs. The laptop sports 16GB of RAM alongside MediaTek's Kompanio Ultra chip. On paper, the Chromebook Plus 14 has some impressive specs, including an 11-core, ray tracing-capable GPU for those few games or 3D apps on Chromebook that support enhanced, realistic lighting effects. It's a portion of the chip designed to process AI-related tasks. MediaTek said the NPU hits 50 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. That number offers a rough estimate of how well it can handle simple AI tasks. Most “AI PC” chips from companies like Intel and AMD can support 45 TOPS. As for what AI features are available at launch, that's a little more disappointing. If you're the type to have too many tabs open simultaneously, it could prove an easy way to get them all contained. While Google didn't confirm what was coming next for Chromebooks, it implied we could eventually see some Gemini Nano language model integration on Chromebook Plus. Considering how limp Microsoft's Copilot has been on PC, it's not the kind of feature we're truly jonesing for. The recently introduced “Quick Access” key, which on some models replaced Caps Lock, can now generate AI images. Users can also access a “Help me read” function to break down a web page or document into more condensed bullet points with AI-generated text. Chromebooks, including non-Plus models, will be able to perform Google Lens image searches by either hitting the on-screen launcher button or using the screenshot tool. Google has been on an AI kick these past few years, and it's still promoting that you'll get a full year of Google One premium subscription with a handy 2TB of cloud storage. Chromebooks generally don't need anything truly special, since most people who buy one just need it for the sake of accessing browser- or cloud-based apps. Samsung's Galaxy Chromebook Plus from last year was already too expensive at $700 despite its light frame and pretty AMOLED display. Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 sports an OLED screen and what the company claims is some of the longest battery life of any Chromebook—17 hours, though that's in video streaming tests. It's also the only Chromebook that supports Dolby Atmos audio through its quad speaker system. If you're entrenched in the Google ecosystem and don't mind cloud-based work, most modern Chromebooks of even moderate quality will serve you well. Lenovo's latest seems to sit somewhere between great and overkill, but we'll need to do our own tests to see whether you should want a multimedia Chromebook, especially if you don't care a lick for Google's AI features.

A firmware update for Gigabyte's RGB lighting controller is reportedly causing issues for users, as pointed out by various social media posts online. In a recent case, Charlie (@ghost_motley) on X highlighted a concern with a firmware package for the RGB controller listed on the Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Master motherboard support page, which added support for Windows Dynamic Lighting. The firmware update in question is the Gigabyte IT5701/ 5702 RGB lighting controller firmware upgrade package with version 1.0.0.9 dated 24 November, 2024. Their PC would shut down normally; however, the CPU fan continued to spin. As pointed out, performing a quick search for terms like “bricked Gigabyte LED update” or “IT5701/IT5702 Gigabyte” reveals multiple forum threads detailing similar problems. The issue is clearly widespread and is not just limited to the above-mentioned motherboard but across Gigabyte's 600 and 700 series motherboards with RGB lighting. This ended in the RGB lighting being stuck on a rainbow pattern, and using Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software did not help either. Another user on Reddit ended up with a bricked Gigabyte B650E Aorus Elite AX V2 motherboard after attempting the same IT5701/5702 RGB controller firmware update. We have reached out to Gigabyte for a statement regarding the issue; however, the company wasn't immediately available for comment. For now, users of Gigabyte 600 and 700 series motherboards are advised to avoid flashing the IT5701/5702 RGB controller firmware update. In addition to that, updating the firmware using the Gigabyte Control Center (GCC) utility for Windows can also potentially create problems; thus, we do not recommend taking that path. A possible solution for those who were unable to successfully apply the update is this guide, which explains the issue and offers a step-by-step process on how to safely update the RGB controller firmware and possibly fix the issue. However, if this process still does not solve the problem, you may have a hardware-level issue and need to visit the Gigabyte service center.

An Asus ROG Astral LC RTX 5090 has been shunt modded, resulting in its performance eclipsing the $10,000 RTX Pro 6000. This kind of PCB surgery mod is notorious for resulting in damaged graphics cards, so please monkey-see monkey-do with extreme caution. However, the video of this particular feat was put together by overclocking legend Der8auer, so everything went extremely smoothly and to plan. As briefly mentioned above, shunt modding can be dangerous to the life of your GPU. If mistakes are made, your $$$ GPU could degrade slowly, or become toast extremely quickly. Der8auer told viewers that he waited until he could get a capable AiO card for this shunt mod experiment, as it should be better at handling the greater power. All else being equal, the Astral cards offer a welcome degree of parameter adjustment and monitoring options via Asus GPU Tweak III – this will be useful later. During this initial assessment, he observed that it was hitting the standard 600W power target constantly when under load, but seemed “pretty quiet” and capable of handling more juice. But in brief, the mod is rather straightforward. The mod went well, and WireView reported about 660 to 700W being used under modest benchmark loads. That contrasts with the GPU-Z readout of around 500W. It was also observed that there was 15 to 20% more headroom left until the new power limit would be hit. Then it was decided to delve into manual overclocking, with acceptable temperatures and noise levels continuing. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. You can also see an alarmingly higher power consumption vs both the unmodded RTX 5090 and the professional graphics card with its 96GB VRAM. Der8auer was pleased and called the result “quite nice.” However, we think it is worth underlining our earlier comments about the dangers of doing a shunt mod on expensive graphics cards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A visit to one of Unifi's last remaining US polyester plants, in Yadkinville, North Carolina, can make you feel like an optimist. After driving through a sweet little neighborhood of small homes, you crest the hill and see the Unifi facility on your right: giant silver-gray buildings perched on a tidy, gently rolling lawn that looks like an advertisement for organic milk. This is the flagship factory where one of the world's most popular so-called sustainable fibers is manufactured: polyester made from recycled plastic bottles. In the last 18 years, more than 42 billion bottles have flowed globally through the owned and partner facilities of Unifi and been turned into a branded polyester fabric Unifi calls Repreve. Unifi pioneered this eco-friendly fabric, but today it is far from the only recycled polyester maker. According to Textile Exchange, an industry group that has been pushing the fashion industry to commit to recycled polyester, the apparel industry used 32 million metric tons of polyester fiber in 2019, and approximately 14 percent of this was recycled. That's the equivalent of almost 16 billion bottles a year. Traditionally, polyester manufacturers are hidden in the back of fashion's supply chain. But Unifi is special; not only does it have a strong relationship with brands, the brands brag to shoppers about using Repreve in their garments. Follow the green and blue ceiling decor as it swishes through the all-white, modern lobby of Unifi, past the recycling and compost receptacles, and into a large meeting room, and you'll see some of the wares created with Repreve: Ugg fuzzy slippers, Rothy's ballet flats, Nike sneakers, Levi's stretch jeans, a Patagonia fleece, a Quicksilver fuzzy camouflage hoodie, a North Face jacket, and an Asics sports bra. Not everyone agrees recycled polyester is part of a better future. Nike is one of Unifi's biggest customers and has bragged that the sportswear brand alone diverts more than one billion plastic bottles a year from landfills and waterways. The lawsuit was dismissed, along with a similar complaint against H&M, but it expressed a bubbling resentment against corporations that use recycled polyester to green up their image without addressing the many other forms of environmental and human damage of plastic fashion. Bottle-to-polyester recycling, once thought to be a key tool in combating our global plastic pollution problem, has been under fire for a few years. “We've been led to believe that recycled and sustainable are synonymous, when they are anything but,” Maxine Bédat, executive director of the New Standard Institute, a nonprofit pushing for a sustainable fashion industry, told The Guardian in 2021. Or, as many now claim, is it greenwashing, a get-out-of-jail-free card for brands who want to look like they're saving the planet while going on with their toxic, fossil-fueled business as usual? Over the past two years, that question has morphed into an even more fraught one: Does this factory provide the kind of good, safe factory jobs that Americans say they yearn for, and that Trump's proposed tariffs purport to bring back to our shores? Unifi CEO Eddie Ingle may look like one of the North Carolina good ol' textile boys—gray hair parted to the side, a neat button down and slacks—but he has a clipped Irish accent, visits the farmers market on Saturdays, and drives a Tesla. He started out as an entry-level mechanical engineer in Ireland, moved to North Carolina in 1987 to join Unifi, and ended up staying for 40 years, with just two years away, before returning in 2020 to take the helm as CEO. “The Unifi people, they are just good North Carolinians,” he tells me over a lunch of fried chicken and mashed potatoes in an old farmhouse that Unifi owns, and which serves as a sort of bed and breakfast for visiting fashion professionals. A lot of our managers have been here 25, 30 years.“ (A third of the company's workforce has been there that long, in fact.) North and South Carolina together used to be a leading global textile hub. The floor of a Unifi factory, where plastic bottles are processed to create synthetic yarn fiber. There are still a few textile and dye manufacturers around the Carolinas, but the bustling fabric industry in the Greensboro area has given way to pharmaceutical plants, dog food factories, and Amazon warehouses delivering Chinese-made goods. According to a (yes, self-mythologizing but extremely detailed) history book that Unifi gave me, through the late '90s, Unifi was known as a fiercely competitive innovator that went from win to win, absorbing smaller polyester companies and going public. A lot of Unifi's growth, according to its history book, came from its salesmen convincing brands to try synthetics for an increasing array of products, from drapes to automotive carpeting and military tents. Today, polyester makes up more than half of all fashion textiles produced worldwide. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, China was a huge market for Unifi. Unifi says that it and one of its biggest competitors, Macfield (with which it would later merge) were together shipping a million pounds of polyester a week to China. But, the company says, by 1985 China had greatly expanded its own synthetic manufacturing capacity, and slapped tariffs on American polyester. "Between 1997 and 2009, more than 650 textile plant facilities closed in the United States," notes the Textile Heritage Museum in Burlington, North Carolina. The Chinese government was financially supporting the growth of its textile industry; it became impossible for American polyester producers to compete. “They were selling below raw material costs,” former president Tom Caudle told the company's biographer. “For the next five to seven years we couldn't shut plants down fast enough and consolidate fast enough to keep up.” Unifi survived, though it shrank and laid off hundreds of employees, closed several plants, and stopped trying to compete with China's cheap polyester. Instead, it sources PET resin, then melt-extrudes it and does what is called texturing, covering, and twisting to turn it into high-end, functional fabrics that have built-in features like water repellency or fire retardancy. Still, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan have a way of copying our innovations, and then doing them with as much skill, for cheaper. About 70 percent of that polyester is now made in China. It was trying to recycle some bad runs of polyester that would have normally gone in the trash. (Both PolarTec and Patagonia had launched their recycled polyester fleece in 1993, though it's unclear if they launched it together in a partnership.) After years of work to create a process that would purify the waste flake so it could be made into a high-quality, white polyester thread, Unifi debuted Repreve at the Outdoor Retailer show in 2004. It also came with a ready-made marketing story, literally—Repreve products are sold with a green hang tag in the shape of a water bottle that will sometimes even say how many used bottles went into that particular product. Ingle says the fashion brands Unifi works with “don't have to compromise anything” when they choose Repreve for their garments. While rumors of fake recycled polyester dog the industry overall, Repreve is also infused with a proprietary chemical tracer, so the material can be tested to ensure it was actually made in a Unifi facility of old bottles. Since Repreve was launched, it has grown to make up 30 percent of Unifi's revenue. In February 2024, Unifi told investors it would cut costs and focus on Repreve to shore up its finances. Usually, the textile business is seen as dirty and outdated. But the Repreve factory in North Carolina buzzes with new machinery and young engineers. “Brands like Adidas, Nike, Patagonia, The North Face, they've got all these big commitments around sustainability. If they didn't have a regional secure supply of recycled yarn, there would be a lot of businesses that would just be moved to Asia,” Ingle says. When Coca-Cola first introduced its PET plastic bottle in 1978, Unifi's founder Allen Mebane worried the beverage industry would take up all the supply of PET resin. Forty to 60 truckloads of plastic waste get dropped off at Unifi's bottle processing plant per week, bought from material recovery facilities as far away as Michigan and Maine. In 2023, the CBC did a high-profile investigative piece into fashion's greenwashing, and focused most of its critique on recycled polyester. The collection rates for PET plastic started rising around the time Unifi debuted Repreve, hitting 30 percent in 2012 and hovering around there for a decade. Meanwhile, demand for recycled PET from both the fashion and packaged food industry, who have both committed to sourcing recycled material, has soared. “Because they believe the textile industry is taking their bottles.” The price of recycled bottles changes twice or sometimes three times a week. Nobody is stopping the bottle industry from doing that.” Unifi's willingness to pay more for old bottles, because it's turning them into a premium product that brands and consumers will pay more for, may be driving the market rate of old water bottles up. When I tour the bottle processing plant, large bales of crushed plastic packaging, each averaging roughly 1,000 pounds, are lined up, ready to be run through the sorting, cleaning, and flaking process. There's a clear difference in quality between the clean and uniform bales from states like Michigan, Maine, Vermont, and New York that mandate deposits of a few cents on bottles to incentivize collection, and the chaotic and dirty bales from states that treat recycling as a purely volunteer activity. North Carolina made it illegal to throw out plastic water bottles in 2009, but despite pleas to supply local industry with material so it can create jobs, a 2021 report put the state's PET recycling rate at a measly 8 percent. Ingle thinks if North Carolina passed a bottle bill that levied a 5- or 10-cent deposit on each bottle, Unifi could get everything it needs from within its borders. “Unifi is involved at the state level in various efforts to increase the recycling rates of PET post-consumer bottles,” he later wrote by email. So what we seem to have is not a demand problem, but a supply problem born of bad government policy. Kirstie Pecci, executive director of Just Zero, a nonprofit that works across the country on waste issues, sees all bottle recycling—no matter what they are made into—as more insidious. “You're giving cover to a bad practice, which is putting beverages or food in plastic. Sure, some polyester clothing is for all intents and purposes a single-use product. But not the PETA-approved recycled polyester fill inside my well-loved puffy hiking jacket, the knit uppers of my Nike running shoes, or the recycled polyester yoga leggings that I can't bring myself to get rid of because they still look perfect after seven solid years of use. But I can't imagine doing serious outdoor activities like camping, jogging, or snowboarding without synthetics of some sort. As I've reported, the fashion industry has been looking for a way to recycle polyester garments into polyester fabric, instead of relying on bottles to make more raw fabric. It has a textile take-back program in the US, and last year expanded its textile-to-textile recycling to its plants in China. And according to Meredith Boyd, Unifi's chief product officer, it is often dyed, printed, and finished with substances that would become so toxic if they were run through the high-temperature recycling process that doing so would be an OSHA violation. Last year, H&M announced that it is committing to buy $600 million of recycled polyester over seven years from Syre, a Swedish startup that chemically recycles polyester by breaking it down into monomers and then remanufacturing it. Syre says it will open its first pilot plant by the end of this year, and build more plants with the aim of producing 3 million metric tons of circular polyester in a decade, including a gigascale plant in Vietnam in 2027. When I ask, Ingle says he is excited for the new chemical recycling technologies coming up, because Unifi can buy that recycled raw material and spin it into fiber. “It took 50 years to build out the virgin infrastructure. The plastic flake that is eventually processed into Repreve recycled polyester. There are legitimate questions about whether the Unifi plant can be considered a clean and green workplace. "We do a good job of cleaning it up," he says, adding that the bags of dust that are vacuumed up are sold off, and the wastewater is filtered. Scientists are still puzzling out what microplastics do to our health, but one study found that people with IBS tended to have more microplastics, including PET and polyamide (of which nylon is one type), in their gut. While PET seems to be one of the most benign out of all the plastics, at least two studies have found BPA, a hormone-disrupting chemical, in polyester baby clothing, and a number of brands agreed to a settlement with California lawmakers in 2023 over the presence of BPA in polyester athletic shirts. In addition, water utility managers in Reidsville have alleged that Unifi and other polyester manufacturers could be potentially be sources of 1,4-dioxane, a probable human carcinogen, in the Cape Fear watershed, which provides drinking water for over 1 million people as it flows from central to southeast North Carolina. Technically, that's not illegal (especially since Unifi, along with other industrial sources and several towns, successfully lobbied against a North Carolina rule limiting 1,4-dioxane in wastewater). Because 1,4-dioxane is a byproduct of manufacturing PET resin, the EPA declared in late 2024 that almost any exposure to 1,4-dioxane constitutes an unreasonable risk to the health of polyester workers and surrounding communities. There are (very costly) ways to treat wastewater for 1,4-dioxane, so how ensuing regulations would affect Unifi remains to be seen, especially since the EPA doesn't currently seem keen to do any regulating of toxic chemical exposure. Ingle and Boyd both declined to speak in detail about these issues. Ingle responded to follow-up questions via email by writing, “We maintain active participation in The Microfibre Consortium, in order to support academic and industry research into the source and impact of fiber fragmentation from textiles into the natural environment.” And “We are compliant with all local, state, and federal regulations for all of our sites.” “We can't do this sustainably in a nontoxic way, it's literally impossible,” Pecci says. Pecci says she doesn't want to “call out that company or those people, because they might be the nicest people in the world doing the best they can with what they have.” She described for me a utopia in which nontoxic and natural clothing is all made here and then composted and recycled here. In February of this year, Unifi announced it was closing its Madison, North Carolina, polyester processing plant. It would ship some of its machinery to its Latin American plants, and offer the Madison employees new job opportunities at the Yadkinsville and Reidsville plants, which remain in service.
