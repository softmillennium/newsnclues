                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A string of previously undisclosed break-ins at Tennessee National Guard armories last fall marks the latest in a growing series of security breaches at military facilities across the United States, raising fresh concerns about the vulnerability of US armories to theft and intrusion. A confidential memo from the Tennessee Fusion Center reviewed by WIRED details four break-ins at Tennessee National Guard armories over a seven-week span. In one incident, thieves made off with night vision goggles, laser target locators, and thermal weapons sights, among other equipment. At others, intruders breached fences, tripped alarms, and gained access to supply rooms discovered in the aftermath to have been unlocked. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. In Covington, Tennessee, for example, evidence suggests intruders may have known in advance the location of a secure key control box. At other sites, attempts were made to bypass alarms and entry points. The memo, which was intended solely for law enforcement use, does not indicate that any weapons were stolen; however, a government anti-terrorism coordinator is quoted as saying: “These events are concerning not only due to the stolen items being sensitive in nature but also because of the indicators for some insider knowledge being needed for successful breach and theft.” “FBI policy prohibits confirming or denying an investigation unless in rare circumstances when publicity would help the investigation, such as in seeking a missing child or trying to identify a bank robber,” Elizabeth Clement-Webb, an FBI public affairs officer, says. The Guard did not respond to a request for comment. Initially regarded as isolated incidents, the memo cites years' worth of FBI and Defense Department reporting on what agents call “domestic violent extremists,” or DVEs, discussing plans to raid armories for weapons and gear, leading analysts to suspect organized activity. Domestic intelligence has consistently flagged violent militia members and racially motivated extremists eyeing armories as soft targets. “Although DVEs previously have stolen some lower-level military gear, the FBI has not identified any instances in which a DVE successfully raided an armory to steal heavy military equipment,” the memo reads. Between 2020 and 2024, the memo says, at least four FBI subjects discussed raiding military facilities for heavy weapons, including .50-caliber firearms and machine guns. One—a former Guard member—identified specific armories that he had served in, while describing how best to exploit their security. Extremist chatter cited by the document echos these ambitions. In early 2024, a militia-linked Telegram user proposed assessing armory vulnerabilities with help from sympathetic firefighters and sought military or law enforcement recruits for inside information. In another case, an active-duty tank commander claimed he could sway an armorer to hand over weapons, while a former Air Force contractor talked about raiding a Guard facility to seize mortars and secure land. Together, these incidents point to a persistent and ideologically varied interest in exploiting armory weaknesses. The Tennessee break-ins, meanwhile, preceded several other armory breaches around the country, underscoring a broader trend in security threats. "Especially when coupled with more recent events, the document makes clear that violent neo-Nazis and far-right militia groups continue to pose a serious and ongoing threat—and that state governments are failing in their duty to secure dangerous military hardware,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People. This year alone, thieves stole three Humvees and other military gear from an Army Reserve center in Tustin, California; raided storage containers at a Colorado National Guard facility; and allegedly attempted to steal body armor and communications gear from a US Army Ranger site in Washington. Despite repeated policy changes and years of heightened scrutiny, the nation's thousands of armories remain vulnerable to both external intruders and those with insider access. Modern security improvements have done little to deter interest in breaching them. In Tennessee alone, the fusion center memo notes that state officials have received at least 25 suspicious activity reports over the past decade, detailing attempted surveillance and theft. “It's not an uncommon occurrence,” he says, pointing to the recent thefts at Washington's Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The FBI recovered a stockpile of weapons found in the suspects' home, amid an assortment of Nazi iconography and white supremacist literature. Extremist ties to the military can run in both directions, Baumgartner explains: Some groups actively recruit veterans, contractors, and even active-duty troops to exploit their skills and access. Others will join the military explicitly to gain tactical training, weapons experience, and insider knowledge they can later pass on. Such heists could also carry symbolic weight for anti-government extremists, Baumgartner says, by casting the federal government as weaker than it appears. “To the casual observer, what it signals is that even institutions we think of as being shielded from this sort of action are not actually immune.” In your inbox: Five new newsletters by deeply sourced experts WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USAFacts, the nonpartisan non-profit organization led by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, rarely weighs in on political controversies. “Undermining trust in official statistics threatens the integrity of the data that millions of Americans — from business leaders to everyday voters — depend on to understand our economy,” the Bellevue-based organization said in a public statement after President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday. “Data about jobs, prices, and wages belong to the American people,” USA Facts added in its statement. Without citing evidence, Trump accused McEntarfer of rigging the numbers “for political purposes” and said he would replace her with “someone much more competent and qualified.” USAFacts depends on government data to generate its analysis and reports, so the timeliness and accuracy of federal numbers are critical to its work. BLS provides many economic indicators beyond the monthly jobs numbers — including inflation, unemployment, and wage data. When asked about USAFacts' take on the firing, Bateman said: “It's essential that that agency remain independent and free of political interference, as it has been for its history.” Banks are reportedly getting anxious calls from clients worried about the reliability of U.S. economic data, with JPMorgan's chief economist warning that politicization of the data collection process poses a threat to financial markets on par with Trump's attempts to influence Federal Reserve decisions. The $2.1 trillion market for Treasury inflation-protected securities, where payouts are based on BLS consumer price data, could be particularly vulnerable. “Survey response rates are certainly important for data quality,” Bateman said in a follow-up message. The spotlight on government data comes at a key time for USAFacts, as it prepares its annual “America In Facts” report for delivery to Congress in September.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI has begun rolling out GPT-5, the latest iteration of its flagship language model, to all ChatGPT users. While he stopped short of claiming the model reaches artificial general intelligence, Altman noted the latest release is “clearly a model that is generally intelligent.” He added that GPT-5 still lacks key traits that would make it reach AGI, a notably loose term that is defined in OpenAI's charter as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” For example, the model still lacks the ability to learn continuously after deployment. As part of Thursday's launch, OpenAI announced two new model variants: a lightweight GPT-5-mini and an even faster, cheaper, GPT-5-nano (which is only in the API). Pro users will still have access to pick through legacy models. For comparison, developers often use Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite since it's so cheap—GPT-5 nano is now cheaper. Starting next week, Pro users will be able to connect their Gmail, Google Contacts, and Google Calendar to ChatGPT, with other tiers gaining access at an unspecified date. “ChatGPT automatically knows when it's most relevant to reference them so you don't need to select them before you chat,” the company said in an email. Users can also choose a chat color and select from four preset personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—a feature WIRED's newsletter Model Behavior reported was in the works last week. The company's API will offer users all three models, along with optional controls for toggling between detailed or direct responses. GPT-5 can retain more information than prior models—it has a 256,000-token context window, a bump up from the 200,000-token context window available in the company's previous o3 model. That means it can better understand long conversations, documents, or code without losing track of context. OpenAI's blog post claims that GPT-5 beats its previous models on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified (scoring 74.9 percent), SWE-Lancer (GPT-5-thinking scored 55 percent), and Aider Polyglot (scored 88 percent), which test the model's ability to fix bugs, complete freelance-style coding tasks, and work across multiple programming languages. During the press briefing on Wednesday, OpenAI post-training lead Yann Dubois prompted GPT-5 to “create a beautiful, highly interactive web app for my partner, an English speaker, to learn French.” He tasked the AI to include features like daily progress, a variety of activities like flashcards and quizzes, and noted that he wanted the app wrapped up in a “highly engaging theme.” After a minute or so, the AI-generated app popped up. OpenAI also says in its blog post that GPT-5 is “our best model yet for health-related questions.” In three OpenAI health-related LLM benchmarks—HealthBench, HealthBench Hard, and HealthBench Consensus—the system card (a document that describes the product's technical capabilities and other research findings) states that GPT-5-thinking outperforms previous models “by a substantial margin.” The thinking version of GPT-5 scored 25.5 percent on HealthBench Hard, up from o3's 31.6 percent score. These scores are validated by two or more physicians, according to the system card. The model also allegedly hallucinates less, according to Pokrass, a common issue for AI where it provides false information. OpenAI's safety research lead Alex Beutel adds that they've "significantly decreased the rates of deception in GPT-5.” “We've taken steps to reduce GPT-5-thinking's propensity to deceive, cheat, or hack problems, though our mitigations are not perfect and more research is needed,” the system card says. “In particular, we've trained the model to fail gracefully when posed with tasks that it cannot solve.” The company's system card says that after testing GPT-5 models without access to web browsing, researchers found its hallucination rate (which they defined as “percentage of factual claims that contain minor or major errors”) 26 percent less common than the GPT-4o model. For prompts that could be dual-use (potentially harmful or benign), Beutel says GPT-5 uses “safe completions,” which prompts the model to “give as helpful an answer as possible, but within the constraints of remaining safe.” OpenAI did over 5,000 hours of red teaming, according to Beutel, and testing with external organizations to make sure the system was robust. “The vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that,” head of ChatGPT Nick Turley says. “Especially average people who haven't been spending their time thinking about models.” In your inbox: Five new newsletters by deeply sourced experts</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A drizzly, cool, grey morning in August feels like the perfect time to recognize that Seattle is not for everyone. Announcing that your tech startup is packing up for the Bay Area might be another way to throw a wet blanket over the Emerald City. The co-founders of Nectar Social sparked a bit of reaction after GeekWire reported Wednesday that sisters Misbah Uraizee and Farah Uraizee are moving their AI-powered social commerce startup to Palo Alto, Calif., to operate in “Valley speed.” “Right now in [Silicon] Valley, teams are working six, seven days a week because they understand this is a unique moment in technology history. That intensity — that sense of ‘we have to win this market NOW' — is harder to cultivate in Seattle where the pace, even at startups, tends to mirror the steadier rhythms of the big tech companies.” On Reddit, Seattle pride mixed with a bit of anti-tech sentiment as commenters on the story essentially said, “good riddance” and took issue with everything from what Nectar is building to how intensely they expect people to work on it. Ginzburg said the first question he asks young and unnetworked or unleveraged founders is “why haven't you moved to the Bay Area?” “In many cases, this being one of them, Seattle is just not the better place to build your company,” Ginzburg said about Nectar's move. But it also shouldn't “suck for the folks where Seattle makes sense,” he added. Nectar Social launched in 2023 to help brands reach consumers where they're hanging out on social media platforms and talk directly to them in personalized conversations using artificial intelligence. The company raised $10.6 million in a funding round earlier this summer. Misbah Uraizee said that while Seattle's startup ecosystem has “matured tremendously,” there is still a “cultural gap around early-stage risk appetite.” As GeekWire Editor Taylor Soper pointed out, the departure of this one startup echoes themes highlighted in our story last week in which GeekWire interviewed more than 20 investors and founders across the community about the state of Seattle's startup scene amid a wave of AI-fueled transformation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In July, Siyan, a UK-based Discord user, logged on one morning and found himself unable to access some of his text chats marked NSFW. The United Kingdom had enacted its far reaching child safety laws, which includes an age requirement system to verify users are over 18. Discord's updates required users to verify their age, either by government ID or a face scan. Two games in his library, Stellar Blade and Death Stranding, include a photo mode that allows players to pose a character and set their expressions; Siyan opted for Death Stranding's Sam, modeled after 56-year-old actor Norman Reedus. He dropped screenshots of his success into a discord, after which a friend posted them to X. Siyan's gambit quickly went viral, inspiring others to try with games like Death Stranding, God of War, and more. Companies like Google are rolling out AI-driven age estimation systems for Search and YouTube. On gaming platforms like Roblox, age checks are becoming a key element of safety measures. But whether by using IDs or face scanning, it's an imperfect system. Several Discord users tell WIRED they've already managed to get around face scans using video game characters. Generative AI could make this problem even more difficult to control as the tech grows more sophisticated; just last month, WIRED wrote about a startup working on AI that can create video in real-time. Users are also worried about giving companies their personal information in case of security breaches. On platforms like Roblox, where failed moderation has allowed predators to groom or even assault some children, confirming that someone is a minor—or over the age of 18—is one way to determine what features they can use. For adult content sites like Pornhub, age verification aims to make sure children cannot access pornography. Critics, however, say the systems being put into place are flawed ones, both from a privacy and protection standpoint. David Maimon, the head of fraud insights for SentiLink and a criminology professor at Georgia State University, says that the current methods of verification can still be fooled. People use many different methods to bypass “liveness checks”—security measures used to verify the user is a real person—whether that's using AI, video games, or videos of other, real people. Ash, a UK-based 20-year-old who requested his last name not be used, tells WIRED he was able to pass verification using God of War's photo mode with main character Kratos. “I didn't expect [verification] to work because of Kratos' white skin and beard, but it worked first try,” he says. Another Discord user in the UK, who goes by Antsy online, says he achieved the same results with Arma 3 and a mod that allows you to pose characters. “Arma 3 characters look very poor, nowhere near realistic, so I thought it would be a solid experiment to solidify or challenge my views on this technology.” Antsy says he and his friends consider this kind of tech “a challenge” they try to bypass. “I believe, though, that it should not be the internet's job to parent and protect its younger users." In a video from YouTuber beebreadtech, he's able to swiftly get an adult-age rating repeating Siyan's steps with Death Stranding. Other Discord users WIRED talked to say they were able to do so with games like Days Gone, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, The Sims 4, Cyberpunk 2077, Days Gone, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Gray Zone Warfare. Discord has not yet responded to WIRED's request for comment. Maimon says there are too many possible loopholes with age verification that people can slip through. Maimon says that bad actors are adept at bypassing these kinds of technologies. Even without generative AI, people can still sell videos of their faces to pass age verification. “The quality of a [fake] driver license—it's just impeccable,” Maimon says. For legitimate IDs, there's an issue with minors and who owns one. “That is a problem,” Kaufman told WIRED at the time, adding that in North America and the United States, it's uncommon for people so young to have them. “I'm hesitant to say that [photo ID] is a useful way to verify folks' age,” Maimon says, “simply because we have so much evidence suggesting that it doesn't work.” There's also hesitance on behalf of users to hand over their IDs. “I don't trust the third party services that are being used with my data, especially with how damaging data leaks can be,” Ash says. “Most of the verification apps say that they don't hold your data for more than seven days and while that might be true there's no way for me to know for sure that they are telling the truth.” There's a risk in handing over sensitive information to companies that request photo or ID verification. In July, Tea—an app where women can share their negative experiences with men—suffered a massive data breach that exposed thousands of women's photos used for verification; a second security issue, according to 404 Media, allowed hackers to access sensitive information like phone numbers, social media handles, and real names through user messages, which has been spread throughout forums like 4chan to dox and harass women. Furthermore, he's doubtful that such systems won't be exploited, whether it's by using video games or some other method. “I don't think that face scans are a useful way to verify age since people can easily look under their age and be incorrectly flagged as being under 18,” he says. Antsy, the Discord user who passed verification with Arma 3, isn't convinced websites or platforms should be in charge of verifying ages. “All you are doing by putting these laws into place is pushing young people towards corners of the internet the government can't police,” he says.</p>

Sure, that means you can work while commuting or at a temporary desk, and we respect that, but it also means you can work on your couch, or even in bed. In those times, it pays to have access to a good docking station, and you can currently get an amazing Anker 13-In-1 Docking Station for just $140, which is 30% off. That's a big discount, but it's also one that's not going to last forever, so if you are looking to boost the abilities of your laptop, act fast. Sometimes this is going to be more peripherals, sure, but a lot of the time it can be extra monitors as well. This can make it a lot easier to show off work, or even treat your laptop more like a PC at home if that's the kind of setup you have going on. This makes it really easy to have everything running through the dock itself instead of your laptop, and that makes it way easier to treat your laptop like a portable core for your whole working life. It's just a really helpful device to have for creatives, freelancers, or just those who do a lot of travelling and project work. This beast of a docking station would normally cost you $200, so being able to get it for $60 is amazing. This 30% discount isn't likely to last for very long though, so you'd better be quick if you want to secure one before it expires and you have to pay full price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump this morning called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, alleging he has conflicts of interest. This latest setback for the struggling computer chip company couldn't have come at a worse time, as Intel is in the middle of attempting a comeback. “The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Tan became CEO of the company this past March. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo regarding Trump's post. Trump's comments also come just a day after Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sent a letter to Intel's Board Chairman Frank Yeary, asking questions about Tan's investments in Chinese chip companies and their alleged ties to China's government and military. He also raised specific concerns about Tan's former role as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a position he held for 13 years until 2021. In July, the company pleaded guilty to violating U.S. export controls by selling hardware and software to China's National University of Defense Technology without obtaining the required licenses. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.” Since the start of his second term, Trump has used tariffs and trade policy as tools to push companies to invest more in the United States. CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos have all met with Trump in efforts to advance their own business agendas. Just last month, Tan had outlined his plan to reduce headcount and cut spending to make Intel more competitive with its rivals. Tan told employees in a staff-wide memo that the company will cut its workforce by roughly 15% by the end of the year and scrapped plans for new factories in Germany and Poland. “I know the past few months have not been easy. As far as its AI ambitions, Tan said the company needs to develop a cohesive stack strategy—not just chips, but also the software and systems to support them. “Our starting point will be emerging AI workloads – then we will work backward to design software, systems and silicon that enable the best customer outcomes,” Tan wrote. Now, with the President against him, Tan's plans of getting Intel back on track have just become a lot harder. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Duolingo announced on Wednesday that it beat its quarterly revenue estimates, even though the company faced widespread backlash for choosing to embrace generative AI over human workers. In April, CEO Luis von Ahn shared that Duolingo would become an “AI-first” company, phasing out its use of contract workers. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings. While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company's financial metrics tell a different story. Now the company anticipates making over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. “The reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn't give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,” von Ahn said. Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The Framework desktop is small and powerful, even for 1080p gaming. But for the price, you can get a full-on gaming rig with discrete graphics. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. When Framework built its first laptop, it was with the ethos of a desktop: repairable, customizable, and upgradable when new parts came out. Now, Framework has a desktop of its own. But the Framework Desktop ($1,599 as tested before a myriad of components and add-ons), isn't a traditional PC by any means. Using an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 “Strix Halo” APU with soldered RAM, the customization options on this desktop are limited to storage, Wi-Fi, your case fan, and some decorative elements. The soldered RAM is effectively required for the bandwidth this system needs, and the mix of powerful graphics and plentiful RAM is why Framework is pushing this as an AI system. The Desktop has a ton of charm, from its 4.5-liter size to its surprising power with the right configuration. But it's also very expensive compared to the best gaming PCs in its price range, and if you don't use all of the RAM, you might be better off with a cheaper system. It's a 4.5-liter Mini-ITX system that will fit on even the small desks. When Framework refers to this as a "DIY" system, it really means removing the side panel and the top, installing an SSD and a fan, and boom, complete system. That took me less than 20 minutes, and Framework has a handy step-by-step guide on its website. Its primary difference from the company's Laptop screwdriver is that it's far longer, letting you get into the case to install your SSD.Our review unit came with an early version of a carrying handle, but that's not available to the public just yet. Otherwise, the top is held on by two thumbscrews. The upgrade potential on this system is limited. On the left side, you can put in your primary storage drive and add a fan of your choosing to the heatsink. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The heatsink is sizeable, with six copper heatpipes, aluminum fins, and Honeywell PTM7958 thermal paste. There are two slots for Framework's expansion cards — the same pick-your-port adapters that it uses on its laptops. I stuck one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port, which accommodates most of the accessories I use every day, though I could see some people picking a 3.5 mm headphone jack for gaming, as the permanent one is on the back of the system. Other choices include SD or microSD card slots, an Ethernet jack, or extra USB-C connected storage.The expansion cards will be very welcome for those who already have a Framework Laptop, as you can mix and match. There are two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a pair of USB4 Type-C ports, HDMI 2.1, two DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, Ethernet, and a headphone jack. I wish Framework included a blank set with purchase, but you have to buy them separately. The tiles highlight Framework's maker roots and allow for tons of different customization options. On the other hand, they look kind of cheap and feel like something that came from a 3D printer. I would have preferred an option to use a single colored sheet, perhaps matching some of the colors Framework uses for its Laptop bezels. It's got some graphics chops, but it's more in the range of Apple's Mac Mini (5 x 5 x 2 inches, no upgradeability) than classic gaming desktops. In its laptops, you get a list of everyone who worked on them printed inside the chassis. $1,599 + $99 SSD + $22 fan kit + $5 power cable, before expansion cards and case tiles The chip, often referred to by its "Strix Halo" codename, features 40 compute units and shares our system's 64GB of RAM with the CPU. Yes, you can game on these integrated graphics, no question. As a challenge, I booted up Alan Wake 2. On the medium graphics preset with no ray tracing, FSR enabled, and a 720p render with upscaling to 1080p, the game saw the titular hero explore a nightmare New York at between 73 and 78 frames per second. The game also ran at high settings, but dropped below 60 FPS. Death Stranding, too, played well (and better understood the shared RAM situation). At 1080p, on the very high preset, I carried packages between 124 - 132 FPS. For most intense games, though, this is a solid 1080p rig.Our benchmarks, which are typically run on discrete graphics cards, are run at quite demanding settings. Some of them may appear unplayable, but if you turn some settings down, you can get the Framework Desktop to playability territory. Here, we're comparing the Framework to other gaming desktops, and, unsurprisingly, the larger, more traditional systems won out in most tests. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme has an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti, while the older Acer Predator Orion 5000 used an RTX 4070 Super. It also excelled on CPU-heavy games like Far Cry 6 at ultra settings (83 FPS) and Borderlands 3 on the "badass" preset (103 fps.) The game performed passably on Red Dead Redemption 2 at medium settings (57 fps). It only faltered on Cyberpunk 2077's challenging Ray Tracing Ultra preset. To stress test gaming PCs, we run the Metro Exodus benchmark 15 times on a loop using the RTX preset to simulate about half an hour of gameplay. Sure, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is a mobile chip in a desktop's clothes, but with 64GB of RAM and a fast 1TB SSD, the system can compete with some recent gaming desktops we've tested when it comes to productivity. With the 1TB WD Black SN7100 that Framework sells alongside the Desktop, we saw it blaze through our file transfer test at a rate of 2,976.46 MBps, handily surpassing everything else on our test. You can't overclock the Strix Halo chip. It throws up an error stating that the chip isn't supported and that the software can't be installed. Throughout my time with the Framework Desktop, I felt a sort of dissonance. In a way, using a soldered CPU and RAM feels antithetical to Framework's entire ethos of choice, repairability, and upgradeability. Framework says there's a reason for that, though. “We spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn't technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus. Because the memory is non-upgradeable, we're being deliberate in making memory pricing more reasonable than you might find with other brands." Framework made the choice to use Ryzen's AI Max processors anyway. If you want replaceable memory, though, there are hundreds of other gaming and productivity PCs on the market with that option. And, of course, you can still build your own. I've reduced this dissonance by thinking of the system more like a Mac Mini that is bigger because it is upgradeable. Still, that may not satisfy some diehards, who see the company's laptops as more repairable than its desktop. There is one part that feels very Framework. This should allow for all sorts of projects (Framework has suggested the use of multiple mainboards for LLM racks to run models). The Framework Desktop comes free of any manufacturer-provided bloatware, and it's refreshing. If you use Windows like I did, you will still get some shortcuts you don't want, like a pinned link to download a local LinkedIn app, but nothing major. Framework sells its Desktop with a one-year warranty. We tested the $1,599 variant of the Framework Desktop, pairing a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 64GB of RAM. With our review unit, Framework included a 1TB WD Black SN7100 ($99), a Cooler Master Mobius 120 CPU fan ($22), a power cable ($5), two USB Type-C and two USB Type-A expansion cards ($11 each), and three sets of tiles (two $10 black sets and a $15 red set, plus a custom Tom's Hardware tile, which you can't really put a price on), as well as five decal tiles and two blank tiles ($5 each and $3 each, respectively). We installed Windows 11 Home on our own, but if Framework included it, the company charges $139 for the download.The cheapest configuration, before any add-ons, is $1,099 with a Ryzen AI Max 385 with lesser Radeon 8050S graphics and 32GB of RAM. The highest step up, and a shoe-in for people interested in local AI, is a $1,999 option with the same processor as our review unit, but with a whopping 128GB of memory. While our review unit came with the standard black side panel, a clear one will cost you $40. Tiles come in various colors, and there are $5 options with logos for AMD and a number of Linux distros. While I think that expansion cards with USB Type-A and Type-C make the most sense for the expansion slots, Framework sells all of the same options it has for its website, including storage, Ethernet, and a microSD card slot, should you want them. I feel that the desktop should come with a set of blank tiles; it's an incomplete system without the front of the chassis.There are a variety of fan and storage options, though you can also bring your own instead of paying Framework. Those are the only two major components that you can change out, so they're important choices. I think the fact that Framework charges for the power cable for a desktop is kind of obnoxious. Enthusiasts may have extras, but this isn't a phone where everyone has extra cheap cables around their house. For a system, this should come in the box. AMD's Strix Halo shows off in Framework's 4.5-liter case, delivering strong 1080p gaming performance for a system that doesn't have a discrete GPU. You can have a solid 1080p system that fits on your desk and doesn't get in the way.But the system doesn't feel entirely like Framework. It's not wrong, but it will likely make the system less appealing for many potential buyers who aren't specifically interested in AI. It's versatile, small, and surprisingly powerful for its size. For the $1,599 our review unit starts at — before all of the components and an OS, you can get a decent gaming PC with a discrete GPU. For over $1,800 as ours was configured, you can get a nice one. I don't fault Framework for offering a DIY edition to its enthusiast-forward fanbase, but I do think its pricing should consider everything you need to add. That's before you get nickeled and dimed with effectively mandatory tiles for the front of the chassis.In competition with something like the Mac Mini, you can really only compare to Apple's most expensive configuration with a 12-core M4 Pro CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD storage for $1,399. Bumping to 1TB of storage and 64GB of RAM is a minimum of $2,199, so while the Mac is a huge budget for light productivity starting at $599, it isn't necessarily a budget competitor on the high end. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999 with an M4 Max and 36GB of RAM.That leaves the Framework in a place as a solid small system for people who need a ton of RAM. If you're going to make use of this much RAM with a mobile CPU and a tiny chassis, there may be value here, as well as the fun of putting parts of the system together yourself. But for everyone else, a stronger gaming rig or a cheaper productivity system might do the job — and will come with everything you need out of the box. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Seattle startup is building a personal AI tutor that doesn't just give the answer but guides students through lessons, adapts to how they learn, appeals to their personal interests, and grows with them over time. Wild Zebra, founded by edtech veteran Edan Shahar and longtime AI technologist Erik Selberg, uses AI to guide students through Socratic-style interactions — drawing out their thinking through guided questioning — while adapting to their interests, learning styles, and individual needs. “We think the days of trains leaving Boston and going to Chicago are dead,” said Shahar, the company's CEO, referring to stodgy word problems. He explained that any subject can be taught using topics a student is already passionate about, such as sports or pop music. Operating in stealth mode up to this point, the startup has already piloted its AI tutor in four schools, reaching more than 6,000 students with an initial focus on math and reading comprehension. The feedback from teachers and administrators has exceeded expectations, Shahar said. Some educators have observed students becoming more focused and choosing to use the AI tutor outside of class time. “So much of the conversation about AI has been around cheating,” Shahar said. Rather than delivering quick solutions, its AI engages students in multi-turn conversations, asking questions that prompt reflection and reasoning. When asked how Wild Zebra differentiates itself from established competitors like Khan Academy's Khanmigo, Shahar pointed to two key areas: As students interact with the system, the AI continually updates their learning profiles — surfacing gaps in understanding that may trace back years, while enabling more advanced learners to progress at their own pace. Wild Zebra recently raised $2 million in funding to build on that early traction, expand its school partnerships, and prepare for a broader rollout. The company plans to introduce an implementation fee for schools starting in the fall of 2025 but has not yet decided on final pricing for its platform. The idea for Wild Zebra emerged in mid-2024, after Shahar, who previously co-founded the travel-tech startup Utrip and served for nearly a decade as CEO of edtech company Test Innovators, returned from helping lead Israel's national quantum computing initiative. He connected with Selberg — a veteran technologist whose career spans leadership roles at eBay, Grab, and Microsoft — through Docusign co-founder Court Lorenzini, a startup advisor. This multi-model approach is also key to ensuring accuracy and preventing the AI from hallucinating or otherwise teaching incorrect information. Selberg has “been working in AI since before it was cool,” with a “deep understanding of what problems AI can and can't solve, and how to think about the shifting landscape,” Shahar said. From there, the AI guides students through conversations designed to promote reasoning rather than simply providing answers. Teachers remain part of the loop through a dashboard that tracks student progress and flags areas where additional support may be needed. Shahar said the startup is a watershed moment in his own journey, as well. “It does feel like everything I've worked on in my life has led to this point — building companies, working in education, being a student myself,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media said in a press release that Perplexity's tech provides “direct, contextually accurate answers with transparent citations” which will help Truth Social “exponentially increase the amount of information available” to users. “We have no visibility or control over that,” Dwyer said. In contrast, Perplexity's public search engine returns a wider variety of sources, including Wikipedia, Reddit, YouTube, NPR, and Politico. Truth Social plans to refine and expand the search function “based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a former California congressman, in the statement. Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer, also noted in the statement that Perplexity's AI delivers answers with “transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper.” In late July, alongside his AI Action Plan, Trump published an executive order targeting “biased AI,” or models that aren't “ideologically neutral.” The order specifically referred to information about race or sex, unconscious bias, systemic racism, and other ideas thrown into the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bucket as “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.” Truth Search AI comes in the same week that top AI firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google were added to a list of approved vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies.

President Donald Trump called for Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan to resign from his role in a post on his Truth Social account. "The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately," Trump wrote. "There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem! These include Cadence Design Systems, where Tan previously served as CEO. Cotton also questioned Tan's ability to be a "responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars" for the company's nearly $8 billion CHIPS Act grant.Cotton also asked Yeary whether Tan was required to divest from any holdings in Chinese companies with ties to the country, Communist Party, or military. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tan took the top job at Intel in March, succeeding outgoing CEO Pat Gelsinger. Yesterday, Trump rattled the semiconductor industry when he called for a 100% tariff on chips, albeit with a loophole for companies that are building and investing in the United States.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're now working on improving the scalability of LISTEN/NOTIFY in PostgreSQL, and to guide that work, I'd like to better understand how it's used (or was used) in real-world systems. What doesn't?The current implementation has some known scalability bottlenecks:1. Thundering Herd Problem: A NOTIFY wakes up all listening backends in the current database, even those not listening on the notified channel. This is inefficient when many listeners are each listening to their own channels (e.g. in job queues).2. This can become a bottleneck when many transactions send notifications in parallel.If you've used LISTEN/NOTIFY in production, I'd love to hear:- What is/was your use case?- Does each client listen on its own channel, or do they share channels?- How many listening backend processes?- How many NOTIFYs in parallel?- Are you sending payloads?
