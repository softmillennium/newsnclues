                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he has selected Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, replacing Adriana Kugler, who resigned Friday. The nominee will serve out Kugler's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. "In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement," Trump said in a Truth Social post, indicating that the nominee for the full 14-year term on the board could be someone else and Miran may just be in a caretaker role. "He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job," Trump added. Likely candidates for that position include current Governor Christopher Waller as well as former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Miran's appointment comes amid continuing speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" whose job it would be mainly to act as a gadfly on the board. Trump said Wednesday that the nominee for the Kugler seat would be temporary rather than a permanent replacement for Powell. The president has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates. Miran still needs Senate confirmation to the seven-person board, something unlikely to happen until the upper house reconvenes in September. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, of which he would be a permanent voting member, meets next Sept. 16-17. Prior to serving in the first Trump White House as senior advisor for economic policy under then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Miran was senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital Management and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. While at Treasury, he played a key role in development the Paycheck Protection Program following the Covid economic shutdown in 2020. In addition to voting on interest rates, Miran's role as governor would include financial regulation. However, his most pressing role between confirmation and January could be as an antagonist to Powell. Trump has fiercely criticized the central bank chief, calling him a barrage of names, requesting his resignation and even mulling the legally questionable possibility of firing him. At last week's FOMC meeting, two governors — Trump appointees Waller and Michelle Bowman — dissented from the decision to hold the overnight funds rate steady. It was the first time multiple governors voted against a rates decision in more than 30 years. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement in the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. More troubling for the president, however, could be that the survey shows positive approval of only one of seven key issues, with the public holding negative views on his handling of tariffs, inflation, taxes and federal spending. There also was a modest rise in the public's preference for the Democrats to control Congress, rising to a 49%-44% advantage from 48%-46% in April. It was the largest lead for Democrats since 2021. At the same time, favorability of the Democratic Party among registered voters sank to a net -32 percentage points, with 24% positive and 56% negative. The -32 rating appeared to be the lowest rating for either party going back to at least 1996. The president's economic approval rating remains negative with 45% approving and 53% disapproving, a modest gain from 43%-55% in April. But it's the second time in a row that his economic approval was worse than his overall approval, a reversal from his first term when the president was always stronger on the economy. "What seemed to be keeping President Trump's overall approval level from really dropping down was the strong economy and the credit that he got from the public," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster. "He cannot rely on that at this point." Overall, the survey of 1,000 people nationwide conducted July 29-Aug. 3 showed a series of conflicting political and economic crosscurrents, with individuals and demographic groups offering sometimes contradictory opinions. "Trump's approval is stable, but his individual ratings are down on issue after issue, except for tariffs," said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which conducted the poll and served as its Republican pollster. "Economic optimism is higher, but there's been no relief in this data from inflation." Even Republicans are 9 points lower on inflation than their economic approval rating. The president is underwater on inflation by 23 points, with 37% approving and 60% disapproving, unchanged from the last survey. Roberts added that the survey is "capturing a country that's in a shifting moment across all of these issues." Views on the economy are equally conflicting. On the current state of the economy, attitudes have improved, with 31% saying it's excellent or good and 68% calling it just fair or poor. The move was driven largely by growing optimism among Republicans, with some improvement among independents. But the outlook for the economy barely budged, with 36% saying it will get better, 17% saying it will stay the same, and 46% expecting it to get worse. Views on the stock market also improved with 46% saying it's a good time to invest and 42% saying it's a bad time. The sharp improvement to +4 percentage points from -15 percentage points has come with a surge in stocks that followed the president backing off from sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs and the passage of tax legislation. Even 36% of those with no investments think it's a good time invest, the highest on record for a group that is typically negative on stocks. But the survey shows some gathering areas of concern for the president on key issues. Approval on measures taken to secure the southern border is the only one of seven that is above water with a 53% to 44% positive approval rating. The public is evenly split on deportations 49% to 49%, with sharp divides by party, age, race, gender, geography, income and education. In fact, 60% of the public still say their incomes are falling behind the rising cost of living, with women and those with lower incomes saying they are especially hard hit. Tariffs could be playing a role in the inflation outlook: 49% say tariffs hurt workers compared with only 37% who say they help; 67% say they raise the cost of everyday goods. But by a 47%-37% margin, tariffs are seen helping U.S. companies who produce in the U.S. Still, almost three-quarters of the public say foreign trade represents an economic opportunity for the U.S., rather than a threat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of relentless hype, GPT-5 is finally here. OpenAI officially released the highly anticipated new model on Thursday. He said that after using GPT-5, going back to GPT-4 was "miserable." OpenAI says the model will be available for free for everyone and that users will no longer need to switch between previous models for different tasks. GPT-5 will be available in standard, mini, and nano versions. Paid users will have higher usage limits. Altman said GPT-5 was also the company's fastest model yet. "One of the things I had been pushing the team on was like, 'Hey, we need to make it way, way faster,'" Altman said. OpenAI has been teasing this next iteration of ChatGPT for over a year, but has ramped up the chatter in the last few days and weeks. On Sunday, Altman shared a screenshot of GPT-5 on X, asking the model to recommend the "most thought-provoking" TV show about AI. Speaking to podcaster Theo Von, Altman said he asked GPT-5 a question he "didn't quite understand" and it "answered it perfectly," making him feel "useless relative to the AI." "There are moments in the history of science, where you have a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, you know: 'What have we done?'" OpenAI's last notable model launch was GPT-4.5 in February, which Altman described at the time as "the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person." During that time, the number of ChatGPT users has continued to grow. In April, Altman said ChatGPT had 500 million weekly active users. OpenAI said on Thursday that ChatGPT is now on track to hit 700 million weekly active users "this week."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Education is making the Free Application for Federal Student Aid available earlier than usual this year as a beta test, which experts say may address some of the bugs that have plagued previous application cycles. The FAFSA serves as the gateway to all federal aid money for college-bound students, including federal student loans, work-study and grants. Starting on Sept. 1, anyone can request to participate in the second phase of testing, according to an announcement from the Education Department. More from Personal Finance:These college majors have the best job prospectsFamilies feel confident about paying for college, until tuition bills arriveStudent loan borrowers: How will the end of the SAVE plan affect you? "We're pleased to hear that Federal Student Aid has launched FAFSA beta testing sooner than expected," said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. "An earlier and longer testing window will give the Department of Education the time it needs to address any potential bugs or errors, with valuable feedback from applicants and financial aid professionals, which should lead to a smoother process when the application is opened to the broader public," Storey said. "All these positive changes portend that the high school class of 2026 will achieve an all-time high FAFSA completion rate by the time they graduate next spring," Cook said. For many families, financial aid is essential when it comes to covering the cost of college, which has jumped significantly in recent decades. Grants — including federal ones such as the Pell Grant — have become the most crucial kind of assistance, because they typically do not need to be repaid. The earlier families fill out the form, the better their chances are of receiving aid, since some financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, or from programs with limited funds, experts say. Submitting a FAFSA is one of the best predictors of whether a high school senior will go on to college, according to the National College Attainment Network, or NCAN. Seniors who complete the FAFSA are 84% more likely to enroll in college directly after high school, according to an NCAN study of 2013 data. Yet, only 71% of families submitted the FAFSA for the 2024-25 academic year, down from 74% in the previous academic year, according to Sallie Mae's recent How America Pays for College report. That's in part because of previous complications with the new form, which initially launched in late December 2023 after a monthslong delay. "Families reported having an easier time completing the FAFSA last year, but 58% indicated they still needed assistance, so having a head start can be beneficial especially for first time FAFSA filers," said Rick Castellano, a spokesperson for Sallie Mae.

The agreement is expected to speed up migration to the cloud, as well as adoption of artificial intelligence tools, the General Services Administration said. "AWS's partnership with GSA demonstrates a shared public-private commitment to enhancing America's AI leadership," the agency said in a release. Amazon's cloud boss, Matt Garman, hailed the agreement as a "significant milestone in the large-scale digital transformation of government services." The discounts aggregated across federal agencies include credits to use AWS' cloud infrastructure, modernization programs and training services, as well as incentives for "direct partnership." The GSA announced a similar deal last month with cloud rival Oracle. The agency also reached an agreement with OpenAI on Wednesday that will give federal agencies access to ChatGPT for $1 through the next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Duolingo shares skyrocketed more than 30% after the language-learning platform boosted its guidance due to strong user growth driven by artificial intelligence. The mobile learning platform hiked its full-year guidance to between $1.01 billion and $1.02 billion, up from a prior range of $987 million to $996 million. "We exceeded our own high expectations for bookings and revenue this quarter, and did it while expanding profitability," said co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn in a release. In an effort to expand its course offerings and boost users, Duolingo has implemented AI tools, including a video-call conversation practice feature for some paying subscribers. The company has also expanded beyond language learning with a new course such as chess. Duolingo also announced the acquisition of London-based music gaming startup NextBeat for an undisclosed amount as it looks to broaden its app products. The company's CEO said Duolingo is still in the early stages of its growth trajectory. Revenues jumped about 41% year over year to $252 million and beat a Wall Street estimate of $241 million. Net income grew 84% from a year ago to about $45 million, or 91 cents per share. With Thursday's moves, the stock is up more than 34% this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed — and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket. This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S., bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: "They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy." Despite Trump's tone, "while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach," Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. "What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals." After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers. Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest. He added: "In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices." If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, "global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers," a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030. Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty. While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called "sour") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals. The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible. In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price. "Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes," Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. "Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught," he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line. That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has been attempting to stave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs — the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies — could burden that mission. A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows. "It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America," Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur ("sweet") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data. We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market. "At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington," Rystad's Sahdev summed up. Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does "very little business with India because their tariffs are so high." He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead. Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't "really behave in the same way" as China's. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set to take effect on Thursday. Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter "fueling" Russia's war machine. Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars. Investment house UBS estimates that $8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerable to the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Indian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market jumped Thursday on excitement that bitcoin and other digital assets could soon be coming to 401(k) retirement plans. President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) accounts to invest in alternative assets, including private equity, real estate and digital assets, CNBC has confirmed. Ether rose almost 5%, also retaking a one-week high. Crypto-linked stocks got a boost of energy as well. Coinbase gained 3%, Galaxy Digital advanced 6% and ether treasury stock Bitmine Immersion rose nearly 8%. Widespread inclusion of bitcoin in Americans' retirement accounts has long been viewed as a holy grail for crypto adoption. Conceivably, it would make the cryptocurrency a mainstay of U.S. financial infrastructure, expand access and encourage longer-term investing in the asset. The retirement market is currently worth $43 trillion, almost $9 trillion of which is held in 401(k) plans. The crypto market cap is nearly $4 trillion today. What we're seeing ... [is] the aperture of being able to buy crypto being widened and widened, [and] more avenues bringing people into the tent," Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Thursday. "When it becomes commonplace – when you can do it at the place you've already been doing business with, if its Fidelity or T. Rowe Price or whoever it is – you just pull more people into this ecosystem," he added. Fidelity in 2022 became the first retirement plan provider to offer investors the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but the service hinges on employer adoption. Adoption since then has been low given that year's rate hike driven bear market, lingering regulatory risk from the previous administration, as well as general caution and skepticism from investors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brian Chesky, cofounder and CEO of Airbnb, laid out his vision for the travel app's AI-powered future during the company's second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. Airbnb beat revenue expectations for quarter two and announced a $6 billion stock buyback, but said it expected slower growth in Q3. "Over the next couple of years, I think what you're going to see is Airbnb becoming an AI-first application," Chesky said on the call with analysts. Chesky said Airbnb's approach to utilizing AI has differed from some other travel companies in that they have not focused on using AI to offer travel planning and inspiration. Instead, the company has rolled out AI in customer service, with a custom agent built on 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations. As a result of the AI customer service chatbot, he said Airbnb has reduced the number of hosts and guests who need to contact a human agent by 15%. "It will not only tell you how to cancel your reservation, it will know which reservation you want to cancel. Airbnb declined to provide additional comment when reached by Business Insider. In February, Chesky said on Airbnb's quarter four earnings call that he thought it was still too early to use AI for trip planning, but that he believed AI would eventually have a "profound impact on travel." Chesky also said in February that he wants to make Airbnb the Amazon of travel, or a one-stop shop for "all of your traveling and living needs." Airbnb in May announced it was relaunching its Experiences business and launching Services, which allows users to book on-site professionals like photographers or massage therapists. On the call Wednesday, Chesky said he was "very bullish" on Experiences and that the feedback so far has been positive. Axel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb.</p>
