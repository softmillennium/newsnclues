                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton defeated compatriot Taylor Fritz on Wednesday, advancing to his first Masters 1000 final. After defeating Washington Open champion Alex de Minaur in straight sets, Shelton produced a fine display to dispatch Fritz, winning 6-4 6-3. Shelton broke into the ATP top 10 for the first time earlier this year and has followed up this breakthrough by producing a consistent stream of high-level performances in Toronto. With his victory over Fritz, Shelton confirmed his status as one of the world's best players, while putting himself in the same conversation with Pete Sampras. Ben Shelton made American tennis history on Wednesday night. As per OptaAce, Ben Shelton is the youngest American to achieve successive ATP top 10 wins in an ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final and semi-final since Pete Sampras. Shelton was aged 22 years and 291 days when he achieved the feat on Thursday night. If Shelton can go on to have a career anything like Sampras', he will have achieved a great deal in the sport. The 22-year-old will hope to create further history against Karen Khachanov on Thursday night. A victory over Khachanov would see Shelton climb to 4,320 points and into the world number six spot. Not many players can say they have been ranked above Novak Djokovic while he is still near his best. Meanwhile, Karen Khachanov has already risen four places to number 12 in the world. If he defeats Shelton, the Russian would rise to world number eight.</p>

By the time he faced Fritz in the semis, Shelton was in the zone, and he played circles around his higher-ranked countryman.‚ÄúPlaying back-to-back guys like Demon and Taylor, and having so much success in the long rallies like the stats showed, is a big confidence-builder for me,‚Äù Shelton said.Shelton said he had everything ‚Äúclicking‚Äù against Fritz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has failed in each of his three attempts to add a 25th Grand Slam title to his collection in 2025. The Serbian star kicked off his Grand Slam campaign in Melbourne, where he picked up a remarkable win over Carlos Alcaraz, before Djokovic retired injured against Alexander Zverev in the semifinals. Suffering the same fate at SW19, Djokovic was beaten by Sinner 3-6, 3-6, 4-6, as he missed out on a place in the Wimbledon final. Looking to go all the way in New York, Djokovic has been praised for what he's done before the US Open begins. Following his run to the last four at Wimbledon, Djokovic pulled out of the Canadian Open, alongside his fellow Grand Slam champions Sinner and Alcaraz. However, unlike Sinner and Alcaraz, Djokovic has now withdrawn from the Cincinnati Open as well, meaning he will next be seen on court at the US Open. During the latest episode of ‚ÄòThe Tennis', Nick Kyrgios' former coach, Simon Rea, gave his verdict on Djokovic's Cincinnati withdrawal. ‚ÄúI think it's hard to knock the change in approach from the perspective that you are looking at an athlete that is prepared to do whatever he can to give himself the ultimate chance at playing for one more Grand Slam title,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I think it's to be applauded that he is trying something different again.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe is prepared to go in there slightly underdone from a physical perspective, because he is thinking I need every ounce of energy available at the backend of that fortnight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe is going to go in there fresh and back himself to find a way, perhaps through some difficult moments in the opening week and back himself to get there with a little bit more in the tank deep in the event against the likes of [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz.‚Äù After Djokovic lost to Alcaraz in the 2024 Wimbledon final, he chose to skip the two North American hard-court Masters 1000 events just as he has done this year. Kicking off his campaign with a comfortable victory, Djokovic defeated Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. Stunning those in attendance on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Popyrin stormed into a two-set lead, 6-4, 6-4, leaving Djokovic on the brink of defeat. For the first time since 2017, Djokovic had lost before the fourth round of a Grand Slam, as he headed home from New York much earlier than expected. Looking to avoid the same fate in 2025, perhaps it would have made more sense for Djokovic to play a warm-up tournament before the US Open. Only time will tell if Djokovic will be subject to another early exit at Flushing Meadows, but you certainly won't want to miss any of the action when the tournament begins on Sunday, August 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton upstaged higher-ranked countryman Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 Wednesday night in Toronto to muscle his way into his first ATP Masters 1000 final at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. 7 combined an expected service masterclass with a surprising baseline assault on return to declaw Fritz, who had dropped serve just once in his previous three matches heading into the semi-finals. Humble and Hungry," Shelton wrote on the TV camera as he celebrated the breakthrough win. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two Top 10 guys back to back is huge for me.‚Äù Should he win the title, Shelton will move to fourth, ahead of Novak Djokovic. In the first all-American ATP Masters 1000 semi-final since 2010, Shelton earned six break points across three Fritz service games in the opening set, eventually breaking through in the ninth game with a thunderous down-the-line forehand winner. The lefty secured back-to-back Top 10 victories for the first time, following his quarter-final win over recent Washington ATP 500 champion Alex de Minaur. Shelton claimed his 100th tour-level win earlier in the tournament and will move to a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings ahead of Djokovic if he defeats Karen Khachanov in Thursday's final, which begins at 7 p.m. He earned 10 break point opportunities and limited Fritz to 68 per cent of first-serve points won and 39 per cent of second-serve points won. ‚ÄúWhen he's standing in one corner, he's one of the best in the world at being behind the ball and hitting it harder and harder every time. ‚ÄúI'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in‚Ä¶‚Äù No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..

The fact that this needs to be said is shocking ‚Äî and only shows how disconnected from reality some people are when they're far away from the war.‚Äù As you can imagine, Isner's one sentence comment sent Tennis Twitter blazing for hours. He said: ‚ÄúJohn, if you want to argue removing the flag in international sports is meaningless and ineffective as a response to war, you can reasonably do that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner is preparing for the North American hard-court swing with renewed motivation, hoping to defend the ATP throne from Carlos Alcaraz. As was expected, the 23-year-old enjoyed his break from tennis after conquering Wimbledon. Five weeks earlier, Jannik squandered three match points against Carlos in that epic Roland Garros final, suffering a heartbreaking 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 defeat in five hours and 29 minutes. He survived a major scare in the fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov and entered the last four with a win over Ben Shelton. Sinner outplayed the seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets and arranged his first Wimbledon title clash against Alcaraz. Jannik experienced different sensations from his previous Major finals, especially after what happened in Paris. The first-time Wimbledon champion took a couple of days off the court, spending quality time with family and friends. The Italian has to defend both titles and 3000 ATP points. The pressure is there, but Jannik looks recharged and eager to build on his incredible season and add more silverware to his growing collection. Only time will tell in the next five weeks. "The final at Wimbledon provided a different sensation because of what happened a month earlier at Roland Garros. Bouncing back in London and performing at that level surprised me, too. I was thrilled to spend some time off the court after London and see my family and friends. After spending time with important people around me, I returned to the practice court and gave my best to prepare for the US swing, an important part of the season. Winning Wimbledon felt very special," Jannik Sinner said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MASON, OH ‚àí The Cincinnati Open has grown into a two-week affair with an expanded 96-player field. After two days of qualifying rounds, the main draw is slated to begin Aug. 7 from the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Wednesday features a schedule-stuffing 27 matches from the opening rounds of ATP and WTA main draw play. On Center Court, 45-year-old Venus Williams, a 7-time Grand Slam champion, will face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. In the night session, Mason native Peyton Stearns will bid for her first main draw victory at her hometown tournament when she faces Yafan Wang. Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time first-round updates from both tours. Joao Fonseca's stellar summer continues after rallying for a three-set win, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, over Yunchaokete Bu on Center Court. 64 Arthur Rinderknech, making his Cincinnati debut, just advanced to the Round of 64 with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Nuno Borges. Maya Joint, a 19-year-old from Australia, is the first player to punch their ticket to the Round of 64. Joint took out Greet Minnen in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. It's Joint's second 1000-level event win of the year after a win in the Mutua Madrid Open in April. Joao Fonseca and Yunchaokete Bu kick things off on Center Court.

For the upcoming US Open tournament, starting in just a few weeks on Sunday, Aug 24, a record $5 million will be awarded each to the women's and men's singles champions. RELATED: WNBA All-Stars Make Powerful Statement on Pay Equity - BET According to the US Open Tournament, "The US Open has made a deliberate and concerted effort to ensure double-digit percentage increases from 2024 in all rounds of all events for all players, while at the same time significantly increasing the percentage of prize money for athletes playing deep into the singles draws." The increase will also affect single players who make it to the finals with a $2.5 million payout each. Semifinalists will receive a 26% hike, making their take-home pay $1.26 million. Many impactful players continue to be in discussions with the heads of each of the four major tournaments in a bid to receive a higher percentage of revenues. For women's and men's doubles each winner will receive $1 million, a new high for the U.S. Open doubles champions where total prizes for qualifying are going up to $8 million, a 10% increase. The US Open will take place from AUGUST 18 - SEPTEMBER 7, 2025, at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, NY.

Mboko began 2025 by winning four consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour events in January and February before claiming a fifth title in March. She remains in second place on the ITF World Tennis Tour for most women's singles titles won this year. She then qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the French Open, where she reached the third round, before stunning 25th-seeded Magdalena Frech in the first round at Wimbledon. Mboko is coached by former world No 3, 1998 Wimbledon finalist and 1997 Billie Jean King Cup champion Nathalie Tauziat. "Incredible match, thank you to everyone for supporting me," Mboko told the crowd in French. "It was really difficult, but anything can happen. "Playing in front of the home crowd, obviously, has its advantages. It really pulls me through in the tough moments where I'm maybe not as positive. Really blessed to have that kind of support." Rybakina was unhappy with the way the home crowd cheered her mistakes, saying: "Yeah, that wasn't nice, of course. "I already felt it from the first game we played, and especially when it's in between the serves. This is something I was kind of expecting, and definitely it didn't depend anyhow on my serve or in the mistakes I did or wrong choices. It was obvious that the crowd is going to cheer for their player." Ranked 85th in the world, Mboko is seeking her first WTA Tour title and trying to join Faye Urban (1969) and Bianca Andreescu (2019) as the only Canadians to win their home event in the open era. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In the final on Thursday night, she will face former world No 1 Osaka, who overcame 16th seed Clara Tauson 6-2 7-6 (9-7) in the other semi-final. She stepped away from the game for 15 months towards the end of that season and had daughter Shai in July 2023. Mboko had previously said that Osaka was her idol and the Japanese star, who has been working with coach Tomasz Wiktorowski after splitting with Patrick Mouratoglou, said: "I don't think that's ever happened. I can't let her not like me anymore.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player "There are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two top-10 guys back-to-back [Alex de Minaur and Fritz] is huge for me." The 22-year-old Shelton is seeking his third career ATP Tour title. "I'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in," Shelton said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TORONTO ‚Äî Under the moonlight at Sobeys Stadium in Toronto, Ben Shelton produced one of the most illuminating performances of his career. Big serve, quick movement, and variety of shot and thought were all on display as the world No. 7 defeated compatriot Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 6-3, in one hour and 18 minutes Wednesday night to advance to the Canadian Open final. No delay to begin the match was going to stop Shelton, 22, from reaching his first ATP Masters 1,000 final, another milestone in his blossoming career. ‚ÄúThe Masters were the one level of tournaments that I've been struggling with, and my next step is being able to excel in these tournaments,‚Äù Shelton said. There was great anticipation for this contest. There were tense moments for Shelton to start the match. In his first service game, Shelton faced two break points. Like his previous round win against Alex de Minaur, it was Shelton owning the long rallies with deep groundstrokes and punitive slices. Fritz committed back-to-back errors, leading to break point. Shelton connected on a forehand winner that went behind Fritz, giving him the first break of the match. ‚ÄúI think for me it was about keeping him moving, keeping him off balance,‚Äù Shelton said on his game plan tonight. ‚ÄúMixing up the way that I play, but playing within my limits, and being really solid. Shelton was not afraid to be aggressive and control the points when needed, and he returned with consistency, something that he does not always find easy. The break point was notable as Shelton brought Fritz forward and punished him with a lob. The crowd cheered before Shelton motioned for them to get louder. He sensed the finish line was near. Ben Shelton, YOU CANNOT DO THAT! On match point, Fritz tossed his third double fault, getting broken for a third time before breaking his racquet in half. He is the youngest Masters 1,000 finalist since fellow American Andy Roddick in 2004. Shelton's opponent in the final is Karen Khachanov. The Russian outlasted top seed Alexander Zverev, saving a match point before winning 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(4) in two hours and 52 minutes. Khachanov is attempting to win his second ATP Masters 1,000 title, after being victorious at the Paris Masters in 2018. As Shelton served for the first set, a fan yelled, ‚ÄúThis is your time!‚Äù He rises to No. In less than 24 hours, the time could be Shelton's to capture his maiden Masters 1000 trophy, the potential beginning of a successful North American summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tournament organizers announced on Wednesday that the men's and women's singles champions will each earn $5 million at this year's tournament, a 39% increase on the $3.6 million awarded in 2024. Overall, the tournament's prize purse will top $90 million ‚Äì the largest in tennis history and a 20% increase on last year, which stood at $75 million. There will also be sizeable increases in pay for those who progress to the latter stages of the competition, with singles finalists earning $2.5 million (a 26% increase), semifinalists $1.26 million (a 26% increase), and quarterfinalists $660,000 (a 25% increase). ‚ÄúThe US Open has made a deliberate and concerted effort to ensure double-digit percentage increases from 2024 in all rounds of all events for all players, while at the same time significantly increasing the percentage of prize money for athletes playing deep into the singles draws,‚Äù said a press release on the US Open website. Organizers have also set aside $5 million to put towards player expenses, including a $1,000 travel stipend for each player and two hotel rooms at the official player hotel (or $600 per day for staying at alternative accommodation). Sweeping ‚Äì and controversial ‚Äì changes have been made to the mixed doubles competition this year, which will now be staged on August 19 and 20 and include some of the biggest names in the sport. Mixed doubles change at US Open branded a ‚Äòprofound injustice' by defending champions The rationale is that top players will then be available to appear in the mixed doubles, attracting more fans and allowing broadcasters to spotlight the competition before main draw singles play begins. However, defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori called the format change a ‚Äúpseudo-exhibition‚Äù and ‚Äúprofound injustice‚Äù which ‚Äúdisrespect(s) an entire category of players.‚Äù The US Tennis Association told CNN Sports that the new format will ‚Äúelevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and provide a greater opportunity to inspire more people to play and grow the sport.‚Äù It also said in a press release that ‚Äúthe world's best players will have the opportunity to compete for this title and the multi-million dollar purse without having to juggle mixed doubles with their singles and doubles commitments.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tournament also lasts 12 days now with almost all top-half first-round matches coming up on Thursday. 18-year-old star Joao Fonseca is looking to bounce back from a disappointing Toronto performance and will face Bu Yunchaokete. Who do you think will come out on top? It's been a messy season for Alejandro Tabilo, and that's not entirely his fault with fitness issues troubling him left and right. He will play for the first time since making the semifinals of the Prostejov Challenger in early June and is 2-5 on hard courts this year with a win each at Indian Wells and Miami. Considering that you probably should be treating Roman Safiullin as the favorite here, even if the Russian is not doing all that hot either. But at least he got a couple of matches under his belt in Toronto. This has been a fun rivalry over the years, especially their grass ATP 250 classics in ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch (three times) and Newport (twice). It seems like now things have changed from where they were at the end of last season when Jordan Thompson defeated Adrian Mannarino at the ATP 1000 in Paris. He looked strong in qualifying and might extend his head-to-head lead here. Cincinnati conditions won't be that good for Fonseca either, but Bu Yunchaokete probably won't blow him off the court like Tristan Schoolkate did. 700 play a ferret if he could see it from the stands. Always pleased by a beautiful one-handed backhand or classic volleying technique. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
