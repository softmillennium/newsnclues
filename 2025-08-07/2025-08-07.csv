            • Army Secretary Dan Driscoll honored the soldiers who sprang into action when an active-duty sergeant allegedly opened fire at Fort Stewart yesterday. One of the soldiers tackled the suspected gunman, another jumped on top of the suspect to subdue him and four others tended to the injured, Driscoll said.
    


            • Quornelius Samentrio Radford, 28, was taken into custody and is accused of shooting five of his fellow service members. Two of the five wounded soldiers remain hospitalized, and the other three have been released, officials said.
    


            • Radford's motive is not known. He had a disagreement with one of the shooting victims on Tuesday, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the case.
    


Our live coverage has ended. You can read more about the soldiers who subdued the suspected gunman and the investigation into the shooting here.



            The Fort Stewart soldier who grabbed and subdued the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting on base said Quornelius Radford was trying to reload his personal weapon during the struggle.
    


                    “We got to the point where the magazine ended up coming out, and by that time frame the next one was trying to get loaded in, got loaded, but (I) still had physical control over it,” Staff Sgt. Aaron Turner, told CNN's Ryan Young on Thrusday.
                





            Another solider, Master Sgt. Justin Thomas, helped restrain Radford, giving Turner the ability to take the gun away.
    


            “I was able to disarm him, drop the magazine and eject the round,” said Turner.
    


            Turner said he tried to talk Radford down before physically restraining him. “Clearly that wasn't working, and I ended up having to go hands-on to try and disengage,” he said.
    


            It was a shock to the unit to see a comrade arrested, Turner said.
    


            “Knowing the fact that it's a teammate, it never ends up getting to the point where you really process that,” said Turner.
    


            Army officials have credited Turner's actions with preventing more casualties. Turner is one of the six soldiers awarded a medal for his actions during the shooting.
    


            Staff Sgt. Melissa Taylor, a career counselor at Fort Stewart in Georgia, said she reenlisted the suspected shooter Quornelius Radford, but no red flags were raised at the time.
    


            Taylor, one of the six soldiers honored for responding to the mass shooting, told CNN's Pamela Brown that she did not know Radford personally but, “As the career counselor, the soldier had talked to me about reenlistment previously.”
    


                    “I do believe I actually did reenlist this soldier a little while back.”
                





            She noted that other than the contractual part of reenlistment and “the work part of it, I do not believe that the soldier ever spoke to me about anything personal. So I did not have any kind of background history on him.”
    


            She said there were no red flags when he was reenlisted. “You cannot reenlist a soldier if there was any kind of flag in place or anything like that. So, he met all the criteria at the time,” she said.
    


            The soldiers who helped stopped yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia, have been identified by Army officials.
    


            Staff Sgt. Aaron Turner of Farmington, New Mexico, was the first to subdue suspect Quornelious Radford, with Master Sgt. Justin Thomas from Kingwood, Texas, helping to keep him restrained, according to the Army.
    


            Turner, an automated logistical specialist, has been at Fort Stewart for less than a year, the Army said.
    


            He was unarmed when he took down Radford, according to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.
    


            “The fast action of these soldiers under stress and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” Driscoll said.
    


            Additional assistance came from Staff Sgt. Robert Pacheco and Sgt. Eve Rodarte, base officials told CNN. They are both combat medics who specialize in responding to medical emergencies.
    


            Watch Army Secretary Dan Driscoll award medals to soldiers who helped halt yesterday's shooting by subduing the suspect who wounded five people in a shooting at Fort Stewart:
    


            Staff Sgt. Melissa Taylor, one of the six soldiers awarded a medal for their actions during yesterday's shooting at Fort Stewart, said she was in her office when she heard a fellow soldier “yelling that a gunshot went off,” before she peered into the hallway and saw smoke.
    


                    “I saw the smoke at the end of the hallway and I noticed there was a soldier laying on the ground, so I immediately sprinted over to the soldier and started rendering aid. He had been shot. And so I was rendering aid to him, while the first sergeant started calling medics,” Taylor told reporters.
                





            Asked if she was scared during those moments, Taylor said, “not at that time.”
    


            Taylor credited adrenaline, her seven years of experience as a combat medic and working for a county's emergency medical services.
    


            “So, I have been in these type of situations before where I've had to render aid to someone with gunshot wounds. So I had a little bit of experience I believe helped get me through that situation,” Taylor said.
    


            One of the soldiers who sprang into action in the moments after a suspect opened fire at Fort Stewart on Wednesday explained in his own words what he heard and did during the attack.
    


            US Army 1st Sergeant Joshua Arnold, one of the six soldiers awarded medals for responding to the shooting, said when he first heard the gunshots, it took a moment for him to realize what was happening – but then his training kicked in.
    


            “It seemed like a flash went past my conference room,” Arnold told CNN.
    


                    “I started yelling through the hallways, ‘That was a gunshot.'”
                





            As the suspect ran away, Arnold said he saw smoke and a shell case on the ground. Then he saw a soldier who had been shot.
    


            He rushed to help the soldier, who told him someone else had been injured, Arnold said.  He said he was able to find later and help them, too.
    


            Arnold said he and other combat medics provided aid until EMS arrived and continued helping the injured.
    


            The gunshots were being fired by a fellow service member, but Arnold said he didn't think about that in the moment.
    


            “You don't really know how to process that in that moment,” Arnold said, adding that he instead focused on taking care of the people around him.
    


            In the aftermath of the attack, Arnold said he's focused on helping his fellow soldiers.
    


            “Of course, friends were shot. Bad things happen, and I'm going to continue to take care of my soldiers and continue to move forward,” he said.
    


            The Army soldiers who responded to the scene of yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart had to treat the situation as though they were training for war, the battalion commander said in a news conference.
    


                    “It's really a — it's a battle drill,” said Lt. Col. Mike Sanford of the 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, “and they went into action and did what they needed to do. So whether it's here or overseas or we're in combat, they did the right thing.”
                





            Sanford said he knew the suspect, Quornelius Radford. Asked if there were any warning signs ahead of the shooting, Sanford responded, “Not at this time.”
    


            Quornelius Radford, the 28-year-old Army sergeant accused of carrying out the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia, will likely be transferred to a military detention center, said Ryan O'Connor,Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Special Agent in Charge.
    


            O'Connor said Radford is currently in custody and that CID is working through the Uniform Code of Military Justice processes.
    


            He said he did not know when Radford will be transferred or the location of the military detention center.
    


            Two of the five soldiers who were shot at Fort Stewart yesterday remain hospitalized today, according to the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division.
    


            “One solider remains as an in-patient at Winn Army (Community Hospital) right here on Fort Stewart. She's doing very well, in high spirits,” said Brig. Gen. John Lubas. “Of course, she's got a little bit of a road to recovery. We're hopeful she may be released as early as this weekend but that will just depend on how things heal up over the next couple of days.”
    


            Another solider who was more seriously injured is recovering at Savannah Memorial Community Hospital, about 45 miles from the base, the general said.
    


                    “She's got a little bit longer road to recovery,” said Lubas. “The doctors are very positive, but I think it's going to take her a big longer to recover. They're very hopeful she's going to make a complete recovery.”
                





            The other three shooting victims were released yesterday, according to Lubas. The Army has not identified the victims nor the nature of their injuries.
    


            An unarmed soldier tackled the shooter, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said during a news conference at Fort Stewart in Georgia.
    


                    “So just think about this, they were unarmed and ran at and tackled an armed person who they knew was actively shooting their buddies, their colleagues, their fellow soldiers,” Driscoll said.
                





            He added that another soldier “jumped on top of the person to subdue them” until law enforcement officials arrived.  Four other soldiers attended to the injured, Driscoll said.
    


            US Army officials who met with the families of soldiers wounded in yesterday's shooting described those meetings as “heartbreaking” in this morning's news conference.
    


            “It was heartbreaking sitting in there, and seeing the soldier, their daughter, sitting behind them, struggling,” said Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in response to a question from CNN's Ryan Young.
    


            “Our hearts broke with them. We tried to hug them,” Driscoll said, adding he tried to convey support from the president, vice president and secretary of defense. “We stand behind them.”
    


            Army officials will not speculate on the motives of the attacker who shot and injured five people at Fort Stewart yesterday.
    


            “We will not speculate on the assailant's motives or the circumstances that led to yesterday's events,” Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Angel Tomko said today ahead of a news conference, citing the ongoing investigation into the attack.
    


            Counselors will be available for soldiers dealing with trauma after the shooting at Fort Stewart that left five people injured, US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll said.
    


            Driscoll addressed the soldiers after presenting those who helped stop the suspected shooter with medals.
    


                    “We want you to take care of yourself,” Driscoll said. “It may be a little bit until this moment really fully hits you, and that's OK, but just know that you can talk to anyone around you. We are here for you. We love you.”
                





            The Army and community members are standing by the soldiers, Brig. Gen. John Lubas said.
    


            “People are going to process this and work through this at different rates, and we know we've got to keep a very close eye on them and wrap our arms around them,” he said.
    


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll awarded medals to soldiers who he said helped halt yesterday's shooting at Fort Stewart by subduing the suspect and tending to the injured.
    


                    “We're going to take a moment and thank these six soldiers,” Driscoll said. “Under duress and fire, they ran into battle to the sound of the gunfire, took down the assailant, and then took care of their comrades, and that made all the difference.”
                





            Driscoll then presented the Meritorious Service Medal to six soldiers, four of whom appeared to be men and two of whom appeared to be women.
    


            The medal is awarded to servicemembers who distinguish themselves through “outstanding non-combat meritorious achievement or service,” according to the US Army.
    


            Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll arrived at Fort Stewart a short while ago and addressed soldiers gathered outside before he planned to recognize those who helped halt yesterday's shooting by tackling the suspect.
    


            “You are in all of our thoughts and prayers,” Driscoll told them, saying he had spoken with President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
    


            The soldiers, Driscoll said, endured a “terrible day” yesterday that “could have gone much worse if not for you and your colleagues.”
    


                    “The heroism shown under fire is something that we should all aspire to know,” Driscoll said.
                





            Authorities have identified the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart as 28-year-old Quornelius Samentrio Radford, an active-duty sergeant who the US Army said had enlisted in 2018 as an automated logistical specialist.
    


            Assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Radford's role involved handling supplies and warehouse operations, the Army said. He had not deployed to a combat zone and had no known behavioral incidents on his military record.
    


            Here's what else we know:
    


A recent arrest: Brig. Gen. John Lubas on Wednesday acknowledged Radford had recently been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Radford's chain of command was unaware of the arrest, which happened in May, before yesterday's shooting, Lubas said. Radford was out on bond and due for arraignment on August 20.
    


A personal weapon: Radford used a personal handgun in the attack, Lubas said. According to a law enforcement official briefed on the case, Radford used a 9mm Glock that he bought in Florida in May. The gun was recovered at the scene along with shell casings, the official said.
    


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll today will honor the soldiers who sprang into action to stop the active-duty sergeant accused of opening fire at Fort Stewart yesterday and wounding five of his coworkers.
    


            Driscoll will recognize the soldiers' “acts of heroism,” according to a news release.
    


            Brig. Gen. John Lubas previously said the attack was stopped when nearby soldiers “immediately and without hesitation tackled the soldier (and) subdued him.” The wounded coworkers were in stable condition as of Wednesday afternoon.
    


Some background: Driscoll, of North Carolina, served in the Army before attending Yale Law School, working in banking and unsuccessfully running for Congress as a Republican. He was nominated by President Donald Trump to his current position and was sworn in to the role in February.

            President Donald Trump on Thursday demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following reports and allegations that he has ties to China.
    


            “The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            The call comes just days after Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton raised concerns and pressed the chair of Intel's board over the CEO's alleged connections to China, questioning the integrity of the company and its impact on US national security.
    


            In a letter earlier this week to Intel board Chair Frank Yeary, Cotton pointed to recent reporting on Tan's Chinese investments. Reuters in April reported that Tan has personally and through various venture funds invested in hundreds of Chinese companies, some of which have ties to the country's military.
    


            “The new CEO of @intel reportedly has deep ties to the Chinese Communists. U.S. companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations. The board of @Intel owes Congress an explanation,” Cotton wrote in a post on X, attaching the letter.
    


            Intel and Tan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
    


            Shares of Intel (INTC) fell nearly 5% in premarket trading.
    


            Trump's remarks come as Tan, who took over as Intel CEO in March, is attempting to revive the beleaguered chipmaker after it missed out on the mobile and AI boom. Rival Nvidia, whose chips have been crucial for AI infrastructure, became the first $4 trillion company last month. Intel said in July that it had slashed 15% of its workforce in the hopes of creating “a faster-moving, flatter and more agile organization.”
    


            Before taking over the top job at Intel, Tan was the CEO of tech design company Cadence Design Systems and was a founding member of Walden Catalyst Ventures.
    


            Thursday's Truth Social post comes after Trump has criticized Intel in the past. On Wednesday, as Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the iPhone maker would invest another $100 billion in its US operations, the president took a shot at Intel.
    


            “Intel was just taken over the over the coals,” he said. “They were taken to the cleaners, frankly.”
    


This is a developing story and will be updated.

US President Donald Trump has told his team to “move fast” to arrange a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, CNN reported on Wednesday. Putin proposed a direct meeting with Trump during talks earlier in the day with US special envoy Steve Witkoff, the news outlet said, citing two anonymous sources in the White House. The US president's aides reportedly began planning for a potential summit immediately. Though these types of high-level meetings typically require preparation time, “Trump was urging his team to move fast,” CNN wrote. No location has been confirmed, but discussions could begin as early as next week, the outlet added. Earlier in the day, Trump praised the outcome of the Putin-Witkoff talks, saying there is “a very good prospect” for a meeting between the Russian president and Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky.

“There is a good chance there could be a meeting very soon,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated on Wednesday that this could come in the form of a trilateral summit involving Trump, Putin, and Zelensky, provided peace talks on the Ukraine conflict go well. The New York Times also reported that the US president intends to meet soon with his Russian counterpart. Trump unveiled the plan in a recent phone call with European leaders, in which he announced plans to hold a trilateral summit alongside Putin and Zelensky after a one-on-one with the Russian leader, the NYT wrote on Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. Moscow has not yet confirmed any plans for a meeting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said time is needed to normalize US-Russia relations before a summit can occur. Relations between Washington and Moscow fell to an “unprecedented level” under Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, leaving many points of contention, he told TASS on Wednesday.

US President Donald Trump has said he could impose new sanctions on China as part of a broader effort to pressure countries that trade with Russia.

On Wednesday, Trump said he will double the tariffs on India to 50% by late August, accusing the South Asian nation of aiding Moscow in the Ukraine conflict by buying Russian oil.

Later that day at a press briefing at the White House, the president was asked whether he plans to extend additional tariffs to China.

“Could happen. Depends on how we do,” Trump said.

Asked about other nations' purchases of Russian energy, he stated that more tariffs will follow.

“You're going to see a lot more. You're going to see so much secondary sanctions,” he said.

New Delhi and Beijing, two of the largest importers of Russian oil, have both pledged to defend their economic interests despite the new tariffs.

“India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interests,” the Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

Beijing vowed last week to “ensure its energy supply” in ways that guarantee its interests. “Tariff wars have no winners,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated.

US tariffs on Chinese goods currently stand at 30%, temporarily frozen after a major trade standoff earlier this year.

In April, Trump launched a trade war with Beijing, which pushed final tit-for-tat US tariffs to 145% and China's retaliatory tariffs to 125%. The two superpowers reached a trade truce in May, but the temporary freeze is set to expire next Tuesday.

US-Chinese trade talks in Sweden last week saw both agree to work towards extending the tariff truce, but did not reach a final agreement.

MINSK, August 7. /TASS/. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has expressed concern over the increasingly aggressive stance of Poland and the Baltic states. During a meeting focused on the activities of the State Security Committee (KGB), he emphasized that the situation extends beyond internal affairs, primarily reflecting the tense military and political environment surrounding Belarus, the BelTA news agency reports.

Lukashenko remarked, ""It is alarming that our neighbors – Poland and the Baltic countries – are acting in a very intimidating and hostile manner toward Belarus. They are exerting pressure from all sides, and our intelligence agencies are feeling this most acutely. That's why we, and I personally, are paying the closest attention to the work of the KGB and the security sector as a whole.""

BelTA recalled that some time ago, KGB Chief Ivan Tertel proposed measures to enhance the agency's effectiveness. The main report was delivered by Alexander Volfovich, the Secretary of Belarus's Security Council. Attending the event were notable figures including KGB Chairman Andrey Shved, Prosecutor General Igor Sergeyenko, and Chief of Staff of the Council of Ministers Valery Vakulchik.

Lukashenko concluded with optimism, stating, ""I hope we will have an open and objective discussion on this topic and reach a suitable conclusion.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, August 7. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he is not against holding a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky but conditions should be created to do that.

""I have reiterated that I have nothing against that on the whole, it is possible,"" Putin told reporters. ""However, certain conditions should be created to do that. Regrettably, there is still a long haul ahead for creation of such conditions,"" he added.

The Kremlin has repeatedly stressed the Russian side is ready for the meeting between Putin and Zelensky but a huge amount of preparatory activities should be completed for that. It is Kiev that is insisting on such meeting without a clear agenda.

The US mentioned the possibility of a trilateral meeting of Putin, Zelensky and US leader Donald Trump, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said earlier. Moscow left this option without comment and urged to focus on the bilateral US-Russia summit. Ushakov told reporters earlier that the Russian leader and US President Donald Trump would hold a meeting in coming days.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON, August 7. /TASS/. China's cooperation with Russia is reasonable and lawful, as well as deserving of respect and protection, Chinese Embassy Spokesperson Liu Pengyu told TASS in response to potential new US import tariffs targeting China over its trade relations with Russia.

""The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Russia within the framework of international law. This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected,"" Liu stated. ""China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. Tariff wars have no winners.

Liu noted that ""recently, China and the U.S. held the latest round of China-US economic and trade talks in Stockholm,"" where both sides ""reviewed and affirmed the implementation of the consensus reached in the economic and trade talks in Geneva and the framework agreed on in London talks.""

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that The Washington administration may impose additional tariffs on China for trading with Russia.

Broad language could allow cities to lock up unhoused people as aid is cut and housing costs soar, experts warn

Donald Trump's executive order that pushes local governments to remove unhoused people from the streets will exacerbate the issues already facing people who have unstable housing, mental health conditions and substance use disorders – and the vague wording could be used for wider action, experts say.

“It's one of the most harmful things to happen to folks who live outside in decades. It is not going to help anybody,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center.

“It sets the stage for rounding up folks who are homeless, folks with mental health issues, folks who are disabled – and instead of helping them, forcing them into detention camps and institutions. So it's terrifying.”

The order instructs states and municipalities to crack down on public substance use; camping, loitering, or squatting in urban spaces; mental health issues; and sex offender registration. It calls for “shifting” people without stable housing into “long-term institutional settings”.

“It is essentially creating a pathway to criminalize larger and larger numbers of people,” said Margaret Sullivan, a family nurse practitioner and director of programs for immigrant and unhoused communities at the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University.

The order is “vague and broad and potentially leaning toward creating more civil rights violations”, she said.

The conditions for detainment outlined in the order are poorly defined, which means it could be interpreted broadly to detain and involuntarily institutionalize people in public spaces. And it doesn't detail who may make determinations on institutionalization.

“It doesn't define ‘mental health crisis'. It also doesn't define who's qualified to make an assessment,” said Rabinowitz.

Individuals with mental illness are defined in the order as people who “pose risks to themselves or the public”, which could be broad enough to encompass many people, he said.

And while the order sometimes refers to cracking down on “illicit” substance use, at other times it speaks more generally to substance use disorder – a condition that can include legal substances such as alcohol and prescription medication.

Many states already have laws on involuntary commitment for mental illness, Sullivan said. Typically, the process begins with clinical healthcare providers or mental health professionals and goes through the judicial system.

“There's a judicial system to ensure that the rights of the individual are not being violated. To strip away those checks and balances, and make it so that there's more essentially policing on the streets of mental illness … has never been proved to be effective in the long run,” Sullivan said.

“This goes a step further than what we've seen in some other states or cities,” she added.

The order would also expand drug courts and mental health courts, and it would “allow or require” anyone receiving federal funding for homelessness support to collect health information and share it with law enforcement.

The Trump administration will also stop supporting housing-first policies, which provide housing and support services as quickly as possible to people experiencing homelessness, the order said.

It comes amid significant proposed reductions for affordable housing.

“The Trump administration is going to make housing more expensive. They're going to force more people into homelessness. And then once people are homeless, they're going to take away actual solutions, and instead lock people up for being homeless,” Rabinowitz said.

This approach has serious repercussions for health, he added.

“Housing is the best form of healthcare, period. The health impacts of housing are tremendous, and the health consequences of homelessness are devastating.”

Higher rates of involuntary institutionalization would add greater strain to the healthcare system, Sullivan said. “We know that involuntary commitment leads to more people being in the emergency room and emergency rooms being more overwhelmed than they currently are.”

Cuts to Medicaid will also make it harder for people with mental illness and substance use disorder to access healthcare, Sullivan said.

And the new federal budget cuts funding for supportive services like mental health care and substance use treatment.

The administration also plans to review grants for existing substance use programs, with explicit instructions not to fund projects on harm reduction – which often includes overdose response and naloxone distribution, needle and syringe exchanges, and education on safer drug use, among other initiatives – and safe consumption. And the order instructed Trump administration officials to pursue possible lawsuits against such programs.

States and cities receiving federal funding could see that money restricted or frozen if they don't enforce the new rules, the executive order said.

In the wake of last year's supreme court decision on Grant's Pass, upholding the Oregon city's ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness, several states and municipalities introduced stricter laws to target people living outside.

“Especially when federal funding is really disappearing, this hamstrings cities and municipalities into compliance in order just to fund vital services,” Sullivan said.

Focusing on programs addressing these issues in innovative ways “makes it seem like this is another mechanism for going after places like LA or Portland or Chicago or any place that is trying to do something different with addressing homelessness and substance use”, Sullivan said.

“That is, to me, what it seems like – this is a way to go after not just individuals and people, but to go after areas,” she said.

But it will have sweeping effects on homeless people and others to whom the order is applied.

“I think that they are motivated by this incorrect belief that homelessness is a choice, that we have to punish people in order for them to make a better choice,” Rabinowitz said.

Even if that were true, he said, “there are no carrots right now, there's no housing that anybody can afford, but there are a whole ton of sticks, and we know that people don't need a stick. People want housing; there's just no housing that they can afford. But the executive order does nothing to address the actual causes of homelessness.”

Sullivan agreed.

“It does nothing to address underlying poverty. It does nothing to address the persistently unaffordable housing crisis,” she said.

“It does nothing to expand access to Medicaid for impoverished people. Meanwhile, the numbers in the US of people who are experiencing chronic homelessness and disability are increasing.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Elizabeth Warren and others pen letter over alleged plan to divert funds from nuclear arsenal to convert jet into Air Force One

Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump's reported plan to divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a luxury jet gifted by Qatar into a new Air Force One.

The US president provoked an outcry in May when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet as a free gift from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the plane so it can transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an estimated $1bn.

Now Democrats are seizing on media reports that the retrofit will be partly funded by money redirected from Sentinel, a nuclear missile modernisation programme already running years behind schedule and said to be 81% over budget.

In a letter obtained by the Guardian, senators Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Ed Markey and Adam Schiff, along with representatives John Garamendi and Jamie Raskin, demand answers from Troy Meink, the secretary of the air force.

The letter reminds Meink that, in testimony to the Senate armed services committee, he acknowledged the Qatari plane needs “significant modifications” to meet Air Force One standards. These are likely to include defences against threats ranging from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear blast, secure and reliable communications systems, and protections against counterintelligence.

The Democrats write: “In June, you told Congress that the cost of retrofitting the Qatari Boeing 747-8 ‘wouldn't be anywhere near' the reported $1 billion estimate. Do you still believe this to be the case?”

The air force has reportedly assessed $934m previously appropriated for the Sentinel programme as “excess to need”, allowing these funds to be used for other classified programmes, including the retrofits for the Qatari jet.

In their letter, the Democrats ask Meink: “Has the Air Force assessed whether shifting funds out of the Sentinel program will increase the program's costs or risk further delaying the program's schedule?

“Did or will any of the $934 million from the Sentinel program go to retrofits for the Qatari Boeing 747-8, or were or will those funds be diverted to other programs?”

Warren and her colleagues criticise a lack of transparency, noting that the total price tag for the Qatari jet retrofit is classified, preventing policymakers and the public from understanding if “additional retrofit costs will eat into other Air Force programs beyond Sentinel”.

The Democrats request a commitment from the air force to ensure that it is “fully cooperating with any independent investigation into the acceptance of the Qatari jet and/or the Qatari jet's retrofitting”.

Democrats have previously suggested that the gift to Trump likely violates the constitution's prohibition on accepting foreign emoluments. They point out that the jet would only be used by the government for a few years at most before being donated to Trump's presidential library.

Trump has previously defended the ethics of his decision. He said: “I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I could be a stupid person and say: ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.'”

He also compared it with “favours on the golf course. When they give you a putt, you pick it up and you walk to the next hole and you say: ‘Thank you very much.'”

But the senators and representatives take a different view. “However,” they write, “by providing the president with a ‘palace in the sky' it clearly appears that Qatar is trying to curry favor with the administration.”

Meanwhile the Trump Organization recently announced a new Trump-branded resort along the coast of Qatar, partnering with Qatari Diar, a property company backed by that country's sovereign wealth fund.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

There are fears that pressure for quick results is threatening the Lebanese effort to gradually build a stronger state

Middle East crisis – live updates

Under mounting US pressure, Lebanon's government is being forced into a dangerous choice. Does it want to fight a war with Israel or does it want to fight a war at home, with Hezbollah?

In recent weeks, the US has been pushing for the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah. The government had already been moving in that direction, but not at the pace the US wanted. Lebanese media began to fill with warnings from unnamed sources that if Hezbollah's arms were not confiscated soon, a second war with Israel could be on the horizon.

On Tuesday, the Lebanese government acquiesced and announced the Lebanese army would draw up a plan to place arms exclusively within the hands of the state by year's end. Hezbollah and its political ally Amal announced the next day that they would “treat the decision as if it did not exist” and accused the government of serving US diktats.

US pressure for faster disarmament has laid the seeds for a scenario the Lebanese government has taken pains to avoid: a confrontation with Hezbollah. If cornered, the group could resort to force to defend its arsenal.

Lebanon's current government was born after the latest Hezbollah-Israel war, with the US as its midwife. A battered Hezbollah could no longer maintain its side of a stalemate that had left Lebanon without a president for two years, and Joseph Aoun, the former army chief, was elected amid heavy US pressure.

The election of Aoun, who included in his mandate restoring the state's monopoly on violence, was an extraordinary sign of how much Lebanon, and the region, had changed in the past year.

Hezbollah had dominated Lebanon for two decades. What had started as a resistance group described as a “state within a state” had transformed into a party controlling the state, setting much of Lebanon's domestic and foreign policy.

It was only after a devastating war with Israel, which saw virtually all of its top leadership killed, thousands of fighters dead or wounded and a large portion of its weapons destroyed, that Hezbollah's grip on the country was loosened. The toppling of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in December was another blow to the group, which had used Syria as its main supply route from Iran.

The new Lebanese government, however, was careful not to gloat. It took pains not to publish videos of soldiers confiscating Hezbollah weapons caches in south Lebanon. Too aggressive an approach to Hezbollah could provoke a confrontation and alienate the group's base of mostly Shia Muslims.

First and foremost was to engage in state-building so that former members of Hezbollah and its popular base felt included in Lebanon's national project, rather than under siege.

Officials were aware that the same conditions which gave rise to Hezbollah in the 1980s are still present today. Similar to 45 years ago, Israel occupies parts of southern Lebanon and the country's Shia population, which bore the brunt of Lebanon's war, are impoverished and do not feel represented by the state.

The US views the gradual pace that the state has set as stalling, however.

On the Lebanese side, officials have privately complained that the Americans seem unconcerned with building a strong Lebanese state. Instead, the US wanted immediate results on disarmament, putting the new government's state-building project at risk.

“This process is very dangerous the way it is unfolding. It will actually consolidate and push potentially even wider sectors of the Shia portion of Lebanese society behind Amal and Hezbollah rather than to national consolidation,” said Joseph Daher, the author of Hezbollah: the Political Economy of the Party of God.

Near-daily Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, in violation of the November ceasefire, have also undermined the Lebanese government's claims that only the state can protect sovereignty.

The day after Lebanon announced it would draft a plan to disarm Hezbollah, an 11-year-old child was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon.

The Lebanese army has not responded to any of the thousands of Israeli airstrikes on the country since November – nor does anyone expect it to. The under-equipped, under-staffed army can do little in the face of an Israeli military equipped with US fighter jets, which drop the latest US munitions by the thousand.

There is little appetite among the international community to help the Lebanese army become a proper fighting force. Requests by army leadership to install low-tech watchtowers on its border with Israel have been rejected.

Without the means to do so, asking the Lebanese army to enforce the disarmament of Hezbollah is a tall order. “How can you ask the LAF to do to Hezbollah what Israel couldn't do to Hamas in a smaller space, with warplanes?” said a senior diplomat in Beirut.

Nonetheless, international pressure to disarm Hezbollah is likely to increase, not abate. Opinion among international powers on the question of the Lebanese state's monopoly on arms was uniform.

“The US, Saudi and EU are in agreement on this point: the question is no longer if Hezbollah should be disarmed, but how to do it,” the diplomat said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

10:54 JST, August 7, 2025

PARIS (AFP-Jiji) — The number of people with liver cancer will nearly double worldwide by 2050 unless more is done to address preventable causes such as obesity, alcohol consumption and hepatitis, a recent study warned.

New cases of liver cancer — the sixth most common form of the disease — will rise to 1.52 million a year from 870,000 if current trends continue, according to data from the Global Cancer Observatory published in the Lancet medical journal.

It is also the third deadliest of all cancers, with the study predicting it would take 1.37 million lives by the middle of the century.

However three out of five cases of liver cancer could be prevented, the international team of experts said.

The risk factors are drinking alcohol, viral hepatitis and a build-up of fat in the liver linked to obesity called MASLD, which was previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

The viruses that cause hepatitis B and C are expected to remain the leading causes of liver cancer in 2050, according to the study, published on World Hepatitis Day.

Vaccination at birth is the best way to prevent hepatitis B, but vaccine coverage remains low in poorer countries including in sub-Saharan Africa, the study said.

Unless vaccination rates are increased, hepatitis B is expected to kill 17 million people between 2015 and 2030, it added.

It is estimated alcohol consumption will cause more than 21% of all cases of liver cancer by 2050, up more than two percentage points from 2022.

Cancer due to obesity-linked fat in livers will rise to 11%, also up more than two percentage points, the researchers calculated.

The large-scale study, which reviewed the available evidence on the subject, underscored “the urgent need for global action” on liver cancer, the authors said.

The experts called for more public awareness about the preventable danger of liver cancer, particularly by warning people with obesity or diabetes about fatty-liver disease in the United States, Europe and Asia.

14:56 JST, August 7, 2025

Enrique Ochoa, Mexico's undersecretary for multilateral affairs and human rights, expressed concern that the threat of nuclear weapons is being underestimated globally in an online interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on Tuesday.

Ochoa, who holds the stance of promoting nuclear abolition said that “there has been a kind of banalization of nuclear threats and their use,” as the focus on nuclear deterrence has increased. He raised urgency about nuclear proliferation, saying, “A world with more states possessing nuclear weapons … will be more dangerous.”

After noting that Mexico and other nations have led the negotiations for the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, he emphasized, “Since the nuclear attacks on Japan [in 1945], Mexico has been a very strong advocate of nuclear disarmament.”

Ochoa stated Mexico's willingness to collaborate with Japan on nuclear disarmament, emphasizing that “we have a lot of common ground in terms of peace and security.”

He expressed gratitude for the activities of Nihon Hidankyo (the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations), which received the Nobel Peace Prize last year, and said Mexico would further develop its achievements through diplomatic action.

Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine created an online ""catalog"" where Ukrainian children are offered up for adoption while sorted based on physical traits like eye or hair color, the head of a Ukrainian NGO said on Aug. 6, denouncing the practice as child trafficking.

The database, which includes data on 294 children, is available on the education department of the Russian occupation authorities in Luhansk Oblast.

""Most children in this catalog were born in Luhansk Oblast before the Russian occupation and had Ukrainian citizenship,"" Mykola Kuleba, CEO of the Save Ukraine organization, said in an Instagram post.

""Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction."" 

Ukraine has identified more than 19,500 children abducted by Russia during the full-scale war and forcibly transferred to Russia, the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, or Belarus. Only 1,480 have been brought back home.

Ukrainian officials estimate the real figure could be far higher. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets puts the number at up to 150,000, while Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Daria Herasymchuk has given a range of 200,000–300,000.

Kuleba said that many children who grew up in territories occupied by Russia since 2014, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, have been ""systematically deported and transferred to Russian families in Moscow and other Russian regions.""

The Russian-run database describes the children listed in the database as ""orphans and children left without parental care."" The website allows users to filter the children by age, eye and hair color, and the preferred form of guardianship, such as adoption or foster care.

Children are introduced with their photos, age, gender, and character traits, with some being described as ""obedient"" or ""calm.""

""The way they describe our children is indistinguishable from a slave catalog. This is child trafficking in the 21st century, and the world must act to stop it immediately,"" Kuleba said. According to him, the database is part of an effort to ""improve"" the system in the face of dropping demand for adoptions.

Save Ukraine is a charitable organization founded in 2014 to support vulnerable groups, namely orphans and children rescued from Russian-occupied territories. 

The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine's children's rights officials for comment.

The abductions of Ukrainian children have been broadly denounced by the international community as a war crime. Their return has remained a central and non-negotiable demand in Ukraine's negotiations with Moscow.

During peace talks in Istanbul, Russian officials dismissed Kyiv's appeal to return the abducted children as a ""show for childless European old ladies,"" even as they admitted to relocating hundreds, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their personal roles in organizing the illegal transfers.

Ukraine's military launched a drone attack on Russia's Volgograd Oblast overnight on Aug. 7, striking a railway station in the town of Surovikino, regional Governor Andrei Bocharov reported.

Preparations for the meeting are underway, and the venue has already been agreed upon, Russian foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said.

""This step will help ensure transparency and legality in the work of enlistment offices' teams, as well as protect the rights of both sides,"" Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

""As in May 2025, the only plan that can be the subject of discussions and approval by the Ukrainian public is a joint plan from Europe and Ukraine,"" the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology read.

""Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction,"" said Mykola Kuleba, head of the Save Ukraine organization. 

Members of the Russian Community reportedly arrived at the cemetery in Russia's Karelia region before the ceremony on Aug. 5 and doused participants with water while singing the patriotic Soviet song “Katyusha,” according to Sova.

""Yesterday (Aug. 6), various potential formats for leader-level meetings to bring peace were also discussed – two bilateral and one trilateral,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said after a phone call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Ukraine's debt securities, sensitive to prospects of an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, hit their highest levels in four months. 

The comments reportedly came during a phone call on Aug. 6, just two days before U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face harsher U.S. penalties.

""The demilitarization of the temporarily occupied Crimea continues,"" Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said in a statement.

""No one else was harmed. The injured person has been hospitalized,"" the police said on social media.

""As a result of the drone strike, a fire broke out at a technical unit for processing gas and gas condensate,"" the General Staff reported.

The slowdown reflects the limits of Russia's war-fueled expansion, driven by military spending at the expense of civilian investment and private consumption.

The official, who has not been publicly named, is accused of organizing a campaign of abuse against Ukrainian detainees, including civilians. Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, was among the victims, prosecutors said.

""President (Donald) Trump has made it clear that he's willing and capable of moving forward on some economic actions, secondary sanctions, or other direct sanctions as well,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Israeli flags are a common sight at Auschwitz-Birkenau.AFP / Getty Images

So just how bad did things get for worldwide Jewry in 2025, someone might ask in a future history class. So bad, the answer might go, that Israeli flags weren't allowed at Auschwitz.

So, pretty bad. Ugly bad.

While not exactly accurate, that is what a group of Israelis felt they experienced when visiting the site of the concentration camp – now a huge, sprawling museum of horrors, near Oswiecim, Poland. Here about 1.1-million people were murdered by Nazis, who had built high-efficiency gas chambers in German-occupied Poland for that purpose. Most of the victims were Jewish, murdered for that sole fact.

So imagine you're a Jewish member of an Israeli delegation, visiting with your emotions and your history and your flags, and you are stopped at the entrance. The flags, the group understood, were the problem.

Israeli flags – as controversial as they might be at this moment – are a common sight at Auschwitz-Birkenau. They are particularly pervasive during the March of the Living, when Jewish people from around the world visit on Holocaust Remembrance Day and parade solemnly from Auschwitz to Birkenau. When I first heard about last week's flag controversy, the image that immediately came to mind was of a young March participant walking along the railway tracks that once led to death, wearing an Israeli flag as a cape.

Opinion: As a Jewish Canadian, I want my community to speak out about the horrors in Gaza

Opinion: Genocide is a process, not an event

Here's what actually happened last week: A group of 180 Israeli army officers and security officials arrived at the gates of Birkenau for a commemoration known as “Witnesses in Uniform” and were told they could not enter carrying the flags, according to Ynet news. Discussions with local officials ensued, and finally, the group entered without their flags. 

One participant told Ynet news that he believed the incident stemmed from antisemitism and an attempt to reshape the historical narrative. 

The real issue, according to the museum, was that the event had not been disclosed or approved in advance.

“The problem was not about the flags themselves, which are allowed, but about organizing ceremonies on the grounds of the memorial site, during which flags and banners on wooden poles are sometimes brought in,” Auschwitz Museum spokesperson Bartosz Bartyzel explained by email. “It is a matter of ensuring the safety of visitors and ceremony participants.”

The museum stated on X that organizers failed to follow proper procedures. “Under no circumstances can the grounds of the former camp be a space for unco-ordinated manifestations or ceremonies – even those carried out with good intentions.” 

Even if the optics aren't great, this is fair. 

On social media, Israel's ambassador to Poland called this a misunderstanding, dismissing claims of antisemitism and humiliation. 

Still, consider for a moment what it must have felt like for those Jews denied entry. To Auschwitz! Among them surely were descendants of Holocaust survivors, perhaps the children or grandchildren of people who had survived – or were murdered in – this very place.

This is hardly the most concerning thing happening in the world right now regarding the State of Israel. But the delegation's response and the social media outrage are indicative of the Jewish experience in 2025. 

Mr. Bartyzel did not answer my question about whether this has happened before. Have unauthorized Israeli flags entered the site previously by people marching in? Has anyone been forced to return their flags to their vehicles and then enter without them? Has such an order been given before Israel became the global pariah it is now? If so, I missed the global outrage.

Today, the Jewish community is on high alert, frightened that antisemitism is lurking around every corner. Here in Canada, B'nai Brith reports that antisemitism has reached “perilous, record-setting heights.” The same thing is happening in the U.S., the U.K., around the world. 

In the midst of this, it is easy for Jews to assume antisemitic intent. While this is often true, it is not always the case. We need to be thoughtful in each circumstance. 

That said, if there is a spot where the consequences of antisemitism can be felt viscerally, it is at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where the absolute worst happened.

I visited the site in 1998 during the March of the Living, with family members including my mother, who survived Birkenau. It was a difficult day for her, but she drew comfort from not just her own descendants, but from seeing so many young Jews from around the world – and the sea of Israeli flags. They were a symbol of what rose from all she had lost: her parents, her little brother, her home, every single possession, her freedom, her youth, her education, her health, her life as she had known it.

Nobody should have to experience such staggering losses. Nobody.

It's a little misleading to ask what the average home costs in Canada: there are so many types, markets and submarkets that the answer makes little statistical sense. Still, the Canadian Real Estate Association does its best with a measure called the National Composite MLS Home Price Index, which tries to suss out where the market overall is going by looking at sales and listings from real estate boards across the country. The latest figures from June show four months of slowly deflating home prices, but they also set a benchmark of $776,400 for single-family detached homes prices across the country.

CREA's numbers show these types of homes are still historically quite expensive, but still lower than when the pandemic-era boom rocketed prices to a peak of $951,200 in 2022. Since then, the trend has been down to the point where CREA's national numbers say these homes are now about 18 per cent lower than their peak.

Not all markets are created equal though: some are still seeing prices marching upwards while others have properties available at a relative bargain. Here's what you'd find if you took that national benchmark and applied it to local markets across the country.

While there are undeveloped lots for sale in Greater Vancouver for under $800,000 (although in the case of the two currently for sale in Burnaby, there's literally a cargo rail track in your front yard) you have drive about an hour away to Maple Ridge to find something like a livable detached house (such as a 1,000-square foot, three-bedroom bungalow at 12121 228 St.) 

For something near national benchmark price you're better off searching B.C.'s vast interior, which is one of the more affordable single family markets in the province with a June single family benchmark of $802,200, down 7.9 per cent from the peak it hit in April, 2022 ($866,200). 

For example, for $779,900 you could get 610 Muir Rd. on the less-developed western side of Lake Okanagan. It's a relatively new-build home finished in 2019, with four bedrooms and about 2,100 square feet of living space. There is also has a three-car garage and a huge deck (and second-floor balcony) looking into the forests of Fintry Provincial Park just behind.

It's location – almost equidistant between Vernon and Kelowna – contributes to its relative affordability. “If that house was right in the city it would be substantially more money; You save money by driving a bit every day,” said listing agent Gord Heighton, realtor with RE/MAX Vernon Salt Fowler. According to him, most of the buyers in the area come from the Lower Mainland, or like himself, from Alberta.

“We get a lot of people relocating around town, upsizing or downsizing. They come here and buy their house for cash,” said Mr. Heighton. “We're still not, like, cheap; but compared to Toronto and Vancouver we are.”

Alberta is one of the few provinces that didn't see huge swings upward during the pandemic that then retrenched. The province as a whole has seen 38 per cent growth since the end of 2019. But the average single family home prices of $522,200 is still well below the national figure. That means in the most expensive market – Calgary, where prices sit around $694,000 – you can get a lovely single-story bungalow or split level on a modest lot near Nose Hill Park for under $780,000.

Meanwhile, Edmonton is still among the more affordable large-city markets in the country with a detached benchmark price of $505,300. For $775,000 you could have 7604 157 Ave. NW, a 3,200-square-foot, three-bedroom home that backs onto one of the city's man-made stormwater lakes. The listing agent, Paul Afonso, with MaxWell Progressive, is more of a builder and entrepreneur but is listing the home for a friend. He said the house dates from the late eighties and has had a few renovations since. Among the newer features are a wine cellar, an indoor hot-tub, a curving wooden staircase and a huge solarium off the kitchen that looks out into the lake. There's a vented barbecue and wood-burning stove to help make it through those long Edmonton winters.

Compared to the Prairies, Ontario's single-family homes grew an anemic 12.4 per cent from $793,000 in 2019 to $891,900 in June. That doesn't tell the whole story of course: it's also the province that saw some of the fastest swings upward and corrections backward of the pandemic.

The big caveat for the province is that “Greater Toronto” is one of the most expensive markets in the country (its $1.2-million benchmark price is second only to Greater Vancouver with $1.9-million). It's worth noting there's a big different between the “Greater” and the city of Toronto. Inside the city boundary the average detached home sold for $1.64-million in June, according to statistics from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. In Toronto, you could find a 700-square-foot detached worker's cottage built in the postwar period for under $800,000, but there aren't a lot of family-sized options at that price.

Outside of Greater Toronto and Hamilton there's quite a few regions where the single family prices are lower than the national number. In the Barrie-Simcoe area, prices are 21 per cent off their 2022 peak (from just over $1-million to $808,300), in Hamilton they are 25 per cent down (from $1.15-million to $864,100) while Kitchener-Waterloo has dropped 26 per cent (from $1.094-million to $805,600). Bargain hunters should note the K-W deals are still relative: the detached prices are still 40 per cent higher than they were in 2019.

For $770,000 you could get a charming three-bedroom brick house in downtown Kitchener at 32 Ellen St. E. The two-storey building is more than 127 years old but has been lovingly updated and maintained with some fanciful additions to the exterior; a motif of stars has been added to the porch and the paved rear yard and patio, perhaps in homage to K-W's premier performance venue (Centre in the Square) that's across the street. Inside there's a lot of personality expressed with hand-painted decorations on everything from kitchen cabinets and furnishings to doorway casings and trim. According to listing agent Alina Telescu with Red and White Realty Inc., rumour has it a host of notable locals have lived there over the years.

Detached homes have also been on a fairly steady rise in Quebec, up 47 per cent from the end of 2019 to June's $600,200 benchmark. Even so the province's most expensive market, the Montreal area, sees its benchmark price still well below the national figure at $684,800. There are plenty of options for a detached house at the national benchmark: closer to the city centre, they might be a little smaller or on eccentric lots. If you move toward the suburbs, you start to find larger properties with more land.

For $779,000 you could get a two-storey, split-level home in the West Island area known as DDO or Dollard-des-Ormeaux at 14355 Rue Meadowvale. This part of the city is 95-per-cent Anglophone, according to listing agent Nabil Rougui, with Group Sutton-Performer Inc., and looks a lot like many Canadian suburbs that began to spring up in the 1960s.

This house has four bedrooms spread across about 1,200 square feet, as well as a finished basement, and features a two-car garage and an in-ground pool in the backyard. While not the biggest house in Montreal in the most fashionable neighbourhood, it's still closer to the higher end of the market than the bottom. As sales slow and the market tips away from sellers towards favouring buyers, Mr. Rougui said he's increasingly having the conversation with clients about how much bigger their next house has to be? “They say ‘I want that big one because my cousin has a big house,'” he said. “If it were cars, it would be ‘You need a Honda Civic.' But people want that BMW or Mercedes: the difference between the need and the want comes into play.”

The price growth in New Brunswick from 2019 is nothing short of remarkable with prices almost doubling (up 94 per cent) from $169,500. In comparison, Newfoundland looks sluggish with just 44 per cent growth from $226,400 over the same period. When comparing the detached homes in the largest cities, Halifax's $584,200 price leads all other Maritimes cities and keeps Nova Scotia the most expensive of the eastern provinces. That's compared to $405,100 figure in St. John's on the Rock and $343,300 in Saint John.

To find a house near the national benchmark take a look in the Moncton area (N.B.'s priciest local market) for properties like 160 Boundary Dr.: This 3,000-square-foot, three-storey home (with attached three-car garage) sits on a 2.1-acre lot, in an area known as Rural Estates that has a bunch of other large houses on acreage, all hidden from each other in a thickly wooded area. The last time this home sold in 2019 the price was $366,500, meaning it's more than doubled in value.

“It was usually people from Ontario that would buy these during COVID,” said listing agent Rickey Côté, with Exit Realty Associates, who saw lots of folks cash out of homes in Central Canada and bring buckets of money to buyer cheaper property in his community. “I had one client sell his house in Ontario and bought three here; one for each of his daughters and one for himself,” he said. These days some of that Ontario money has had to leave, thanks to remote working policies withering away, and now the market is tilting more toward more moderate price growth even while home values remain higher than they had ever been historically. “It's not going to double again in the next four years, but we were so far behind the rest of the country,” said Mr. Côté.

Donald Trump is tightening sanctions loopholes that fund Moscow's war machine. What does a crackdown on Russia's oil trade mean for global markets — and economic heavyweights like China and India?

India and China have pushed back against US President Donald Trump's threats of secondary sanctions — penalties for doing business with a sanctioned country — over their continued purchases of Russia's oil, which is a key revenue stream for Moscow's war in Ukraine. 

Both nations vowed to protect their energy security and economic sovereignty against what Beijing firmly called ""coercion and pressure"" from the United States. China became the biggest importer of Russian oil in 2022.

India, meanwhile, accused the West of hypocrisy, pointing out that the European Union continues to import Russian energy, despite having massively reduced its reliance on it since the war began.

New Delhi further noted that Washington had actively supported its oil purchases from Russia, which ramped up shortly after the Russian invasion, to help stabilize global oil prices.

India's oil purchases from Russia grew nearly 19-fold from 2021 to 2024, from 0.1 to 1.9 million barrels a day, while China's rose by 50% to 2.4 million barrels a day.

Petras Katinas, a Lithuania-based energy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), told DW that India, Russia's second-largest oil buyer, had saved up to $33 billion in energy costs between 2022 and 2024 as Moscow offered large price cuts when the US and Europe cut their reliance on Russian oil and gas.

India's longtime policy of balancing ties with the US, Russia and China, without prioritizing any side, had ""underpinned"" the decision to buy discounted Russian crude, with New Delhi ""prioritizing energy security and affordability,"" Katinas said.

Having already imposed a 25% tariff on Indian imports, Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday, levying an additional 25% tariff on the same goods over India's purchases of Russian oil. 

Oil prices rose nearly 1% on the news, while Indian media outlets reported that the new levy could spike the country's oil bill by up to $11 billion. New Delhi labeled the additional levy ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.""

Trump said the tariffs would take effect in 21 days, giving India and Russia time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes. The president was also expected to announce wider secondary sanctions on other countries and entities with which Russia trades oil. The White House said that details would come on Friday, without providing further details.

Secondary sanctions would be another major blow to the Russian economy, already reeling from Western sanctions. With military spending now exceeding 6% of GDP and real inflation estimated by some analysts at 15-20% versus the official 9% figure, Russia is burning through cash, putting serious pressure on its budget and arms factories.

For global markets, new sanctions could trigger a seismic shock in energy prices and trade flows reminiscent of 2022, when the oil price surged and Russia bypassed Western sanctions by striking discounted energy deals with two of the world's largest economies.

""If India had not bought Russian crude [in 2022], it's anyone's guess what the oil price would have been — $100 (€86), $120, $300 [per barrel],"" Sumit Ritolia, a New Delhi-based oil analyst from trade research house Kpler, told DW. WTI crude hovered between $85 and $92 per barrel in the weeks before the invasion.

Trump's 25% ""secondary tariff"" could now leave India with no choice but to scale back at least some of its oil trade with Russia.  Any additional sanctions would only make matters worse.

Katinas said secondary sanctions ""raise the stakes"" significantly, ""threatening Indian companies' access to the US financial system and exposing banks, refineries, and shipping firms to serious repercussions given their integration into global markets.""

If Russia's five million barrels a day were suddenly removed from the oil market, analysts think oil prices could surge once again, as affected countries scramble to source other supplies. Even with oil cartel OPEC recently increasing output, replacing such a large volume would be exceptionally difficult in the short term, given limited spare capacity and logistical constraints.

""There is nowhere to get those five million [barrels] fast enough to prevent a spike in oil prices."" Alexander Kolyandr, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told the UK's Independent newspaper.

Ritolia told DW it may take Indian firms up to a year to cut their reliance on Russian oil, if required.

Higher oil prices would trigger a sharp rise in inflation both in the US and worldwide. The US Federal Reserve has estimated that every $10 increase in crude adds about 0.2 percentage points to US inflation. India's central bank reached a similar conclusion. 

In a worst-case scenario, if prices were to climb from the current $66 a barrel to $110-$120 per barrel, a roughly one percentage point inflation rise would drive up costs for consumers and businesses — especially in energy, transport, and food.

Katinas said China, whose total trade with the US is more than four times the size of India's, ""might be exempt"" from the new US measures. With the world's two largest economies conducting over $580 billion of trade, China's sheer economic scale gives it bargaining power that India lacks.

China's chokehold on the supply of rare earth minerals — a persistent friction point in US-China relations — may serve as yet another lever Beijing is pulling to temper Trump's stance.

With India lacking comparable leverage, Trump earlier this week doubled down on New Delhi, saying the likely impact of his new sanctions on Russia and India would ""take their dead economies down together.""

Asked on Wednesday why he was singling out India over China, Trump told reporters: ""It's only been 8 hours. So let's see what happens. You're going to see a lot more...You're going to see so many secondary sanctions.""

India is, meanwhile, no longer reaping the same windfall from Russian oil as it did in 2022, when discounts ranged from $15 to $20 per barrel. That margin has now narrowed to around $5, according to Kpler's Ritolia.

Eager to replenish its war chest, Russia is aggressively maximizing energy revenues, buoyed by rising demand from Turkey — now its third-largest oil customer — and across Asia, where Russian crude is covertly rebranded and reexported to sidestep American sanctions.

Still, Indian refiners continue to buy. Imports hit an 11-month high in June at 2.08 million barrels per day, accounting for 44% of India's total crude intake — a sharp rebound driven by hedging to offset the geopolitical tensions and price competitiveness.

Beyond the rhetoric, China's likely response seems guided by its earlier reaction to secondary sanctions. Chinese banks are increasingly refusing Russian transactions, even in yuan, forcing Moscow to rely on opaque intermediaries and third-country workarounds.

However, Beijing sees oil imports as a priority that is mostly shielded from political pressure, while India is seen as more likely to hedge: trimming purchases if pressured, but not abandoning discounted Russian crude entirely.

Ritolia speculated that India might ""reduce"" its Russian oil imports, but added: ""I don't see us going down to zero anytime soon.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why is Saudi Arabia leading push for Palestinian statehood?","https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-saudi-arabia-leading-push-for-palestinian-statehood/a-73536683","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 02:20:24 GMT","

Saudi Arabia is helping organize an international push to recognize Palestinian statehood. Is the oil-rich Gulf state acting for humanitarian reasons or due to self-interested foreign policy?  

Admirers are calling it a ""masterclass in diplomacy"" that offers a true chance for peace in the Middle East. Critics say it is a selfish move, a ""publicity stunt"" to help burnish a country's international image more often in the headlines for human rights abuses.

So why is Saudi Arabia leading the charge for international recognition of a Palestinian state?

The current Saudi push for more countries to recognize Palestinian statehood actually began around a year ago. In September 2024, Saudi Arabia, together with Norway, announced the launch of a ""Global Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution"" and held the first two meetings in Riyadh. 

In December 2024, the United Nations General Assembly voted to confirm again that most countries in the world believe the answer to problems between Israel and the Palestinian Territories is a two-state solution. 

Last week, Saudi Arabia and France chaired a conference on the topic. During and after the meeting, multiple countries — France, Canada, Malta, the UK and Australia — announced they would definitely be, or were very seriously thinking about, recognizing a Palestinian state.

The meeting also resulted in a seven-page document, the ""New York Declaration,"" signed by all member states of the Arab League, as well as the EU and around 17 other countries.

The declaration outlines a phased path towards a two-state solution. It calls on Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that led the incursion into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, to disarm, release remaining Israeli hostages and give up leadership in Gaza. ""We also condemn the attacks by Israel against civilians in Gaza and civilian infrastructure, siege and starvation, which have resulted in a devastating humanitarian catastrophe,"" the signatories said.

The fact that all 22 members of the Arab League signed the declaration was seen as a diplomatic breakthrough. It is the first time many have censured Hamas so publicly.

And Saudi Arabia, together with France, has been credited with helping to make it all happen.

""Given Saudi Arabia's position within the Arab and Islamic world, and the kingdom's stewardship of [sacred religious sites] Mecca and Medina, anything Saudi Arabia does carries weight,"" Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Middle East fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy, explained.

Before the October 2023 Hamas attacks and the ensuing Israeli military campaign, there was much talk of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel. But if it did, it would do so without any regard to the cause of Palestinian statehood, long a serious obstacle between Israel and good relations with its neighbors.

As a result, Saudi Arabia was often seen by locals in other Arab nations as a ""traitor"" to the Palestinian cause. This is why some critics have suggested that Saudi Arabia's recent moves at the UN are simply a way of combating that negative image in the Arab and Islamic world. 

But in fact, as Aziz Alghashian, a Saudi analyst with Washington-based think tank, the Gulf International Forum, wrote in the Cairo Review of Global Affairs, ""one of the enduring misconceptions on this topic is the idea that Saudi willingness to normalize ties with Israel is something new — when it actually dates back to the late 1960s.""

Saudi Arabian plans for a two-state solution also go back decades, Coates Ulrichsen pointed out.

In 2002, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah (who was crown prince at the time) proposed what is now known as the Arab Peace Initiative. At an Arab League summit in Beirut that same year, all the member states agreed to support the proposal, which among other things, says they would all recognize and normalize relations with Israel if Israel ended its occupation and agreed to establish a Palestinian state.

Over time, the initiative was derailed for a number of reasons, among them disagreements about Palestinians' right to return to land taken from them by Israel, the Arab Spring which changed the focus of regional politics, and then the Abraham Accords, which saw several Arab states normalize with Israel in their own interests.

""But for many years, the Arab Peace Initiative was the default Saudi position,"" Coates Ulrichsen said, a position that was reaffirmed as recently as 2020.

""Now, the urgency of the situation in Gaza and the worsening violence in the West Bank likely means that the Saudis have calculated that they cannot stay silent in the face of such destruction and humanitarian suffering,"" he continued. In fact, last week's ""New York Declaration"" has already been described as a reboot of the 2002 Saudi-led Arab Peace Initiative.


Experts say there are also other reasons why leading a push towards Palestinian statehood benefits Saudi Arabia.

One obvious one is regional stability, crucial for Saudi Arabia to realize grand plans to diversify its economy away from oil.

Saudi diplomacy also advances other foreign policy objectives. ""Riyadh's leadership is part of a calculated Saudi repositioning,"" Arab-language media outlet Raseef22 argued in an op-ed last week. ""Saudi Arabia has transformed the Arab Peace Initiative into a political lever with international relevance, forming an Arab-Islamic voting bloc, [giving it] influence in energy and maritime security negotiations with the West and, perhaps most importantly, consolidating its position in the post-[Gaza]-war architecture.""

It is too early to tell, Coates Ulrichsen says. ""But the fact that the UK and Canada have both come out with statements of conditional recognition of Palestine suggests the Saudi-French approach is moving the needle.""

After last week's meeting in New York, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan called on more UN member states to support the ""New York Declaration"" before the next UN General Assembly in early September.

There is a good chance many might because it offers a way out, Faisal J. Abbas, a regular commentator on Saudi topics and the editor-in-chief of the English language daily Arab News, wrote for US website, Semafor, last week. ""For Washington, the Saudi-French diplomatic initiative fits within American strategic interests and offers a route out of perpetual conflict. It could help stabilize the region, reducing the need for US military involvement,"" he argued. ""And it offers Israel long-term security guarantees, if it's willing to abandon demands from its far right to annex the West Bank, alongside other maximalist positions.""

The Saudi-French initiative still faces considerable opposition from Israel and its ally, the US.

Neither Israel nor the US participated in the meeting and both have criticized it. The Trump administration called it a ""publicity stunt,"" and Israel's ambassador to the UN complained that ""conference organizers are engaging in discussions and plenaries that are disconnected from reality.""

Ghana's defense and environment ministers died in a helicopter crash that killed all eight people on board. 

Ghana's Defense Minister Edward Omane Boamah and Environment Minister Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed were among the eight people killed in a helicopter crash on Wednesday.

Everyone on the military Z9 helicopter was killed in the accident in Ghana's central Ashanti region, a government spokesperson said.

The Ghanaian Armed Forces said the air force helicopter took off in the morning from the capital, Accra, and was heading northwest into the interior toward the gold-mining area of Obuasi in Ashanti when it went off the radar.

The wreckage was later found in the forested Adansi area of Ashanti.

Three other officials, including the vice chair of the ruling National Democratic Congress party, Samuel Sarpong, were killed alongside three Ghana Air Force crew members.

The cause of the crash was not immediately known, and the armed forces said they had launched an investigation.

Ghana news site My Joy Online reported a strong security presence of military and police at the crash site.

Ghanaian media reported that the helicopter was on its way to an event on illegal mining, a major environmental issue in the west African country.

""The president and government extend our condolences and sympathies to the families of our comrades and the servicemen who died in service to the country,"" said President John Dramani Mahama's chief of staff.

Mahama declared three days of mourning and had canceled his official activities for the day, the spokesperson said.

Mourners gathered at the Boamah's residence as well as at the party's headquarters, and Ghana's government described the crash as a ""national tragedy.""

Mahama was ""down, down emotionally,"" Haruna Iddrisu, Ghana's education minister, told reporters outside the presidency after news broke of the crash.

Muhammed, the environment minister, was at the helm as the country battles a scourge of illegal, informal gold mining that has ravaged farmlands and contaminated water.

A medical doctor by training, Boamah's career in government included stints as communications minister during Mahama's previous 2012-2017 tenure. Before that, he served as the deputy environment minister.

UnitedHealth brought in $34 billion in profits in 2024, far more than any other health care company in the US.

A pair of Democratic senators on Thursday launched an investigation into the most powerful corporation in the U.S. healthcare system, sounding alarm over allegations that UnitedHealth Group is incentivizing nursing homes to slash care expenses for patients insured by the company.

Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote in a new letter to the company's CEO that UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has “been at the center of numerous reports suggesting that it is maximizing profits at the expense of patients' health and well-being,” including accusations that the company “systematically denied needed care to children and adults with chronic illnesses” and used an artificial intelligence algorithm to deny Medicare Advantage enrollees necessary care.

Most recently, the senators noted, reporting by The Guardian alleged that UnitedHealth is using a bonus scheme to push nursing homes that contract with Optum to reduce hospital transfers as part of an aggressive cost-cutting effort. Optum is a UHG subsidiary that employs or affiliates with roughly 10% of all physicians in the U.S.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Wyden and Warren demanded that UnitedHealth provide answers to numerous questions related to its practices at nursing homes, including whether it institutes “hospital transfer quotas” at the facilities it works with.

“UHG denies the allegations in The Guardian's reporting and maintains that its practices reflect best practices in the care of nursing home residents,” the senators wrote. “However, we are concerned that the methods UHG appears to rely on to deliver the high-quality care it purports to provide may in fact incentivize practices that threaten resident safety.”

The Guardian's reporting underscores the extent to which UHG has injected itself into virtually every aspect of the American healthcare system. The healthcare conglomerate has roughly 2,700 subsidiaries, according to an analysis by the Center for Health and Democracy.

Using confidential corporate and patient records, whistleblower accounts, and interviews with UHG staffers and nursing home employees, The Guardian examined a company program under which Optum medical teams provide care on-site at nursing homes or in partnership with facility staff.

The newspaper identified “several cases” in which “nursing home residents who needed immediate hospital care under the program failed to receive it, after interventions from UnitedHealth staffers.”

“At least one lived with permanent brain damage following his delayed transfer, according to a confidential nursing home incident log, recordings, and photo evidence,” the newspaper reported. “To reduce residents' hospital visits, UnitedHealth has offered nursing homes an array of financial sweeteners that sounded more like they came from stockbrokers than medical professionals.”

The company also allegedly gave its medical teams “budgets” limiting the number of hospital admissions they could allow for nursing home patients.

One whistleblower, a nurse practitioner formerly employed by a UnitedHealth insurance subsidiary, said in a statement that “scores of elderly patients may never have received the care that they needed, all because UnitedHealthcare skimped on care to cut costs.”

“UnitedHealthcare is compelling medical professionals to comply with its financially-driven playbook at the expense of patient safety in a way that pressures providers to violate their ethical obligations,” the whistleblower added. “I'd like to see them held accountable for putting profits over patients.”

UnitedHealth raked in over $34 billion in profits last year — far more than any other U.S. healthcare company.

Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive who now serves as president of the Center for Health and Democracy, wrote in a recent blog post that mounting scrutiny of UHG's practices shows the company is “facing a reckoning it can't ignore.”

“It's coming from every direction: the U.S. Department of Justice (under President Donald J. Trump), congressional Republicans and Democrats, state lawmakers and regulators, the media, physicians, hospital administrators, tens of thousands of Americans on the internet sharing their own personal UnitedHealth horror stories, and, most importantly for the C-Suite, enraged investors who've lost hundreds of billions of dollars in recent months,” Potter wrote.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we're talking about public assemblies and how we can build direct democracy at the community level. You'll hear from Denzel Caldwell, an organizer with the Black Nashville Assembly — a quarterly gathering where Black residents of Nashville come together to discuss the issues impacting their lives, develop solutions, and take action.

As authoritarianism intensifies in the U.S., we often hear calls to “save democracy.” But one of the problems with that framing is that many people don't feel they have a meaningful relationship with democracy. But the participatory nature of a public assembly can allow people to create democratic experiences, hear each other out, and begin to solve problems together. I think this is going to be an essential organizing tactic in the coming months and years, and I am excited for you all to hear from Denzel about it. Denzel recently shared some of these ideas here in Chicago at a workshop I organized on this subject. That workshop went so well that I decided we should cover some of the same ground here on the show so that those of you who weren't able to attend could engage with these ideas as well.

KH: Denzel Caldwell, welcome to “Movement Memos.” 

Denzel Caldwell: Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

KH: How are you doing today?

DC: So far so good. It's climate change-degrees outside, so it's a little hot, but I'll take it for now.

KH: I am right there with you. It's burning hot outside, and the air here in Chicago is awful today, but the sun is shining through my window, and everything looks lovely, so there's that at least. 

DC: Yeah, exactly.

KH: I am so happy you could join me today, and I'm really glad we've had the chance to collaborate a bit recently. For folks who may not be familiar with your work, can you share a little about who you are and what you do?

DC: Yeah, so peace to everyone listening. My name is Denzel Caldwell. I am a kid born, raised, and organizing in Nashville, Tennessee. I do organize under a number of different formations, but the one I definitely want to talk about today is the Black Nashville Assembly. I've been organizing overall for about a little under 10 years or a little bit over 10 years. And with the BNA I've been organizing for about five. And so, yeah, I've been doing that for quite some time, learning along the way, got some lessons and victories. But yeah, outside of that, I love to read. I love to work out and talk to cool people like Kelly.

KH: Well, I love hanging with you, too — and I've been so interested in the work you've been doing in Nashville. But before we get into the evolution of the Black Nashville Assembly, can you start by explaining: What is a People's Movement Assembly?

DC: Yeah, so I think the easiest, most straightforward answer to this question is it's a gathering of community members. And when I say community members, I mean people who share particular geographic location, at least traditionally. And they answer three questions: What are the shared problems that they face? What are the solutions that they need for those problems? And how can they work together to make those solutions concrete? I would say that's the most distilled, easiest answer to shape or to explain what it does or what it is.

Now, I would say historically, people's movement assemblies as we know them today, can be traced back to what's called the World's Social Forum. And this was a coalition of organizations, movements and those that are adjacent who were coming together to combat neoliberalism, capitalism, imperialism. And within that body, the People's Movement Assembly was a mode of governance that they used to make decisions. And so, from there, given the fact that this was an international body, when folks went home, folks utilized this mode of governance and it made its way to the USA in the 2000s, I'll say, because I'm forgetting the date. And since then we've seen a number of different people's movement assemblies emerge in the United States as the idea or the concept spread. And so, you'll have some that are regional, some that are very local, and something that I think will be very relevant to this current political moment.

KH: I couldn't agree more about the relevance of this approach in the current moment. And while the World Social Forum is a clear predecessor to some of the assemblies we're seeing today, this kind of gathering and this approach to organizing has ancient roots, across the Americas and Africa. The Muscogee councils, which have existed for hundreds of generations, are one just one example. Within my lifetime, we've seen a resurgence of some of these traditions during moments of transition, upheaval and social reclamation. The Zapatista movement, for example, created village assemblies to facilitate decision-making at the community level. The Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil, known as MST, has used assemblies for collective decision making in their encampments. In 2011, the Indignados movement in Spain held horizontal, plaza-based assemblies to deliberate and make decisions outside of formal institutions. And that same year, I got my first experience of direct democracy in the Occupy movement. 

Occupy's General Assemblies were messy, and we didn't always get where we needed to go, but gathering together with dozens and sometimes hundreds of people to listen, share ideas, and make decisions that would shape our movement and affect our lives was a really important experience for me as an activist. I had never had that kind of opportunity to be heard, or to decide what would happen next, at that scale, in concert with other people. Eventually, we had neighborhood-based assemblies here in Chicago, and some of the core people who attended those neighborhood Occupy assemblies in my area became part of an organizing crew that I worked with for years after the Occupy movement had faded. A lot of really important work was born out of that moment, and out of those spaces that incubated so many ideas and so much potential.

During Occupy, we were moved by the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the austerity of neoliberalism, and the momentum of global justice movements. What moved you and your co-organizers to create the Black Nashville Assembly?

DC: There were a couple of factors. Prior to 2020, because 2020 is really a watershed moment for us. Prior to 2020, there was some growing interest across the local (and by local, I'm referring to Nashville) ecosystem in terms of doing invest/divest campaigns or abolitionist campaigns that encouraged city councils to spend more money on social services and things that people actually need and less on cops, courts and cages.

And so, what emerged from that was just a coalition where folks who were on the left were committed to that work. So that was around the budget cycle. But as we initiated this work in 2019 going into 2020, one of the themes that kept coming up from our opponents on the city council was that we weren't organizing Black people in Nashville. They were trying to make this claim that we didn't represent the interest of working-class Black folks in the city.

And so, a number of different organizers, including myself, Erica Perry, Jamel Campbell-Gooch, Mike Floss, we who are from Nashville, decided to go out and organize our folks. And so, we initially were bringing Black folks, and in this case for us, this was our family and friends and our networks to the larger coalition, the assembly work to challenge the carceral appropriations to the city budget. But what we realized is that along the way, a lot of our folks were interested in creating a container where Black folks, working-class Black folks were able to build their own analysis, assess their own problems, and create strategies and methods for making those solutions concrete. And so, from there, that's when the Black Nashville Assembly emerged, which is a Black autonomous space. So those who participate are of African descent or identify as Black, but we do have spaces where we invite our comrades to build with us.

KH: I love that you and your co-strugglers responded to this claim that you didn't represent your community by mobilizing your community in such a highly visible and participatory way. I think there's a lot to be learned from that example. So, how did this project evolve over time?

DC: So initially as it started, it was a call, as I mentioned earlier, from a larger coalition to particularly organize Black people to build a people's budget for the city, an abolitionist one. And so, a lot of that initially at the beginning was focused solely on that. And that still is a pretty key core to our work. But over time, as we learn more and more about the importance of organizing working-class Black folks in the city, and more importantly falling within the lines of the traditions that we descend from, that being SNCC and others, within the Black Radical Tradition, we learned that our assembly had to become more multifaceted and it had to reflect our people.

So a lot of it evolved where we had artists that we were organizing perform during the assemblies. We've developed a youth assembly that has come out of our work where our youth are organizing our political agendas and bringing it to the larger assembly, and going through the voting process to land on an agreed upon political agenda.

And a lot of other programs from that assembly work have emerged. We've had book clubs, we have a men's circle. We're just constantly coming up with different ways and things to evolve our work and to reflect the needs of our folks. Black Nashville Assembly is also a project of Southern Movement Committee, which is a container that we created not only for our youth assembly work, but also to engage in statewide assembly work or aspirationally engage in statewide assembly work for Black communities across the state of Tennessee. And so, those are just some of the ways that our work has evolved over time and we're constantly evolving in terms of our cultural organizing, our assembly work, and our youth assembly work as well.

KH: I really appreciate what your story is illustrating here around the creation of book clubs, the BNA's men's circle and the youth council. Larger gatherings and political projects often serve as incubators in ways that people don't always consider or realize. Years ago, I was involved with a project called “We Charge Genocide” here in Chicago, which challenged police violence. That effort sent a group of young people to present a shadow report to the UN about police violence and torture in Chicago. It also played an important role in winning reparations for police torture survivors. At We Charge Genocide meetings, we would engage as a large group, and then break into working groups that were focused on different projects and pursuits. My collective, Lifted Voices, which provided political education workshops for thousands of people during the decade or so before it sunsetted, wouldn't have existed without We Charge Genocide's radical education working group. Those working groups set people on a number of paths. In a moment like this one, when we don't have all of the projects, participation, and experiments that we need, we need to create more fertile ground for that work to begin.

But circling back to the growth process of the Black Nashville Assembly, did you have a plan or formula to start with or did the people you organized inform the process?

DC: So it was definitely more so of the latter than the former. When we started as an assembly formation, a number of us who had founded this assembly had previous organizing experience, and we had already a developing political ideological orientation. And so, that colored how we approached the assembly work. However, one of the most brilliant things that has come from our assembly work in these past five plus years has been that a lot of the most innovative, radical, grounded ideas have come from folks who have participated in the assembly process. I think sometimes there's this assumption that for those of us, especially on the left, but that we have to take this evangelical approach to organizing. But one of the most powerful things that we've recognized doing our assembly work here is that a lot of our folks know exactly what we need and do have a grounded analysis in the systems that oppress them and really are looking for a container to actualize some of the solutions that would need to take root and to be birthed into reality to address those problems.

And so, of course we have political struggle and our politics are evolving, our practice is evolving, but a lot of our direction, if not most of it, comes directly from those who participate in the assembly. And one of the things I definitely want to lift up here is that the first time that we released a political agenda, that was the result of months and months of deliberation, power mapping with our folks, turning some solutions into policy demands or into policy language and then doing things like a candidate forum during a judicial election as well as the city council and mayor elections, so that instead of politicians coming to our space to do a stump speech, they are being interrogated based on the concretized political agenda of the assembly. And so, that's heavily shaped how the electoral outcomes have happened, not only in the judicial elections, but also in the mayoral and city council elections.

KH: I love the idea of politicians having to contend with questions that are informed by an agenda a community collectively built. So, in reflecting on what you all have built, can I ask, what surprised you about this process?

DC: Yeah, I think for me it's a couple of things. One, just as I mentioned before, the first thing is (I would hear this often) to trust the people and to trust their ability to lead, to organize, and to dream of a fundamentally better world, but seeing that is different and that was huge for me. It didn't take this, again, this evangelical approach where we're just browbeating people over the head with our ideological reading and position necessarily. A lot of folks came to very abolitionist, anticapitalist conclusions on their own. 

I'll never forget one time or often, we do this often anytime we table, we'll create a poster and we'll ask folks, “What makes you feel safe?” And we've done that several times and every time that we do it, not once do people write down “police,” not once do people write down “cages” and not once do people write down this carceral system, any piece of this carceral system that makes them feel safe. They talk about family, their faith, their community, their loved ones, the things they love to do, the things that make the city great, things like that from music to culture. But not once do people bring up police.

And so, I think sometimes we can really underestimate the radical potential of our people. And so, that's been one thing that was huge. I think the other thing that stands out to me was the outcome or the reaction to our candidate forums. In our candidate forums, we had an agenda and we sent the agenda to the candidates that were running for various offices and we gave them an opportunity to fill out their responses to each position, policy position, and we interrogated them once we got there. And you can actually find at least the mayoral one on YouTube and I'll share that link for folks to see later.

But I think the thing that surprised the most was that a lot of organizations in the city and people in the city were really just amazed by the fact that we asked the questions as an assembly rather than the politicians answering a question that no one asks in terms of what they're going to do for their constituents. And it threw me off and it threw others off because in my mind I'm thinking there's a lot of civic organizations throughout the city, throughout the state that do civic engagement, electoral work. And you would think, oh yeah, folks have asked the critical questions. But when folks felt like this was groundbreaking, we were like, wait, all we did was just concretize the political agenda that folks our base wanted and then interrogated politicians based on that. How is that groundbreaking? But for me, that was surprising because that just showed how anti-democratic just like our norm is in terms of how we engage in governance under this current structure. But it was just a reminder also of how powerful the People's Movement Assembly process is. 

KH: One thing I really appreciate about this process is that it's really the opposite of how a lot of people are experiencing politics right now, alone together in the glow of their screens. We have a serious problem in the U.S., in that our reliance on digital mobilization has left us with a generation of organizers who never learned how to base build or how to canvas. In this alienating culture, that often means that people simply don't know how to talk to strangers or how to work with people who aren't of their own choosing. And I'm not blaming people or getting down on people, that alienation is inflicted by design. And unless your political work evolved within an organization that wanted you to canvas or do the labor of base-building, you probably never got that training. We got a lot done by other means, but now, we're about a decade and a half into the process of being deskilled in this way within our social movements. When you compound that with the alienating dynamics that have evolved on social media, and the isolation of late capitalism, we're in real fucking trouble. Even when people want to make a difference, they often don't know how to do more than seek or reward affinity and agreement. They don't know how to navigate difference or talk about justice with people who don't understand them or their goals. We need to get practiced at talking to people we would never normally engage with about their fears, hopes, and desires —and we need to be able to build around the shared interests that emerge in those conversations.

So, that said, I'm really curious, how did you and your co-organizers adapt some of your movement, language, and ideas to fit the needs of the community?

DC: Yeah, so that's a great question. This was an experiment. This is, very much so, an experiment. And what we have found to be successful is attaching the assembly process and the demands and the desires of folks to larger political language. And there's a meta-note that I have to make here. One of the most important organizing lessons that we have learned in the past five years is our people are very receptive to listening and engaging in learning and political struggle when you consistently show up, I think too often, and I don't think this is exclusive to liberals, but I think too often even those of us on the left will engage in momentary organizing with folks based on a campaign or a particular flashpoint, but we're not continuing to cultivate those relationships with our base, which leads to this hamster wheel where we don't get any farther.

And so, part of our work has really centered on relationship building. So that means in our early days we used to have this thing called “the recharge” where instead of there being an assembly, it was like a party essentially. We got a DJ, people were playing music, and folks were just recharging because we probably went through a particular election season or some really rough moment or we just needed a break. And so, we would do things like the recharge, we have cookouts with our families and folks who are part of the assemblies and bringing folks together.

And so, it's through that constant interaction that it gives us the trust and basis to do certain, what we would consider mass meetings, because our mass meetings are different than our people's movement assemblies, where our mass meetings are where we engage in civic and political education and the people's movement assemblies are the moments where we actually develop our political agenda and strategy.

And so, it's through those constant interactions, constant events where we're bringing together community members that we get the trust to engage in civic and political education. So we talk through some of the things that we're developing in the People's Movement Assembly and say, Hey, the folks who shape that problem we're dealing with are in the courts. Let's break down how the courts work. Or the reason that we keep running into this issue around youth violence is because this carceral system adds to or shapes the violence that our youth are victimized by.

And so, we really just take the opportunity through relationship building and through moments where people are assessing their problems to inject this political, more politicized conversation and some of the movement language, where we reshape things like public safety, reshape things like the notion of community safety and things like that. And that's what helps people to sharpen their analysis in our experience.

KH: Can you give me an example of something that you might hear in a leftist space language-wise and how it might be talked about differently in the community space?

DC: I think I'll just use abolition. This is the easiest one to think of where in most leftist spaces, we talk about abolition as this challenge to the legitimacy of the state where we challenge the need or notion of law enforcement or police and the larger carceral system that shapes this arm of the state. And we talk about how we need to build a world where those things don't exist, and we have these robust accountability processes that exist that allow us to get to the root of a problem. So that's in our leftist spaces. But then when we're talking about talking to our folks in the assembly, we might be in conversation and our folks are like, “Yeah, we don't rock it to police. We're not interested in that.”

We are interested in something else. We feel we are forced to talk to police. We're forced to go through this court system, but I really just want to be in a place where I can talk to my folks and have some type of community trust and buy-ins, where we can address the problems without having to involve the law. Or people will bring up a lot of these really robust ideas, especially the youth, around how we resolve conflict in the public schools. Our youth are bringing up restorative justice processes on their own. They're brilliant enough to say, “Hey, we have to find ways to restore relationships within the school because we know that the school resource officers and the metal detectors and things are a threat to our safety.” And so, our people are talking about the things that they already do to avoid the carceral system.

And what they're doing is talking about ways to institutionalize those things, so that the necessity for police becomes less and less, or the legitimacy of the police becomes radically less. And so, this is how the abolition conversations come up. And sometimes, honestly, we may not even use the word “abolition,” but the spirit of abolition is within the conversation in the analysis-building and the concretization of our political agenda. So it's in there, it's materially in there. But sometimes we may use the language and they're familiar with it, but we may not. And that's okay, because we care about the material outcome of our agenda and our struggles for wins.

KH: That really resonates with me, and I have had a similar experience talking with people who are trying to combat the damage done by the opioid overdose crisis. In Native communities, some of the people I talk to are on the same page as me about not fucking with police, but I've also heard people talk about holding out hope that there was some way the cops could arrest our way out of this. They thought that if the cops could just be pushed to “do their jobs,” or do their jobs in a particular way, fewer of our people would die. And then, over time, those people observed the actual trends on the ground. They saw that people who were using substances were more likely to overdose after getting arrested. Because while they're locked up for a few days, their tolerance to the drug drops, and when they get out and use — which will happen, because people don't heal in jail, they just become more traumatized — they are more vulnerable to overdose. So, some people who previously looked at cops as a potential solution now recognize that our people actually need care, and to be insulated from contact with the police, whenever possible. And these are things I've heard from people across different communities, and the Native people I've talked to about this stuff, most of them wouldn't call themselves abolitionists, and they are not out here calling for the abolition of prisons, but the work of replacing carceral responses with care is abolitionist. The work of reducing contact between our community members and police is abolitionist. So, often, I've found, it's really about addressing people's needs in very concrete terms. What actually helps? What actually hurts? And if we're thorough and honest in our analysis on those points, there's going to be alignment with some of our radical politics — because those politics exist for a reason. 

Of course, the work of hearing each other, and meeting people where they are, can get messy. Activists and justice-minded people have really built their own cultures and subcultures around the pursuit of justice, and we can sometimes be intolerant of people using the wrong terminology, or knowingly or unknowingly saying things that are problematic or disrespectful. So, how do you handle it, in the public assembly setting, when someone says something fucked up, or there's a harmful impact that occurs?

DC: Yeah, I appreciate this question, because this is something we definitely have experienced before. I want to say that one of the first things that we do with that expectation that something like that would happen is we have a set of community agreements in our assembly that folks have to consent to before we begin.

And so, some of those things include not making assumptions about folks, being curious, making space and taking space. Some of these things, we're familiar with. A lot of us on the left and in movement spaces are familiar with. And of course we are adjusting it to reflect our folks who are organizing with. And so, that's sort of like the basis or the agreement or the account upon which we can engage in accountability. Because oftentimes when people talk about accountability, people forget that a prerequisite of accountability is relationship and an agreed upon set of values or agreements to which we hold people to account. And so, in our assembly, the community agreements are the things that people consent to first.

So when someone says something fucked up or when someone says something that is out of alignment, we take time to remind people, “Hey, we agreed to these community agreements. Let's reground.” We've done different things, we've had conversations, we brought people to the side and talked with folks during and then after our assemblies. But one of the things we also do as well is we remind people of the agreements. We always center the agreements, and we push back. We have no problem pushing back in our space. We do it not from a place always of combativeness, from a place of love, and love being the willingness to see the fullness of our people and the willingness to struggle with them towards a collective liberatory victory.

So we talk about our edges, our growth edges as something as a part of our community agreement. We recognize it. We recognize that people come in with fucked up ideas, that people come in with a colonial mentality or colonial outlook. We are all under colonialism. And so, we acknowledge that up front. We don't run away from that, and that's embedded in our agreement so that when we do hear things that are colonial, are carceral, are anti-Black, all these things, we are able to address it from a more solid basis than just calling somebody out because they said something fucked up, but not really being in relationship with them, which is something we see too often online and unfortunately even in some spaces, real world spaces.

So I would say that our community agreements have been the basis for how we respond and struggle principally with our assembly members, and then also just relying on our relationships. So it can take a lot of organic forms. We can hit folks up and just say, “Hey, I want to follow up with you and just talk with you about what you said at the assembly.” Or sometimes that might even shape our mass meeting content. And there's a number of examples there. And oftentimes it's something that within the assembly work and the political agenda development, that shapes the conversations and policy demands and agendas that we develop in the assembly. So I say all that to say that that political struggle is embedded within our assembly work and we don't run from it. It's embedded in our community agreements and our folks are still here.

KH: Can you say a bit about how you developed the community agreements?

DC: Yeah. So a couple of things that I think it's important to note. I think with the community agreements, that is probably of the places that initially was shaped by our political orientation, our political pillars, and to specify, our four political pillars as an organization are pan-Africanism, Black queer feminism, economic democracy, and police and prison abolition. And so, as I mentioned earlier, a number of those of us who were at the beginning and formed the assembly, we came in with a certain set of politics or political dispositions already. And so, a lot of the things we saw in community agreements, in other spaces, other movement spaces of the base-building organizations we brought with us.

But the thing about it is that as we started to engage our people, as we started to learn our folks, struggle with our folks and have the assembly shape be shaped in our folks' collective image, the way in which those community agreements evolved began to more directly reflect the people that were in the space. So it's not that so much they shifted in terms of being curious about people not making assumptions, acknowledging growth edges. It's not so much that they shifted in terms of the spirit, but the language might have shifted to reflect our people. The way in which we ground the assemblies or the mass meetings more accurately reflect our folks who are part of the assembly. And so, yeah, I say that to say that there was a mixture of our initial or our base political orientation that shaped it, but it has evolved based on the engagement of folks in the assembly work.

KH: I really hope people will internalize this piece around developing an approach that reflects the culture of the community and the space. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and the language and norms of our movement cultures and subcultures are not going to copy-paste well into a neighborhood practice. We need to be of the community, and for the community, rather than trying to simply prescribe something for the community. And we need to shape our goals in the same way.

Speaking of goals, what are some of the wins you've experienced since beginning this project?

DC: We've had a couple of strong wins, actually. I would say just as we began the assembly five years ago, we played a critical role in the normalization of abolitionist language on the city level, particularly when it came to the budget cycle. Because before 2020, if you brought up this idea that money needed to be reallocated away from Metro Nashville Police to the social services, there would be a lot of pearl clutching.

But we played a huge role in normalizing that language when post-2020, post-George Floyd uprising, in a way that has shifted the Overton window left locally, as far as the budget cycle is concerned. I would say more concretely our biggest, we've had back-to-back wins in the past two years, this year and as well as last year. Last year, just to give you context, our youth, when they developed their demands for the budget cycle in 2024, they came up with this plan called the Varsity Spending Plan.

And this was a $10 million plan where you had money that would go to the nation's first Office of Youth Safety, which was an office that was dedicated to creating proactive solutions, youth-led solutions to youth gun violence that is fundamentally working separate from the carceral system. And this is language that was included in the executive order, the mayoral executive order when this office was erected. The other part of the varsity and spending plan includes some restorative justice programs or pilots in a number of different schools, public schools that are predominantly Black in the city, as well as providing more support for community center funding as well as ensuring there's funds for a full-time restorative justice staff.

And so, with this Varsity Spending Plan, the assembly got behind it. There was a consensus with the adults and the youth that this was the assembly or the political agenda that we would put forth. And so, back in 2024, we were able to secure a million dollars towards this plan. And again, this is not something that's going to our organization. This is something that's a part of the larger city infrastructure, so the Metro Nashville infrastructure. And so, that a million dollars had $750,000 go towards the Office of Youth Safety, which again, according to our analysis, is the first of its kind in the nation, not just in Nashville. And we also got funding to go towards restorative justice pilots in some of our targeted schools.

This year, we were able to increase that budget allocation to $1.7 million. And so, since then, our youth have played a direct role in the selecting of the director for the Office of Youth Safety, as well as the organizing and advocacy and public commentary that led to the additional allocation for the restorative justice programs as well as the Office of Youth Safety. And so, we've been on a two-year winning streak. We hope to continue building and moving towards that $10 million allocation to fully fund the Varsity Spending Plan. But we're proud of our youth, we're proud of the assembly, and we look forward to continue winning.

KH: That is all so heartening. And we need heartening stories right now. 

We both expressed earlier that we think that the creation of public assemblies is a particularly important organizing tactic right now. Can you talk about the importance of the public assembly as a tactic in this moment of intensifying authoritarianism?

DC: Yeah, I think that there's always, in this country, even when we take a decolonial lens, in public discourse, there's always been this question or conversation around democracy. Depending on who you talk to, some would say that democracy has been under threat for a while or maybe even is coming under threat under Trump. I think those of us who fall under the Black radical tradition recognize that this U.S. project was inherently anti-democratic from the perspective of the colonized.

And so, I think in that vein, I think that what this process, the People's Movement Assembly process provides is a unique opportunity for people to build a democracy that has yet to be born or has yet to exist. And I think that is particularly unique and something very opportune in this moment because a number of people across the political spectrum, honestly here in the United States, are looking for something different. People recognize the dilapidating social safety nets, the increased cost of living, the impending climate disaster and Armageddon we're facing, and the imperial boomerang that we see coming back home to roost with the increase in ICE raids, the further militarization of police.

And so, with that, one of the most potent tools that people can do, not only as a means of survival, but as a means of world making is to engage in a governance structure process like the People's Movement Assembly, because this process invites people to be active participants in shaping the collective outcome of our people's futures.

And that is a primary and oftentimes missing ingredient in building mass movements, because if people don't participate in the shaping of their futures, then we can't hope for more radical or revolutionary outcomes. And if we look across history at various revolutionary moments, radical moments, especially throughout the world, one critical component was organizing the masses towards being active participants in the shaping of their futures. Whether that's through literacy campaigns, whether that's through collective assemblies, whether that's through party formations, all of the above. And I think particularly in this moment in the United States history and this particular political moment, not just domestically, but internationally, that the U.S. and people who live within the U.S. can in some ways, once again, depending on the history that you reference, can participate in a larger struggle for a world where people and systems are governed directly and democratically by the masses, and controlled by the masses rather than by a wealthy predominantly European few.

KH: I couldn't agree more, and I think that we need to give people a different set of experiences, if we want people to want folks to develop a different perspective. Right now, a lot of people are experiencing politics as consumers of takes and information. We consume opinions, we approve or disapprove. Maybe we echo a perspective or add one to the mix. But we need to get people into a practice of actually hearing each other, and actually having a voice among other people who are trying to solve a problem or a set of problems together. Some of that needs to happen in person. Some of it can happen digitally, outside of algorithmically curated spaces. It can also happen with an eye toward accessibility and COVID safety. When we gathered to talk about public assemblies in Chicago with you recently, Denzel, it was too hot to gather outside, so we were indoors and we were masked. The important thing we need to realize is that we need to create space to build the kind of relationships and potential that we want to see right now. Repeating the same patterns isn't going to give us different outcomes.

If we want people to fight for democracy, let's give them a sense of what democracy can feel like. Let's build that together. And whether people are gathering around a specific issue, like housing struggles, austerity, a site fight, or defending their neighbors, let's give people a hands-on sense of what it means to come together and make decisions that shape what happens next. I know some people in this country already have a passionate or romanticized relationship with democracy, but that's not everyone, and I don't think it's most people. Most people just want better lives. They want less suffering and more justice. We have to make democracy a vehicle toward those ends. 

So, all of that said, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?

DC: Yeah, definitely, if folks are interested in following the developments of the Black Nashville Assembly or the Southern Movement Committee, definitely feel free to connect with us or support our work through OurSMC.org. Beyond that, I would highly encourage folks to find an organization.

Whether you're engaged in mutual aid, whether you're engaged in particular policy campaigns or whether you're engaged in assembly work, to find an organization, find an organization in particular that is, ideally, anti-imperialist, that is challenging capital and wants to build a fundamentally different world. Especially in this political moment, there's a wide political window, and we hope that you are able to find one that fits, and there are many out there. And if you don't see one that exists, feel free to build one that meets the need. But yeah, I would encourage folks to find an organization. I would encourage folks to do political education in connection to collective work, as opposed to just engaging in ideological study and ideation, attach it to some work.

And lastly, to maintain hope, maintain revolutionary optimism. I think it's very easy and it's a tool of the empire for folks to engage in Doomerism, especially those of us on the left. So I would highly encourage folks to adopt a revolutionary optimism that isn't delusional, it's not idealist. It is a optimism that says that we can win if we choose to actively engage in collective struggle against these systems that oppress us and the planet. So I would leave with just those parting words of: join an organization, maintain revolutionary optimism, and ensure that your political education that you're engaged in is tied to some type of organizational work.

KH: That's good advice. And in addition to joining an organization or starting up a project, I also want to encourage folks to keep picking up skills. Over the years, I have worn a lot of hats, because I've picked up a lot of skills. Sometimes, skills that weren't immediately relevant to what I was doing became crucial under unforeseen circumstances. In unpredictable times like these, having just-in-case skill sets is going to be important. 

And on the subject of skill-building, if you want to learn more about facilitating public assemblies, Denzel and I are planning a virtual followup workshop that will build on some of the ideas Denzel covered in his recent workshop in Chicago, and in today's episode. So, if you attended that workshop or listened to this episode, you will be welcome to join us. And you can look for updates about that in my newsletter. Right now, we are thinking that will happen in early October.

Denzel, I want to thank you again for joining me today. I am so grateful to be working in collaboration with you, and to have the chance to learn from you and everything that the Black Nashville Assembly is accomplishing. 

DC: Thank you so much. I'm excited to be participating and I'm looking forward to leading this virtual workshop and conversation and talking with more folks who are interested in engaging in this type of work.

KH: I'm looking forward to it too. Let's keep connecting and building.

DC: All right. Peace, everybody.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

As disabled people face brutal cuts to Medicaid, we must draw on Berne's insight to link with other fights for freedom.

I was in the middle of writing an email to my friend Patricia (Patty) Berne when I got a text message from our mutual friend. “Come to the hospital quickly,” they said. “Patty's dying.” My first thought was, ‘But that's impossible. We're right in the middle of a conversation.'

I knew that Patty had been sick, but it didn't seem possible to me that they might die. Patty's impact on me and the disabled world I live in was simply too huge. I couldn't imagine the planet without them. Born disabled, Patty was told as a child that they would not live past 16 years old. This prediction was pessimistic, and wrong. Patty grew up to live a full life, and changed disability history. They were a visionary artist and one of the primary architects of the Disability Justice movement, which connected the struggle for disabled liberation with other fights for freedom for the first time in the early 2000s.

Patty died at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, California, on May 29. Just a few weeks later, on July 3, Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which proposes cutting Medicaid spending by $1 trillion. These cuts will likely force states to slash home- and community-based services, like personal care attendants, that disabled people need in our fight to stay out of institutional settings. It feels like many of the advances that Patty and other disabled activists have struggled to achieve over the past 50 years might be unraveling, which makes my grief sharper and more overwhelming.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“I was truly devastated when I heard the news,” said Lateef McLeod, a disabled activist and scholar who has performed with Patty since 2007. Patty “was a phenomenal leader and true friend. I would describe Patty as the mother of disability justice and this second wave of the disability movement.”  

The first wave of disability rights organizing in the 1970s-1990s led to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as other similar important legislation around the world. However, it fell short of examining how racism and other forms of oppression play a role in the subjugation of disabled people, or how we contribute to other movements. In the early 2000s, Patty gathered with a group of other disabled people in Berkeley, including the late Stacey Milbern, Mia Mingus, and Leroy Moore, to tackle this issue. Those conversations led to the second wave of disability activism, and a new movement that centered a much broader array of voices and highlighted the unique skills of disabled people such as our resilience, adaptability and capacity to care for each other. 

“Patty brought together a movement that centers the struggles, brilliance, and beauty of disabled people,” said Patty's longtime collaborator and chosen sibling Mordecai Cohen Ettinger. “That movement understands disabled people expansively, not only as those who use technology for mobility assistance, but also neurodivergent and mad people, as well as those who have been hurt in climate chaos, survivors of state violence and incarceration.”

As a young person, Patty drew on their experiences as a Haitian-Japanese, queer, and nonbinary person to build power for Haiti and Palestine, and for sexual violence survivors. Later, Patty became the co-founder and longtime executive and artistic director of Sins Invalid, a disability justice-based political education performance project, where they directed 11 major performances, co-produced two documentaries, and globally trained thousands.

Patty knew that to be disabled is to live close to death. Just a few months before their passing Sins Invalid mounted a play called “Stages of Grief,” which dealt with mourning the impact of climate crisis on disabled communities, as well as celebrating our expertise for adapting to this era of cascading emergencies.

“Just as each component in earth's ecosystem plays a vital role in supporting everything around it,” Patty wrote in a 2019 essay, “so do each of us have an essential role to play in sustaining our communities, our environment, our planet. In this time, people need strength models. Strength isn't just about momentary power to jump building to building, it is also endurance to handle what is less than ideal. It's the gritty persistence that disabled people embody every day.”

On my way to the hospital to say goodbye to Patty, I picked a rose from my garden. I wanted Patty to have something sweet to sniff when the nurse removed their respirator, to combat the institutional odors. In the weeks since Patty's death, the bush which the rose came from has been blooming wildly. Each blossom is a slightly different hue of yellow, pink, white, or red. Some blooms are enormous and some are tiny.

One of Patty's most central teachings was how valuable each of us are, with all our complications. “A Disability Justice framework,” Patty famously wrote, “understands that all bodies are unique and essential, that all bodies have strengths and needs that must be met. We know that we are powerful not despite the complexities of our bodies, but because of them.”

It's easy to see this in an unusual rosebud or a delightfully crooked branch, but it is sometimes harder to appreciate my own idiosyncratic, chronically ill body, or my quirky learning disabilities. Patty helped me to love my body and mind just the way I am.

As disabled people face the brutal prospect of historic Medicaid cuts, we can draw strength from Patty's legacy. “[W]e know through our bones,” they once said, that there have always been disabled people “visioning a world where we flourish, that values and celebrates us in all our myriad beauty.”

There will be a Celebration of Life for Patty Berne on August 9, 2025. This gathering is a hybrid event at the East Bay Church of Religious Science in Oakland, California, and via livestream at 3:00-6:00 pm PT | 5:00-7:00 pm CT | 6:00-9:00 pm ET. It is lovingly hosted by Patty's family.

 Robert A. Pape

After nearly 700 days of war, the death toll in Gaza has risen to extraordinary levels. Amid heavy bombardment that has turned the territory into a wasteland of rubble and stringent blockades that have led to mass hunger and even starvation, over 61,000 Palestinians have died and over 145,000 have been seriously wounded, according to Gaza's Hamas-affiliated health authorities, which do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters.

But the true number of the war's casualties may far outstrip those figures, which do not include the thousands of bodies that remain under the rubble, the large number of dead that could not arrive at morgues, and the excess deaths from the destruction of infrastructure and the ensuing disease, famine, and lack of medical care. In February, the medical journal The Lancet published an extensive analysis based on a wide variety of sources (including obituaries) and estimated that the official death toll underreported the direct war deaths in Gaza by at least 41 percent and perhaps by as much as 107 percent, while not accounting at all for nontrauma-related deaths resulting from the impact of Israeli military operations on Gaza's health services, food and water supplies, and sanitation.

In sum, the authors of the study suggested that Israel's campaign has caused at least an additional 26,000 Palestinian deaths and perhaps as many as over 120,000 additional deaths, with the true death toll possibly upward of 186,000. Taking that into account, as of late July 2025, Israel's war in Gaza has led to the deaths of between five to ten percent of the prewar population of about 2.2 million. This represents an unprecedented slaughter. Israel's campaign in Gaza is the most lethal case of a Western democracy using the punishment of civilians as a tactic of war.

Leaders and scholars have long assumed that democracy offered a solution to the worst pathologies of authoritarian states, especially the willingness of a government to subject populations to coercion, cruelty, and violence. Indeed, the United States and other Western democracies, including Israel, have insisted that democracy is crucial for the promotion of fundamental human rights, individual prosperity, and a more peaceful world. For Israel, a country that has long touted its democratic bona fides, to violate core democratic norms in such dramatic fashion cheapens the value of democratic government itself.

Israel's defenders may insist that civilian deaths are inevitable in a conflict against a burrowed-in terrorist enemy. But it has been clear from Israeli actions—including the targeting of children by snipers, the relentless bombing of civilian infrastructure and residences, and the blockade and starvation of the civilian population—as well as the rhetoric of numerous Israeli officials that Israel's war is not simply against Hamas but aimed at all the residents of Gaza. That is also the conclusion of numerous international institutions and human rights groups. Indeed, the notion that Hamas can be eradicated via military means is a “fantasy,” as former Shin Bet director Yoram Cohen said this week. As civilians continue to suffer in Gaza, Israel has squandered the moral high ground for no good strategic purpose.

Israel's critics may demand that, based on its treatment of the Palestinians, the country should not be considered a democracy. That understates the full dimensions of Israel's behavior in Gaza. Even now, Israel retains the political institutions built on majority rule and the high levels of citizen participation in free elections that are the hallmarks of representative government and that have long characterized Western democracy. Independent experts, such as Freedom House, still recognize Israel as a democracy. What is truly shocking about events in Gaza is both the scale of the devastation and that the government of Israel can genuinely say that its policies reflect the will of most Israelis. The carnage in Gaza is not the work of authoritarians or demagogues but bears the imprimatur of democracy. Israel's campaign thus has profound implications both for the long-term security of the country and the value of democracy around the world.

In my 1996 book, Bombing to Win, I studied every campaign in the twentieth century that employed airpower with the intention of inflicting harm on civilians: 40 campaigns in all, including the Spanish Civil War, the Vietnam War, and the 1991 Gulf War. Only five of the 40 involved civilian deaths greater than one percent of the civilian population. These included four campaigns in and around World War II—Japan's invasion of China from 1937 to 1945, Germany's invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945, the Allied bombing and invasion of Germany from 1939 to 1945, and the U.S. bombing and conquest of Japan from 1942 to 1945—and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1988. In proportional terms, Nazi Germany's attack on Poland ranks as the deadliest of these campaigns, killing upward of 20 percent of the prewar population over six years. That figure was enlarged, of course, by the Holocaust and the slaughter in ghettos and concentration camps of millions of Polish Jews.

Until Gaza, the worst civilian punishment campaign by a Western democracy was the bombing and ground invasion of Germany in World War II, which killed approximately two to four percent of the population, outpacing even the U.S. nuclear attacks and fire-bombing raids on Japan, which killed about one percent of the population. Those estimates from Germany account for deaths caused by both Soviet and Western forces, as well as direct and indirect deaths (as in The Lancet's study on Gaza).

Whether it is called a “genocide” or not, no sensible observer could look at Israel's war in Gaza and miss the stunning levels of devastation that Palestinians have endured. Beyond the mass death and suffering, the level of physical devastation is remarkable: satellite analysis by credible independent media outlets, such as The Economist and the Financial Times, reveals that at least 60 percent of all the buildings and 90 percent of homes in Gaza have either been severely damaged or completely destroyed. All 12 of Gaza's universities, 80 percent of its schools and mosques, and numerous churches, museums, and libraries have also been demolished. No hospital in Gaza is fully functioning, and only 20 out of 36 hospitals are partially functioning.

And yet despite this mammoth destructive enterprise, Israel has not come close to fulfilling its stated aim of eliminating Hamas. The group still has significant appeal among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. It may be diminished as a military force, but it can replenish its depleted ranks with new recruits—indeed, by some accounts, it has managed to bring in over 10,000 new fighters since the war began. The extreme brutality Israel has inflicted on the Palestinian people has not produced the strategic gains that Israeli officials promised.

The moral case for harming civilians is always dubious even when such violence serves a strategic purpose. When that strategic purpose does not exist, however, the moral case evaporates altogether. Israel now finds itself in a morally untenable situation. Rather than incur the world's growing wrath, increased economic pressure, and the greater likelihood of future violence, Israel must reverse course and pursue alternatives to its campaign of mass death in Gaza.

Throughout history, states have repeatedly punished civilian populations harshly to try to compel local communities to turn against governments and terrorist groups. But even intense civilian punishment rarely achieves these goals. Instead, it often leads to what I have termed the “Pearl Harbor effect”: growing support among the assailed civilian community for its government or for the local terrorist group.

In June 2024, I argued in Foreign Affairs that at least in one way, Hamas was stronger then than it was before October 7, 2023. To be sure, Israeli attacks had devastated the group's leadership and smashed much of its infrastructure. But according to the most reliable polling information available at that point in time, Palestinian support for Hamas had remained the same or risen in Gaza and the West Bank. Overall, the taproot of Hamas's power—its ability to recruit new fighters to replenish losses—had actually increased. In January 2025, U.S. officials revealed that according to their estimates, Hamas had recruited around 15,000 new fighters since the start of Israel's military operations in 2023, more than making up for the 11,000 to 13,000 losses that U.S. intelligence estimated the group had suffered.



Much has happened since the start of this year: the end of a two-month cease-fire in March, the escalating Israeli siege and the tightened blockade on food and humanitarian goods entering the territory, the humanitarian crisis affecting Gaza's entire population, and Israel's announced intention to conquer at least 75 percent of Gaza—along with the overt consideration by some Israeli leaders that they should expel all Palestinians from the territory. For its part, Hamas seems to be stepping up its guerrilla tactics of ambushes and bombings targeting Israeli soldiers in Gaza, but the group has not been able to meaningfully defend the territory and its population from Israeli attacks.

Media reports in recent months have revealed sporadic demonstrations in Gaza against Hamas, suggesting that some Palestinians are fed up with the group and its actions. But according to recent polling, Hamas remains broadly popular among Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank. The unprecedented scale of Israeli action has not yet exploded the assumptions in my original analysis.

Hamas's relative power cannot simply be measured the same way one would measure the military balance between Israel and its state rivals. In contests between states, the military balance between opponents is of paramount importance. Their militaries usually engage in direct, large-scale battles to take and hold territory, control the skies over territory, or secure access to contested territory. The success of these operations is determined by key indicators, such as the numbers of fighters, stocks of weapons, and levels of economic support. If such factors determined the nature of combat between Hamas and Israel, the war would have been over long ago, since Israel far outpaces the group on all the usual indicators of military strength. That the war has continued for nearly two years and Hamas retains sufficient governing authority in Gaza to hide the remaining Israeli hostages and inflict casualties on the Israeli security forces strongly suggests that the true power of Hamas cannot be found in the traditional metrics of the military balance.

Terrorist groups such as Hamas fight asymmetrically. They rarely seek to seize and hold territory and almost never attempt to win pitched military-to-military battles. Instead, these groups seek to impose losses on their opponents in other ways, mostly through guerrilla operations that pick off enemy military personnel in small numbers and over long stretches of time and through attacks against civilians. Most often, they simply want to maximize harm to vulnerable civilian targets. And since they are always weaker than their state rivals in the usual military indicators, terrorist groups expect to suffer great losses as the conflict persists. As a result, the most telling power of Hamas is its ability to replace the fighters it loses with new ones. Estimates of Hamas's fighting strength bear out this logic. According to the Israeli military, in early 2025, Hamas had as many as 23,000 fighters, a figure roughly the same as an Israeli estimate of the group's size prior to October 7, 2023.

Hamas can recruit new fighters because it still enjoys support. Surveying public opinion is the best way to measure how much support exists among Palestinians for Hamas. The best available surveys conducted among Palestinian populations in Gaza and the West Bank are by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), an independent, nonprofit survey center established in 1993 following the Oslo accords, that collaborates with Israeli scholars and institutions.

My previous June 2024 analysis relied on the PSR surveys from 2023 and 2024. When recent surveys from May 2025 are added to the mix, a striking finding emerges: Hamas has more support among Palestinians today than it did before October 7. Hamas is now, for instance, substantially more popular than its main political rival, the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which dominates the Palestinian Authority. In September 2023, Fatah enjoyed a four-point lead over Hamas (26 to 22 percent). In polling from May 2025, Hamas now enjoys an 11-point lead over Fatah (32 to 21 percent).

The shift toward Hamas is particularly acute in the West Bank, where support for Hamas has more than doubled. There, support for armed attacks on Israeli civilians—and for the October 7, 2023, attacks—has risen from 48 percent in June 2023 to 59 percent in May 2025.



In Gaza, support for Hamas has remained flat, despite the enormous suffering brought upon the territory in the wake of Hamas's October 2023 attack. In September 2023, Hamas had a 13-point lead over Fatah in Gaza (38 to 25 percent), and in May 2025, the numbers were almost the same: Hamas held a 12-point edge over Fatah (37 to 25 percent). The one sign that the Israeli campaign may have changed some views in Gaza is the drop in support among Gazans for armed attacks on Israeli civilians, which fell from 67 percent in September 2023 to 37 percent in May 2025.

But the polling suggests that Israel has not succeeded in severing the connection between Gazans and Hamas. Far from dwindling, support for Hamas has grown or remained the same, and the willingness of Palestinians to attack Israeli civilians remains high enough to satisfy Hamas's recruiting needs, despite the most brutal punishment campaign by a Western democracy in history. For Israel's security, the tragic reality is that Hamas likely retains the key asset that could allow it to carry out another major attack down the road: vast numbers of fighters willing to fight and die for the cause.

Hamas's abiding popularity could be a factor in wider violence beyond Gaza. With Israeli forces stepping up raids on Palestinian refugee camps and settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, the region is now a powder keg. The West Bank is home to 2.7 million Palestinians and 670,000 Israeli settlers living in close proximity to one another. Recent Israeli plans to expand settlements in the West Bank and rhetoric from far-right figures calling for the territory's annexation will likely add fuel to this potential fire.

Israel's announced intention to seize control of at least 75 percent of Gaza and then confine Gazans to a small portion of territory won't succeed in divorcing the population from Hamas. As Palestinians are driven into a small corner of the enclave, Hamas will just move with them; this plan is no more likely to defeat Hamas than were the previous population transfers that forced people from area to area inside Gaza. Indeed, such Israeli actions will cause more suffering among civilians—and produce more terrorists. Israel could go further still, expelling Gazans into the Sinai Desert, but such a drastic measure would stoke the possibility of future retributive violence targeting Israelis. And most damaging for long-term Israeli security, throwing Gazans out of the territory would leave Israel open to accusations of engaging in ethnic cleansing, undermining any moral case for supporting the country.

Military operations that, intentionally or not, result in historic levels of civilian deaths are ultimately leading to a more dangerous situation for Israel, making it a less desirable home for Jews and a more likely target for those seeking revenge. Instead, Israel should establish a new security perimeter between Israeli civilian population centers and the Palestinians in Gaza, allowing Gazans enough space to rebuild their lives, letting humanitarian and economic aid to flow into the territory unimpeded, and working with international allies to foster alternative political arrangements to Hamas or Israeli control in Gaza.

Since the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, international support for the country has been based in significant part on the recognition that Jews were the victims of the worst genocide in history. The war in Gaza, however, has seen a swelling tide of condemnation of Israel for committing intentional harm to civilians, mass atrocities, and even genocide. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants that require some 125 countries, including France and the United Kingdom, to detain Israel's prime minister and other members of Israel's cabinet. Even within Israel, prominent voices are calling for a course correction: former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has declared that Israel's actions in Gaza are tantamount to a “war crime,” arguing that “what we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: the indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.” As Israel becomes an international pariah and faces stiffening resistance to its rule in Gaza, the historic scale of its punishment of civilians is only jeopardizing the country's long-term security.

Many Western countries have already begun to make moves to chastise Israel, including by joining much of the rest of the world in formally recognizing a Palestinian state, a step that could lead to large-scale humanitarian intervention in Gaza and economic sanctions on Israel. The United States will likely not follow that path, but U.S. President Donald Trump is mercurial. He has already contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and insisted that the starvation of Gaza must end. Rifts within Trump's base are widening over Israel. U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leading hard-right Republican, declared that Israel is in fact committing genocide in Gaza, borrowing from rhetoric heard more often on the left. A tactical alliance could grow in the United States between elements of the far right and the far left that seek to roll back U.S. support for Israel.

Israel is the most militarily powerful country in the Middle East and has scored numerous victories over its opponents in recent years. But it is also a tiny country surrounded by rivals. And it needs close relations with major Western democracies to ensure the viability of its economy. Those relations could be tested and strained as Israel continues waging the worst campaign of civilian punishment ever performed by a Western democracy, a campaign that has not come close to eliminating Hamas and has given Israel more adversaries and left it more isolated. Israeli leaders must decide whether their ongoing immoral actions in Gaza are really worth the costs to their country's future.

The rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years has led many analysts to suggest that it will upend international politics and the military balance of power. Some have gone so far as to claim, in the words of the technologists Dan Hendrycks, Eric Schmidt, and Alexandr Wang, that advanced AI systems could “establish one state's complete dominance and control, leaving the fate of rivals subject to its will.”

AI is no doubt a transformative technology, one that will strengthen the economic, political, and military foundations of state power. But the winner of the AI race will not necessarily enjoy unchallenged dominance over its major competitors. The power of nuclear weapons, the most significant invention of the last century, remains a major impediment to the bulldozing change brought by AI. So long as systems of nuclear deterrence remain in place, the economic and military advantages produced by AI will not allow states to fully impose their political preferences on one another. Consider that the U.S. economy is almost 15 times larger than that of Russia, and almost 1,000 times larger than that of North Korea, yet Washington struggles to get Moscow or Pyongyang to do what it wants, in large part because of their nuclear arsenals.

Some analysts have suggested that AI advances could challenge this dynamic. To undermine nuclear deterrence, AI would need to knock down its central pillar: a state's capacity to respond to a nuclear attack with a devastating nuclear strike of its own, what is known as second-strike capability. AI technology could plausibly make it easier for a state to destroy a rival's entire nuclear arsenal in one “splendid first strike” by pinpointing the locations of nuclear submarines and mobile launchers. It could also prevent a rival from launching a retaliatory strike by disabling command-and-control networks. And it could strengthen missile defenses such that a rival could no longer credibly threaten retaliation. If AI could in this way help a state escape the prospect of mutual assured destruction, the technology would make that state unrivaled in its capacity to threaten and coerce adversaries—an outcome in line with increasingly popular visions of AI-enabled dominance.

But undermining the nuclear balance of power will not be easy. Emerging technologies still face very real constraints in the nuclear domain. Even the most sophisticated AI-powered targeting and sensor systems may struggle to locate a mobile nuclear launcher hidden under a bridge, isolate the signatures of a nuclear-armed submarine from the background noise of the ocean, and orchestrate the simultaneous destruction of hundreds of targets on land, air, and sea—with zero room for error. And competitors will respond to their adversaries' use of new technology with moves of their own to defend their systems, as they have at every turn since the dawn of the atomic age.

Yet even if it does not challenge nuclear deterrence, AI may encourage mistrust and dangerous actions among nuclear-armed states. Many of the steps that governments could take to protect and toughen their second-strike capabilities risk alarming rivals, potentially spurring expensive and dangerous arms races. It also remains possible that AI systems could cross a crucial threshold and exhibit extremely rapid improvements in capabilities. Were that to happen, their advantages to the country that possesses them could become more pronounced and difficult for rivals to contend with. Policymakers should monitor for such a scenario and facilitate regular communication between AI and nuclear experts. At the same time, they should take steps to reduce the probability of accidents and escalation, including assessing nuclear systems for AI-related vulnerabilities and maintaining channels of communication between nuclear powers. Such steps will help ensure that nuclear stability—and not just nuclear deterrence—endures in the age of AI.

Nuclear deterrence depends, most fundamentally, on states' possessing the ability to retaliate after absorbing a nuclear attack: so long as two nuclear powers credibly maintain a second-strike capability that can inflict unacceptable damage on their adversary, a first strike is suicidal. This understanding has for decades sustained a relatively stable equilibrium. But second-strike capabilities are not invulnerable. States can eliminate delivery platforms, such as road-mobile missile launchers and nuclear submarines, provided that they can find them. The difficulty of finding and disabling these platforms is one of the central obstacles to launching a splendid first strike. The sheer size of China, Russia, the United States, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean—the most important domains for nuclear competition today—makes such a strike hard to accomplish.

The emergence of powerful AI systems, however, could solve that problem. Capable of processing and analyzing vast amounts of data, a military equipped with such technologies could better target the nuclear assets of its rivals. Consider ground-launched mobile missiles, one of the platforms that underpin Russian and Chinese second-strike capabilities. These missiles, which are carried on vehicles that can hide under camouflage netting, bridges, or tunnels and drive from one concealed location to another, are probably the most difficult element of Russian and Chinese nuclear forces to eliminate. (Silo-based ballistic missiles, by contrast, are much more vulnerable to attack.) The improved speed and scale of AI-empowered intelligence processing may make it easier to conduct operations against these vehicles. AI systems can scour and integrate huge amounts of data from satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, signals intelligence intercepts, stealth drones, ground-based sensors, and human intelligence to more effectively find and track mobile nuclear forces.

When it comes to the sea, the potential convergence of AI with sensing technologies might make the oceans “transparent,” allowing governments to track ballistic missile submarines in real time. That is a particular concern for the United States, which keeps a much higher percentage of its warheads on submarines than Russia or China does. AI could make it easier to track submarines by automating pattern recognition from multiple types of sensors across massive ocean areas and over long durations. It could also help a state hack into the systems its adversaries use to track their own weapons.Yet even with the assistance of AI, states will not be absolutely sure that a splendid first strike can knock out a rival's capacity to retaliate. On land, for instance, China and Russia could respond to improvements in U.S. tracking systems with their own countermeasures. They could invest in antisatellite weapons and jamming capabilities. They could adopt old-fashioned low-tech solutions, such as covering roads with netting or constructing decoys, to increase the number of targets an attacker would need to strike. They could order their launchers to emit fewer signals, making it harder for the United States to track them. They could modify the launchers to move faster, widening the target area U.S. strikes would have to hit. They could even use their own AI systems to inject false information into channels monitored by the U.S. intelligence community.

In the maritime domain, too, AI is unlikely to make the sea fully transparent. Any system will struggle to continuously identify, track, and monitor multiple targets over long ranges and amid ocean background noise, especially as submarines get quieter and oceans noisier. Submarines remain extraordinarily difficult to detect when submerged at depth and operating at low speeds, due to how sound moves underwater, shifting ocean conditions, and the inherent noisiness of the marine environment. In the seas, false alarms are frequent; reliable contact is rare. And at sea, as on land, major powers can tip the scales in their favor through various countermeasures: they can jam signals, manipulate sensor data, use undersea sensors and uncrewed vehicles to detect adversary assets, and operate their own submarines in protected bastions close to their home shores. Detection will thus remain a matter of probability, even with the introduction of AI—and states are unlikely to want to risk a splendid first strike on anything less than a safe bet.

Beyond making it easier to find and destroy an adversary's nuclear weapons, AI could plausibly threaten the nuclear command-and-control systems that would be needed to launch a retaliatory strike. Command-and-control systems are responsible for detecting attacks, reporting them to the relevant authority, and transmitting retaliation orders to nuclear forces. These systems must be able to identify a wide range of missiles; assess damage on the ground; send short messages over thousands of miles, including deep underwater; and protect the leaders responsible for nuclear decision-making. States seeking to disable a command-and-control system must proceed with caution, as overt moves to knock out a rival's system may be seen as the prelude to a nuclear attack, potentially justifying preemptive retaliation. Like most elements of a splendid first strike, disarming a command-and-control system requires, in the words of the scholar James Acton, destroying “as much of each component as possible with as little warning as possible.”

Many parts of a nuclear command-and-control system are already vulnerable to attack and will become increasingly so with new technological breakthroughs. Nuclear and conventional strikes can already destroy fixed equipment, such as radars and high-frequency transmitters. With improvements in AI, meanwhile, it may become easier to track mobile command posts on land as well as more precisely target airborne ones. Satellites that provide early warning of incoming nuclear attacks may become increasingly vulnerable to AI-enhanced antisatellite weapons. And sophisticated cyber operations supercharged by AI might allow states to penetrate a rival's command-and-control networks, disable early warning-systems, and disrupt the transmission of orders—a risk that may grow as states modernize their systems, moving away from analog and hardwired capabilities toward digital ones.

But taking out an entire command-and-control system in one fell swoop will never be straightforward, even with advanced technology. States have gone to great lengths to make their systems resilient, incorporating redundancy and elaborate countermeasures. On land, some command bunkers in China, Russia, and the United States are buried at least 700 meters underground in hard rock, deep enough to survive even a direct hit from a large nuclear weapon. In space, every major nuclear power has either sent hundreds or thousands of satellites into orbit or is close to doing so, making it difficult to destroy all of a country's advance-warning and communications systems. In the air, the curvature of the earth limits the distance at which surveillance radar can track airborne command posts. And in cyberspace, the ability to launch a disarming strike will require persistent access to an adversary's systems, risking detection and possible retaliation. States will also expend enormous effort trying to prevent such intrusions, most likely with the aid of their own AI defenses, while operating multiple redundant networks. As a result of these challenges, it seems unlikely that AI will credibly threaten the elimination of command-and-control systems.

A final fear is that AI could weaken nuclear deterrence by improving missile defenses, thereby minimizing the possibility of a successful second strike and making first strikes more tempting. Establishing strong defenses against nuclear missile attacks has always been an exceptionally challenging task. Russia and China have few such capabilities, and U.S. defense systems are error-prone, spread thin, and unable to fully prevent an attack from a major nuclear power. These systems must do the nearly impossible: detect a launch, track hundreds of missiles traveling through space at 20 times the speed of sound, estimate their future trajectories, and destroy them with interceptors—all in less than 30 minutes, the rough flight time for most land-based missiles traveling between the United States and Russia or China. National security officials have likened this process to trying to shoot a bullet with another bullet. And they must be able to do all this economically and at scale, so that an attacker cannot overwhelm a defensive system with many cheaper missiles.

AI could improve some of these capabilities. Machine-learning algorithms might, for example, rapidly analyze data from multiple sensors to distinguish actual warheads from sophisticated decoys and speed up decision-making once an adversary launches its missiles. Software advances can make it easier to predict a missile's trajectory. In addition, through advancements in materials science, AI might help produce lighter, more agile interceptors, making the weapons cheaper and more maneuverable in flight.

But none of these developments will take place overnight: defensive architectures take years to develop, and U.S. adversaries will not stand by and watch. Attackers maintain significant advantages: they can launch from unexpected directions, overwhelm defenses with coordinated salvo attacks using large numbers of decoys, or directly target key defense systems. In the highly unlikely event that missile defense becomes so strong that it is insurmountable, states could resort to more creative delivery methods, such as smuggling and prepositioning small nuclear devices in enemy territory. An AI-hardened system of missile defense would depend on machine learning algorithms that are trained on large, reliable data sets regarding decoy measures and missile systems—data that U.S. adversaries have every incentive to obscure. Indeed, U.S. rivals could try to confuse AI algorithms by manipulating missile tests. In short, even AI-enhanced defenses face physical and economic constraints that sophisticated nuclear powers can exploit.

Even in the face of AI-driven technological change, nuclear deterrence should remain strong. This does not mean, however, that AI poses no risks to global nuclear stability. Even if predictions of AI power overestimate the technology's actual capabilities, states may perceive greater threats and take potentially destabilizing actions. If a state believes that an AI-powered rival can more easily discover its missiles, for example, it may decide to build more warheads, house more of its weapons on harder-to-detect mobile vehicles, direct those vehicles to move faster, and delegate more launch authority to vehicle drivers to reduce the need for long-distance communication that could be intercepted. If states believe their command-and-control systems are vulnerable to AI-enabled attacks, they may wish to reduce the number of steps required to launch a counterattack. These are all moves that increase the probability of escalation and accidental launches, especially with respect to states with fewer resources and less experience in managing nuclear weapons, such as India and Pakistan.

Beyond such destabilizing uncertainty, it remains possible that countries will develop significantly more powerful AI systems that could threaten methods of nuclear deterrence in ways that cannot yet be anticipated, especially if—as some experts suggest is possible—AI R&D becomes fully automated, spurring a sudden takeoff in capabilities. National security experts should not dismiss this eventuality, and they should continuously monitor for evidence of rapid takeoffs in AI capabilities among rivals.



But even if intelligence is a powerful asset, it isn't magic, and states seeking to use AI to disarm their adversaries will confront real physical, practical, and institutional limits. A state empowered by transformative AI systems will still have to solve an enormous number of extremely difficult problems before it can contemplate decapitating a nuclear competitor: it will need to integrate advanced AI into large-scale military bureaucracies, no easy task, and figure out how to test these systems in advance—a tall order given the need both to avoid triggering a preemptive response and to rehearse thousands of steps with little room for error. No matter how intelligent they are, powerful AI systems will not be able to evade the laws of physics. And no tool or capability guarantees that a state can impose its preferences on another: the United States, after all, possessed overwhelming military and economic power over the Taliban in Afghanistan yet suffered an unambiguous defeat after two decades of war.

None of this should encourage complacency. Even if nuclear deterrence persists, AI will still transform national security in many ways, including by helping states develop new autonomous weapons and by strengthening offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities. These developments will have significant consequences, even if they do not give any state the ability to impose its will on nuclear-armed adversaries. AI may also democratize access to dangerous capabilities, lowering the barriers for nonstate actors and individuals to build and deploy devastating biological, chemical, and radiological weapons. These are just a few of the problems that policymakers will have to grapple with as AI continues to improve.

In the nuclear domain, U.S. officials should not wait to see what advances AI brings. They should ensure that policy processes include AI experts alongside nuclear ones, encouraging a dialogue that has thus far been lacking in the national security community. They should conduct rigorous reviews of nuclear systems to check for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by advanced AI, especially in cyberspace, and deepen the ranks of AI experts within the U.S. government. They should carefully calibrate any statements about the need to race to artificial general intelligence, or the importance of being the first to develop a decisive wonder weapon, lest they exacerbate risky and costly nuclear competition. And through arms control dialogues, they should work to strengthen the significant ethical, political, and legal constraints on a state's ability to launch a splendid first strike or to take other escalatory steps. The system of nuclear deterrence that has been in place since the end of World War II cannot be taken for granted. As political rivalries and the growing competition for AI supremacy heat up between the world's great powers, it is more important than ever to maintain channels of communication and pathways to reduce the risk of inadvertent escalation and calamity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Energy chief suggests Trump administration is altering previously published climate reports","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/climate/wright-national-climate-assessments-updating","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:08:00 GMT","


            Energy Sec. Chris Wright said Tuesday night the Trump administration is updating the National Climate Assessments that have been previously published, which the administration recently removed from government websites.
    


            “We're reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those reports,” Wright told CNN's Kaitlan Collins in an interview on “The Source.”
    


            Wright dismissed the past reports, saying “they weren't fair in broad-based assessments of climate change.”
    


            “When you get into departments and look at stuff that's there and you find stuff that's objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said.
    


            Energy spokesperson Andrea Woods said, “The National Climate Reports are published by NOAA, not DOE. He was not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports.”
    


            The interagency process and publication is overseen by the US Global Change Research Program, which was established by Congress.
    


Trump EPA proposes revoking pollution limits based in part on document authored by 5 climate contrarians



            The National Climate Assessments are congressionally mandated research reports authored by hundreds of scientists and experts, intended to inform the country of the latest climate science and the current and future impacts of climate change in the US. The reports take years to research, draft and publish and go through multiple rounds of peer review, with all 13 federal agencies that conduct climate research. An independent National Academy of Sciences panel signs off on the content.
    


            The first Trump administration signed off on and released the Fourth US National Climate Assessment in 2018, although it attempted to bury the report's news by releasing it on Black Friday. The current administration has deleted all previous reports from government websites, fired the scientists working on the next iteration of the report, and recently issued a separate report compiled by five researchers that questioned the severity of climate change.
    


            Altering or revising previously published assessments would be a significant escalation in the administration's attempts to wipe credible climate science off the record.
    


            “That would be a very unusual approach, especially given the process that went into creating these,” said scientist Zeke Hausfather, the climate research lead at financial services company Stripe, who helped author the Fifth National Climate Assessment.
    


            Wright played a large role in commissioning a new federal report that questioned the severity of climate change, authored by five researchers who are well-known climate contrarians. The report was issued last week, in conjunction with a proposed regulatory repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency's “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety.
    


            Wright told CNN that he hand-picked the four researchers and one economist who authored the Trump administration report: John Christy and Roy Spencer, both research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Georgia Tech professor emeritus Judith Curry and Canadian economist Ross McKitrick.
    


            “I just made a list of who do I think are the true, honest scientists,” Wright said. “I made a list of about a dozen of them that I thought were very senior and very well respected. I called the top five, and everyone said yes.”
    


            Compared to the National Climate Assessments and international climate science reports that take years to compile and review, the recent DOE report took just two months to produce. It is now undergoing a public comment process.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            Zed Nelson spots the painting on the wall behind me almost as soon as we begin our interview.
    


            “It's perfect,” he said.
    


            The canvas depicts a sleeping tiger draped across a velvet cushion, floating among pastel-shade leaves and flowers. The London-based photographer doesn't mean “perfect” as in “masterfully painted;” he means it's the perfect metaphor for the idealized, human-centric relationship we've cultivated with nature.
    


            The painting reminds him of another artwork, “A young Tiger Playing With Its Mother,” by the French Romantic artist Eugene Delacroix, who used a captive tiger at a zoo and his pet cat as models.
    


            “The Romantic movement in painting began with the human divorce from the natural world. As we removed ourselves from nature, and it receded from our imagination, we reenacted these hyper-romantic versions of nature,” said Nelson.
    


            It's the central thesis of his latest project, “The Anthropocene Illusion,” which earned him Photographer of the Year at the 2025 Sony World Photography Awards. Captured across 14 countries and four continents over six years, the images show nature as imagined by humans: staged habitats in zoos, manufactured ski slopes, indoor rainforests, and artificial beaches.
    


            In his previous project, “Love Me,” Nelson explored the homogenization of beauty standards. “There's some echo of that here. It's about how this artificial, idealized version of nature is being — I mean, I want to say sold back to us, but we're willing participants in it, too,” Nelson explained.
    


            “While we destroy the real thing, we seem to be creating more and more artificial or choreographed, curated versions of nature.”
    


            It's this “psychological disconnect” that Nelson is most interested in exposing. The collection is equal parts ironic (a Maasai tribesman posing beside a picnic blanket for an “Out of Africa” champagne brunch in Kenya) and dystopian (a child perched on a fiberglass rock at a beach in the world's largest indoor rainforest, the canvas of the sky slightly ripped behind him).
    


            “That's very sort of Truman Show-esque. He's gone to the very edge of that artificial world,” said Nelson of the photo.
    


            More than anything, though, there's a feeling of sadness that permeates the collection: taxidermied museum dioramas of endangered species; vibrant fish shoals swimming in dark aquariums with plastic pipes, captive elephants paraded to a bathing spot for the benefit of flocks of Instagram influencers; a caged polar bear crouched beside a mural depicting an Arctic landscape it will never know.
    


            “What we replaced real nature with becomes an unwitting monument, really, for what we've lost,” Nelson observed.
    


            The term “Anthropocene” refers to the age of humans. It's not an official epoch — yet. But Nelson believes firmly that, in years to come, today's society will mark the beginning of this new era, evident in elevated carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels, an abundance of microplastics, and layers of concrete.
    


            “The usefulness of renaming an epoch, in this instance, would be to focus people's attention on our impact on the planet,” said Nelson. As he sees it, “the language of (environmental action) has become sort of tired or stale; you become kind of immune to it.”
    


            He wanted to counter this collective numbness with visuals that “make you think or feel differently.”
    


            Bleak but beautiful, his photos reveal a paradox.
    


            Less than 3% of the world's land remains ecologically intact, according to a 2021 study, yet nature-based tourism and biophilic architecture, a design philosophy that mimics nature, are surging in popularity. Global wildlife populations have dropped by an average of 73% in the last 50 years; meanwhile, there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild, globally.
    


            Arctic ice sheets are on course for catastrophic “runaway melting” that would see rising sea levels devastate coastal communities. But at the same time, cocktail bars in Dubai are importing ancient glacier ice from Greenland to provide the wealthy with pollution-free drinks.
    


            “We're engaged in creating an illusion for ourselves; either to hide what we're doing, or as something that we can retreat into for reassurance, because we crave the very thing that we've lost,” said Nelson.
    


            There's a spectrum to the illusion, ranging from managed outdoor landscapes to contrived scenes that simply evoke the idea of nature.
    


            Nelson likens it to fast food: “We don't want to grow it and prepare it; we just want it delivered to us with no thorns, no danger, with a nice walkway in a car park. We want to consume it and then come home. We are complicit in it.”
    


            Despite his criticisms of the “consumerist” qualities of today's manufactured natural experiences, Nelson emphasizes that he's not necessarily against any of these things: people should enjoy safaris, be awe-inspired at aquariums, relish their time in a local park, and not “destroy ourselves with guilt.”
    


            “We have this enduring craving for nature, for a connection to the natural world. That's real,” he observed.
    


Haunting images from photo prize show the ‘beauty and tragedy' of our planet



            There's a limit to what the individual can do, too: the kind of sweeping change required to protect the environment needs to come from major corporations and political leaders, which, in Nelson's view, is sorely lacking.
    


            “It's important to remind ourselves, it's not that we don't have ideas for things that can be done,” he said, reeling off a long list of environmental policies that could change the course of climate change.
    


            Perhaps this book, with its stark juxtaposition of astonishing wildlife and human interference, can be a reminder of just how in control of the world we are — with the power to remodel it in our own image, or protect and restore the landscapes we feel so connected to.

Israel has routed its enemies across the region but has yet to return all its hostages from the Gaza Strip. Hamas appears to have been decimated militarily but has kept up insurgent attacks. Gaza is in ruins and experts say it is sliding into famine, and long-running ceasefire talks seem to have broken down.

So where do we go from here?

Both Israel and Hamas have embraced visions for how the war should end, but mediators from two American administrations, Egypt and Qatar have yet to bridge the gaps. There are at least two other scenarios in which the war goes on indefinitely, at an unimaginable cost to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians, the Israeli hostages and their families.

Here's a closer look.

For days now, Israeli media have reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of ordering the full reoccupation of Gaza for the first time since Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers two decades ago. He is expected to meet with his security Cabinet late Thursday, possibly to make a decision.

That would mean sending ground troops into the few areas of Gaza that haven't been totally destroyed, the roughly 25% of the territory where much of its 2 million people have sought refuge, including the sprawling coastal displacement camps of Muwasi.

It would lead to countless more Palestinian deaths and more mass displacement, and it could put the roughly 20 remaining living hostages at serious risk. It would also leave Israel in full control of the territory, obliged by international law to provide security and ensure the basic needs of the population are met.




Reoccupation would spark outrage internationally and further isolate Israel and the U.S. There is also opposition within Israel, from those who fear for the hostages and former security chiefs who have warned of a quagmire.

But it has strong support among Netanyahu's far-right governing partners, who have long called for the reconquest of Gaza, the relocation of much of its population to other countries, and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements.

Hamas has said it will release all the remaining hostages in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.

Those demands were adopted by the Biden administration and the U.N. Security Council over a year ago, and enshrined in the ceasefire agreement finalized by the Trump administration in January. That brought about a six-week ceasefire, the release of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others, and a flood of humanitarian aid.

The two sides were supposed to use that pause to negotiate a more lasting ceasefire. Instead, Israel ended the truce in March, demanding another temporary ceasefire and the release of some of the remaining hostages. 

Israel fears that withdrawing from Gaza would allow Hamas to eventually rebuild its military machine and maintain influence in the territory even if doesn't hold formal power, paving the way for another Oct. 7-style attack.

Netanyahu may also fear that his far-right allies would follow through on threats to bring down the government if he agrees to such terms. That could spell the end of his 16 nearly unbroken years in power, leaving him more vulnerable to long-running corruption charges and inquiries into the security and intelligence failures around the 2023 attack.

Netanyahu has said he will end the war once all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or agrees to disarm and go into exile.

But even then, he says Israel will pursue plans to relocate much of Gaza's population to other countries through what he refers to as “voluntary emigration.” The Palestinians and much of the international community see the plan as forcible expulsion in violation of international law.

Netanyahu says Israel is willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire in which Hamas would release several living hostages and the bodies of others in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a flood of humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli pullback. They would then negotiate an end to the war, but Israel would require Hamas' disarmament.

Hamas has said it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not lay down its arms as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. It also wants guarantees that Israel will not resume the war, as it did in March.

Further military escalation could yield more concessions. But Hamas has already lost thousands of fighters and nearly all of its top leaders in Gaza, where it no longer controls many areas. Its strongest allies, Iran and Hezbollah, have been severely weakened.

The hostages are the last bargaining chip held by Hamas, which also has a strong culture of martyrdom.

It's quite possible the war continues in its current state.

Israel could continue carrying out daily strikes across the territory, which it says have only targeted militants but have frequently killed adult civilians and children. Hamas could keep up a low tempo of hit-and-run attacks, occasionally killing Israeli soldiers. Additional measures to get more food into Gaza may stave off famine and allow aid to be distributed more safely.

The hostages could survive in captivity for months or even years.

Israel is set to hold elections in October 2026 — and likely earlier — which could bring in new leadership even if Netanyahu keeps his coalition intact.

Which scenario unfolds will largely depend on U.S. President Donald Trump, who has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, and who proved he has leverage over Netanyahu when he brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after 12 days of war in June.

Trump has said he wants to end the war in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home, but he has exerted no public pressure on Israel and appears to have fully accepted its terms for a ceasefire.

Asked on Tuesday whether he would support Israel reoccupying Gaza, Trump said, “It's going to be pretty much up to Israel.”

ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) — The U.S. was knocked off the top spot in FIFA's latest women's rankings by world champion Spain. 

Spain regained the No. 1 position despite losing to England in the final of the European Championship last month. 

The U.S. held the top position since August last year after winning gold at the Paris Olympics. Spain was No. 1 from December 2023 to June last year after its World Cup triumph. 

The latest rankings were released by world governing body FIFA on Thursday.

England, which has won back-to-back Euros and lost to Spain in the final at the 2023 World Cup, moved up one place to fourth. 

Brazil dropped three positions and is seventh despite successfully defending the Copa America to win its ninth continental title.

Sweden and France were big movers after impressive showings at the Euros. 

Sweden rose three places and is third after being eliminated on penalties by England in the quarterfinals. 

France moved up four places to sixth after also losing in the quarterfinals.

SPRING HOPE, N.C. (AP) — Two people were found dead in central North Carolina after they and a police officer trying to save them were swept away in rushing floodwaters, authorities said Wednesday.

Another cluster of storms was dumping rain on the region Thursday, a day after a 24-year-old woman and 55-year-old man were found dead when flooding on a section of highway receded, according to police in the town of Spring Hope.

Some communities had been under flash flood warnings and advisories Wednesday while as much as 5 inches (127 millimeters) of rain fell in parts of the Raleigh and Durham areas.

The woman and man, both from the small town of Louisburg, had been trapped in a vehicle that was pushed into a ditch filled with about 6 feet (1.8 meters) of fast-moving floodwater, police said. The woman was climbing out of the roof when she fell into the water and an officer jumped in to save her, police said.

The strong current swept away the woman, the man and the officer, who escaped unharmed as the two people disappeared. Authorities searched but the two died. 

The storm's pathway over central North Carolina follows Tropical Storm Chantal's flooding in parts of the region last month. Public assistance damage estimates are already more than $42 million, according to Gov. Josh Stein's office. Stein also issued a state disaster declaration Tuesday for eight counties because of Chantal damage, meaning residents can seek out state financial aid.

Harvard medical student Nick Norwitz reveals the science behind his food experiment, in which he consumed 133,000 mg of dietary cholesterol

The question of whether to incorporate eggs into a healthy diet has long been debated due to their cholesterol content.

But recent research has found that eggs may not be as bad for cholesterol as previously believed.

A new study led by researchers in Australia investigated the impact of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat on LDL cholesterol, often known as ""bad cholesterol.""

5 EGG MYTHS DISPELLED BY AN EXPERT, PLUS TIPS FOR EVERY EGG LOVER

High cholesterol is known to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a leading cause of death.

The randomized, controlled study — which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition — assigned 61 adults with baseline LDL cholesterol to various diets for five weeks each.

Previous guidance warned against egg intake as a potential risk to heart health. (iStock)

These included a high-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet with two eggs per day; a low-cholesterol, high-saturated fat diet without eggs; and a high-cholesterol, high-saturated fat control diet with one egg per week.

'I'M A HEART SURGEON, HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT EGGS, YOUR HEART AND YOUR HEALTH'

The researchers found that the nutrition plan with two eggs per day, as part of a low-saturated fat diet, reduced LDL cholesterol more than the egg-free diet.

Across all three diets, saturated fat intake was ""positively correlated"" with LDL cholesterol, but dietary cholesterol (primarily found in animal products like meat and eggs) was not.

The study found that eggs did not correlate to LDL cholesterol, but saturated fat did. (iStock)

""The key message is that it is not foods that are high in cholesterol that increase blood levels of 'bad' cholesterol, but it is the saturated fat in the foods that we consume,"" study co-author Jon Buckley, executive dean at the University of South Australia, told Fox News Digital.

""Most foods that are high in cholesterol are also high in saturated fat, but eggs are somewhat unusual in that they are high in cholesterol but low in saturated fat.""

KEEP THE EGGS BUT REPLACE 5 BAD-FOR-YOU BREAKFAST FOODS, SAYS NUTRITIONIST

These findings follow a December 2024 advisory from the FDA that deemed eggs ""healthy,"" due to growing research that the food does not raise bad cholesterol.

""Current research shows that cholesterol in eggs does not negatively impact your body's cholesterol levels as was once thought,"" the news release stated. 

These findings follow a December 2024 advisory from the FDA that deemed eggs ""healthy,"" due to growing research that the food does not raise bad cholesterol. (iStock)

""This important milestone closes the door on decades of debate over whether eggs are good for you and reinforces their standing as a powerhouse of nutrition.""

Certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco, who is based in New York, confirmed in an interview with Fox News Digital that eggs can be part of a balanced diet.

They serve a ""decent amount"" of lean protein at about 6 grams per egg and contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the expert said.

""For a long time, it was thought that dietary cholesterol (any foods containing cholesterol) caused cholesterol levels to rise – but in more recent years, that notion has been debunked by many studies,"" she said. ""It is more noted now that saturated fat is a main reason for LDL cholesterol to increase."" 

DeCicco, who was not involved in the study, said saturated fat is mostly found in dairy and meat products like cheese, creams, butter, fatty cuts of meat, dark meat, poultry, processed meats like sausage and bacon, and processed baked goods.

A nutritionist agrees that eggs can be a healthy part of a balanced diet. (iStock)

""Not only do eggs contain little saturated fat, but they also contain monounsaturated fat and omega 3 fats, which are heart- and brain-protective,"" she added.

Eggs contain less than 2 grams of saturated fat, and the American Heart Association recommends about 12 to 13 grams of saturated fat per day for a 2,000-calorie diet.

""So eating two to three eggs with vegetables and fruit is a nutritious breakfast full of protein, fiber and healthy fat that will provide long-lasting fuel,"" DeCicco said.

Buckley agreed, recommending that ""if you are going out for a cooked breakfast of bacon and eggs, consider swapping out some of the bacon or sausage for more eggs, and this will help you maintain a healthier blood cholesterol level.""

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss oil giant BP's decision to lower their spending on green energy initiatives.

In Tuesday's ""Morning Glory"" column, I laid out a small part of the abuses perpetrated on farmers, ranchers and landowners by the application of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) to private property by the 9,000 bureaucrats of the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS.)

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has another 12,000 bureaucrats and they regulate marine species. The USFWS is by far the worst offender of private property rights, but NOAA as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also contribute to the giant, tangled tumbleweed of regulations, rules, ""guidance,"" incompetence and environmental extremism that have paralyzed major infrastructure projects as well home and apartment building projects across the country. 

Three executive orders from President Trump would greatly assist the farmers, ranchers and landowners who have been shut down from using their land in whole or part because of the listing of one or more of the 1,300 species and subspecies listed as ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" by the USFWS and NOAA.

MORNING GLORY: MEMO FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, SECRETARY BURGUM AND DIRECTOR NESVIK

The first EO would direct Secretary Burgum to immediately remove from the list of ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" species and subspecies all mammals, birds, crustaceans and insects that were added to the list because of the application of the criteria that looks at the ""projected decline"" in ""critical habitat"" or ""occupied or potentially occupied habitat."" This criteria for declaring a species or subspecies on the basis of ""projected decline"" of its habitat is guesswork, not ""science,"" and the application of this criteria has been repeatedly abused by bureaucrats for the past three decades. 

A species or subspecies is considered ""endangered"" when it is in ""imminent"" danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A ""threatened species"" is one that is liable to become endangered in the foreseeable future. Both the terms ""imminent"" and ""foreseeable"" are accordion terms that can be stretched to absurd limits. The USFWS has done so, again and again. 

When the ESA passed in 1973 there were 78 species or subspecies listed as ""endangered"" or ""threatened."" Now there are 1,300. This extraordinary rise in the number of ""protected"" species is because the Service began using ""projected future decline"" in a species' or subspecies' range. Every species or subspecies that is on the list because of projected loss of habitat should be immediately removed from the list. Such ""projections"" are not ""science"" and indeed are often absurdly applied to achieve listing status. Very often the USFWS doesn't even account for permanently set aside parks and open spaces in its calculations of ""projected habitat loss.""

If President Trump orders these removals from the ESA list be done immediately, he will focus the energy and budget of the bureaucracy on truly endangered and threatened species, and stop environmental extremists within the USFWS and NOAA and outside of those agencies from manipulating the list. 

The second executive order from President Trump should declare that private property impacted by ESA listings has been ""taken"" by the federal government and the owner must thus be compensated the fair market value of the land in question. The Constitution protects private property from uncompensated ""takings,"" and the vast cost imposed by the ESA should be born by all taxpayers, not the few thousand landowners slammed by the Act.

Finally, President Trump should order Secretary Burgum and USFWS Director Brian Nesvik to downsize both the USFWS and NOAA and do so on the basis of merit. Too many activists have infiltrated these agencies and use the ESA to block development, not protect species. They are also among the least responsive and most inefficient members of the federal workforce. It is long past time to clean house, beginning with new regional and area directors who are committed to the Constitution's explicit protection of private property, not their own private agendas or stopping development. 

The Pacific Legal Foundation does yeoman's work to protect the rights of all landowners, including ranchers, farmers and developers, but the scale of this problem has been growing exponentially for decades. Secretary Burgum and Director Nesvik would do well to hire from within the Pacific Legal Foundation for their senior staffs. That way lies growth and true protection of genuinely endangered or threatened species. And if that protection requires the sequestration of private property for months or years, the landowner should be paid immediately for their lost economic value of their land, as the Fifth Amendment requires.

DNC chair Ken Martin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Texas' redistricting effort as Gov. Abbott feuds with Democrats over the effort and his reaction to Sen. Warren embracing Zohran Mamdani.  

Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan announced he is leaving the GOP and joining the Democratic Party, a move he says has been a long time coming as he has bucked heads with the Republican Party.

Duncan, who served as lieutenant governor as a Republican from 2019 until 2023, wrote in an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday that his path to becoming a Democrat began before President Donald Trump attempted to overturn his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, which Duncan criticized at the time.

""My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia,"" Duncan wrote in the newspaper.

""There's no date on a calendar or line in the sand that points to the exact moment in time my political heart changed, but it has,"" he continued. ""My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican.""

Duncan pointed to several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, criticizing Republicans for their handling of issues such as health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and how to help poor people.

He said his time in office taught him the best way to ""love my neighbor"" is through public policy. Before his time as lieutenant governor, he served in the Georgia House from 2013 until 2017. He opted not to run for re-election as lieutenant governor in 2022. 

The former Republican said GOP lawmakers have argued for decades that the solution to not having health insurance is to have a job, but noted that most uninsured people in the Peach State live in working households yet do not have insurance because of affordability or eligibility. 

""So, the reality is they have a job, just the wrong job,"" Duncan wrote. ""One that doesn't offer health insurance or generate enough spare money each month to afford their own health insurance plan.""

Duncan also said the Trump-backed spending bill that was signed into law last month will leave Medicaid funding ""in shambles,"" as it cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from the government program. He also criticized the measure for its cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps, and its impact on ensuring children do not go hungry at school.

Duncan pointed to polls showing support for gun control measures such as universal background checks and red-flag laws.

He also criticized the Trump administration's mass deportation immigration policies that he said ""have turned into a lesson on how not to love your neighbor."" He said that immigration policy should focus on securing the border, deporting those in the country illegally who have committed felonies, but that a path to citizenship should be created for other migrants in the U.S. 

Duncan's party switch comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the party earlier this year over alleged disloyalty. The party's resolution cited his endorsement of Biden in the 2024 presidential election and, once he dropped out, his endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as alleged efforts to undermine and sabotage some Republican candidates, including current Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and failed 2022 Senate candidate Herschel Walker. 

The former Republican also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in support of Harris.

Duncan has been a fierce critic of Trump and the Republican Party in recent years, particularly since the president's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

""The list of reasons why I'm now a Democrat continues to grow,"" Duncan wrote. ""Most importantly, my decision puts me in the best possible position each day to love my neighbor.""

New Zealand's air force carried out a nearly 20-hour medical evacuation to rescue three Americans from Antarctica, calling it a high-risk mission conducted in freezing temperatures and total darkness.

The U.S. National Science Foundation requested the evacuation after three staff members at McMurdo Station were unable to receive adequate medical treatment on-site.

One of the individuals required urgent care, while the other two also needed medical attention and were transported as a precaution, according to New Zealand's air force.

Air Commodore Andy Scott, head of New Zealand's air component, said mid-winter flights to Antarctica are among the most difficult missions due to shifting weather, extreme cold and ice landings in total darkness.

""The crew can only attempt the flight after detailed analysis of the weather and airfield state,"" Scott said. ""The United States Antarctic Program Winter Team must physically create the runway before we can depart by ensuring the ice is groomed and suitable for landing.

""Although they determine it is safe, it's still an extremely challenging environment to fly in on Night Vision Goggles due to the extreme weather conditions, which are highly changeable at this time of year and makes accurate forecasting a challenge,"" he added. ""This, coupled with there being no airfields available to divert to once the aircraft is past a certain point south adds to the risk, so these missions are not taken lightly.""

A medical team, including a physician, accompanied the crew to provide in-flight care during the return to Christchurch.

The aircraft was pre-positioned from Auckland to Christchurch on Sunday, with a crew on standby for a weather window.

The crew made the decision on Tuesday to fly to Antarctica, working through the night to complete the mission.

After landing on the ice runway, the aircraft's engines remained running to prevent freezing during refueling, the air force said.

President Donald Trump is calling for the CEO of Intel, a semiconductor manufacturer, to resign after Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) questioned his ties to China.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the company as its chief executive in March of this year.

“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump wrote on social media. “There is no other solution to this problem.”

Intel's shares dropped more than 3% in after-hours trading following Trump's comments.

Cotton sent a letter to Intel's board chairman on Wednesday to “express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security.”

He also accused Tan of controlling “dozens” of Chinese companies and of holding “deep ties to the Chinese Communists.” Cotton noted Intel received the largest grant from the CHIPS and Science Act, nearly $8 billion, and wrote on social media that “companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations.”

He added, “The board of @Intel owes Congress an explanation.”

The competition between the United States and China over semiconductors, critical to artificial intelligence and computer systems, is fierce. Former President Joe Biden placed a 50% tariff on semiconductors near the end of his term in office to encourage domestic production.

Trump said he would place a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors on Wednesday during a meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. “We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” he said.

The president indicated that he won't place tariffs on companies that make semiconductors in the United States.“If you have made a commitment to build or are in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff. If, for some reason, you say you are building and you don't build, we go back and add it up, it accumulates, and we will charge you at a later date. You have to pay,” Trump said.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES 100% TARIFFS ON SEMICONDUCTORS AS APPLE UNVEILS $100 BILLION US INVESTMENT

China and a litany of other countries are top chip sources for the U.S. The U.S. imported more than $60 billion worth of semiconductors in 2024, including $2 billion from China.

Intel is the second-largest manufacturer of semiconductors in the U.S. by revenue, second only to Nvidia. Nvidia is led by Taiwanese-American businessman Jensen Huang. Trump met with Huang on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A group of Republican state lawmakers from Midwestern states filed a complaint over smoke from Canadian wildfires.

Republican state Reps. Austin Harris of Iowa, Elliott Engen of Minnesota, Calvin Callahan of Wisconsin, and state Sen. Clare Cory of North Dakota signed the letter. The Upper Midwest and parts of the Northeast have been experiencing poor air quality conditions for weeks due to smoke from Canadian wildfires.

“Enough is enough. We owe it to our constituents, especially our kids, seniors, and those with respiratory issues, to fight for clean air. If Canada can't get these wildfires under control, they need to face real consequences. We won't sit back while our air becomes a health hazard,” Callahan said.

The letter was sent to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and the International Joint Commission, the latter of which was established to prevent and solve disputes along the border regarding air quality and shared waters.

The lawmakers said they want to solve their dispute through international law. They asked both parties to respond within 30 days. 

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew accused the state Republicans of throwing a “timber tantrum” and playing “political games” with their complaint. He noted that firefighters from the United States have been aiding Canada in firefighting, and that Canadian firefighters were aiding the U.S. when California saw widespread fires earlier this year. 

“These are attention-seekers who can't come up with a good idea on healthcare or on making life more affordable,” Kinew told the Canadian Press. “So they're playing games with something that's very serious.”

He added that he does not “generalize these attention-seekers' misguided words to all Americans.”

FEMA'S FORK IN THE ROAD: ABOLITION OR SEAT AT THE CABINET

There are currently around 737 active fires across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Manitoba has seen the highest amount of fires this season. 

At the federal level in the House, Reps. Elise Stefanik and Nick Langworthy, both New York Republicans, coauthored a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney outlining the impact of smoke in their state. They are asking Canada to increase wildfire prevention resources and have requested more collaboration between the U.S. and Canada on the problem.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Bureaucrats at the National Endowment for the Humanities cut checks to fund various liberal research projects as the Trump administration signaled its intention to cut diversity, equity, and inclusion-related grant spending, a Washington Examiner review of public records has found.

Many of the grant projects that NEH staffers silently funded weren't slated to begin until much later in the Trump administration, suggesting that the payments may have been expedited to avoid looming cancellations.

Among the grants pushed out the door by the NEH were a research project concerning the “LBGTQ+” history of comic books, a text “examining strategies to nurture black self love and joy as empowerment for political struggle,” a “cultural history of Latina feminist writing,” and a book reflecting on how Mayan “human-nature-spirit relations” have been affected by climate change, among many other similarly left-of-center projects.

“One of the problems with DEI is that it can make grants intended to fund cultural initiatives, such as those related to the humanities, look as if the goal is to study, for example, Mayan ethics — which could be a worthwhile endeavor to a historian or philosopher — when the goal is actually to promote an intersectional political agenda and introduce a cultural mandate,” Capital Research Center director of communications Sarah Lee told the Washington Examiner. “The lines can get very blurry. But these NEH grants, pushed out the door before executive orders took effect restricting DEI-based federal funding, and in which NEH had to remove language like ‘promotion of discriminatory equity ideology' from their notices of funding opportunities, certainly look suspiciously politicized.”

Working to appropriate funds swiftly to evade a hostile administration is an established strategy among bureaucrats. The Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden distributed hundreds of billions of dollars in government and private resources before President Donald Trump took office to prevent him from cancelling that funding.

The NEH payments were released between January and March of this year, before the agency announced in late April that it would implement the president's executive order targeting DEI initiatives in the federal grantmaking process.

One project, for instance, involved the NEH paying an anonymous individual $60,000 to produce a book documenting how “LGBTQ+ artists … innovate[d] comics through grassroots forms” by “document[ing] LGBTQ+ life and activism in a moment when the community was facing government neglect of the HIV/AIDS crisis and disregard for their civil liberties.” Through its grant funding, the NEH sought to help the anonymous author “excavate stories of vibrant queer communities to inspire a new generation at a time when LGBTQ+ people face renewed threats.”

While the project wasn't slated to begin until January 2026, federal records show that the NEH disbursed the full $60,000 on Jan. 28, just over a week after Trump took office.

A similar story played out across a number of different NEH grants.

Examples include $60,000 paid out in late February to fund a project on the “cultural history of Latina feminist writing” scheduled to begin in July; an additional $60,000 paid out in March to fund work on “a book examining strategies to nurture black self love and joy as empowerment for political struggle” that was supposed to start in July 2026; $343,197 in March for a grant program to increase racial diversity in the “library preservation profession” slated to begin in September; $25,000 disbursed in February to support work in a book on “interpreting queer history and culture in central Illinois” that was set to begin production in March; and a slate of five-figure grants aimed at promoting “Arab and Muslim cultural awareness” that were paid out a few weeks before the programs associated with them began in April. 

Many of these awards match the description of grants that the NEH said in April it would cease funding in accordance with the president's orders.

“In collaboration with the Administration, NEH has cancelled awards that are at variance with agency priorities, including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (or DEI) and environmental justice, as well as awards that may not inspire public confidence in the use of taxpayer funds,” the agency's April statement reads.

DEI-related grants that the NEH didn't push out prior to implementing the president's orders, however, could still end up being paid out.

On July 28, Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, whom former President Bill Clinton appointed, said that the president's efforts to cut DEI-related NEH grants ran afoul of the First Amendment and ordered funds to be disbursed.    

“The American story simply cannot be told by suppressing all conversation about such matters — including especially conversation about past injustices that some, perhaps many, of us would rather forget,” McMahon wrote. “But for well over two centuries Americans have shown, again and again, that we can take a hard look at ourselves without falling apart.”

Conservative critics have condemned judges for attempting to block the president's spending cuts, characterizing them as unelected magistrates preventing the federal government from delivering on its mandate. Liberals, meanwhile, argue that the president does not have the absolute power to withhold public funds.  

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SPENT NEARLY $400,000 INTERVIEWING TRANSGENDER PEOPLE IN INDIA

“The Supreme Court already ruled that the Trump Administration could terminate federal funds dedicated to DEI,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle told the Washington Examiner. “This is yet another example of the rogue judiciary — radical lower court judges are directly contradicting the rule of law by openly and actively defying the Supreme Court's instructions. The Trump Administration will continue to lawfully abide by the Supreme Court's rulings, will not allow openly unlawful court orders to stand, and looks forward to this court's order being reversed on appeal.”

The NEH did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

George Mason University, Virginia's largest public university, sits less than 20 miles from the District of Columbia, yet its president apparently thinks he can somehow outrun the national vibe shift on the misuse of race. But whatever you may read in the press, Gregory Washington is running out of options.

The Justice and Education departments have each launched two investigations on GMU's use of race in hiring and promotion and on the divisive and often illegal practices known as diversity, equity, and inclusion.

GMU's Board of Visitors is responsive to the state's voters and taxpayers, not to a leftist professoriate predictably circling the wagons around Washington. The board did not fire Washington last week as many expected, but soon enough, it will have to do its duty and vote on whether to remove him.

The inquiries are damning. One by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates two complaints by professors. The first is that GMU has allowed antisemitism to thrive on campus, making Jewish students feel unsafe.

The other Education Department investigation is “based on a complaint filed with OCR by multiple professors at GMU who allege that the university illegally uses race and other immutable characteristics in university policies, including hiring and promotion.”

The DOJ investigations seek to “determine whether it is engaged in discriminatory employment practices based on race and sex,” and “whether the university has denied equal treatment of individuals based on race or national origin, in violation of Title VI.”

Give Washington credit for his adroit use of the faculty, the press, and friendly Democrats in Virginia's legislature and congressional delegation. They have rallied to his cause and given him the Houdini-like abilities to escape accountability that we saw last week — so far.

But Washington's use of politics and PR is being recognized for what it is: a refusal to accept that the nation's mood has changed. Trump was elected in part because voters have had it with the use of race in hiring, promotions, and as a cudgel to change society.

Despite getting by on a reputation for conservatism that it deserves less every day, GMU is not that different from other universities that Trump is trying to reform. Professors at GMU outside of the economic and legal faculties are just as liberal as those at other universities, and their support for Washington is seen as par for the course.

Ditto for the political cover Washington has been able to garner, as valuable as that has been for the moment.

For example, Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), a liberal Democrat, and Tim Kaine (D-VA), a left-wing progressive, rushed to Washington's aid in a July 9 op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, likening Washington's predicament to the recent ousting of Jim Ryan as president of the University of Virginia.

The two senators, both former governors, wrote, “We fear that what happened at UVA is just the beginning. Already, the Trump administration appears to be eyeing its next target: George Mason University President Gregory Washington. The accusations … are eerily similar to those lodged against Ryan.” They said Trump was leading a “calculated campaign … to politicize higher education.”

Warner and Kaine added, sagely, that “decisions about who leads our colleges and universities should rest with their boards — appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state legislature — not with partisan actors in Washington seeking headlines or revenge.”

This was cheeky on several fronts. First, it is the Left that politicized higher education in the first place, when it began to hire only like-minded liberals to populate the faculty lounge and then leveraged that monopoly to indoctrinate students into a leftist worldview.

But it doesn't stop there. The only reason the Board of Visitors likely didn't fire Washington at its meeting last week was that Washington's allies in the Virginia Senate have voted down four board members appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA).

A judge sided with the Democrats, and the four Youngkin appointments are still not off the board, but the matter should be resolved once Youngkin's team takes it to the state's Supreme Court. It could be resolved much earlier if either federal department finds that GMU — that is, Washington — is not compliant with strong antidiscrimination laws.

Not that the board gave Washington a ringing endorsement at its meeting last week, either — far from it. It voted to give him the smallest raise possible and did not verbally support him. It was the same lack of support by the UVA board that convinced Ryan this summer that his gig was up. But Washington wants to wait it out, apparently.

Unfortunately for Washington, the evidence that he uses racial preferences is clear. Just four years ago he wrote, “If you have two candidates who are both ‘above the bar' in terms of requirements for a position, but one adds to your diversity and the other does not, then why couldn't that candidate be better, even if that candidate may not have better credentials than the other candidate?”

And it's not just something he said four years ago. GMU included in a recent student orientation video a land acknowledgment statement, and it referred to America as “Turtle Island,” a term supposedly originating with some Indian tribes that leftists use to legitimize the United States.

LINDA MCMAHON CELEBRATES ‘TRIUMPHS' OVER UNIVERSITIES

Three members of the GMU faculty wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education recently, “Let's be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn't about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. It's about political control — plain and simple.”

They view it that way because they started the takeover of higher education with that mindset. Washington gives them the political control of GMU they want — for the moment. But time is running out.

President Donald Trump asked Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) to call the state legislature in for a special session where they could approve new congressional maps that would redraw district lines in favor of Republicans. That began a partisan back-and-forth, with Democratic states such as California and New York threatening to redraw their maps in favor of Democrats. The process of redistricting is complicated and time-consuming, and not every state that has floated middecade redistricting is legally allowed to do so. This Washington Examiner series, “Power Lines,” will investigate the process, its local implications, and the hurdles the middecade redistricting effort helmed by national political figures will face in court. Part 1 is an in-depth look at how redistricting works in different states. Part 2 investigates why Democrats are disadvantaged in the redistricting battle after the 2010 midterm elections. Part 3 covers the legal considerations of Republicans' efforts to rewrite Texas's map. Part 4 looks at the elected House members caught in the crossfire as the standoff escalates.

The summer of redistricting continues, with more states threatening to redraw their district lines to maximize partisan advantage, and more members of Congress caught in the crossfire.

While the national conversation mostly centers on the political makeup of news maps, adding red seats in one state and blue seats in another, myriad careers could end in the process. Each member of the House of Representatives has roughly 760,000 voters, and all were elected to their posts just nine months ago.

At least 22 representatives have had their seats threatened as first Texas, then California, and now at least 10 states are considering an unusual middecade redistricting process.

The House's partisan makeup has been extremely close during the last two sessions of Congress, with Republicans enjoying a nine-seat advantage in 2023 and 2024 and now an even slimmer seven-seat majority that could easily flip in next year's midterm elections.

President Donald Trump aims to preserve that edge in part through redrawing Texas maps to include five more Republican seats. While the Lone Star State is following his lead, that effort has led Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) to threaten his own redistricting process that would more or less cancel out what's happening in Texas. 

The dominoes have fallen from there, with both parties pointing fingers at the other as the true culprit. Democrats say they must counter Trump's corrupt proposals, while the president says the Left has already maximized its advantage through gerrymandered blue state maps and will continue to do so no matter what course the GOP takes.

But ironically, if California and Texas both get their way, the House makeup as it currently stands could be left unaltered, as both target five opposition party members to draw out of the map. Other states that have floated mid-decade redistricting, with the exception of Ohio, have a smaller likelihood of actually getting a new map approved before the midterm elections.

“Republicans will win the political war in Texas, but escalation is real,” Republican strategist Doug Heye said. “What's to prevent Democrats from drawing out every Republican seat in California? It's like watching Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd continually pulling out larger weapons.”

Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist, had a similar take. 

“I don't think anybody is winning this fight,” Bannon agreed. “First of all, it feels like inside baseball to most Americans. And for the Americans who are actually paying attention, my guess is they see this as more evidence of dysfunction in the political system.”

Nonetheless, the change could be very big for the affected congressmen and congresswomen, and to the millions of voters who elected them, even if the overall map balances out. Below is a state-by-state look at who those people are and what changes could be in store for them.

Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is working hard to redraw maps with five more House Republicans, while Texas Democrats have fled to Illinois for the moment to prevent him from having a quorum.

The Democrats he's targeting are Reps. Greg Casar (D-TX), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Henry Cuellar (D-TX), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Julie Johnson (D-TX), and Marc Veasey (D-TX). 

Five seats will be gained among those six names because the idea is to draw Doggett and Casar into the same district so that only one survives.

That pair makes for an interesting contrast, as the 78-year-old Doggett has been in office since 1995 and is the dean of the Texas congressional delegation, while “Squad” member Casar is 36 years old and the youngest-ever chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

Neither wants to go, and both are fighting their ouster along with other Texas Democrats.

“No matter how they draw these lines, they can't get rid of the people of Austin, they can't get rid of the people of Texas,” Casar said at a rally outside the governor's mansion. “So once we send the Greg Abbotts and the Donald Trumps to the dustbin of history where they belong, we will build a new kind of Democratic Party that gets big money out of politics.”

Cuellar, a longtime House member whose district scrapes the southern border, predicted that the redistricting effort could backfire if Texas draws its districts too narrowly and Democrats have a good year.

“Republicans are taking a big gamble in South Texas. They are looking at Trump numbers,” Cuellar told KGNS News. “If the lines change, I have almost 95% to 97% of the areas I've represented in the past, so those are areas that I've represented before.”

Texas has 25 Republicans, 12 Democrats, and one vacancy. It hopes to reach 30 Republicans and just eight Democrats through a new map.

Though redistricting will be trickier in California thanks to the state's history with an independent redistricting commission, Newsom is nonetheless targeting five seats of his own. He hopes to take the Golden State from 43 Democrats and nine Republicans to 48 Democrats against just four representatives for the GOP.

Reps. Kevin Kiley (R-CA), Darrell Issa (R-CA), David Valado (R-CA), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), and Ken Calvert (R-CA) are the targeted California Republicans.

While no one wants to lose their seat, Kiley has made one of the most interesting appeals, filing a bill to call off the dogs nationwide and ban all mid-decade redistricting.

“I am introducing legislation in Congress to stop Newsom's corrupt scheme to overthrow our Citizens Redistricting Commission and make California a permanent one-party state,” he said in a post on X.

“My bill prohibits congressional districts from being redrawn in the middle of the decade,” Kiley added. “This is already the law in California under our State Constitution, which provides that redistricting is done once a decade by an Independent Commission.”

But Kiley's bill would also kill the Texas redistricting scheme and require a level of bipartisanship rarely seen in the halls of Congress.

Assuming that doesn't happen, Bannon, the Democratic strategist, hopes that Newsom moves forward regardless.

“I think that Newsom should go ahead and redistrict California regardless of what happens in Texas,” he said.

Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) is another big-state governor who has entered the redistricting fray, though, like California, it will not be an easy process in her state. Doing so would take multiple steps and cannot be completed in time for the 2026 midterm elections.

Nonetheless, Hochul has pledged to squeeze new sets out of her state's map at some point, to increase the Democratic advantage from 19-7 to 22-4.

“We are at war,” Hochul said. “And that's why the gloves are off, and I say, ‘Bring it on.' This will have implications not just in Texas, but for our entire nation and its future.”

One wrinkle in the New York case is that it appears unclear exactly which three GOP-held seats would be affected. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), who holds a closely drawn seat in the suburbs of New York City, is one name that has been thrown around so far.

But another high-profile New York Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), isn't waiting to hear names before slamming Hochul over the effort.

“Kathy Hochul's pathetic press conference today shows she continues to put New Yorkers LAST, and she truly earns the title of the Worst Governor in America,” Stefanik said in a statement. “In her own words, Kathy Hochul is hell bent on angrily spiting the New York State Constitution, the will of New York voters, good government groups, and the courts by dismantling fair and legal district lines.”

The number of seats at stake falls with the size of the state in question. Ohio has 10 Republicans and five Democrats in its congressional delegation at the moment, but could go to 12-3 with a new map. Ohio and Texas are further along in the process than most states because of their unique redistricting systems.

Reps. Mary Kaptur (D-OH) in the northwestern part of the state and Emilia Sykes (D-OH) in the Akron area are the two Democrats who could face the axe.

Both have come out swinging against the idea. 

“It is no surprise national and state Republicans in Columbus are scheming to confuse and handpick voters by gerrymandering Ohio congressional districts again,” Kaptur's political director, David Zavac, said, according to Punchbowl News.

Sykes spokesman Justin Barasky told the same outlet that “special interests” in Washington and Columbus want to “ignore the voters and rig the game.”

Vice President JD Vance, formerly an Ohio senator, is visiting nearby Indiana, according to Gov. Mike Braun (R-IN), and a reported topic of conversation is redistricting in the Hoosier State.

Already a reliably red state, Indiana has a 7-2 Republican majority in its House delegation. The aim appears to be making it 8-1, with Rep. Frank Mrvan (D-IN) the odd man out. 

Mrvan has released a statement saying that “any attempt to redistrict now is simply an attempt to silence” the voters who elected him.

Like Indiana, Missouri is hoping to snag a single seat through a new map, forcing out Kansas City-area Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) to take the state from 6-2 Republican to 7-1 Republican. 

Efforts to reach Cleaver were unsuccessful, but he told local news station KBIA, “Someone over at the White House is seemingly committed to fomenting what I call national nastiness as a way of establishing a one-party rule in our country. … And I think it is very dangerous.”

Back in blue-state territory, Maryland is considering removing its only Republican in Congress, Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), who represents the Eastern Shore.

Harris has held the seat since 2011, and his district is rated a solid R+8 by the Cook Partisan Voting Index. Nonetheless, Democrats in the Old Line State believe they can carve it up with portions of heavily left-leaning districts nearby to force Harris out and make Maryland 8-0 in the House. 

Other states reported to be in the mix include Alabama and Florida, the latter of which could target five new GOP-held seats.

The ever-expanding push is likely to continue drawing claims of corruption and hypocrisy from both sides, and redrawn maps can create headaches both for voters hoping to contact their local representative and even for the elected officials who don't stand to lose their seats as they adjust to a new electorate with new local issues.

Dean Cain used to protect innocent people from villains as the comic book hero Superman, but now he will do so as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Cain, who portrayed the superhero in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, announced in a video on his social media accounts that he had joined the federal agency.

“For those who don't know, I am a sworn law enforcement officer, as well as being a filmmaker,” Cain said. “I felt it was important to join with our first responders to help secure the safety of all Americans, not just talk about it.”

The video clip was 92 seconds long and essentially a recruitment ad to join ICE. Cain mentioned some of the benefits associated with the job and the actions ICE was taking to make communities safer, including the arrest of “hundreds of thousands of criminals, including terrorists, rapists, murderers, pedophiles, MS-13 gang members, and drug traffickers.” He also highlighted some of the job's perks, including a $50,000 signing bonus and student loan repayment. 

“So, if you want to help save America, ICE is arresting the worst of the worst and removing them from America's streets. I like that. I voted for that,” Cain said. “They need your help. We need your help, to protect our homeland and our families.”

Cain's announcement that he had joined ICE comes as the agency has received widespread scrutiny from Democrats for enforcing the Trump administration's illegal immigration efforts.

The uncomfortable fact about its historic run is that no one is sure why it's happening—or what could bring it to an end.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Can anything stop the stock market? The U.S. economy recently weathered the worst pandemic in 100 years, the worst inflation in 40 years, and the highest interest rates in 20 years. Yet from 2019 through 2024, the S&P 500 grew by an average of nearly 20 percent a year, about double its historical average rate. Despite President Donald Trump's erratic economic policies, which include the highest tariffs since the 19th century, the market is already up by about 8 percent in 2025.

As the stock market soars ever higher, the theories of why it rises have suffered the opposite fate. One by one, every favored explanation of what could be going on has been undermined by world events. The uncomfortable fact about the historic stock-market run is that no one really knows why it's happening—or what could bring it to an end.

According to textbook economics, the stock market's value reflects what are known as “fundamentals.” An individual company's current stock price is derived from that firm's future-earnings potential, and is thus rooted in hard indicators such as profits and market share. The value of the market as a whole, in turn, tends to rise and fall with the state of the broader economy. According to the fundamentals theory, the market can experience the occasional speculative bubble, but reality will bite soon enough. Investors will inevitably realize that their stocks are overvalued and respond by selling them, lowering prices back to a level that tracks more closely with the value justified by their fundamentals—hence the term market correction.

The fundamentals story held up well until the 2008 financial crisis. Within six months of the U.S. banking system's collapse, the market fell by 46 percent. In response, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to almost zero and pushed money back into the economy by purchasing trillions of dollars in securities from financial institutions.

The Fed's goal was to get the economy going again quickly. This didn't happen. For most of the 2010s, corporate earnings were modest, GDP and productivity growth were low, and the labor market remained weaker than it had been before the crisis. In other words, the fundamentals were not great. Yet the stock market soared. From 2010 to 2019, it tripled in value.

Rogé Karma: The Federal Reserve's little secret

This gave rise to what became known as the “liquidity” theory of the market. In this telling, the force driving the ups and downs of markets was the Federal Reserve. As long as the central bank was willing to keep flooding the financial system with cash, that money would eventually find its way into the stock market, causing valuations to rise regardless of what was happening in the real economy.

The apotheosis of the liquidity theory came in early 2020: The stock market crashed when the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the Fed once again responded by turning on the money taps. By mid-summer, unemployment was still above 10 percent, but the stock market had already rebounded past its pre-pandemic peak.

But the liquidity theory's run was short-lived. In 2022, as inflation replaced unemployment as the economy's biggest problem, the central bank reversed course, quickly raising interest rates and selling its securities. As the liquidity theory would predict, the stock market took a nosedive, falling by close to 20 percent. Then something strange happened. The Fed continued to raise interest rates over the course of 2023, to their highest levels in two decades, and kept them there in 2024. It also drained about $2 trillion of liquidity from the financial system. Yet the market took off once again. The S&P 500 rose by nearly 25 percent in both 2023 and 2024, making it the market's best two-year run of the 21st century. “Between 2008 and 2022, the view on Wall Street was we were experiencing a liquidity-driven market,” Mohamed El-Erian, an economist and the former CEO of the asset-management firm PIMCO, told me. “That wasn't at all the case in '23 and '24.”

The stock market's performance in those years was unusual for another reason. More than half of the S&P 500's total growth in 2023 and 2024 was driven by the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia. During those two years alone, Tesla's value rose by 286 percent, Meta's by 355 percent, and Nvidia's by 861 percent. The biggest firms have always been responsible for a disproportionate share of the market's growth, but never had the gains been so acutely concentrated. The phenomenon couldn't be explained solely by superior business performance; the Magnificent Seven's stock prices had begun to exceed earnings by record amounts, implying that their valuations had more to do with expectations about future growth.

This gave rise to a new theory: The stock market was being supercharged by the coming AI revolution—or, at least, by belief in it. The Magnificent Seven's extreme surge began in early 2023, shortly after the release of ChatGPT, which kicked off a wave of interest and investment in the AI sector. The seven companies seem especially well positioned to prosper from the emerging technology, either because they provide crucial inputs to the development of AI models (Nvidia), are investing heavily in building their own models (Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet), or stand to benefit significantly from automation (Amazon, Tesla, Apple).

To some experts, the situation has all the markings of a speculative bubble. In a recent blog post, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at the asset-management firm Apollo, pointed out that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued—meaning their stock prices exceed their earnings by larger factors—than the top 10 companies at the height of the 1990s dot-com bubble were.

Take Nvidia, the chipmaker that recently became the first company in history to hit a $4 trillion valuation. Historically, the average price-to-earnings ratio for a company in the U.S. market has been about 18 to 1, which means that to buy a share of stock, investors are willing to pay $18 for every $1 of the company's yearly earnings. Nvidia's current price-to-earnings ratio is 57 to 1.

AI boosters argue that these valuations are justified by the technology's transformative potential; skeptics respond that the technology is far from being adopted at scale and, even if it eventually is, that there's no guarantee that these seven specific companies will be the ones to rake in the profits. “We've seen this story play out before,” Jim Bianco, an investment analyst, told me, pointing to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. “Just because there's a truly revolutionary technology doesn't mean stocks are correctly pricing in that reality.”

If the current market froth is indeed an AI bubble, then a day must come when the bubble bursts. For a moment, that day appeared to have arrived on April 2, when Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Over the next week, the stock market fell by 12 percent, and the Magnificent Seven took even steeper hits.

But then, on April 9, Trump backed down from his most extreme tariff proposals and, a few weeks after that, de-escalated what seemed like an imminent trade war with China. The market swiftly recovered and launched into a bonanza even wilder than those of the previous two years. The S&P 500 has risen nearly 30 percent since its post–Liberation Day low, setting all-time records, and the Magnificent Seven have come roaring back. This gave rise to the concept of the “TACO trade,” as in “Trump always chickens out.” The idea is that Trump hates falling stock prices and will back off from any proposal that puts the market in jeopardy. So rather than sell their stocks every time the president threatens to impose crippling trade restrictions, investors should continue to pour money into the market, confident that the proposals Trump ultimately leaves in place won't do much damage.

The flaw in the TACO theory is that Trump hasn't completely chickened out. Tariffs are the highest they've been in more than a century, and the president is announcing new ones all the time. Still, the market appears largely unfazed. When Trump announced “trade deals” with the European Union and Japan that set the tariff on most goods arriving from those places at 15 percent, the stock market actually rose. Even last week, when the president announced a sweeping new set of global tariffs—an announcement immediately followed by a brutal jobs report suggesting that tariffs were weakening the economy—the market suffered only a blip. As of this writing, it is higher than it was before the announcement.

This leaves a final theory, one that has nothing to do with Trump, AI, or the Federal Reserve.

Thirty years ago, almost all of the money in the U.S. mutual-fund market was actively managed. Retirees or pension funds handed over their savings to brokers who invested that money in specific stocks, trying to beat the market on behalf of their clients. But thanks to a series of regulatory changes in the late 2000s and early 2010s, about half of fund assets are now held in “passive funds.” Most retirees hand their savings over to companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, which automatically invest the money in a predetermined bundle of stocks for much lower fees than active managers would charge. The most common type of passive fund purchases a tiny share of every single stock in an index, such as the S&P 500, proportional to its size.

Annie Lowrey: Could index funds be “worse than Marxism”?

Some experts believe that this shift is the best explanation for the otherwise inexplicably resilient performance of the stock market. “The move to passive funds is a radical shift in the structure of financial markets,” Mike Green, the chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, told me. “To think that wouldn't dramatically impact how those markets behave is just silly.”

Active investors are highly sensitive to company fundamentals and broader economic conditions. They pore over earnings reports, scrutinize company finances, and analyze market trends, and will often sell at the first sign of an economic downturn or poor company performance, which causes markets to “correct.” Passive investors, on the other hand, typically just pick a fund or two when they set up their retirement accounts and then forget about them, meaning they are automatically buying stocks (and rarely selling), no matter what. In June 2020, for example, Vanguard released a statement bragging that fewer than 1 percent of its 401(k) clients had tried to sell any of their equities from January to the end of April, even as the economy was melting down.

Thus, whereas a market dominated by active investors tends to be characterized by “mean reversion”—in which high valuations are followed by a correction—a market dominated by passive investors is instead characterized by “mean expansion,” in which high valuations are followed by even higher valuations. “When there's a constant flow of passive money coming in, betting against the market is like standing in front of a steamroller,” Green said. “You'd be crazy to do it.”

A market dominated by passive investors also naturally becomes more concentrated. Active investors tend to avoid larger stocks that they believe might be overvalued, but the opposite is true for passive investors. Because they allocate funds based on the existing size of companies, they end up buying a disproportionate share of the biggest stocks, causing the value of those stocks to rise even more, and so on.

The explosion of passive funds over the past 15 years could explain why the market has become less sensitive to real-world downturns, more likely to keep going up no matter what, and dominated by a handful of giant companies. Or that theory could end up being disproved by unforeseen events. It wouldn't be the first.

How can you prove the absence of a secret file?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Jeffrey Epstein's “client list” is the conspiracy theory that may never die. A secret document detailing all of the elite clients that Epstein allegedly sex-trafficked minors to—it's something of a grail for QAnon adherents, TMZ watchers, and serious news readers alike. There is no proof that such a thing exists.



Yet President Donald Trump himself suggested that it did during his campaign, and pledged to release it before a disastrous backtrack from the Department of Justice last month. Now, in a poll released Monday, nearly two-thirds of Americans said they believe that the Trump administration is hiding something, and 71 percent said they still believe that the list is real. Meanwhile, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has demanded that the list be released, Democrats are pushing the narrative that the Trump administration is orchestrating a cover-up, and yesterday the House subpoenaed the DOJ for additional files related to the case.



To be clear, many unanswered and valid questions remain about Epstein. Before his death, he was charged with trafficking and abusing, as it read in the indictment, “a vast network” of dozens of underage girls. Many still wonder why he was permitted to carry on with his crimes for so long, whether other people who were complicit in them have escaped justice, and how much President Trump may have known while the two were friends. Trump's name reportedly appears in files that have been redacted by the FBI, though he has repeatedly denied personal knowledge of Epstein's crimes and says their relationship ended in 2004.

David A. Graham: Donald Trump doesn't want you to read this article

The specific idea of a client list, though, has taken on a life of its own. No one can demonstrate that the list doesn't exist, so people will continue to insist that it does—that it is being kept from them. There's a certain logic to their belief, because a similar document has been seen already. In 2015, Gawker published Epstein's address book, which was full of names of celebrities and politicians. He apparently kept meticulous records and liked putting all of his famous contacts together in one place. And so the idea of a client list feels plausible to many people because they've had a mental image of it for 10 years now.



Moreover, Trump has created a “where there's smoke there's fire” effect in the past several weeks. The president has vacillated among suggesting that he has no obligation to talk about Epstein, speculating that political foes may have fabricated parts of the Epstein file, attempting to placate his supporters by ordering the release of grand-jury testimony about the case (which cannot be unsealed, a federal judge ruled), and deflecting (“you ought to be talking about Bill Clinton”).



There's a useful parallel between the government's handling of the Epstein case and its investigation into the John F. Kennedy assassination. That assassination, of course, launched a million conspiracy theories: Most Americans still believe that the shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not act alone. One theory holds that the CIA was somehow involved, which has led people to search for hidden evidence within the government's own records—much as we've seen with the Epstein case.



In 1967, Jim Garrison, the district attorney of New Orleans, ended up going down this road. He was re-investigating the case after receiving tips that Oswald, a New Orleans native, had worked with locals in a plot to kill the president. Long and complicated story short, Garrison would eventually subpoena CIA Director Richard Helms, demanding that he produce a photograph that purportedly showed Oswald with a CIA officer in Mexico City in 1963—cementing a link between the killer and the intelligence agency.



There was only a slim reason to think such a photo might exist. Garrison was extrapolating from an existing controversy over a photo that the CIA had provided to the Warren Commission years before. That photo showed an unknown man in Mexico City; it was labeled as a photo of Oswald but was clearly not him. Garrison's theory was that there had been a swap. “It's perfectly clear that the actual picture of Oswald and his companion was suppressed and a fake photo substituted,” he said. The government had no way to prove that he was wrong—to prove that there was no such photo. Garrison took his accusations all the way to a highly publicized trial in 1969. His theory of the case fell apart in court for unrelated reasons, but his many notions linger to this day. (He is the hero of the 1991 blockbuster film JFK.)



The Kennedy assassination still features many unknowns, and information is still being released about it in drips and drabs—previewing, perhaps, the future of disclosure around the Epstein case. Last month, the CIA released assassination files that researchers had been requesting for more than 20 years. They pertained to a specific CIA officer who some think may have known or worked with Oswald in New Orleans. In the 1970s, the same CIA officer was assigned to work with the House Select Committee on Assassinations and help them in their re-investigation of Kennedy's death. He was using a different name by then, and the committee did not know it was the same person. He blatantly deceived Congress and actually thwarted their efforts to understand whatever had happened in New Orleans. The latest batch of files still didn't reveal a direct connection between this officer and Oswald, but that hasn't put the issue to bed.

Read: Conspiracy theorists are turning on the president

That the CIA maintained its secrecy around the officer for decades is what has made curiosity linger. The historian Gerald Posner was one of the public figures (along with the novelist Don DeLillo and the writer Norman Mailer) who'd signed an open letter asking for the release of these files back in 2003, a decade after he wrote a definitive book affirming the theory that Oswald acted alone. He recently told me that he's disgusted with the CIA for taking so long to provide them—not because he thinks they shed new light on the Kennedy assassination but for just the opposite reason. He thinks they really don't, but that hiding them encourages people to speculate ever more darkly. The CIA drags its feet, and when the documents are finally released, they usually have “nothing to do with the assassination,” Posner said. “But it's often too late to explain that.”



This dynamic—in which defensiveness and reflexive secrecy lead to prolonged struggles over information that may or may not be important—has been a recurring problem throughout modern U.S. history. In her 2008 book, Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War 1 to 9/11, the historian Kathryn Olmsted argues that selective opacity is one of the key reasons that Americans distrust their government. The passage of the Freedom of Information Act in 1966 democratized access to information, she argues, yet also left citizens baffled and frustrated when documents were refused to them or granted only with heavy redactions. The government's “ambivalence” about providing information “sometimes had the effect of frightening citizens rather than reassuring them,” Olmsted writes.



There are good reasons that not all of the Epstein files can be released—chief among them, the privacy of victims—but Americans are not wrong to think the government is being less transparent than it could be. The administration could release more than it has, which Congress is currently pressuring it to do. Within that context, why would people believe Trump or the FBI when they say that a client list doesn't exist? I posed this question to Mark Fenster, a professor at the University of Florida's law school who often writes about government transparency and conspiracy theories. Can you ever convince people that there is no list? “No, you can't,” he said. “You can't convince people that all of the pertinent JFK-assassination documents have been released. You can't convince people who believe otherwise that all the truth is out on Jeffrey Epstein.” (Especially because it currently isn't.) “That's just a flat no,” he went on. “Rarely do I say flat nos, but that's just a flat no.”



Like the Epstein case, Kennedy-assassination skepticism demonstrates two opposing impulses. The first, to speculate wildly. The second, to doggedly pursue more and better information, sometimes so stubbornly that it approaches irrationality in itself. These past few weeks have also brought to mind the Kennedy researcher Harold Weisberg, whose early books were a countercultural phenomenon and who was known for his diligent, insistent filling of FOIA requests. He wanted a specific report that he thought must exist about the spectrographic testing used on the Dallas crime-scene bullets; he was told that the FBI had looked for such a report and couldn't find anything. He appealed four times before the D.C. Circuit ruled in 1983 that he had to stop. The decision stated that if an agency could prove it had conducted a thorough search for the requested material, it did not also have to prove the negative—that the material never existed or had previously been destroyed. Yet, of course, the court couldn't compel him to stop wondering.



Nobody can make Americans stop wondering about a “client list” either. It can't stay on the front page indefinitely, but people won't forget about it. Epstein will become part of the American cultural backdrop, like Hunter Biden's computer, 9/11 trutherism, Kennedy, chemtrails, Roswell, and QAnon. At certain times, such conspiratorial thinking and refusal to accept the evidence will become dangerous—people will spin up fantasies that result in acts of defamation or threats of violence. At other times, it will just be part of the daily chatter.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

When the greatest musicians of the 1970s needed an instrument—or a friend—my dad was there.

Listen to more stories on hark

In August 2000, when I was 2 years old, my mother put me in a maroon velvet dress and stuck foam earplugs in my ears. She carried me through the backstage corridors of the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium—the same venue where, in 1964, James Brown gave one of the most ecstatic performances of his career. It's where, in 1972, George Carlin first listed the “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.”

My mother remembers the night in flashes. David Crosby—walrus mustache, smiling eyes—telling jokes. Bonnie Raitt's aura of red hair. In the distance, the sound of Linda Ronstadt warming up. Sitting in a dressing room with Michael McKean and Christopher Guest, already in costume as Spinal Tap's front men.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

That night, the auditorium was hosting the Friends of Fred Walecki benefit concert. These friends included Crosby, Raitt, and Ronstadt. Also Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Emmylou Harris, and Warren Zevon. Three of the four original Eagles, who in this room in 1973 had performed their new album, Desperado, were there too.

One of the Eagles, Bernie Leadon, had helped put the event together. He had known Fred Walecki, my father, since they were teenagers, when Leadon started coming into Westwood Music, Dad's musical-instrument shop in Los Angeles.

Dad had recently been diagnosed with Stage 4 throat cancer and had undergone a complete laryngectomy. Surgeons removed his vocal cords and created a hole in his throat that he used to breathe; to speak, he pressed an electronic buzzer against the side of his neck. If people gawked at him, he'd joke that everyone on his home planet sounded like this.

When Leadon had learned that my father was sick, he called Glyn Johns, another of Dad's close friends and a groomsman at my parents' wedding. Johns is the English sound engineer and producer who worked with pretty much every major rock band of the '60s and '70s—the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Eagles. He and Leadon suspected that my family was struggling to pay Dad's medical bills, so they contacted his other friends and asked if they'd play a benefit concert for him. Everyone said yes. Dad's classmate from Emerson Junior High School, Jeff Bridges, who'd recently starred as “The Dude” in The Big Lebowski, would be the evening's emcee.

I wish I had been old enough to remember this night of thank-yous to my father. He was 51 when I was born; I've only known Dad with gray hair, and I have no memory of his original voice. But Browne remembers my father's impeccable Jimmy Stewart impersonations; he remembers Dad as the guy who turned him on to Gibson guitars. At the concert, he performed “My Opening Farewell” on a guitar that had been assembled at Westwood Music. Dad had spent hours polishing it to give it the rich hue Browne wanted.

Crosby thought of my dad as his “guitar guru,” and like many of the performers that night, he praised my father for his friendship. “Fred's helped a lot of people when they really needed it. Really needed it,” he said. He and Nash then played their song “Déjà Vu.”

Nancy Walecki: The house where 28,000 records burned

Before the night could get too sentimental, Spinal Tap—who claimed that Dad had been the first person in the music business to ask them, Do you have to play so goddamn loud?—took the stage and gave an enthusiastic rendition of “Big Bottom.” I'm told I fell asleep sometime before the Byrds reunited.

After the concert, Rolling Stone declared that Fred Walecki had been “responsible for a night of music history,” even though his name “might not mean much, if anything at all, to music fans.” But my father has been there since the 1960s—doing his work so that some of America's greatest artists can do theirs.

Dad never wanted to go into the family business, and his father, Hermann, didn't want him to either. Hermann opened Westwood Music, a classical-instrument shop, in 1947, the year after Dad was born. But even as he taught my father to apply thin layers of shellac to wooden instruments until they were as reflective as still water, he'd say, This life is too small for you.

Maybe because no Walecki before him had lived a small life. Dad's grandfather had been a cabinetmaker by day and a socialist revolutionary by night. His opera-singer aunt was the buxom blonde on The Three Stooges, and his sister, Christine—known as the Goddess of the Cello—was the first American musician to hold a concert in Castro's Cuba. Dad's brother, the only family member who wasn't in the music industry, was one of the engineers behind the fastest jet-propelled aircraft in the world. Then there was Hermann, who spoke five languages, had a photographic memory, and was a world-renowned expert on and dealer of rare classical string instruments. As a young man, he'd trained to be a priest before getting recruited to play hockey for the Chicago Blackhawks.

But as I would half a century later, Dad grew up in Westwood Music. He loved it as I would; he memorized its smell of old wood and lacquer. When customers came in to have their violin bows rehaired, they'd sit beside Hermann and confess their problems while he worked. Hermann, still a devout Catholic who prayed on his knees every night, would listen, nod, and occasionally offer spiritual advice. The Walecki tract home nearby was decorated with harps and baroque instruments, and served as an artist's salon of sorts: For a summer, the harpist Marcel Grandjany gave master classes in the living room and slept in the extra twin bed in Dad's room. When my father was born, his parents received a year-long diaper service as a gift from their friend Harpo—whom Hermann knew more as a harp player than a Marx Brother.

Dad started working on Westwood Music's sales floor in grade school. Once, he bragged to his father that he'd persuaded a man to buy more expensive strings than his cheap guitar required. Hermann made Dad chase the guy to his bus stop with his change and the strings he actually needed and could afford. When Dad was 12, he ran the shop while his parents traveled to Europe to find rare instruments. Sold $123 worth today, he reported in a letter to his parents, and added that he'd previously sold a piano, nine flutes, and a $350 drum set, and talked a guitar student into buying a banjo and learning that, too. As a teenager, he started a guitar-polish business, mixing his concoction in the garage with an eggbeater and a coffee percolator from Goodwill.

Westwood Music back then was a blend of old-world craftsman's studio and museum. By the front door: a grandfather clock built by Hermann's woodworker father. On the sales floor: trumpets displayed in antique jewelry cases, fine violins in velvet-lined cubbies. On the wall: violas da gamba (baroque cousin of the cello), violas d'amore (baroque cousin of the violin), an oil painting of Christine playing the cello as a child, a rare oud constructed when Istanbul was still Constantinople. And in a frame above the sales counter was one of Hermann's favorite quotes, attributed to Goethe:

The store was the complete opposite of Ledbetter's, the folk club that opened next door in the 1960s. Its idea of decor was putting a vintage Dodge truck on the roof. On its stage, against a brick wall, the then-unknown Steve Martin did his banjo-and-comedy routine and Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. gave one of his first performances in L.A. It was the owner of Ledbetter's who suggested that Deutschendorf needed a stage name, which is how he became John Denver.

Chris Hillman, later of the Byrds, bought mandolin strings from Hermann when he was playing in what he described to me as a “horrible faux bluegrass band” for $100 a week at Ledbetter's. Sixteen-year-old Bernie Leadon was in town to see Hillman rehearse when he spotted a National Tricone guitar in the window of Westwood Music. (These guitars, which have bodies made of metal, look like they belong to very hip aliens, but are a favorite of blues musicians.) My dad, also a teenager, was behind the counter, and Leadon thought he looked like a total prep: oxford shirt buttoned at the cuffs, dress slacks, penny loafers, brown hair neatly coifed. Leadon didn't buy the guitar (he couldn't afford it), but Westwood Music had made an impression.

Dad wanted to welcome the Ledbetter's crowd drifting in and told Hermann that folk and rock were going to be big. But Hermann was hesitant about adding “that element,” as he called it, to the store while still accommodating violin buyers with white hair and season tickets to the symphony. He allowed Dad the National Tricone and some acoustic and electric guitars if he mostly tucked them away in a little-used music-lesson room. Dad paid Hermann rent for the space and furnished his mini guitar salon with an antique clock and table so that, he told me, “it looked kind of groovy.”

Dad ran Westwood Music alongside his father, with no designs to take it over. But then Hermann got lung cancer. Soon, suppliers were calling, asking why Westwood Music was so late on payment. Eighteen-year-old Dad told them that Hermann was on an extended trip to Europe. He ran the shop solo, and at night, he repaired instruments for extra money. He'd take cash straight out of the register to pay his father's home nurses. The cancer spread to Hermann's brain, and he died in 1967, when Dad was 20. Westwood Music was now his to run alone.

When he'd open the shop in the morning, Dad had no trouble with the lock at the top of the door. But when he'd bend down to undo the latch at the bottom, he'd get hit with a wave of nausea. The neon sign above the door still said Westwood Musical Instruments—Hermann Walecki, but the decal on the window now read Hermann Walecki & Son. He asked himself, How do you take your father's place? 

One day, a tour bus pulled up in front of the store and out walked the country singer Merle Haggard. He was a real-life outlaw who'd done time in San Quentin and a leader of the “Bakersfield Sound,” gritty country-western music that sounded nothing like the overproduced schmaltz Nashville was selling in the '60s. “I'm here to get a really good violin,” he said. Dad took him to Hermann's safe and brought out a centuries-old Carlo Antonio Testore. “Can you put steel strings on that?” Haggard asked. Hermann would have thought the request blasphemous, but Dad obliged. The violin went for $16,000; this one sale would cover much of the family's remaining medical debt. Haggard was fiddling on the new strings when Marian, Dad's mother, who'd taken over as the store's bookkeeper, walked by.

“It sounds like that violin has steel strings on it,” she said. An accomplished classical violinist and wool-skirt woman of the old school, she was scandalized. But then Dad told her that Haggard was going to buy it. “It sounds marvelous,” she said.

Every time he sold one of his father's violins, Dad would reinvest in new inventory—handmade guitars by the Spanish luthier José Ramírez; Traynor amps imported from Canada; and, for musicians who wanted their own sound system, Lamb Laboratories mixing boards from England (because Dad found that if he adjusted the board's settings just right, it could “get you a really good Rolling Stones sound live”). Martin guitars, a favorite of folk musicians, had only a handful of authorized retailers in Los Angeles; Dad was one of them. As musicians started traveling more and more by plane, he found a man named Mark Leaf, who built fiberglass guitar cases on his kitchen table in Virginia. Dad told Leadon that a guitar in that case could fall onto an airplane tarmac without a scratch. (Leadon later learned this to be true.)

Dad would stock anything that delighted him—folk, rock, or otherwise. Dolmetsch, a company in England, made “the ultimate baroque recorders,” in his opinion, so he carried a full line of them. “If another music store sold it, then forget it, you know? But if it was the best and the coolest, then I would get it,” he said. He remembers a young guy dressed in jeans and a suit jacket coming into the shop one day and trying out the recorders. He'd take one out of the display case, play it, then slip it in his suit-jacket pocket before returning it. Again and again: out of the case, in the pocket, back in the case.

“Hey, man,” Dad said, and asked what the guy was doing.

“I wanted to see how comfortable it is, because I want to use it as a little traveling instrument,” Jackson Browne replied.

I met Browne at his recording studio in Los Angeles last summer. One of the first things he said to me was “You're tall!” The last time we'd seen each other, I was 3 feet and still struggling to pronounce my r's. He showed me his studio of vintage recording equipment and the ailing sunflower seedlings he was trying to grow on the windowsill for his grandson. “You are going to come back,” he told the slouching shoots. “Sorry I let this happen again.” We sat at a table in the studio's kitchen while he made us a pot of coffee.

Browne has no idea what his younger self wanted to do with that recorder. “That was pretty harebrained,” he said. “I didn't really learn to play recorder at all.” But back then, music was “the coin of the realm. The songs you could play or what you could do on a guitar was a kind of introduction to people and friends.” At little clubs like Ledbetter's, musicians could listen to one another and ask, How do you do that?

All of them were so young. Browne was only 18 when he wrote “A Child in These Hills.” Linda Ronstadt was the same age when she moved from Tucson, Arizona, to Los Angeles. Crosby and Hillman were in their early 20s when, in 1965, the Byrds essentially launched the folk-rock genre with their cover of “Mr. Tambourine Man.” By 1970, Hillman and Leadon had fused country and rock together in the Flying Burrito Brothers. (Their pedal-steel player used Jimi Hendrix–esque fuzz distortion and was also an animator for The Gumby Show. His name was Sneaky Pete.)

Dad's store had become part of a scene that was reshaping American popular music. But Dad was still trying to run a shop suitable for his father's remaining violin clientele. Leadon took him aside. “Fred, you don't need to dress like that, wearing a tie and white shirt and slacks,” he said. “These people that you're dressing for are not the ones that are bringing in money. We are.” So Dad kept his father's old instruments on the wall, his grandfather's clock by the door, and the Goethe quote above the sales counter, but he placed his Martin guitars on stadium bleachers in the front window and started wearing Levi's like the rest of them.

In one of my favorite photographs of my father, he stands behind the counter of Westwood Music. A lute, a violin, and about a dozen guitars hang on the wall behind him, and the counter and cabinets overflow with papers. In his Levi's and Waylon Jennings T-shirt, he is now the king of cool. And then there is his smile—the one I inherited—which takes up half his face. He looks at whoever is on the other side of the counter as though they are the center of his world.

“People would come in and it was boom, that floodgate of stories would open,” Christopher Guest told me. Maybe Dad would launch into the one where he found himself in a Las Vegas greenroom with Elvis and women he took for “ladies of the night,” as he put it; or the time he dropped off a 12-string guitar at a recording session for Crosby, along with some regifted weed from a member of Ricky Nelson's road crew, who'd cautioned that it was “one-hit dope.” The recording engineer called the next day to say they'd all ignored the warning, and when he drove home afterward, he couldn't believe how long it was taking to get to his house, a few neighborhoods over. Then he saw the sign: Welcome to San Diego. Dad would follow customers to their car, just to finish a story.

My father was a competent musician, though never thought about doing it professionally. He learned some songs, including Browne's “My Opening Farewell,” so he could show customers different aspects of a guitar's tone. “He always really liked to show me that he could play it, which I felt very honored by, you know?” Browne said. “And that goes right along with him pulling out a guitar and saying, ‘I have to show you something. Check this out.' And he would show you what invariably would be a phenomenal guitar.”

Check this out : the three-word portal into the Fred Walecki Experience. Check this out, and he'd hand John Entwistle his first-ever Alembic bass, a brand he would go on to use for many years with the Who. Check this out, and he'd pull out a guitar by Mark Whitebook or David Russell Young, luthiers he'd discovered in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, and whose instruments he sold to James Taylor and Gram Parsons. Glyn Johns bought a David Russell Young so he'd have a good acoustic guitar for the rock bands he worked with. (Johns showed me that guitar when I visited him at home last fall; he apologized for all the scratch marks. “Everybody's played this,” he said. “Eric has played it; Jeff Beck's played it; Jimmy Page has played it.”)

Guest does an imitation of my father rummaging around in his shop for the item he needs you to see. Wait, what's this thing? he'll say, as he unearths some treasure. My dad has been doing this for as long as I can remember. It was just over here [Dad lifts up a touring case, printed with B.D., from a Bob Dylan tour]. Maybe it's under [peers behind a platinum record the Eagles gave him for One of These Nights]. I think it's just [moves aside a priceless Spanish guitar by the 19th-century luthier Antonio de Torres Jurado]. Oh, here! The joy for my father is in watching other people check this out. This is why when he looks at me with pure excitement and asks me to try the soup he has made from three different types of Progresso, I accept the spoon from him.

I've tried to get my father to wax poetic about the music that his customers were making in the '60s and '70s. He was there for the birth of what is sometimes called the California Sound, a blend of country, bluegrass, folk, and rock that is utterly distinctive and nearly impossible to categorize. How to contain the Beach Boys and the Byrds, the Doors and the Mamas & the Papas, Bonnie Raitt and Joni Mitchell? Gram Parsons called his own sound Cosmic American Music, and maybe that's a better term for the entire Los Angeles scene. The music, he said, would unite “longhairs, shorthairs, people with overalls, people with their velvet gear on.” Cosmic American Music, at least, captures the movement's spiritual aspirations, while gesturing to the distance between its stars.

Whatever you call it, this music defined an era, and it has stuck around since. On road trips, my friends and I, all under the age of 30, still roll down the windows and blast the Eagles. We act like Joni Mitchell wrote Blue just for us. I've asked my father to explain it to me, to offer a theory for why there, why then. How did so much good music come out of one place?

But he just shrugs. “I'm more of a jazz guy,” he says. This is true. My entire childhood, our car radio was under the tyranny of KJAZZ 88.1. His heroes are Bola Sete, Kenny Burrell, Johnny Smith, and Baden Powell. If I want to talk about the California Sound, he tells me, I should ask his friends who actually made it. So I brought the question to Browne, the bard of '70s Los Angeles. What do you think did it?

“It was the guitars,” he said. “Anybody will tell you it's the instruments.” He smiled and we both laughed. But then Browne stopped himself, considered. “I'm joking when I say it's the guitars. But I'm also serious.”

Each instrument contains unwritten melodies and lyrics, he said. “They have personalities, and they will speak to you with those personalities.” (Dad likes to say that instruments have their own little souls.) Browne said, “Especially for a writer, you'll get to play stuff that will unlock a way of playing, or a song that's in that guitar that you might not write on another.”

Chris Hillman described Westwood Music to me as “the hardware store” of the L.A. music scene. Guest had a more romantic metaphor: Dad, he said, “was like a matchmaker,” a conduit between the human soul and the instrumental one. Where other salesmen might just tell you the price of a guitar, with my father, “it was about going so much further than that and thinking, I'm listening to you play, and it sounds like this might be a good guitar for you.”

When Joe Walsh brought in his Gibson J-200 to sell, Dad called up Emmylou Harris right away. “You need to have this guitar,” she remembers him telling her. It had that warm country sound he knew she'd like. “You play an A chord and it's just like, pwah! ” Harris told me, miming fireworks. J-200s have been her signature guitar ever since. She added, “I sort of became the unofficial Gibson Girl.”

Early in her career, Bonnie Raitt was playing in little clubs and “wasn't even expecting to do this for a living. It was kind of a hobby for me,” she told me. But Dad, she says, “showed me around and showed me the whole world of things that I could have.” He explained how different amplifiers could change her sound, and he took her to a trade show where he introduced her to the genteel, rather ancient chairman of Martin Guitar, C. F. Martin III.

Raitt has a mischievous, bawdy sense of humor. (As a kid, I understood I was never to repeat a Bonnie Raitt joke.) Dad told C. F. Martin that Raitt was a rising star and may be in need of a custom-made guitar. “What I really need is a custom-made IUD,” she said. Martin had no idea what she was talking about, so Dad jumped in: “Uh, it's a lot like a Martin D-35.”

None of this could happen now. Today's musicians don't need Fred Walecki to call them up about a J-200 or broker a deal for a bespoke Martin. Like professional athletes, they have sponsorship deals and can get their equipment for free. But Dad “made it his business to know the latest on every single improvement of every keyboard, every amp, and every guitar,” Raitt said. “It's not something I take for granted. We were all incredibly lucky to have someone on our side that had so much integrity.”

Dad never forgot having to chase down the man he'd upsold on fancy guitar strings; once the store was his, he kept prices reasonable—if anything, he charged too little. Warren Zevon once saw an antique harmonium in Westwood Music and asked Dad how much he wanted for it. “Fifty bucks,” he said. “Or nothing! Take your pick!” Zevon used to call them “Freddie's Zen Prices.”

My father became an angel investor of sorts. When the future Eagle Don Felder first came to L.A., he needed to learn mandolin for an audition, so Dad loaned him one. As Felder writes in his memoir, my father told him to take it “if you have a chance for a job,” and wished him luck. He got the gig. The Eagles landed their first tour before they had the money to buy all the necessary equipment. Dad gave them a charge account.

As usual, I'm staying in the Blue Room, named for its cerulean rug and robin's-egg walls. And as usual, when I come down the staircase, Linda Ronstadt is in her favorite armchair.

Her San Francisco living room feels like the inside of an Impressionist painting: pastel-hued, soft at the edges. It smells of cut flowers and the black tea she prefers to coffee. An icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe keeps watch from the mantel; a painting of her cat wearing a crown overlooks her shelves and shelves of books. Outside in the garden, fog cradles the roses she brought with her from one of her grandfather's ranches in the San Gabriel Valley.

She has known me since I was born, when my parents were still trying to make my double name, Nancy Kathryn, catch on. When I began singing as a child, Linda introduced me to Brian Wilson's harmonies and Maria Callas's vocal placement, and, unbeknownst to me, paid for my lessons. Every time I visit, we talk about books (most recently, Anna Karenina) and boys (I talk, she listens). We watch TV and go to bed early. I'm just Nancy now to most people, but to Linda, I'm still Nancy Kathryn.

She has known my father since the 1960s, when she started coming to his shop as the lead singer in the somewhat bumbling folk-rock group the Stone Poneys. In a feeble attempt to sound like a rock band, they bought electric pickups for their acoustic guitars. Dad, she recalled, “gave us the same attention he gave to the Byrds.”

The two became friends, and whether she was looking for a new guitar or just some company, “he always showed up when he was needed. And he was always needed.” In the late '70s, a powerful storm hit Malibu, washing away the glass-enclosed tearoom attached to Linda's house. Dad arrived with sandbags, quick-dry cement, and a stockpile of Mexican food from Lucy's El Adobe. Years later, he was the one who drove her home to Tucson after her breakup with George Lucas.

When Linda pictures Westwood Music, she thinks of an old line she loves: “Music is a conspiracy to commit beauty.” Someone was always fingerpicking, an electric guitar was always humming—musicians were always conspiring.

People didn't necessarily come to buy something. Westwood Music was a daytime clubhouse of the L.A. scene, Bernie Leadon said. Emmylou Harris called it “the watering hole.”

It “was a place where people saw people, made friendships, made connections, and it was all through your dad,” Harris told me. “He just put out that vibe—that sense of it was always about music, the musicians.”

This was an analog world, a world in which serendipity was still possible. “Sometimes you'd go in and you'd see Jackson or Ry Cooder and all these different people that were hanging out there, and suddenly it would turn into half a day, and you'd go in the back room and you could just sort of sit and jam together,” Leland Sklar, a bass player who has backed artists including Linda, Browne, and James Taylor, told me. Artists would catch up, talk about what they were working on, and then head off to their respective recording sessions, maybe at the Complex or Village Recorders nearby. Cooder, a slide-guitar virtuoso, would bring a six-pack and jam. Joni Mitchell popped by for pizza. Even Neil Young, known as something of a hermit, stopped in.

The store came with a bemused den mother, Marian, known to all as “Mrs. Walecki.” She'd do the store's payroll while musicians in the adjacent guitar room tried out new instruments by playing “Stairway to Heaven.” (It was always “Stairway to Heaven.”) One time, Mick Taylor, the bony, long-haired guitarist for the Rolling Stones, asked Marian where the loo was. That depends, she said, with total sincerity. “Are you a boy or girl?”

Mark Bookin, the store's senior salesman for decades, described Dad as the “master of ceremonies” at each day's gathering. But Dad says he thought of himself more as the store's maître-d'hôtel. Let me sit so-and-so here, near the producer from Asylum Records, he'd think. Or: These two guitar players might sound good together; let me introduce them. He connected Linda and Johns because he thought they might make a good record, and shortly after, they did—We Ran. “Music-store owners don't do that,” Johns told me.

My father and his store, Guest said, “accelerated everything. It made everything better, because it provided a second home and a place where people could feel appreciated, and that's a big thing.” When I asked Dad what time Westwood Music would close at night, he shook his head. It closed when its crowd wandered elsewhere—usually to the Troubadour, a West Hollywood club and the scene's nighttime nexus. Dad remembers leaning against the bar and running through his celebrity impersonations: Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas. “You know, really funny shit,” Browne said. Dad had to get up early the next morning to run a business, while the rest of them slept in. But Ned Doheny, a singer-songwriter and Browne's former musical partner, said, “He was as much a part of that scene as anybody who ever made a record during that period of time.”

By the mid-'70s, “it was all happening,” Dad says. The Eagles and Jackson Browne were playing arenas around the world. Linda would rush home from one string of concerts, dump out the contents of her suitcase, pack for an entirely different climate, and head out on the road again. Dad sold her a portable, battery-powered Pignose amplifier, about the size of a lunch box, that she and her band could use for jamming between gigs. He sent the Beach Boys cases of Ricola cough drops to preserve their voices on tour.

Read: Brian Wilson's world of sound

As his friends' music moved deeper and deeper into rock, Dad phased out his remaining pure-folk inventory—ceding the folkies to a music store he'd been competing with nearby. Not long after, a roadie for the Rolling Stones called and asked Dad if he could come to a Warner Bros. soundstage, where they were recording. Keith Richards wanted a guitar with a B-string bender—a device that musicians put inside their guitars to emulate the sound of a pedal steel. Dad's car was in the shop, so he hopped in his mother's station wagon. When he got there, he mentioned that he was going to see the blues duo Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee at the Ash Grove, and asked if the Stones wanted to come. They piled into Marian's station wagon. When they walked into the club, Dad saw that the other music store had set up a kiosk inside. “And here I come with the Rolling Stones,” Dad says, with that smile that takes up half his face.

How do I describe my father, a man who, if he could, would crawl out of these pages and meet you himself? In my head, he comes with his own theme music—a rollicking kazoo melody with a boogie-woogie bass line. If he finds himself around someone he feels is taking themselves too seriously, he will hover his finger about one inch from their face and singsong, I'm not touching you! until they are disarmed into being nothing but themselves. When faced with adversity, he will say, God's not on a coffee break. And if presenting a plan, work-around, or detour that will inspire the fear of death in his companion but ultimately be a lot of fun: Let me show you a cheatsy way to do that.

Dad was never one to say no to an adventure. Over the years, he went skiing with the band Poco and tuna-fishing with the Doors. Wix Wickens, the keyboardist for Paul McCartney, refused to join my father on his frequent trips to Mexico, because, “it being your dad, jaunts would turn into escapades would turn into incidents.”

It was on one such trip that he met my mother, who was sitting at the next table at a seafood restaurant. She was a Stanford grad and a celebrated Western-style horseback rider who had grown up on a Nevada cattle ranch about 100 miles from the nearest gas station. He was a very loud man wearing a hat that resembled a marlin. It had a fin.

Fred Walecki “incidents” were not necessarily fueled by drugs or debauchery. (Dad told me he smoked weed only between 1977 and 1979. He got it for free from Crosby's dealer.) Instead, his adventures were inspired by what Wickens described as my father's “benign chaos.” Dad's policy: “If it seemed to me that a nice person wouldn't hold it against me, I would do it.”

Jimmy Buffett once called and said he'd been offered a last-minute stadium gig. He asked if Dad could replicate his band's entire stage setup—including the congas—in record time. Buffett's box truck couldn't fit all the equipment, so they loaded up Dad's station wagon with gear and strapped the congas to the roof. They paused long enough to paint Freddy and the Fishsticks World Tour '81 on the side.

People turn to folklore to describe my father: He's the Pied Piper, the maven, or, as Ned Doheny calls him, the trickster—a mischievous entity who “tracks pollen all over the place, and all kinds of things happen.”

One day in 1977, he showed up at Linda's house in Malibu with some fresh fruit and some excellent marijuana. Lulled by the strong weed, the sun, and my father, Linda stayed outside too long and got horribly sunburned. The next day, she had to take publicity photos for her album Simple Dreams. In the iconic shot of Linda (her ex George Lucas's favorite, she says), she looks over her left shoulder, lips parted, a white flower in her hair—but whenever she looks at the photo, she sees the sunburn she got with Dad. My father and his pollen.

But then there is my father, quiet, beamed back down to Earth. When I was 18, I got a bad concussion that took me out of college for my first semester. My doctor didn't want me to fly home for a while, so I called Dad one night from the other side of the country, panicked that my brain would never return to normal. “What are you looking at right now?” he asked. Pine trees, I said. Some shrubs. I'm sitting on a bench outside. “What's the temperature like where you are?” It's nice. Cool but not cold. It was early fall in the Northeast, a new sensation for a Californian. “What does the air smell like?” Wood chips. “I know it's hard, but your only job right now is to stay in this moment and not future-trip. In this moment right now, the one God is giving you, the air smells nice, the temperature is good, you're somewhere beautiful.” We kept talking and he slowly untangled problems that, before I called, had felt insurmountable. He signed off that night, as he usually does, by saying not I love you, but I'm loving you—love, active.

I know now that he had dozens of conversations like this, with dozens of musicians, decades before he became a father.

Anyone “can feel like the stowaway in the trunk of a great enterprise,” Browne told me. But an artist, maybe especially, needs someone who makes them believe that they're worthy, that it's all going to be okay, Mac McAnally, a singer-songwriter and longtime member of Jimmy Buffett's band, told me. “Fred can make you believe it's going to be okay.”

Joni Mitchell stopped touring in the 1980s, and in the '90s told Dad she was going to do her last-ever public performance, at the 1995 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Her songbook incorporates about 50 different tunings. “I'd tune to the numbers in a date, I'd tune to a piece of music that I liked on the radio, I'd tune to birdsongs and the landscape I was sitting in,” she said in a 1996 interview. “I'd work out these wonderful fresh harmonic movements, only it was a pain in the butt to perform and I felt like I was always out of tune.” She didn't want to do it anymore.

But Dad told her he might have just the right tool: Roland's new VG-8, which could electronically alter a guitar's sonic output and, crucially, memorize tunings. Mitchell could keep her guitar in standard tuning, then push a button for “Big Yellow Taxi,” say, and the VG-8 would convert the sound of each string to match that tuning. Dad knew Mitchell had had polio as a child and still suffered from muscle weakness, so he built her a guitar from lightweight spruce (commonly used in violin making) and placed the VG-8 inside. He painted the guitar his favorite color, British racing green. She named it “Green Peace.”

What she thought would be her swan song “turned into the first performance in a whole new period,” she said in that 1996 interview. She used the VG-8 to make the guitar sounds on Taming the Tiger, giving her “access to all kinds of possibilities in keeping with the way I hear guitar, which is like a full orchestra, with the treble like a brass section and the lower strings like the viola, cello, and bass.” To another reporter, she said, “This instrument is going to be my savior.” She used my father's name in one of the album's lyrics—she calls him “Freddie”—and, in the liner notes, thanked him for “rekindling my desire to make music.”

From the November 2017 issue: The unknowable Joni Mitchell

Dad has always been “genuinely interested in people,” Linda told me in her living room. “And when they came in, he'd talk to them, and they confided in him.”

I leaned in, ready for a flood of rock secrets. “What would they confide in him about?”

“Well, I don't know! He kept it secret.” She smiled. “He kept my stuff secret. But he always knew the undercurrents that were going on and band dynamics and stuff like that.”

And if necessary, “he'd tell them when they were full of shit. He had no reservations about that,” Bookin, the store's longtime salesman, said. Once, at a recording session, Crosby played Dad a vocal track he'd just cut and was clearly proud of. “Your voice is great, but were you reading it?” Dad asked. Unmemorized lyrics are the height of laziness, in my father's eyes.

“Oh fuck you,” Crosby said. (The two remained good friends until Crosby's death.)

My father has a low tolerance for what he perceives as stupidity, and over time, drug use in the L.A. music scene got stupider and stupider. To hear my father and his friends talk about it, the era can be divided into B.C. and A.C.: Before Cocaine and After Cocaine. When Weed Guy showed up at the party, that could be fun. Mushroom Guy, too. Even Acid Guy. But when Cocaine Guy started coming to parties, Dad said, he drained the scene of its remaining innocence. The music got self-indulgent. People would talk over one another and think they were having a conversation.

Doing a line with someone “was like having a cup of coffee” with them, Mickey Raphael, Willie Nelson's harmonica player, told me. It took everyone a while to notice the scene darkening. In June 1979, Dad's friend Lowell George, of the band Little Feat, died of an overdose. Dad was an Eagle Scout by the scene's standards, but he realized that “we couldn't keep going at this pace” and got sober that August. “He was one of the first people I knew to really get sober and just draw the line,” Browne said. “The rest of us, it was years before anybody decided that was the problem.”

Dad still went to all the parties; he just brought IBC root beer to drink. Once, at a gathering at Crosby's house, he was being so loud, so boisterous, cracking such awful jokes, that another party guest, Neil Young's producer and recording engineer Niko Bolas, assumed he was high on some new drug they all needed to try. Raphael said that Dad's particular brand of abstinence “turned a little light on with all of us, saying, Hmm, if Fred can do it, then maybe I can.” You could be clean and “still able to hang with the musos.” Dad would help heroin addicts detox at the little country home he and his father built together in the 1950s, and started a weekly gathering of the alcoholics he mentored, who nicknamed it “The Gol Darn Dingy Deal,” after my father's catchphrase when facing a setback. (“What's the gol darn dingy deal?” he will ask when, say, the car doesn't start.)

In 1986, when Crosby was out of prison on drug charges and newly sober, Dad joined him on a white-water-rafting trip. That vacation, Crosby's wife, Jan Dance Crosby, told me, was “really the first time we actually did something for fun after working so hard to get sober.” Dad was proof that life didn't end—indeed, could become more joyful—after sobriety. “He wasn't shy about sharing that joy, and he also wasn't preachy,” she said. “All he was was a friend.”

Dad became a Christian around that time. This, too, started in the shop. When Larry Myers, a musician and pastor, came to Los Angeles, someone told him that if he wanted to meet people, he had to go to Westwood Music and meet my father. The two became friendly, and Myers invited Dad to hear his band at the Vineyard Church. Today Vineyard is an international body of churches, but at the time one of its only chapters met in Dad's old junior high school. Members of Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue made up the worship band; Myers had helped bring Dylan himself to Christ. As Dad listened to the band play that Sunday, “I realized I had tears in my eyes,” he recalled. “I realized that I really always—I always loved God, and it was time to make friends” with him.

When my parents met, in 1990, Dad bragged that he was building an off-the-grid home in Topanga Canyon, in the mountains outside L.A. My mom, Kathy, made it clear, in her quiet way, that she knew a lot more about off-the-grid living than he did. Together, they finished the home where I was raised, surrounded by sage and overlooking the Pacific. When the solar power inevitably went out, Mom would put on a headlamp and start the generator; when our water pressure dropped, she'd go outside and bang on the pipe with a rock; when rattlesnakes came into the house, she'd take care of it. She created the conditions for Dad to continue doing his work. He bought a 1970s GMC motor home on eBay (shag carpets, corduroy seats), which became a guest room for family, friends, wandering souls, and the addicts he mentored. Mom organized a family trip to Ohio to drive it home. At one point, she held the broken door closed with a piece of rope so it wouldn't fly open on the highway.

Throughout my childhood, and to this day, Dad regularly reads his favorite book, The Greatest Thing in the World, a pocket-size theological meditation on love as defined in First Corinthians. It was his father's favorite too. And now it is mine. The section about a love that “thinketh no evil” reminds me of my father:

Dad does not describe the people in his life as musicians, mathematicians, or zoologists; they are the drummer “who understands how to swing on a metaphysical level,” “the mathematician who practically ran the Aerospace Corporation,” and the “only person Dennis Wilson trusted” to care for the Asian small-clawed otters he kept in his swimming pool.

My father sees us as the people we wish to be, and he will tolerate us being nothing less. In 2022, Dad was one of Mitchell's guitar techs at her surprise Newport Folk Festival comeback, and he let me tag along. At a rehearsal, Marcus Mumford was sitting a few feet away from us, behind the congas, and I whispered to my father how much I loved his music. “Go talk to him,” Dad said. “He's Marcus Mumford, Dad,” I said. He grinned. “And you're Nancy Walecki.”

Westwood Music was always a family enterprise. Dad told customers to check this out on the sales floor while my brother and I ostensibly helped take inventory, but mostly built forts in a loft above the amp room. We'd read Tales From the Crypt surrounded by touring cases, cross-legged on the British-racing-green carpet. Upstairs, in her bookkeeping office next to the repair shop, my mom kept the Fred Walecki Experience running.

Musicians would sit on the store's leather couches, playing guitars and drinking the coffee we made in our Mr. Coffee machine. I saw how much the electrolarynx frustrated my father, but he continued to be the voice of the shop. He once came up behind Browne while he tried a guitar; got real close, up to his ear; then buzzed: “Can you believe that tone?”

By the 1990s, the store was struggling, as professional musicians got more and more free equipment through sponsorship deals. A Guitar Center opened down the street—a black hole sucking up our business, to hear my parents describe it. “Gui-Target,” Dad called it. Later, people started buying instruments online, but Dad wasn't interested in building a web presence. If an instrument has its own little soul, how could you buy it without spending time with it in person?

Dad sold Westwood Music in 2010, and the new owners closed it during the pandemic and never reopened it. Dad and I went back to the store last year, to clear out the last of his belongings: the leather couch my brother and I had carved our initials into with a paper clip; the scoreboard-size photograph of Dad, sitting backwards on a chair, talking to Lyle Lovett; the neon Westwood Musical Instruments—Hermann Walecki sign. I thought of something Christopher Guest had said. Someone should put a plaque outside the building: Westwood Music was here. 1947–2021.

I told Dad I was sorry that my brother and I hadn't carried on the family business. It felt like we'd failed him and the generations before him. Dad shook his head and reminded me that his father hadn't wanted him to take over the store. Besides, being here didn't even make him that sad, he said, because the new owner's iteration was so different. “But when it was ours,” he told me, “we did it well.”

Dad is 78 now, and still repairs instruments for customers like Guest, Sklar, Robby Krieger of the Doors, the Edge, and anyone else resourceful enough to find his new shop, unlisted on Google Maps and located inside a converted greenhouse at a succulent nursery in Malibu. Dad brings lettuce from home to feed the rabbits that run beneath the pallets of cacti; the other tenants include a glassblower, a clothing designer, a painter, and a sculptor. When he leaves home in the morning, he will say, “I'm off to do my father's work”—referring to both Hermann and his heavenly father.

His repair shop still smells of Westwood Music's old wood and lacquer, along with the ocean and the faded paper in his boxes of ephemera. (My favorite piece is a photograph of Crosby, Stills, and Nash's recreational baseball team, the Hoovers—a cocaine joke, Dad had to explain to me.) He keeps his father's Goethe quote above his workbench, where he recently repaired a cello from 1876. “You know what's interesting? I realized that's what I like to do,” he told me. If he didn't love guitar players so much, he'd work only on cellos. Repairing them reminds him of his father.

This past winter, I stopped by with some lunch for us to share. He was chatting with a customer while he lowered the strings on the man's guitar closer to the fretboard so it would be easier to play. Dad told a joke and offered the man some advice on a problem he'd been having with his wife, then the two of them discussed Romans 8. When it was time for the man to go, my father told him a story all the way to his car.

Dad and I ate our sandwiches, and I mentioned how much I missed singing. He said that I should hang around more jazz clubs, because “parties don't happen by themselves,” and that I should join a sailing club, because he suspected that I missed the ocean. (I have never expressed an interest in sailing, but maybe now I'll learn.) We searched for a guitar pick he wanted to show somebody, from the set he'd custom-made for the Beach Boys. When we locked up the shop for the day, he looked tired but pleased. He'd be back again tomorrow.

An already fragile system can't withstand Republicans' cuts.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Alison Chandra was thrilled and gutted. She was pregnant with a much-wanted second child. But her baby had a rare disease called Heterotaxy, causing heart defects and organ abnormalities. He might not survive, her doctors warned her, describing his condition as “likely incompatible with life.”

Chandra is a nurse. She “grew up on the far right, and very staunchly in that pro-life, single-issue-voter camp,” she told me. “That was the first time that I had to come face-to-face with what being pro-life actually meant.” She chose not to terminate the pregnancy. Because she and her husband had no income—they had spent the past half decade volunteering on a medical ship off the coast of West Africa—the family decided to sign up for Medicaid.

“I was someone who really thought Medicaid is just for moochers and leeches,” she told me. “Quote-unquote good people should never have to need Medicaid. It was really hard for me to walk into that office and hand over my paperwork.” But she did. “It obviously changed the trajectory of everything because at that point we were able to pursue the best care.” Medicaid covered her prenatal visits, her son's delivery, and two open-heart surgeries. Eleven years later, her son is thriving, and Chandra is working in suburban Utah as a nurse specializing in the care of children with complex health needs—kids covered, as she and her son once were, by Medicaid.

Soon she might not be able to provide that care. This summer, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Donald Trump's sweeping second-term domestic legislation. The bill does not cut Medicaid, the White House insists. It slashes taxes and offsets the revenue losses by tamping down on what Republicans describe as waste, fraud, and abuse in the health-insurance program.

Annie Lowrey: A big, bad, very ugly bill

Yet the Congressional Budget Office foresees that the law will drain close to $1 trillion of Medicaid's financing in the next decade and cause 11 million Americans to lose their insurance coverage. Experts anticipate a cascade of effects. Private-insurance premiums and medical-bankruptcy rates will climb. Wait times for appointments with specialists will rise. Care deserts will expand. Hospitals and clinics will have to shut down. The most fragile sectors of our health-care system will be in danger of collapsing. And pediatric care might be first on that list.

The law does not target children's-health coverage or children's-health initiatives. But nearly half of American children are enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program. If the One Big Beautiful Bill Act goes into effect as written, sick babies will end up paying for tax cuts for the wealthy.

The bill “strengthens” Medicaid, as Republicans put it, by stripping insurance coverage from adults. For the first time, the country is implementing a nationwide work requirement for the program. Any state with an expanded Medicaid initiative (meaning that the state offers coverage to all low-income adults, not just those with a disability or another qualifying condition) will have to verify that enrollees are working, volunteering, or attending school, and kick them off the rolls if they're not. The work requirement is not expected to spur more people to get a job; studies have found that nearly every adult on Medicaid already works if they can. But states will have to spend millions of dollars to implement it, diverting cash from delivering actual health care. And  8 million Americans are predicted to lose coverage as they struggle to keep up with the paperwork. The bill also contains a series of technical changes to Medicaid's financing, altering the taxes that states levy on medical providers and the payments they make to them.

Experts warn that dropping parents from Medicaid will mean dropping kids, even if those children continue to qualify in their own right. Parents are twice as likely to enroll their children in a public-insurance program if they are enrolled themselves, and states that cover a small share of low-income adults tend to cover a small share of low-income kids too. Already, more than 4 million American children lack health coverage. Hundreds of thousands more might join them in a year or two.

A rising uninsurance rate among children is a crisis in and of itself. Kids without insurance are less likely to have a pediatrician monitoring their well-being and development. They're more likely to be sick, less likely to get immunizations and prescription medications, less likely to be treated for severe health conditions, and more likely to be hospitalized. They are also more likely to die before reaching adulthood.

At the same time as the number of uninsured children rises, states are expected to slash spending on “optional” or “nonessential” Medicaid initiatives, such as in-home care for children with chronic health problems and disabilities. These services allow disabled kids to learn in classrooms and sick kids to sleep in their own bedroom, alongside their pets, siblings, and stuffies, rather than in pediatric-hospital wards. Providing care at home reduces emergency-room visits, and slashes the rate of hospital admissions. It is also essential for families, Chandra told me, her tone oscillating between tempered rage and measured despair. “Those are my patients,” she said. “Those are the kids I love.”

Medicaid already has an “institutional bias,” explains s.e. smith, the communications director of Little Lobbyists, an advocacy group for children with disabilities and complex health needs. The program covers care in hospitals and clinics more comprehensively than care provided at home or in the community. When state Medicaid programs face financing crunches, they tend to slash in-home services first. The bill will lead to much greater cuts, separating kids “from loving families, depriving them of a free and appropriate public education, and denying them an opportunity to participate in society,” smith told me.

Jonathan Chait: They didn't have to do this

As at-home care is reduced and demand for in-hospital treatment rises, the bill will make it harder for parents and caregivers to access institutional services too. Over the past decade and a half, health systems have gotten rid of 20 percent of pediatric beds and 30 percent of pediatric-care units. That's because hospitals make more money admitting adults than children: Kids are much more likely to be on Medicaid, and Medicaid offers lower reimbursement rates than Medicare and private-insurance plans do.

As a result, pediatric care has become concentrated in specialty children's hospitals that cannot meet the existing demand. The country has too few hospital beds for babies and teenagers, too few pediatric-health specialists to make diagnoses and provide treatment, and far too few pediatric-health providers in low-income and rural areas. What institutions exist are fragile: Nonprofit children's hospitals have profit margins of 2.7 percent, versus 6.4 percent for all hospitals.

The system is a rickety structure, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act a hurricane-force wind. With fewer kids covered by Medicaid, revenue per patient will go down, giving health systems a yet-greater incentive to focus on providing care to adults and seniors; hospitals will close, affecting not only kids with Medicaid but all children; in surviving pediatric institutions, demand will rise, given that families will have fewer options for treatment. Doctors foresee panicked parents driving their ill and injured kids for hours and hours to a children's ER or ICU—only to find it overflowing.

Health experts anticipate exactly the same dynamic playing out in rural medical care. “This is going to impact 62 million Americans,” Alan Morgan, the CEO of the National Rural Health Association, told me. “If you're in a rural area, it's impacting your ability to access health care, because you're reducing the bottom line of these facilities and the ability of these facilities to stay in the community.” They see the same dynamic playing out in nursing-home, rehabilitative, and long-term care as well. A law intended, putatively at least, to get adults to work might end up destroying fragile institutions for the country's most vulnerable, and weakening those providing health care to everyone.

The bill's work requirements do not come into effect until after the 2026 midterm election—a sign that, perhaps, Republicans understand just how catastrophic and unpopular the party's policies are. Aides on Capitol Hill and hospital executives believe that Congress might soften the bill or push parts of it back. But there are tax cuts to pay for, and people with disabilities and cancer available to pay for them.

“I have lived and worked in countries where people lack access to health care. I know what that looks like,” Chandra told me. “It is heartbreaking to me that we are facing, potentially, some of the same challenges that I've dealt with in some of the poorest countries in the world. It should not be the case anywhere, but especially not in the richest country in the world.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Being courteous can be challenging in these times of online snark, but it is guaranteed to make you happier.

Want to stay current with Arthur's writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.

“A dying culture invariably exhibits personal rudeness,” wrote Robert Heinlein in his 1982 futuristic novel, Friday. “A loss of politeness, of gentle manners, is more significant than is a riot.” What, 40 years ago, were the science-fiction adventures of a technologically enhanced “artificial person” turned out also to be prophecy when we consider today's digital networks of anonymous humans and bots, conversations between people and humanlike artificial intelligence, and a cratering of courtesy. This loss of gentle manners at almost every level is attributable, at least in part, to our adoption of these technologies.

Virtually everyone agrees that people are becoming ruder, especially online. But do you see this tendency in yourself as well? Even if you're not a sociopathic troll who feeds on incivility and conflict, you might all the same have noticed that you're less polite than you once were, and that online environments have contributed to this. You may have observed the passing of such small niceties as addressing others by name in your messages and signing off with your own name. Quite possibly, you find yourself adopting a harsher, more sarcastic tone on social media than you ever would in real life. And why bother saying “please” and “thank you” when communicating with what is, or might be, an AI bot?

This coarsening, even toward nonhuman entities, is not harmless. Indeed, it is probably hurting your well-being. When you become less polite, the alteration in your conduct can make you less happy, more depressed, and angrier about life. You may not be able to fix the broader trends in society, but you can—and should—fix this in yourself.

Read: How please stopped being polite

Politeness can be defined in four ways. The first two are: etiquette, which governs basic manners and speech, and conduct, which involves actions such as holding open a door for someone to pass. The other two are a pair: positive politeness, which refers to doing courteous things for others, and negative politeness, which involves refraining from discourtesy. Social scientists define these forms of politeness not just as a set of behaviors but as part of personality. Specifically, one of the Big Five Personality Traits—agreeableness—is made up of compassion and politeness. One well-regarded study from the 1990s estimated that the heritability of agreeableness is about 41 percent genetic, allowing us to infer that you inherit some politeness from your parents partly through your genes, but more through how you were brought up. This also implies that you can become more polite with good influences and by cultivating positive habits.

Some aspects of courtesy are fairly universal, such as saying please and thank you, as well as listening while others speak (positive politeness) without interrupting (negative politeness). Other courteous values vary around the world: Shaking hands is good manners in London but not in Bangkok; tipping a taxi driver is a common courtesy in New York but not in Tokyo. Some demographic variation in politeness also occurs, and gender norms can play a part too. For example, experiments show that American women generally receive more politeness than men do, and show less courteous behavior to men than vice versa.

None of us wants to be treated rudely, online or in person. The finding in studies that when someone is discourteous toward you they lower your well-being is so commonsense as to make citation scarcely necessary. Even witnessing rudeness toward others can lower your happiness, as experiments have shown: When media content contains sarcasm by the author and the comment sections are uncivil, readers become unhappier—even if they agree with the snarky writer or commenters. Rudeness just brings you down.

More surprising, perhaps, is the effect that your being courteous toward others has on your own mood. Researchers in 2021 showed that being polite to others raises happiness and lowers anger. This might be counterintuitive at first, because we may at times feel a powerful urge to be snippy—so doesn't that mean that snapping at someone should make us feel better? The reverse is the case: Being impolite is more like scratching at your poison-ivy rash. Giving in to the urge makes things worse. I doubt you've ever felt great when you've known, deep down, that you've been a jerk, whereas you've almost certainly felt better when you've been your better angel. Being prosocial, even when you don't feel like it or the object of your courtesy doesn't deserve it, has been proven to raise your mood.

The effect is so powerful that you benefit from being polite even when your courtesy is extended toward nonhumans. Psychologists writing in The Journal of Positive Psychology set research participants a task to perform alongside a helping robot named Tako: Those who had a stronger urge to thank Tako for its help afterward were more likely than others to behave in a prosocial way in a subsequent task. This finding suggests that even being civil to an AI bot or other nonhuman interface matters; yelling at Siri or being curt with ChatGPT will lead you to behave worse with other people, and lower your well-being.

Read: Three rules for politeness during a confusing social transition

In short, be polite for your own sake. And be aware that if tech-mediated interactions are making you less polite, that can still hurt your happiness. Quitting the internet or returning to a world without AI is impractical, so the solution to this challenge of courtesy lies in how you consciously decide to behave. Here are three rules for your conduct that I can suggest.

1. Make courtesy a habit, even when other humans are not involved. My late father had impeccable manners, and I have no doubt that if he were still alive, he would start every request to AI with please and finish it with thank you. Years ago, I would have made fun of that—Dad, the bot doesn't care!—but I'm sure he wouldn't have paid any attention, because I now understand that his good manners were a demonstration of decent behavior to himself, about himself. And they would have protected him from some of the unhappiness we see all around. So today, I try to imitate him, online and in person, whomever or whatever I'm interacting with.

2. Renounce snark, whether you're witnessing it or using it yourself. As noted, media sarcasm can lower your well-being as its consumer. Yet mockery of others seems an integral part of modern communication, especially among people who wish to seem sophisticated. I try not to participate in this, because even if, in the moment, it can feel satisfying or make me laugh, I know the cost to my soul. I no longer read comment sections in publications, and when an author throws out an impolite barb, I stop reading altogether.

3. Respond to rudeness not with rudeness, but with courtesy. If your happiness correspondent got into social-media spats or angry public battles, that would be a bad look and very off-brand. So I always refrain. But I try to go further than self-restraint: If I need to react to a rude in-person remark or mean online comment, I try to see it as an opportunity to improve my well-being by responding with courtesy and dignity. This gets easier with practice, and I have never once been sorry for passing on the opportunity to retaliate with a nasty zinger. I'm only sorry when I fail to make use of the opportunity to do the right thing and feel good about it.

Arthur C. Brooks: How to get the most happiness from your social life

One last thought about Heinlein's “dying culture” claim: Is it true that our culture is dying, given all the rudeness? And if so, are we too far gone to turn it around? On many days, things do look bleak, as online nastiness seems to become the dominant style. But my personal defense mechanism also aims to act as a countercultural force: I see politeness as today's punk rock because it so transgresses the spirit of our times. And like punk rock, when you empower yourself with politeness, you feel exhilarated. It is the ultimate exercise in freedom: the freedom to be the person I want to be in the face of a cultural tyranny.

A radical campaign that began in 2023 is entering its final phase.

After Hamas massacred some 1,200 Israelis on October 7, 2023, the Israeli settler right converged on a plan. In 2005, Israel had uprooted about 8,000 settlers from Gaza, ceding the territory to Palestinian control. Many of the settlers never forgave the state for removing them; now they saw a chance to return. And so while other Israelis mourned, the hard right went to work, methodically building a political movement to retake the Gaza Strip, annex it, and repopulate it with Jewish settlements. As I warned in late 2023, these activists planned on “displacing or expelling Palestinians,” and their dream was “not restricted to the political fringes, and should not be expected to stay there.” Since then, more than a third of the lawmakers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government have joined the cause.

The Israeli security establishment opposes this land grab. So do most Israelis, surveys have found for years. That dissent spilled into view last week when thousands of settler activists toured the Israeli border region near Gaza. “I hear these things and I'm horrified,” a soldier tasked with protecting the group told a reporter. “It's revolting, because I know that my friends and younger brother are the ones who will guard those settlements.” Referring to one of the activists, he added: “My greatest fear is that your vision will come true, and that keeps me up whole nights. I don't want my friends to sacrifice their lives for a goal that sanctifies the death of innocent people.”

But popular opinion may not matter, because Netanyahu is not responsive to popular opinion. The prime minister's coalition received just 48.4 percent of the vote in Israel's most recent election, and only came to power thanks to support from far-right anti-Arab parties. Without them, Netanyahu's government would collapse, and he would have to hold elections that polls show he would lose. In other words, the Israeli leader is beholden precisely to those who aim to annex Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The Biden administration worked to combat this influence, but President Donald Trump has not only relieved that pressure—he has joined the other side, calling for Gazans to be relocated to make way for a “Riviera in the Middle East.” The result: The obstacles to the far right's blueprint for conquest and ethnic cleansing have been removed, and its agenda has effectively become Netanyahu's policy.

Yair Rosenberg: The worst-kept secret of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

Unsurprisingly then, the push for settlement and annexation has escalated. Last week, 22 lawmakers in Netanyahu's coalition signed a letter pressing Israel's defense minister to allow activists into northern Gaza itself to scout potential settlement locations. “The return of the Jewish people to these places is not just a strategic step,” they wrote, “but a return to Zion in the deepest and most practical sense.” On Sunday, the far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the hotly contested holy site, and declared, “We are relaying a message that from today on, we are conquering the entire Gaza Strip, announcing our sovereignty on the entire Gaza Strip, taking down every Hamas member, and encouraging voluntary emigration”—his preferred euphemism for ethnic cleansing.

Right-wing media in Israel have also begun seeding the idea of resettlement in earnest. Last Thursday, Makor Rishon, a newspaper that serves the settler community, ran a story titled “Negotiations on the Verge of Collapse: Israel Prepares for Annexation.” Amit Segal, the best-sourced journalist on the Israeli right, recently promoted a poll with the headline “A Majority of Israelis Support Jewish Settlement in Gaza.” The not-so-resounding results of that survey? Fifty-two percent for, 48 percent against. The poll was commissioned and published by Israel Hayom, the pro-Netanyahu newspaper founded and funded by the late right-wing casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, and it was an outlier on the topic.

Other leaked reports suggest either that Netanyahu plans to fully reoccupy Gaza—a course consistent with potential resettlement—or that he intends to pursue a comprehensive hostage deal that would lead to a negotiated conclusion to the war. These competing narratives reflect an internal information war over Israel's next steps. Not coincidentally, 19 former heads of Israel's security services released a video on Sunday calling for Israel to end the war, which they argue has crossed moral and strategic red lines and is now serving another agenda. “There are moments that represent a ‘black flag' in which one must stand firm and say: This far and no further,” Netanyahu's former defense minister Moshe Ya'alon declares in the clip, claiming that the government has been suborned by “messianic zealots.”

For now, something intermediate might be in the offing. Segal has reported on a plan to annex the border regions of Gaza as a way to pressure Hamas to release its hostages, because the group “cares more about land than human lives.” Conveniently, this piecemeal annexation could be presented as a military maneuver against Hamas, while also advancing the goals of the settler right—the sort of dual-use policy that Netanyahu has pursued to keep his partners on side since this war began.

Annexation in any form would undoubtedly be met with international opprobrium, threats of sanctions, and further isolation of Israel on the world stage. The cascade of Western countries recognizing a Palestinian state can be understood as an attempt to oppose Israeli designs on the territory. But with Trump still backing Netanyahu, the Israeli leader has little immediate incentive to alter course. Netanyahu is a master of pivoting when politically convenient—including on seemingly core principles—but he tends to choose whatever option keeps him in power, which means that changing his direction requires changing his calculation as to what will accomplish that.

Franklin Foer: Israel's last chance

Over the weekend, Jews around the world observed Tisha B'av, Judaism's day of mourning that commemorates the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem. On Monday, Netanyahu opened his cabinet meeting with a reference to those events: “1,955 years ago, following Tisha B'av, we suffered the greatest defeat in our history,” he said. “At that time, we were divided, splintered, and fighting with one another.” Today, by contrast, “we are in the midst of a great war in which we attained historic achievements because we were not divided, because we stood together and fought together.”

Netanyahu's boast of Israeli solidarity—made as protests against his war policy and his attempt to fire the attorney general investigating his government roiled the country—rang hollow. But the prime minister's reference to Tisha B'av was apt, if not for the reasons he thought.

As the Talmud tells it, when the Romans first laid siege to Jerusalem and the Second Temple, the walled city had supplies to withstand the blockade for years to come. The rabbinic sages counseled patience, seeking a diplomatic accommodation that would avert mass bloodshed. Instead, a group of Jewish zealots burned the city's storehouses in order to force the population to fight rather than wait out or appease their adversaries. Jerusalem was conquered and the Temple destroyed. A radical minority yoked the entire polity to a messianic policy—and the result turned out to be a national catastrophe.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

American bullfrogs are gobbling up everything in sight, including some of the rarest species in the Western US.

On summer evenings in the Midwest, the muggy air comes alive with a chorus of crickets, cicadas, and frogs — especially bullfrogs. Their booming mating calls sound like something between a foghorn and a didgeridoo.

As far as we know, summer here has always sounded like this. Bullfrogs are native to most of the Eastern US, from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Coast. They evolved here. They belong here. I, for one, adored them as a kid growing up in Iowa, and spent countless summer days trying to catch them to get a closer look.

What's unusual is that a few states west — into Colorado and on to California — summer nights are similarly marked by the iconic call of the American bullfrog. But here, they don't belong. They're unwanted. And they threaten the very existence of some of the West's other amphibious animals, such as the Oregon spotted frog, which is found only in the Pacific Northwest.

American bullfrogs are not native to the Western US. Humans brought them to the region more than a century ago, largely as a food source. And in the years since, the frogs — which are forest green and the size of a small house cat — have multiplied dramatically, spreading to countless ponds and gobbling up everything that fits in their mouths, including federally threatened and endangered species. Conservation scientists now consider them among the most dangerous invasive species in the Western US, and in the 40-plus other countries worldwide where they've been introduced.

That leaves bullfrogs in an unusual position. Invasive species are typically brought in from other countries — Burmese pythons in Florida and spotted lanternflies in New York City come from Asia, for example — but American bullfrogs are, as their name suggests, American. They're both native and invasive in the same country. And the difference of just a few states determines whether we treat them like pests or as an important part of the ecosystem.

It's easy to hate bullfrogs. They do cause a lot of damage and, like other non-native species, they're leading to what some researchers call the Starbucksification of the natural world — you find the same thing everywhere you go, which can make ecosystems less resilient. Yet bullfrogs themselves aren't the main problem, but rather a symptom of a much bigger one.

One reason is that people enjoy eating them. Or more specifically, their legs.

In the 1800s, as the human population in the West surged amid the Gold Rush, so did an appetite for frog legs, which were associated with fancy French cuisine. To meet that demand, people collected native amphibians from the wild, like the California red-legged frog. But as those species became rarer and rarer — in part, due to overharvesting, researchers suspect — entrepreneurs and farmers started importing American bullfrogs from the eastern US and tried to farm them.

For a time, it seemed like the bullfrog industry might take off.

“Bullfrog legs! Something to tickle the gustatory glands of the epicurean bon vivants,” a reporter wrote in the Riverside Daily Press, a California paper, in 1922. “Propagation of the bullfrog in this state already has become a successful reality. In the near future, bullfrog farming may be expected to take its rightful place as one of the prominent industries of California.”

That never really came to pass. Bullfrog farming proved challenging and financially risky: They take years to raise, they need loads of live food, and they're prone to disease outbreaks, as Sarah Laskow wrote in Atlas Obscura. And for all that trouble, they don't produce much meat.

But while the frog leg industry didn't spread, the frogs, of course, did.

They escaped from farms and, with other accidental and intentional introductions, proliferated until they were common in ponds, lakes, and other water bodies throughout much of the West, including Arizona, California, and the Pacific Northwest. Now, in some portions of the region, “you see so many bullfrogs that it's just sort of alarming,” said Michael Adams, an ecologist and amphibian expert at the US Geological Survey, a government research agency that monitors wildlife. There are no reliable estimates of the total population of bullfrogs in the West, though a single pond can be home to thousands of individuals.

Part of what enabled their success is biology: A female bullfrog can lay as many as 25,000 eggs at one time, far more than most native species.

But as several researchers told me, humans have also modified the landscape in the West in ways that have helped bullfrogs take over. While western states have rivers and wetlands, permanent warm waterbodies weren't common until the spread of agriculture and the need for irrigation, said Tiffany Garcia, a researcher and invasive species expert at Oregon State University. Now ponds, reservoirs, and canals — which bullfrogs love — are everywhere.

“It's a story of human colonization,” Garcia said. “Bullfrogs were brought by people settling and industrializing the West, and they are maintained by people who are natural-resource users of the West. They wouldn't be here and survive without us changing the landscape to create these systems where they do so well.”

Bullfrogs are often found alongside other non-native species, Garcia said, which typically tolerate landscapes modified by humans. And sometimes they even help each other succeed. Research has, for example, shown that bluegill sunfish — introduced in the West largely for sportfishing — can help bullfrogs survive. Sunfish will eat dragonfly larvae that might otherwise prey on bullfrog tadpoles.

“You can't even consider them invasive species anymore,” Garcia said of bullfrogs. “You have to consider it an invasive community.”

Like unsupervised toddlers, bullfrogs will put pretty much anything in their mouths. Mice, birds, turtles, snakes, rocks, other bullfrogs — if it fits, they'll try to eat it.

This is a big problem for species that are already rare, such as the Chiricahua leopard frog or the northwestern pond turtle. Bullfrogs are shrinking their paths to extinction.

“They're implicated in the declines, along with habitat loss and drought, of many of our native reptile and amphibian species,” said Sidney Woodruff, a doctoral researcher at the University of California Davis who studies bullfrogs and other invasive amphibians.

In May, Woodruff published a study that found that waterbodies in Yosemite National Park that were full of bullfrogs had lower densities of northwestern pond turtles than those without invasive frogs. She also found that where bullfrogs were present, only large turtles could survive.

“Our study adds mounting evidence that hatchling and juvenile pond turtle losses to bullfrogs pose a serious threat to pond turtle population persistence,” Woodruff and her co-authors wrote.

And where bullfrogs live in communities with other invasive species, native animals often face even greater challenges, said JJ Apodaca, executive director of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental group. Non-native crayfish, for example, are voracious consumers of plants and other habitat features that native animals hide in. So, where you have invasive crayfish, the local fauna will be that much easier for bullfrogs to eat.

Invasive bullfrogs may also be spreading diseases. A study published in 2018 linked the arrival of bullfrogs in the West with the spread of a pathogen called chytrid fungus. While the pathogen typically doesn't sicken bullfrogs, it has helped drive the decline and extinction of more than 200 amphibian species globally, including those in the West.

No, a bullfrog-killing spree won't fix ecosystems in the West. They're already everywhere, so even if scientists manage to eliminate them from a pond or 10 ponds — which often requires fully drying out the water body and hours and hours of effort — they'll likely come back.

“It's futile,” Garcia said. “We're not getting rid of bullfrogs. Not really.”

Even if we could remove bullfrogs from large areas in the West, ecosystems wouldn't suddenly revert back to some sort of natural state. Bullfrogs are both a problem themselves and a symptom of change — of the large-scale transformation of land in the West.

“There's kind of an irony,” said Brendon Larson, a researcher and invasive species expert at the University of Waterloo. “We're nurturing these agricultural systems — which are monocultures and non-native species — and then we're turning around and saying we're surprised when a non-native species does well in response to that.”

Doing nothing isn't a great option either. Left alone, bullfrogs will continue to replace native species that comprise the ecosystems we depend on, including insects that pollinate our crops and salamanders that can help limit the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere and accelerating climate change.

The best approach, researchers told me, is to prioritize bullfrog control — to get rid of frogs in areas with endangered species or where conservation scientists are reintroducing native species that disappeared.

This works. For her study on pond turtles earlier this year, Woodruff and her colleagues caught more than 16,000 bullfrogs across two waterbodies in Yosemite — using nets, spears, air rifles, and other methods — which they then euthanized. It was only after her team shrank the invasive frog population that they detected small, baby pond turtles in those areas. That suggests that, absent bullfrogs, the turtles were finally able to breed and survive, “providing some hope for turtle population recovery once bullfrog predation pressures are alleviated,” the researchers wrote.

Woodruff says she noticed all kinds of other native animals return after clearing out the invasive bullfrogs, including native frogs, salamanders, and snakes. “The coolest thing to me was that the soundscape changed,” she told me. “Over time, you actually started to hear our native chorus frogs again.”

Managing bullfrogs is complicated, Woodruff says, and especially for her. She grew up in Alabama and Georgia, where the animals are native. She liked hearing them. But now she lives in California, where she's studying how they harm the environment, and so hearing them makes her tense up.

“It sucks because I love these frogs,” Woodruff said. “It is not the animals' fault. They are doing what they instinctively want to do — survive and procreate.” She tries to stay focused on the point, she said: “We're doing this for the native species.”

A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever.

A new Gallup poll finds public approval of the Supreme Court falling below 40 percent for the first time in the poll's history. The poll aligns with many others, which have shown public support for the Supreme Court collapsing since Justice Amy Coney Barrett's 2020 confirmation gave Republicans a 6-3 supermajority on the high Court.

One of the Gallup poll's most significant, if unsurprising, findings is that there is also an unprecedented partisan gap in public approval of the Court. Republicans give the justices high marks, while the Court is slightly more popular than venereal disease among Democrats:

This partisan gap is more or less what any close observer of the justices would predict, given the Court's recent behavior. Last year, the Republican justices ruled that President Donald Trump has broad immunity from prosecution — so broad, in fact, that the GOP justices even determined that Trump may order the Justice Department to prosecute his perceived enemies “for an improper purpose.”

Similarly, since Trump returned to power last January, the Court has blocked more than a dozen lower court decisions that limited Trump's ability to act unilaterally. Some of these decisions are blockbusters. In June's Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., for example, the Republican justices effectively neutralized the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the United States from deporting immigrants to nations where they may be tortured. In July's McMahon v. New York, the Republican justices permitted Trump to fire nearly half of the Department of Education's workers — in what Education Secretary Linda McMahon called “the first step on the road to a total shutdown” of the entire department.

The same justices who treat Trump as the special favorite of the laws, moreover, have also treated prominent liberal litigants as outside the law's protection. In Medina v. Planned Parenthood, for example, the Republican justices effectively repealed a law permitting Medicaid patients to choose their own health providers after some of those patients chose Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider and Republican bête noire.

In fairness, not all polls show the Court is currently at its all-time low point. A recent Fox News poll, for example, shows approval of the justices bottoming out in July 2024, the same month that the Republican justices ruled that the leader of their political party has broad immunity from criminal law. Fox's poll shows public approval of the Court rising this July from its post-Trump immunity low. (Although Fox News is closely aligned with the GOP, its polls are well-respected and generally viewed as reliable.)

Still, while individual polls disagree about whether the Court is unpopular or historically unpopular, the broader trend of voters losing faith in the Court as it aligns itself more closely with the Republican Party has been apparent in polling data for quite some time.

When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Court had distinct “liberal” and “conservative” blocs, but it would not be fair to describe it as partisan. Two Republican appointees, Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter, typically voted with the Court's liberal bloc. Justice Anthony Kennedy, another Republican, voted with the conservative bloc on most issues, but also held moderate views on abortion and frequently supported gay rights.

But that era has passed. Obama replaced Stevens and Souter with his own appointees. Trump replaced Kennedy with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a much more hardline conservative. Now, the best predictor of how each justice will vote in politically charged cases is whether they were appointed by a Democrat or a Republican.

In the past, American presidents often paid surprisingly little attention to their justices' ideologies — President Woodrow Wilson, for example, appointed the reactionary Justice James Clark McReynolds largely because he found McReynolds obnoxious and wanted to get the man (who was serving as Wilson's attorney general) out of the cabinet.

The two parties, moreover, often didn't hold consistent views on the types of issues that come before the courts. Some of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's justices, for example, were segregationists — a view that put them at odds with the Democratic Party's liberal views on race under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Republican President George H.W. Bush, who appointed archconservative Justice Clarence Thomas, was such an enthusiastic supporter of reproductive freedom when he was in Congress that his nickname was “Rubbers,” a reference to condoms.

Beginning in the Reagan administration, however, the Republican Party started producing lengthy documents laying out what Republicans did and did not believe judges should do. They also worked with ideologically aligned organizations like the Federalist Society to vet potential nominees to ensure that their judges shared the party's vision.

Democrats, meanwhile, do not have the same formal structures to evaluate potential Supreme Court nominees, but they've been no less successful in choosing justices who share the Democratic Party's approach to governance. The last Democratic Supreme Court appointee to break with the party on abortion, for example, was Justice Byron White — a Kennedy appointee who joined the Court in 1962.

So it is no surprise that, after decades of both parties appointing carefully vetted partisans to the Supreme Court, public approval of the Court now aligns with voters' political party. The American people correctly perceive that the Supreme Court has become a partisan institution, and that perception is now apparent in polling data.

There's a long history of using starvation as a weapon of war. But this is different.

“We are imposing a complete siege on [Gaza]. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel — everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we must act accordingly.”

That was Yoav Gallant, then the Israeli defense minister, two days after Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 more hostage. The following week, Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir echoed a similar sentiment: “So long as Hamas does not release the hostages,” he posted on X, “the only thing that should enter Gaza is hundreds of tons of air force explosives — not an ounce of humanitarian aid.”

Israel, in other words, did not engineer a famine in Gaza overnight. From the war's outset, Israel has been blocking humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip, to varying degrees, resulting in the spread of preventable diseases, including malnutrition, across the territory. In fact, since late 2023, international organizations have been warning that Gaza has been on the brink of famine. And in April of last year, Save the Children confirmed that children had been dying from starvation.

So why is it that it took this long for the world to turn its attention to this humanitarian disaster?

Part of the answer is that in recent weeks, the situation really has gotten much more dire, after Israel ended its 42-day ceasefire with Hamas in March and stopped allowing any aid into Gaza for two months, as my colleague Joshua Keating recently wrote.

But there's another factor: The images coming out of Gaza have been absolutely heart-wrenching. Photos and videos have gone viral — on news sites and on social media — clearly showing malnourished babies starving to death, as well as those showing children and adults with their skin clinging to their bones with barely anything in between. “It is tragic that it takes those types of really graphic, really horrible images to break through,” said Alex de Waal, an expert on famine who serves as the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University. “And that is such a terrible commentary on just a gargantuan failure.”

This, of course, is nowhere near the first time horrific images from Gaza have surfaced and sparked outrage around the world. But there's something about the visibility of a human-made famine that, for many people — including some of Israel's most ardent supporters — crosses a moral threshold.

Starving an entire population cannot be spun as collateral damage or merely the cost of war — a messaging tactic that Israel has turned to to justify its killing of innocent people despite plenty of evidence that it has routinely targeted civilians. “You can't starve anyone by accident. It has to be deliberate and sustained,” de Waal said. “It is beyond dispute that you have to starve people systematically because it takes so long.”

Indeed, Israel's use of starvation as a weapon of war has been well-documented by human rights organizations since 2023, and both Gallant and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court, including the use of starvation as a method of warfare.

Israel's mass starvation of Gaza is, by definition, a form of collective punishment — imposing potentially fatal consequences on every Palestinian living in the enclave, whether they are a combatant or an innocent civilian. That's why using starvation as a weapon of war is illegal under international law.

But that wasn't always the case. What Israel is doing is part of a long history of weaponizing food and basic resources. Still, while there are many examples of countries intentionally creating or exacerbating famine conditions on populations, there are also aspects of Israel's current policies in Gaza that are unique.

Using starvation as a weapon of war wasn't always explicitly illegal under international law. The siege of Leningrad by the Nazis and their allies, which lasted from 1941 to 1944, was one of the deadliest sieges in history, killing more than 1 million people.

Many of these deaths were attributed to starvation. An American-run tribunal, however, determined that the forced starvation was compatible with international law. After all, it was a tactic that the Allies themselves had used as well, notably in their blockades of German-occupied territories and in Japan.

There are many examples throughout history of famines that were either entirely engineered or deliberately made worse through reckless colonial and war policies. In 1943, as the British empire's colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent was nearing its end, the Bengal famine killed up to 3 million people.

Since then, studies have uncovered scientific evidence that the famine was not a result of climate conditions like serious drought. Instead, British policies, under Prime Minister Winston Churchill — which included confiscating rice and boats from the coastal parts of Bengal and exporting rice from India to other parts of the empire — seriously exacerbated famine conditions. Churchill denied this, saying that the reason there was a famine was because Indians were “breeding like rabbits” and suggesting that if the situation was indeed as dire as people claimed, then Mahatma Gandhi would be dead.

Another example is the Holodomor, the famine that killed millions of Ukrainians under the Soviet Union in the early 1930s. Joseph Stalin pursued a range of policies that engineered famine conditions — including restricting the movement of people, seizing grain even when there wasn't enough to feed the local population, and exporting grain even as Ukrainians starved — in part, historians argue, to tamp down Ukrainian nationalist movements. Several countries and scholars have since recognized the famine as an act of genocide.

The US also used blockades as a means to advance its war interests. One of its military campaigns against Japan during World War II was named “Operation Starvation” — which aimed to destroy Japan's economy by limiting the distribution of food and other imports. The military assault deprived Japan of essential raw materials and led to food shortages. That, along with naval blockades and America's destruction of agricultural infrastructure contributed to widespread malnutrition and starvation.

It was only after World War II that the Geneva Conventions of 1949 established some rules about the responsibility to allow food and other essentials into enemy territory for vulnerable populations. But even then, by and large, starvation tactics were still permissible.

“The reason it was permitted was because the Americans and the British rather liked using it,” de Waal said. “It really wasn't until the British and the Americans had abandoned their colonial wars — the American one being Vietnam in the '70s — that they thought, ‘Okay, now we're not going to fight these kinds of wars, and we can get around to banning it.'”

The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, which were agreed to in 1977, finally prohibited the “starvation of civilians as a method of warfare [or combat].” And just over 20 years later, in 1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court officially codified weaponizing starvation as a war crime.

Any food shortages in Gaza have been directly triggered by the Israeli siege, not by any market failures or climate disasters, since Israel has the capacity to allow more food in at a moment's notice.

“Here, what we see is all the ingredients coming together in a deliberate way. We see the [Israeli leaders'] statements; we see the total bombing of all the food production,” said Neve Gordon, a professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London. “I don't think there's [another] case in history, because other cases had to do with other stuff going on that were not human-made. Here, the whole starvation — from beginning to end — is human-made.”

Israel has also significantly limited traditional aid groups' operations and, for months, entirely blocked aid from entering Gaza. Generally, UN-coordinated aid providers, which include UN agencies and established NGOs, have been able to enter and operate in war zones.

But since the ceasefire ended in March, Israel has placed unprecedented constraints on those organizations. Instead, since May, Israel has been coordinating with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a newly formed US- and Israel-backed private entity that operates militarized distribution sites in central and southern Gaza.

GHF has denied that its system is unsafe. But it operates far fewer distribution sites than experts recommend — dramatically decreasing the number of aid sites that were in place before Israel instituted its total blockade in March, making it more and more difficult for Palestinians to access food.

Israeli troops have also shot at aid-seekers at GHF's distribution sites, and, according to the UN, some 1,000 Palestinians have been killed trying to get aid from GHF. Gordon calls GHF “a famine profiteering company,” adding that it “does not actually provide the necessary food, while producing these hunger games that everyone was watching, [showing] starving people are going to get food and getting shot at.”

Israeli government officials have defended GHF and instead blamed Hamas for the food shortages, accusing the group of looting humanitarian supplies despite Israeli military officials saying that there's no proof that Hamas has systematically stolen aid. But the UN and many NGOs have called for GHF to be shut down, calling it dangerous and ineffective — a departure from established international humanitarian relief systems and a rejection of basic humanitarian principles.

While Egypt has been complicit in enforcing the blockade through its border with Gaza, the reality is that even aid going into Gaza through the Egyptian border has to go through Israeli inspection. The result is that Israel has effectively vacuum-sealed Gaza, with full control of what aid gets in.

Israel could have chosen to prevent a famine at any point. Instead, it has repeatedly hampered or entirely rejected efforts to deliver life-saving aid to Palestinians — all in contravention of international law. “Israel is not unique at all in using hunger as a weapon of war,” de Waal said. “What is unique about the Israeli one is just how rigorous and how sustained it is, and how it is in defiance of an international humanitarian capacity that can respond just like that. So if Netanyahu wanted every [child in Gaza] to have breakfast tomorrow, it can be organized.”

One example of Israel's (and the world's) capacity to stop the worst from happening is the polio vaccination campaign that happened last year. When polio — which had been eradicated from Gaza for 25 years — resurfaced as a result of the humanitarian and sanitation crisis imposed by Israel's war, governments around the world pressured Israel to agree to a humanitarian pause in combat, in order to vaccinate children across the Gaza Strip. In the middle of the war, the vaccination campaigns were successful, reaching 95 percent of the target population. An effort to stop malnutrition can be similarly efficient.

The faster Israel relents and allows unimpeded aid delivery, the more lives can be saved. But unfortunately, it's already too late for far too many Palestinians in Gaza. “Even if there was divine intervention — and we had a ceasefire and the best doctors and the right kind of food — I think we'd still have hundreds [or] thousands of deaths,” Gordon said. “But we're not going to have that divine intervention.”

The cutting-edge of neurotech can read your mind. Sort of.

For the past few months, when I really needed to get something done, I put on a special pair of headphones that could read my mind. Well, kind of. The headphones are equipped with a brain-computer interface that picks up electrical signals from my brain and uses algorithms to interpret that data. When my focus starts to slip, the headphones know it, and an app tells me to take a break.

It sounds like something out of science fiction, but a decade-old startup called Neurable is pioneering the technology, and it's preparing to put the brain-tracking tricks into more gadgets. Earbuds, glasses, helmets — anything that can get an electrode near your head could provide a real-time stream of data about what's going on inside of it. Neurable's technology uses a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to collect brain data and algorithms to interpret those signals. Beyond measuring attention, the company is now using that data to track and improve brain health.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

I want to emphasize again that this technology does not actually read your mind in the sense of knowing your thoughts. But, it knows when you're entertained or distracted and could one day detect symptoms of depression or, on a much more consequential front, early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

I came across Neurable on a longer mission to understand the future of health-tracking technology by testing what's out there now. It's one that left me anxious, covered in smart rings and continuous glucose monitors, and more confused about the definition of well-being. That's because almost all health trackers that are popular on the market right now — Apple Watches, Oura Rings, Whoop Bands — are downstream sensors. They measure consequences, like elevated heart rate or body temperature, rather than the root cause of that state. By tapping directly into your brainwaves, a brain-computer interface can spot issues sometimes years before they would show up.

It could one day detect symptoms of depression or, on a much more consequential front, early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

“Biologically, your brain is designed to hide your weaknesses: It's an evolutionary effect,” Neurable's co-founder and CEO Ramses Alcaide, a neuroscientist, told me. “But when you're measuring from the source, you pick up those things as they're occurring, instead of once there's finally downstream consequences, and that's the real advantage of measuring the brain.”

Other major tech companies are also exploring ways to incorporate non-invasive brain-computer interfaces into headphones. A couple years ago, Apple quietly applied for a patent for an AirPod design that uses electrodes to monitor brain activity, and NextSense, which grew out of Google's moonshot division, wants to build earbud-based brain monitors for the mass market. There's also been a recent boom in activity around invasive brain-computer interfaces being developed by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink and even Meta that surgically implant chips into people's brains. It's safe to say that's not currently a mass-market approach.

Still, while all of those mega market cap companies ponder the possibilities of their own brain-powered projects, Neurable's is on the market. It's on my head right now, actually, and it works.

Spun out of the University of Michigan's Direct Brain Interface Lab in 2015, Neurable initially planned to break into the gaming industry. An early version of its technology used EEG sensors in a VR headset to power the world's first brain-controlled video game but pivoted to wearables before launching a wildly successful Indiegogo campaign for a futuristic set of headphones. That attracted the attention of major hardware makers and a partnership with Master & Dynamic.

The Master & Dynamic MW75 Neuro — the $700 pair of headphones I tested — looks like any other set of noise-canceling headphones, except for the badge that reads, “Powered by Neurable AI.” When you connect them to the Neurable app is when things get fun.

Inside the Neurable app is a little video game that lets you fly a rocket ship with your brain — and serves as a proof of concept. The trick is you have to focus on a set of numbers on the screen. The more intensely you focus, the higher the numbers go, and the faster the rocket ship flies. If you start to get distracted by, say, thinking about flying an actual rocket ship, the numbers go down, and the rocket ship slows. It's one of the coolest innovations I've ever seen, if only because it's so simple.

The EEG sensors in Neurable's products can pick up a range of brainwave frequencies, which are associated with different behaviors and activities. The beta frequency band provides some information about attention state as well as anxiety, while alpha indicates a mind at rest.

While EEG sensors and brain-computer interfaces are most often seen in labs, putting these sensors into a device that people wear every day stands to transform our understanding of the mind. “Non-invasive EEG is cheap and completely safe,” said Bin He, a professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, whose lab built a drone you can fly with your mind over a decade ago. “AI, or deep-learning technology, however has drastically improved the performance of [brain-computer interfaces] to read the minds of individuals.”

If you changed the technology's mission from measuring focus to, say, symptoms of depression, you could imagine how an everyday gadget could offer some life-changing interventions. The possibilities are as endless as the list of issues that can affect the brain. The Pentagon has been using Neurable's portable technology to study traumatic head injuries in soldiers, for instance, and that research could have practical applications in sports. Alcaide also mentioned Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as potential targets for their technology. Symptoms for these diseases don't appear for years after onset, but early markers could show up in the kind of EEG data their technology captures from everyday wear.

If you changed the technology's mission from measuring focus to, say, symptoms of depression, you could imagine how an everyday gadget could offer some life-changing interventions.

For now, however, the MW75 Neuro headphones are primarily used to sharpen your attention — with the new and added benefit of giving you a snapshot of your brain health. This involves starting a session with the headphones on and letting the sensors collect the electrical signals your brain's sending off. Your focus is measured as low, medium, or high, and when you're flagging for a while, the app will prompt you to take a break. You can also turn on a feature called Biofeedback, which plays music of varying intensity in order to nudge your focus toward the high range. The Brain Health reports are still in beta mode but will show you daily estimates of how you're doing in terms of things like anxiety resistance, cognitive speed, and wakefulness.

The way you know that the device isn't actually reading your mind comes down to science and a strong data policy. Neurable's technology picks up raw voltage — not actual thoughts — from your neurons and uses AI to decode the data and identify signals associated with focus, the company's co-founder Adam Molnar explained to me recently. Neurable encrypts and anonymizes the data coming out of your head and onto its sensors and then again when it goes to your phone, so it's far removed from any personal data. Furthermore, he said, Neurable has no ambitions to be a data company.

“Our business model doesn't depend on identity. We don't sell ads. So there's no benefit,” Molnar said. “It's actually more of a liability for us to be able to have data map back to an individual.”

It's hard for me to say how much more productive I became thanks to the brain-reading headphones. As with many other health trackers, there's sort of a placebo cat effect: Simply deciding to track the behavior changed my state of mind and made me behave a certain way. So, setting up a focus session inevitably made me pay closer attention to how well I was focusing, how often I took breaks, and if I was choosing to be more mindful.

This is actually what makes me so curious about an earbud version of what Neurable's doing. I wear AirPods for most of the day, whether it's taking calls for work, listening to podcasts, or just drowning out the sounds outside my Brooklyn apartment. If these earbuds were also collecting data about my cognitive well-being during all those activities, I'd be interested in knowing what I could glean from that information, if only to better understand what's rotting my brain. And I'm sure plenty of companies would be happy to collect more data about their users' states of mind at any given time. Imagine if the TikTok algorithm knew you weren't interested in something — not because you swiped through it but rather because your brainwaves said so.

Neurable's website has mockups of EEG-equipped earbuds, helmets, and smart glasses, and it's clear that the company is eager to move beyond its first product. The company doesn't just want to make gadgets, either. It wants to be the leading platform for brain-powered technology. “Just like Bluetooth is in every single device, and everyone should have access to Bluetooth, we believe that everyone should have access to neuro tech,” Alcaide told me.

We're years away from the most far-fetched applications of brain-computer interfaces, but we're heading in that direction.

“There's so many things you can do with neuro tech, whether it's tracking health conditions, whether it's controlling devices, whether it is understanding yourself better,” he said. “It would be a disservice to the world if the only solutions that came out were our own.”

Neurable is indeed one of many startups trying to bring neuro tech to the masses, although they're the only ones selling a product I'd actually wear in public. Several other EEG-based gadgets out there take the form of headbands, many of which are geared toward sleep health or meditation. A company called Emotiv, which also partnered with Master & Dynamic, will start selling its own EEG-equipped earbuds this fall. It remains to be seen if and when Apple will make brain-reading AirPods, but they've already partnered with a brain interface startup called Synchron, which allows people to control iPhones with their minds (Haven't you always wanted to become one with your iPhone?).

This is where we circle back to the point where science fiction meets reality. We're years away from the most far-fetched applications of brain-computer interfaces, but we're heading in that direction. Whether that future ends up looking miraculous or like a Black Mirror episode is up to us — and to the companies, like Neurable, pioneering it.

Politicizing economic data is dangerous.

On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a jobs report that upended the narrative pundits, journalists, government officials, and the White House had been repeating for months: The economy is doing just fine.

The numbers showed that the US economy added a modest 73,000 jobs in July, several thousand under what economists had forecasted. But the real surprise came in the revisions to data from May and June, which found the country added 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported.

President Donald Trump was outraged by the revisions, calling the data “a scam.” And he directed his anger towards BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

“We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.”

But Trump wasn't the only one who appeared to be stunned by the latest jobs report.

Kimberly Adams, senior Washington correspondent for Marketplace and the host of the Marketplace podcast Make Me Smart, told Vox that everyone in her business is getting whiplash.

“We were doing all of these stories about why is the economy so resilient? Why isn't anybody reacting to tariffs?” Adams said. “And then this week we're all talking about, my gosh, are we heading into stagflation and recession?”

Adams explained that the reason it seems like experts got it wrong is because a lot of the economic data in the United States relies on lagging indicators like the unemployment rate.

Below is an excerpt of Adams's conversation with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Why did the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics make up the statistics?

The head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up the labor statistics. It's literally shooting the messenger. The president of the United States was complaining on Truth Social and elsewhere that the reason for firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics has to do with the number and the scale of revisions.

The jobs numbers came in lower than expected last week, and they indicate that there's not the same kind of robust labor market that we thought we'd had over the last couple of months. But what drew even more attention were the revisions to the numbers from previous months. And they were pretty drastic revisions that shocked a lot of people.

These revisions tell us that the labor market we thought we had the last few months — that seemed to be pretty resilient against the tariffs and other changes President Trump and his administration were making in the economy — it wasn't actually as resilient as we thought.

I should say: Labor market numbers get revised all the time. GDP numbers get revised all the time to pick whatever economic indicator you want. But these revisions in particular were, a) really large, and b) just fundamentally changed the story of what the labor market looked like over the last couple of months.

So not only did the numbers tell us that there was less hiring than we thought there was, it also told us that the labor market itself shrank, that there was a lower labor force participation rate. A lot of people are blaming that on the crackdown on immigration. The report also told us that if it weren't for job growth in the tariff-resilient health care sector, we would have had almost no job growth at all.

But now that Donald Trump has fired the commissioner in charge of these job report numbers, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it'll all be okay again by the next jobs report in September? We all win?

I imagine that may be what the president wants to believe, that the numbers will be a bit more appealing. Almost all of the economists I talk to say that there's no reason whatsoever to believe that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is manipulating the numbers or that the numbers are rigged, as the president said.

There's been a huge backlash to this firing from the community of people that follow this stuff very closely. And putting in someone who might be a little bit more amenable to the president's narrative around economic data has the potential to undermine economic data in the United States and make it less trustworthy — both for businesses here in the US, as well as in the global economy.

And why does that matter? I mean, for people who don't pay attention to these numbers, why does trustworthy data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics matter to this country and to the world?

Because lots of different businesses and countries and even individuals use this data to make decisions about how they're going to manage their money, how they're going to manage their businesses, and how they're going to plan for the future.

So, for example, if you know that the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, which is what the numbers came in at last week, you can say that's a pretty low unemployment rate. And that means that most of the people out there who want jobs have jobs. And if we're going to hire, we're going to need to position ourselves well in the market to compete with the relatively few workers who are out there looking for a job.

This gets into one of the main reasons that this is on the agenda for a lot of folks, which is the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has two mandates: full employment and stable prices. Full employment basically means as near as you can get to it, low unemployment rates. Stable prices equates to a more or less 2 percent inflation rate. We are still trending a little bit above 2 percent inflation, but when the Fed met last week, which was before these jobs numbers came out, the unemployment situation looked pretty good. So they didn't have much of an incentive to do anything about interest rates, because inflation was still running a bit high. Unemployment looked fine, so no big deal. So let's leave interest rates until inflation cools down a bit more.

If the Fed had the information on Wednesday that they ended up getting on Friday, would that have changed their decision? Maybe.

The last time you were on this show, you were here to talk about the Fed. It has sounded for weeks now like Trump has been itching to fire Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed.

Who he hired!

Who he hired, thank you. He didn't end up firing Powell, but then he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Are the economists you're talking to afraid that this might not be the end of Trump getting rid of people who seem to disagree with his imaginary vision of what the numbers should be?

You're absolutely right. This is definitely creating an environment where folks are worried that even if people at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (or any other federal statistical agencies) are still putting their heads down, doing the work, and churning out the data without fear or favor — if they release a report that the president doesn't like, they might lose their job.

Even if they still do the work, other people and other entities might look at it and say, well, can it really be true?

Look at a country like China, which releases economic data about the performance of its economy all the time. And you'll always hear folks say, take it with a grain of salt because the Chinese Communist Party likes to mess with the numbers. That means lots of folks have to jump through all of these additional hoops to try to figure out what's actually going on in the Chinese economy.

China is one of the biggest economies in the world. What happens if we end up in the same boat?

In this article

Intel shares slipped Thursday after President Donald Trump called for the chipmaker's CEO to step down.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan ""is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem.""

Intel did not respond to a request for comment.

Tan was named as Intel CEO in March as the company tried to rebound from declining sales under the stewardship of Pat Gelsinger.

This week, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies and referenced a past criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan was CEO until 2021.

Cotton wrote to Intel's chair to ""express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security.""

""Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,"" Cotton wrote. ""Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.""

Cotton asked whether the company required Tan to divest from positions in chipmakers linked to the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and any other concerning entities in China.

Tan has invested in a number of Chinese companies, including some linked to the country's military, both directly or through venture funds, Reuters reported in April.

Intel beat revenue expectations when it reported financials for the second quarter in July, but announced several spending cuts.

In a memo, Tan announced cuts to the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and had an operating loss of $3.17 billion.

The company canceled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and consolidated testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. Tan also said Intel would slow construction of a chip factory in Ohio.

President Donald Trump on Thursday said he has ordered the U.S. Commerce Department to create a new U.S. census that excludes people who are in the country illegally.

The ""new and highly accurate CENSUS"" will be ""based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

""People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS,"" Trump added.

Trump's announcement marks his latest effort to reshape the survey, which every 10 years provides the bedrock data that is used to determine the number of seats in the U.S. House and distribute federal funds.

The post also comes as Trump backs an attempt by Texas Republicans to redraw their state's congressional map in order to boost their prospects in the 2026 midterm elections. Redistricting usually takes place every 10 years after the census is completed.

""We are entitled to five more seats"" in Texas, Trump said Tuesday in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

Those redistricting efforts hit a boiling point this week, when Democrats in Texas fled the state in an attempt to prevent a vote on the new map.

The president has previously sought to alter the census. He attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census during his first term in office, but the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the effort. Trump's campaign last year centered in part on mass deportations of those living in the U.S. without adequate legal documentation.

The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the president's post.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

The crypto market jumped Thursday on excitement that bitcoin and other digital assets could soon be coming to 401(k) retirement plans.

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) accounts to invest in alternative assets, including private equity, real estate and digital assets, CNBC has confirmed.

The price of bitcoin climbed around 1% to reclaim the $116,000 level for the first time since July 31. Ether rose almost 5%, also retaking a one-week high.

Crypto-linked stocks got a boost of energy as well. Coinbase gained 3%, Galaxy Digital advanced 6% and ether treasury stock Bitmine Immersion rose nearly 8%.

Widespread inclusion of bitcoin in Americans' retirement accounts has long been viewed as a holy grail for crypto adoption. Conceivably, it would make the cryptocurrency a mainstay of U.S. financial infrastructure, expand access and encourage longer-term investing in the asset. The retirement market is currently worth $43 trillion, almost $9 trillion of which is held in 401(k) plans. The crypto market cap is nearly $4 trillion today.

""That's a monster pool of capital. What we're seeing ... [is] the aperture of being able to buy crypto being widened and widened, [and] more avenues bringing people into the tent,"" Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday.

""When it becomes commonplace – when you can do it at the place you've already been doing business with, if its Fidelity or T. Rowe Price or whoever it is – you just pull more people into this ecosystem,"" he added.

Fidelity in 2022 became the first retirement plan provider to offer investors the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but the service hinges on employer adoption. Adoption since then has been low given that year's rate hike driven bear market, lingering regulatory risk from the previous administration, as well as general caution and skepticism from investors.

The executive order, first reported by Bloomberg, is the latest in a series of efforts under the Trump administration to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world."" In July, he signed stablecoin legislation known as the GENIUS Act into the first official U.S. crypto law.

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday to allow alternative assets such as private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate into 401(k)s, according to a senior White House official.

The executive order will direct the U.S. secretary of Labor to review fiduciary guidance on private market investments in 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. The federal law sets minimum standards for most retirement plans.

Trump has an executive order signing scheduled at noon. The development was first reported by Bloomberg News.

An executive order would mark a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has pushed for greater adoption of private assets in defined contribution plans under Trump's second term in office. Thought it also brings with it new risks for investors.

Bitcoin jumped Thursday in response to the news. Private equity stocks such as Apollo Group were slightly higher on Thursday in early trading.

Private market assets have traditionally been excluded from 401(k)s, even as they've been embraced by pension funds and university endowments, because their high fees, lack of transparency and longer lockup periods make them riskier investments.

Yet, private market exposure in 401(k) plans was considered permissible in 2020, when the Department of Labor under the first Trump administration issued an information letter saying it could be appropriate for defined contribution plans under certain conditions. The guidance was later affirmed by the Biden-directed agency.

Its presence has already grown. Asset managers and plan sponsors have created products for retirement vehicles in which Americans collectively hold roughly $8.7 trillion in assets, according to data on 401(k)s at the end of the first quarter of 2025 from the Investment Company Institute.

In June, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said it's launching a 401(k) target-date fund in the first half of 2026 that will include a 5% to 20% allocation to private investments. In May, Empower, the country's second-largest retirement plan provider, said it's joining asset managers such as Apollo to start allowing private assets in some accounts later this year.

The U.S. Department of Education is making the Free Application for Federal Student Aid available earlier than usual this year as a beta test, which experts say may address some of the bugs that have plagued previous application cycles.

The FAFSA serves as the gateway to all federal aid money for college-bound students, including federal student loans, work-study and grants.

The 2026-27 FAFSA is already available to a limited group of students in a beta test. Starting on Sept. 1, anyone can request to participate in the second phase of testing, according to an announcement from the Education Department.

All students will have access to the coming academic year's form at the beginning of October, in keeping with the typical start date.

""We're pleased to hear that Federal Student Aid has launched FAFSA beta testing sooner than expected,"" said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

""An earlier and longer testing window will give the Department of Education the time it needs to address any potential bugs or errors, with valuable feedback from applicants and financial aid professionals, which should lead to a smoother process when the application is opened to the broader public,"" Storey said.

Kim Cook, CEO of the National College Attainment Network, said she was ""pleased"" that beta testing for the new FAFSA is underway and that the new FAFSA is on track to open to the public on Oct. 1.

""All these positive changes portend that the high school class of 2026 will achieve an all-time high FAFSA completion rate by the time they graduate next spring,"" Cook said.

For many families, financial aid is essential when it comes to covering the cost of college, which has jumped significantly in recent decades. Grants — including federal ones such as the Pell Grant — have become the most crucial kind of assistance, because they typically do not need to be repaid.

The earlier families fill out the form, the better their chances are of receiving aid, since some financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, or from programs with limited funds, experts say.

Submitting a FAFSA is one of the best predictors of whether a high school senior will go on to college, according to the National College Attainment Network, or NCAN. Seniors who complete the FAFSA are 84% more likely to enroll in college directly after high school, according to an NCAN study of 2013 data. 

Yet, only 71% of families submitted the FAFSA for the 2024-25 academic year, down from 74% in the previous academic year, according to Sallie Mae's recent How America Pays for College report. That's in part because of previous complications with the new form, which initially launched in late December 2023 after a monthslong delay.

""Families reported having an easier time completing the FAFSA last year, but 58% indicated they still needed assistance, so having a head start can be beneficial especially for first time FAFSA filers,"" said Rick Castellano, a spokesperson for Sallie Mae.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Thursday said the highest dose of its daily obesity pill helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight, or roughly 27 pounds, at 72 weeks in a late-stage trial, paving the way for its entrance into the market.

The pill's weight loss was 11.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.

Shares of the company fell around 13% on Thursday. Meanwhile, shares of rival Novo Nordisk, which is also working to bring an obesity pill to the market, jumped more than 7% on Thursday.

The data comes under what some Wall Street analysts were expecting for Eli Lilly's oral GLP-1, with hopes for weight loss of around 15%. Some doctors said the results appear to be comparable to, but overall slightly lower, the level of weight loss seen with Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weekly GLP-1 injection for obesity, Wegovy.

Some doctors also made note of the number of patients on the highest dose of the pill who discontinued treatment due to side effects or any other reason in the trial.

Still, other doctors lauded the results and the potential of the pill to reach new patients, such as those who are afraid of needles. 

""This is a strong and promising result for an oral agent,"" said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center, calling the weight loss ""a significant and clinically meaningful outcome.""

""Injectables have set a high bar, but this study reinforces the potential for an oral GLP-1 to be transformative in obesity care, particularly for patients who are hesitant to start or maintain injectable therapies,"" he continued. 

Dr. Mihail ""Misha"" Zilbermint, director of Endocrine Hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said he believes the pill ""has the potential to be a game changer, as long as people can tolerate the side effects.""

The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most closely watched studies of the year, and follow positive data in April from a phase three trial examining the experimental pill in diabetes patients. They bring Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, one step closer to potentially becoming a new, needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. 

Eli Lilly is ""not disappointed with these results. It's right on thesis for us,"" despite being ""one or two points below what the Street had,"" CEO David Ricks told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.

""The goal was to create an oral pill that was convenient and can be made at a huge scale, really, for the mass market, and had weight loss that was competitive with other single-acting GLP-1s, and that's what we've achieved,"" Ricks said. He added that the pill's percentage of weight loss is ""in the range"" of what most people who are overweight or want to improve their metabolic health want to achieve.

Ricks said Eli Lilly expects to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year, with hopes of launching the pill around the world ""this time next year.""

That launch could fundamentally shift the space, helping more patients access the treatments and alleviating the supply shortfalls of existing injections. The more convenient and easier-to-manufacture pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as other drugmakers, including its main rival Novo Nordisk, race to bring weight loss pills to market. 

There are roughly 8 million patients on injectable obesity and diabetes drugs, but likely around 170 million who could benefit from the medicines, said Ken Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in an interview.

""In order to meet that demand, we're going to need other options, including oral small molecules like orforglipron, which use different means of production and also don't need as sophisticated of a supply chain to distribute it to patients,"" he said.

Dr. Amy Sheer, professor of medicine and program director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at the University of Florida, said she hopes the pill will be less expensive than existing injections, which are costly largely due to the devices they come in. She said lower prices could help eliminate barriers to access for patients, potentially making insurers more willing to cover the drug. 

Many insurers still don't cover GLP-1s for obesity. Wegovy and other drugs have list prices of roughly $1,000 before insurance. 

The highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill helped more than 59% of patients lose at least 10% of their body weight and more than 39% of patients lose at least 15% of their weight, according to the trial results. 

Almandoz said the proportion of people who achieved ""greater magnitudes"" of weight loss was ""very impressive for an oral agent,"" adding that many people ""often overlook the proportion of people achieving these high weight loss categories"" and typically focus closely on the average weight loss

Orforglipron also helped lessen cardiovascular risk factors.

But data on how well some patients tolerated the pill in the trial came under some analysts' estimates. 

About 10.3% of patients who took the highest dose of the pill — 36 milligrams — discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared with around 2.6% of those who took a placebo. Those side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, and mild to moderate in severity. An estimated 24% of those who took the highest dose experienced vomiting, while 33.7% and 23.1% had nausea and diarrhea, respectively.

Ahead of the data, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said he expected less than 10% of patients on the highest dose of the pill to discontinue treatment due to side effects and lower rates of vomiting, nausea and diarrhea.

More patients stopped taking the pill due to side effects compared with existing GLP-1s on the market, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The discontinuation rates due to side effects in late-stage trials on Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weekly obesity injection Zepbound are around 7% or less.

She noted that almost a quarter of patients on the highest dose of the pill discontinued treatment for any reason, cautioning that the enthusiasm for orforglipron should be tempered ""because we get all this excitement, and then the pill comes out, and then nobody can take it.""

It's unclear why, apart from side effects, those patients discontinued the pill. Nearly 30% of those on a placebo discontinued treatment for any reason.

Eli Lilly's Ricks said the company is not concerned about those dropout rates in the study.

""What we really want to see is that the medicine dropout rate is lower than placebo, and that's what we saw here,"" he said, referring to the discontinuation rates for any reason.

Ricks added that Eli Lilly was looking for a less than 12% dropout rate due to side effects, noting that the industry has seen 8% to 12% rates with GLP-1 drugs.

""We're right in the middle,"" he said. ""Continuation rates in this category, in all chronic drug categories, are not perfect. But the dropout from the drug is what we pay attention to, and here again, we're right on with the profile.""

The University of Florida's Sheer said she doesn't believe the discontinuation rates or side effects will be a deciding factor for physicians when prescribing the pill. 

She believes an oral option could actually make more physicians more comfortable prescribing a GLP-1 to patients. Some physicians are currently hesitant to prescribe injections because they ""may not know how to tell patients how to use them,"" Sheer added. 

Almandoz said prescribing decisions are going to depend on the patient's specific needs and preferences, as well as access and affordability. An injectable GLP-1 may be the preferred option for patients whose priority is a greater level of weight loss or those who have significant cardiometabolic complications, or health issues that arise from cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. 

But an oral GLP-1 could be the best fit for those who ""prioritize simplicity or convenience or have these logistical challenges with injections,"" he said.

The detailed results from the trial will be presented in September at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal. More phase three trial results on the pill will be shared later this year, including from a study on adults who have obesity or are overweight and have Type 2 diabetes.

Wegovy, Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus all work by targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to promote weight loss and regulate blood sugar. But unlike those other medications, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus does.

Eli Lilly is currently about three years ahead of other drugmakers developing pills, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Roche, Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics, Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez previously CNBC.

Some analysts expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s. Oral GLP-1s could grow to be worth $50 billion of that total, Fernandez said.

In this article

Peloton posted a surprise profit for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday and outlined its strategy to return to growth under new CEO Peter Stern. Shares gained 6% in early trading. 

The connected fitness company, known for its stationary bikes and treadmills, posted a net income of $21.6 million, compared with a loss of $30.5 million in the year-earlier period. That's thanks to better than expected sales but also, Peloton's efforts to cut its operating expenses, which Stern said in a letter to shareholders remain too high. 

In fiscal year 2026, which began in July, the company plans to reduce run-rate expenses by another $100 million, on top of the $200 million it cut in fiscal 2025. Half of those cuts will come from indirect costs, like renegotiating contracts with suppliers, but the other half will come from cutting 6% of its staff, the company said. 

""Our operating expenses remain too high, which hinders our ability to invest in our future,"" Stern wrote in the letter to shareholders. ""We are launching a cost restructuring plan intended to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of FY26 by reducing the size of our global team, paring back indirect spend, and relocating some of our work. This is not a decision we came to lightly, as it impacts many talented team members, but we believe it is necessary for the long-term health of our business.""

The latest round of layoffs comes just over a year after the company announced plans to cut 15% of its staff.

For the most recent quarter, Peloton beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $21.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales dropped to $607 million, down about 6% from a year earlier.

Ever since its pandemic heyday, Peloton has been working to cut costs, stabilize its business and generate free cash flow to ensure its business can survive. Eight months into Stern's tenure as Peloton's latest top executive, those efforts are starting to bear fruit. 

For the full year, the company generated $320 million in free cash flow, ahead of its own internal expectations, and its guidance implies a path to revenue growth in the back half of the year. Overall, operating expenses were down 25% in fiscal 2025, with meaningful cuts to sales and marketing as well as research and development, metrics investors and analysts have long said were too high for the size of Peloton's business.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating expenses were down 20% compared to the same quarter a year prior, led by a 28% decline in sales and marketing expenses, a 20% drop in research and development costs and a 33% decline in general and administrative costs.

Peloton has also made strides in reducing its debt, which it restructured last year to stave off an imminent liquidity crunch. In fiscal 2025, its net debt declined 43%, or by $343 million, compared to the year-earlier period, bringing net debt to $459 million when cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from its total debt of about $1.5 billion.

For Peloton's current quarter, it's expecting sales to be between $525 million and $545 million, weaker than the $560 million than analysts had forecast, according to LSEG. However, for the full year, its expecting sales of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, in line with expectations of $2.41 billion, according to LSEG. 

The current quarter is forecast to be worse than expected, largely because it falls during the summer months when people tend to pause their subscriptions and pull back on new workout gear. But the remainder of the year implies improving sales patterns in the quarters ahead. 

During the most recent quarter, Peloton sold more bikes and treadmills than Wall Street expected, posting connected fitness revenue of $198.6 million, well ahead of the $170.3 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Subscription revenue came in a bit light at $408.3 million, behind forecasts of $411 million, according to StreetAccount. 

Improving top-line metrics, which allows Peloton to better leverage its fixed costs, led to a 5.6 percentage point increase to its gross margin, which was 54.1% during the quarter, compared to 48.5% in the year ago period. 

Notably, its hardware segment, which has long been a drain on Peloton's performance, is steadily getting more profitable. Peloton's gross margin for hardware was 17.3%, a 9 percentage point increase from the year-ago period, driven by a shift toward more profitable products and decreases in service and repair, warehousing and transportation costs.

The company's subscription gross margin grew by 3.7 percentage points to 71.9% but was helped by a one-time balance sheet adjustment related to music royalties costs. Excluding that benefit, subscription gross margin would have been 69.2%.

The gains that Peloton has made in improving its profits are expected to continue, but will be hampered by new 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on products made with aluminum, as well as other duties that touch parts of the company's supply chain. The company is expecting tariffs to impact free cash flow by $65 million in the year ahead and as a result, is expecting to generate $200 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2026, below what it achieved in fiscal 2025. 

In Stern's letter to shareholders, there were no explicit plans to raise prices on subscriptions or hardware, but he said the company will rework its use of promotions and ""adjust prices"" to reflect its high costs. 

""For example, we will introduce optional expert assembly fees to reflect the real costs of installing our equipment, while extending free self-install to include our Tread and Row, thereby preserving Member choice and control,"" Stern wrote. 

Now that cash flow and some metrics are starting to stabilize, Stern is ready to talk about growth and outlined his vision to get there in his letter to shareholders. To offset the high costs of acquiring customers online, Peloton is returning to physical retail but this time, it'll open up micro-stores, rather than the sprawling showrooms it had in its early days. In fiscal 2025, it closed 24 retail showrooms, reducing its footprint of larger stores from 37 to 13 by the end of the fourth quarter.

Peloton plans to expand its micro-stores, from a count of one to 10, as well as grow its secondary marketplace for pre-owned hardware, Stern said. It also plans to increase the presence of its instructors at in-person events by three times this year, with the goal of increasing it by 10 times in fiscal 2027, he added.

Peloton also intends to expand further beyond the bike.

""We plan to support our members' wellness journey by expanding our offerings and strength where we are already a category leader, mental wellbeing, sleep, recovery, and over time, nutrition and hydration,"" Stern said on Thursday's earnings call. ""We will employ advanced technologies like AI to enhance our ability to serve as personalized coaches.""

Stern said the company will also work more closely with Precor, the fitness company it acquired under founder John Foley, by creating a ""unified commercial business unit."" He also said the company will start building a plan to expand internationally – a goal that Peloton has long had but has failed to execute profitably. 

""Internationally, we plan to deliver local, in-language experiences using a mix of native instruction, AI dubbing, and more flexible approaches to music for thousands of classes,"" Stern wrote. ""Through partnerships, we aim to introduce the Peloton brand and experiences to millions of people around the world. Together, we believe these actions lay the groundwork for future, cost-effective launches of the full Peloton offering in new geographies.""

Duolingo shares skyrocketed more than 30% after the language-learning platform boosted its guidance due to strong user growth driven by artificial intelligence.

The mobile learning platform hiked its full-year guidance to between $1.01 billion and $1.02 billion, up from a prior range of $987 million to $996 million. Duolingo also lifted its bookings guidance to between $1.15 billion and $1.16 billion.

""We exceeded our own high expectations for bookings and revenue this quarter, and did it while expanding profitability,"" said co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn in a release.

Daily active users jumped 40% to nearly 48 million from about 34 million in the year-ago period.

In an effort to expand its course offerings and boost users, Duolingo has implemented AI tools, including a video-call conversation practice feature for some paying subscribers. The company has also expanded beyond language learning with a new course such as chess.

Duolingo also announced the acquisition of London-based music gaming startup NextBeat for an undisclosed amount as it looks to broaden its app products.

The company's CEO said Duolingo is still in the early stages of its growth trajectory.

Revenues jumped about 41% year over year to $252 million and beat a Wall Street estimate of $241 million. Net income grew 84% from a year ago to about $45 million, or 91 cents per share.

For the third quarter, Duolingo projects revenues between $257 million and $261 million, surpassing the $253 million forecast from Wall Street analysts.

With Thursday's moves, the stock is up more than 34% this year.

Business leaders are scrambling to get their head around a new era of tariff complexity.

The bemused mood among European chief executives on Thursday came as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to reshape the global trading system in America's favor.

The Trump administration slapped higher tariff rates of between 10% to 50% on dozens of trading partners just after midnight ET, following months of delays and extensions.

As of Thursday, most imports into the U.S. will now face a baseline tariff rate of 10%, although the overall tariff effective tariff rate is estimated to have climbed to more than 17%, according to the Yale Budget Lab think tank. That represents the highest level of tariffs since 1935, during the Great Depression.

Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco said on Thursday that he was ""confused"" by Trump's tariff announcements, according to Reuters. He reportedly added on a press call that the U.S. tariff blitz appeared to be ""part of the game, to create chaos.""

The Swiss insurer, which does not expect a new era of global trade rivalry to impact its business, said it was well positioned over the coming months.

""Look, what is important for business is to have clarity and to have decisions. Business adapts and adjusts itself and we are prepared to any kind of conditions in the market, as we have done in the past, but clarity is very important,"" Greco told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

Oliver Bate, CEO of German insurance giant Allianz, shared Greco's assessment of the tariff situation.

""If you are not confused, I don't know what confuses a human being. But we have to see through the confusion,"" Bate told CNBC.

""So, I can talk about being confused but our customers expect us to provide protection to them. Second, it doesn't affect us very much directly. The thing that does affect us on the accounting level is the volatility around foreign exchange and the potential volatility in financial markets,"" he added.

Major trading partners, such as the U.K., Japan and South Korea, have secured deals to get lower tariffs than those announced by Trump in early April. The European Union has also struck a framework agreement to lower tariffs on most EU goods to 15%.

Other countries have been hit harder by Trump's trade war. The U.S. has imposed levies of 50% on goods from Brazil, 39% on Switzerland, 35% on Canada and 25% on India.

Carsten Knobel, CEO of German consumer goods and adhesives maker Henkel, described the current market environment as ""very challenging and uncertain.""

""This is reflected due to the geopolitical tensions but also the trade and tariff conflicts — and also the military escalations we see in a lot of countries,"" Knobel told CNBC on Thursday.

Worries about a lack of trade certainty was a common thread during earnings season.

""One of the things that for us, if I look at the medium to long term outlook, is certainly a concern is the lack of certainty,"" Vincent Clerc, CEO of Danish shipping giant Maersk, told CNBC.

""One thing is having to deal with baseline tariffs or tariff regime that you know you can count on when you're making investment decisions or when you're making strategic decisions,"" Clerc said.

""What we feel from a lot of our customers is that this uncertainty is causing a delay on investments and could have an impact on global growth and global demand as people are waiting to see what is the right decision.""

Maersk, widely considered a barometer for global trade, said a sustained period in which businesses can get to grips with the announced trade deals would help customers manage a new phase of globalization.

Siemens CEO Roland Busch, meanwhile, welcomed the passing of the latest tariff deadline, while making clear the development was likely to have a limited impact on the business.

""The most important point was, of course, to have certainty now, which is good. We would have wished for lower tariffs. We are clear for global trade but the impact on our Siemens business for this current fiscal year is minor,"" Busch said.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

If refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed — and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.

This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S., bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: ""They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy.""

Despite Trump's tone, ""while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach,"" Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. ""What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals."" 

After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.

Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.

""We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer,"" Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, ""we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap.""

He added: ""In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices.""

If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, ""global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers,"" a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.

India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.

Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.

While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called ""sour"") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals.

But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.

India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo — but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.

The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.

In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.

""Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes,"" Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. 

""Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught,"" he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.

That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has been attempting to stave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs — the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies — could burden that mission.

But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.

Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a ""flurry"" of tenders to buy spot crude.

A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.

""It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America,"" Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. ""Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations."" 

Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur (""sweet"") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.

We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.

""At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington,"" Rystad's Sahdev summed up.

Trump told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does ""very little business with India because their tariffs are so high.""

India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead.

Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't ""really behave in the same way"" as China's.

Trump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India. This brings the total levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set to take effect on Thursday.

Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter ""fueling"" Russia's war machine. Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediately could cause a spike in global crude oil prices.

Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars. Investment house UBS estimates that $8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerable to the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs may diminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S. relative their peers in the region.

Indian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.

Both the benchmark Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

In this article

After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers. 

On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are ""building in the United States.""

As semiconductors represent an over $600 billion industry at the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight. 

However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. 

""It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,""  Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. 

""The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point."" 

One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption. 

The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.

If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of ""continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,"" Sullivan said. 

Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMC announced it would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion. 

Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix — which have both committed investments in the U.S. — were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs.

Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear. 

Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia,"" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at  Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.

For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors — only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with. 

""What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,"" Rasgon asked. 

The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started a national security investigation of semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector was exempted from Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

The vague language from the Trump administration — though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations — could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. 

Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain. 

Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S. 

""Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,"" he said. 

Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Google, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans. 

According to a recent report from ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and ""big data.""

In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas. 

The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.

India's stock market showed little sign of panic a day after the U.S. announced a 50% tariff on goods from the country and threatened secondary sanctions over its continued oil trade with Russia.

The Sensex, the benchmark index for India's blue-chip stocks, ended the day around 0.1% higher on Aug. 7.

From bureaucrats to businesses, there's a broad consensus in India that the latest escalation from the U.S. is only a pressure tactic to fast-track trade talks. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi now has something he didn't have, even a day earlier: the support of the Indian opposition to push back. 

Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India's largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, described the penalty for Russian oil purchases as ""economic blackmail"" by Trump. 

Consequently, the Indian negotiators' resolve may only get stronger, especially in talks over areas that directly affect the country's farmers.

""India will never compromise on the interests of the country's farmers, fishermen, and livestock breeders. I know it will cost me personally, but I am ready,"" Modi said on Thursday morning, hours after the U.S. increased tariffs.

By most estimates, the cost of losing trade with the U.S. is significant for India but not debilitating.

The most pessimistic estimate is from Morgan Stanley. It says that if all goods are subject to a 50% duty, the impact on India's gross domestic product is likely to be 60 basis points, about $23 billion at current exchange rates.

On the other hand, the cost of allowing U.S. dairy exports into India — one of the most contentious issues— is expected to cost India 1.8 lakh crore rupees ($20 billion) alone, according to SBI Research, a unit of the country's largest bank. A little over half of that burden will hit farmers directly in the form of falling retail prices, SBI said, unless the government compensates for the loss.

The additional tariffs could also be catastrophic for India's gem and jewelry companies, a spokesperson for the industry lobby told CNBC-TV18 on Thursday, while Indian seafood exporters, who sell the bulk of their produce to the U.S., may lose nearly $3 billion a year at the 25% tariff effective today, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. 

India's labour-intensive textile industry, meanwhile, expects $5 billion worth of business to move away from India in the next few months due to the tariffs. 

High U.S. duties will also affect India's ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), according to Arvind Sanger from Geosphere Capital Management, a New York-based broker.

India's position is bolstered by the fact that over 60% of its GDP comes from domestic consumption, however. 

The Indian rupee will be the immediate casualty, according to Mahesh Patil, who oversees more than 3 lakh crore rupees ($35 billion) worth of financial assets at the Mumbai-based Aditya Birla Mutual Fund as its chief investment officer. However, Patil also noted that the rupee settling at lower levels against the U.S. dollar may offset some of the hit on Indian exporters, and the impact may be visible with a lag of a few months.

About 40% of India's entire trade with the U.S. is in services, which is not even a point of discussion so far as the U.S. exports more services to India than it imports. Trump also hasn't paid heed to the call for curbs on the H1-B visa, which is a route mostly used by Indian nationals looking to fill talent gaps — particularly in the tech sector — in the U.S. 

Amid Trump's threat of secondary sanctions on India, Modi is planning his first visit to China since 2018. And, close on the heels of U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is visiting Russia in an effort to pursue India's interests through diplomacy.

Meanwhile, India's foreign ministry has hit out at what it calls U.S. hypocrisy in ignoring its own trade with Russia that has continued through the war in Ukraine, an allegation that Trump brushed aside but didn't deny. It's also important to note that Indian companies own stakes in many Russian oil fields. 

Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, has also alleged that India uses the dollars from trade with America to pay for Russian oil, however most of India's oil trade with Russia is settled in dirhams, the currency of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), refiners have told CNBC-TV18.

India has been a lot more willing than Brazil and China to find a middle ground with the U.S.

The government has already reduced duties on imports of U.S. motorcycles, bourbon, ethernet switches, synthetic flavoring essences and fish hydrolysate, to name a few. It has also allowed Tesla to set up shop in Mumbai and withdrew the equalization levy on internet giants, widely known as the Google tax.

India has also increased its oil purchases from the U.S. by 120% in the last six months, source in the Indian government told CNBC-TV18, which was one of Trump's primary demands when Modi visited the White House in February 2025.

However, since then, Trump has moved the goalposts from just reducing the U.S.' trade deficit with India to the South Asian country's relationship with Russia. 

Trump has said India's purchases of Russian oil are why it's now facing tariffs of 50%, with this full rate due to be imposed 21 days after Trump's executive order was signed Wednesday.

Despite this, New Delhi's tone and rhetoric have been milder than the statements coming from Beijing or Rio De Janeiro, but it's also sticking to its red lines. India is keen to use the 21 days before to find a win-win situation, a government official told CNBC-TV18.

While the Indian government hasn't hinted at any escalation on its end, some experts believe that India has some legal options at its disposal.

""It is important that we talk to our trading partners and like-minded countries who have been hit by similar actions by the U.S.,"" Anjali Prasad, the former Indian ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said. 

""Only when we get together, decide on a strategy, will there be some action effectively possible, because there is strength in numbers.""

The fact that Trump is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, meanwhile, shows that the U.S.' priority is to end Russia's war on Ukraine.

If there's a breakthrough in talks between Trump, Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, India's oil purchases from Russia might no longer be a problem.

The incentive for India to watch and wait, instead of rushing with concessions, is right there.

U.S. President Donald Trump's so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs took effect on Thursday, imposing higher duties on many of the country's trading partners' exports to the U.S.

""IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"" Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

In an earlier post Trump had said the tariffs were targeting ""COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS.""

Trump last week — ahead of his Aug. 1 tariffs deadline — rejigged the tariff rates and pushed back the deadline to Aug. 7.

Some of the steepest duties include Syria's 41%, and Laos and Myanmar's 40% rate, while Switzerland — after being unsuccessful in a last-minute scramble for a deal — is facing 39% tariffs.

Swiss negotiators this week travelled to Washington D.C. for talks after the country's higher rate came as a surprise to many, but so far, no deal appears to have been agreed. An update is expected from the Swiss government later on Thursday.

Separately, Brazil and India are both now facing duties of 50%. While Brazil's tariffs appear to have kicked in, India's rate is at 25% for now, and will rise to 50% later this month, according to an executive order signed Wednesday. Trump said his tariffs on India are related to its current purchases of Russian oil.

Other countries and regions, meanwhile, have been able to strike trade agreements with the U.S. This includes the European Union, Japan and South Korea — which all now face 15% tariffs — as well as the U.K., which negotiated a 10% rate.

Others, including China and Mexico, remain in limbo. China is engaged in something of a trade truce with the U.S. for now, while previously announced rates for Mexico are on pause.

Trump's latest tariff announcements — including higher duties on India and threats of 100% tariffs on chips — show ""this game is not over,"" according to Bill Papadakis, macro strategist at Lombard Odier.

""There has been some optimism building recently because the overall level of uncertainty has come down,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday, pointing out that several deals have been made and Trump has walked back some of his threats.

""But we shouldn't be overly optimistic either,"" he warned, as the impact of tariffs on economic growth and inflation is not yet clear.

Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors, noted that sharp duties like the ones faced by India and Switzerland should not come as a surprise.

""You just watch how Trump is treating neighbors, Canada, and then you can imagine all the rest. So welcome to this new world,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

Wittmann also weighed in on Switzerland, as it scrambles to lower its tariff rate.

""What should Switzerland do? Realize that we live in a world of policymakers and these other three superpowers — China, EU and the U.S., and all the rest — are in various degrees, takers,"" he said.

""So the only thing you can do is short-term accommodate, be flexible, be adaptive. But you know, structurally, you have to become stronger yourself and more independent.""

Oops, something went wrong

Major cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks were rallying early Thursday ahead of President Trump's expected signing of an executive order that would allow alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and private equity into the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose more than 2% near 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, while ether (ETH-USD) and XRP (XRP-USD) were both up more than 4%. Shares of Coinbase (COIN), the biggest publicly traded crypto exchange, were up as much as 3%. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) shares each rose more than 1.5%.

President Trump's executive order, expected to be signed around 12:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to Reuters, will direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the use of alternative assets in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts.

The order would mark a major shift in retirement investments, opening up the traditionally staid industry to more speculative and sometimes illiquid investments. Typically, most 401(k) participants are offered a mix of stock or bond funds or index products in which to invest.

Large-scale alternative assets firms, including BlackRock and KKR, have expressed support for the move, which would open up the multitrillion-dollar retirement account industry to a broader mix of the funds these firms manage.

""Private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns,"" BlackRock chairman Larry Fink wrote in his latest annual investor letter.

""We need to make it clear: Private assets are legal in retirement accounts. They're beneficial. And they're becoming increasingly transparent.""

The executive order builds on recent crypto momentum in Washington coming off Congress's ""Crypto Week"" in July, where the two chambers worked to get the Clarity, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC Acts past their respective votes.

The GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump on July 18, establishes a regulatory framework for the use of stablecoins like Tether.

The Clarity Act, which seeks to define regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to block the Federal Reserve from establishing central bank cryptocurrencies, have both passed in the House of Representatives and are now awaiting votes in the Senate.

Since Donald Trump was reelected as president, Washington, D.C., has made many moves to become friendlier with the world of cryptocurrency. From new laws to executive orders, the Trump administration and Congress are moving quickly to make the U.S. a leader in digital assets innovation. Another example arrived on Thursday when Trump said he would sign an EO that broadens the availability of crypto and other alternative assets in retirement plans.

Is it a good thing? Some advisors, led most notably by Ric Edelman, say that investors should hold as much as 40% of their portfolio in digital assets (primarily as an update on the 60% stock-40% bond investment model). That's a big move, as just a few years ago, Edelman recommended as little as 1% in crypto like bitcoin and ethereum. Other advisors say the risks still outweigh the potential benefits.

Cryptocurrency isn't new, with a history now dating back almost two decades, but it continues to disrupt the markets. Cryptocurrency ETFs are one example, experiencing explosive growth, all the while evolving at a rapid pace in investment strategy. Crypto ETFs have seen record inflows this year, at roughly $13 billion, making them one of the most popular portfolio choices within the ETF universe, and led by flagship bitcoin ETFs such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Ethereum ETFs are growing too, with Van Eck's Ethereum ETF (ETHV) now over $200 million in assets.

ETFs offer convenience for the long-term investor as a way to gain exposure to the asset class without holding an underlying cryptocurrency and needing to open a crypto wallet or use a crypto exchange. It's like owning a gold ETF, such as GLD, rather than actually owning the metals contract. 

""From our perspective, demand is really strong, investors are really interested,"" said Eric Pan, CEO of ICI, the fund industry trade association, on a recent edition of CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

""And we have a new regulatory environment here in Washington that is encouraging this kind of innovation,"" Pan added.

Bitcoin and ethereum have generated strong returns, though not without their fair share of volatility to match the gains. For example, IBIT and ETHV have generated roughly 20% and 11% in returns year-to-date, respectively. 

Both cryptocurrencies popped on the news about Trump pushing the government to make them broadly available in 401(k) plans.

July was a winning month, in particular, for ether and bitcoin ETFs, which have had $5 billion and $6 billion inflows during the month, out of a ETF industry cumulative haul of $55 billion in net new money from investors.

But within the world of retirement plans, access to crypto ETFs remains limited. Retirement plans that offer self-directed brokerage window options alongside company-sponsored 401(k)s and individual IRAs already offer investors ways to invest in crypto like bitcoin.

But as more crypto ETFs hit the market, it also ratchets up the risk for investors if they don't distinguish carefully between the options. 

One of those evolutions within crypto space has been leveraged funds, which provide double or triple exposure to individual digital currencies, such as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), which provides double exposure to Ripple's XRP. 

Leveraged and inverse ETFs have ballooned as an asset class, offering a way for traders to make big bets on some of the market's most popular assets, like tech stocks, whether they want to bet the asset is going to increase or decrease in value on any given day. But these types of funds are not meant for the faint of heart, the risk-averse, or, most importantly, to be held as a long-term investments.

""This is an aggressive product, it's leveraged, it's not designed to be bought and held, it's designed to be traded each day,"" said Sal Gilberte, Teucrium Trading's president, on the recent edition of CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

Similar funds, such as ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) and the Volatility Shares Trust XRP ETFs (XRPI & XRPT), rely on derivatives rather than holding XRP outright. The exposure provided via such funds comes at a lower cost than buying equivalent holdings.

While leverage funds offer the potential for big returns, double or triple the market return, they also increase the risk factor, which is why investors need to be savvy and ""understand what they're owning"", Gilberte said. 

Losses can multiply quickly.

If investors are looking for a steady exposure to crypto, non-leveraged crypto ETFs such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF or VanEck Ethereum ETF might be better options. 

""They should buy a fund that just holds the token, and goes up and down with the token very smoothly with no leverage whatsoever,"" Gilberte said.

 Ether outpaces Solana and Bitcoin in capital inflows and futures dominance, with $4,000 retest in the cards. 

Key takeaways:

Capital rotation favors Ether as “Hot Capital Ratio” hits a yearly low for Solana.

ETH futures dominance grows with open interest hitting $58 billion.

ETH eyes $4,000, backed by low funding rates and strong spot accumulation. 

Ether (ETH) has emerged as the primary beneficiary of capital rotation within the altcoin market. 

According to Glassnode, the SOL/ETH Hot Capital Ratio, a measure of short-term realized capital movement, has declined to a year-to-date low of 0.045, marking a 42% drop since April. 

This suggests that while ETH and SOL saw inflows in July, capital flow is now favoring Ether.

The Hot Realized Cap metric shows which asset short-term speculators are favoring. With the ETH/SOL trading pair in a multimonth downtrend, the data signals “a fading but notable ETH-led rotation,” Glassnode said. 

Another bullish sign for Ether is the ETH/BTC pair, which is also back to multimonth highs, rising above the 200-day exponential moving average for the first time in over two years. 

As Cointelegraph reported, ETH price rebounded to its average trading range while Bitcoin continues to face heavy selling at $116,000 and below.

Ether's open interest (OI) recently reached an all-time high of $58 billion. This surge in OI, alongside Ethereum's record-high daily transaction count, reflects more money entering the market and increasing network participation. 

Additionally, Ethereum's share of total OI across major exchanges has climbed to 34.8%, while Bitcoin's declined from 59.3% to 47.1%.

However, while ETH has yet to reclaim the key $4,000 resistance level, futures funding rates suggest the rally has room to run. 

Current aggregated funding rates remain significantly lower than during previous attempts to breach $4,000 in March and December 2024. In fact, compared to March, funding rates have nearly halved.

This dynamic is bullish for two key reasons: First, lower funding rates indicate that traders are not overly leveraged to the long side, reducing the risk of sudden liquidation. 

Second, it shows that the current price action is being driven more by spot demand (led by Ether treasury companies) rather than excessive speculative positioning.

In fact, NovaDius president Nate Geraci highlights,

Ether price corrected by 9.72% over the past seven days after rallying for five consecutive weeks. ETH has swiftly recovered 9% since, retesting $3,800 on Thursday. 

With $4,000 in sight, crypto analyst Jelle notes that the psychological level “has been resistance since forever.” The analyst said:

XRP Ledger's Ethereum sidechain could lead to more experimentation within the network's ecosystem, while potentially attracting fresh talent, according to Ripple CTO David Schwartz.

A lot of Ethereum-based applications are “just garbage,” but developers' overarching focus on experimentation “is good,” and could benefit XRP Ledger, he told Decrypt in a recent interview.

“The XRP Ledger's set of developers is not as big as I think it should be,” he said, attributing part of that to the fact that “we don't have programmability at layer-1.”

In June, Ripple said that XRP Ledger was entering a multi-chain era with the debut of the XRPL EVM Sidechain. The network supports smart contracts, allowing people to create applications in the same way that they would on Ethereum, while using XRP as its native token.

“If you understand Solidity and building on the EVM platform, you're welcome here,” Schwartz said, referring to Ethereum's primary programming language.

In April, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick penciled in a year-end price target of $5.50 for XRP, saying the cryptocurrency is “positioned at the heart” of cross-border and cross-currency payments. However, he flagged a “small number of developers” within XRP Ledger's ecosystem as one of the biggest headwinds for the token.

XRP Ledger's ecosystem has 168 total developers, while Ethereum and Solana are home to around 8,500 and 4,000 developers, respectively, according to Developer Report. 

“I think it is fair to say that we haven't been quite as successful in terms of the sort of number of developers,” he said. “We definitely are trying to attract more developers.”

Alongside the networks mainnet debut, Ripple said that the Ethereum-compatible network unlocks new possibilities within XRP Ledger's ecosystem, including apps that are dedicated to lending and tokenization. They can also tap into “XRPL's deep liquidity,” it said.

Bitcoin ETFs Pull In $91.6M, Snapping Four-Day Outflow Streak

So far, the XRPL EVM Sidechain has gotten off to a quiet start, but Schwartz said Ripple is trying to “encourage people with grants, community funding, [and] driving institutional adoption.” 

As of Wednesday, XRPL's EVM sidechain had $94,000 worth of assets being used within DeFi applications, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. The most popular application was Moai Finance, a decentralized exchange with $54 in trading volume over the past day.

Oops, something went wrong

Sharplink Gaming plans to raise roughly $200 million to add Ethereum to its corporate treasury, the company said Thursday in a statement.

The ETH treasury firm has entered into an agreement to sell its common stock to four institutional investors, with shares priced at $19.50 each. The offering is expected to close on August 8, if the deal's closing conditions are met.

This deal brings the online gambling marketing firm closer to its goal of holding 1% of all Ethereum in circulation.

“Sharplink is proud to be joined by globally-recognized institutional investors, augmenting our strong existing investor base and further validating our mission to be the world's leading ETH treasury,” Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom said Thursday in a statement.

Sharplink Gaming did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for additional comment.

The raise comes as a growing number of public companies pivot to corporate strategies focused on accumulating massive amounts of cryptocurrencies, following the lead of Michael Saylor's software firm Strategy. As part of that trend, several Ethereum treasury firms have emerged over the past year, catapulting Ethereum to its highest price in roughly two years.

Ethereum was recently trading at $3,812, just 22% below its record price of $4,878 that it touched during the bull run of 2021, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Sharplink held 521,939 ETH worth $1.9 billion as of August 3, according to its filings with federal regulators. The company initiated its Ethereum-accumulation strategy in June of this year.

Bitcoin ETFs Pull In $91.6M, Snapping Four-Day Outflow Streak

As the treasury firm nears 1,000 ETH in total holdings, bettors are wagering on whether the company will meet or exceed that benchmark. Fifty-five percent of bettors on Myriad Markets, an events-contract platform, have wagered that Sharplink will not accumulate at least one million ETH before mid-September.

Myriad is owned by Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.

Whether Sharplink snaps up one million ETH tokens by mid-September, it already boasts of one of the world's largest Ethereum treasuries. The largest ETH treasury firm is the Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion, which holds roughly $2.9 billion in ETH, according to publicly available data.

Binance sees sharp spike in altcoin deposits. Potential precursor to BTC rotation?



Altcoins saw a broad-based rotation in July. Despite the rally, rising exchange inflows and BTC.D stalling below 63% suggest traders may be exiting into strength.

July marked a decisive shift in crypto market structure. 

Total crypto market cap surged 13.3%, driven by Bitcoin [BTC] retesting all-time highs. But the headline move: Ethereum [ETH]-led rotation, fueled by a record 19-day streak of net inflows into spot ETH ETFs.



What followed? Despite BTC's headline rally, Bitcoin dominance [BTC.D] dropped 5.2% to 60.6%, while altcoin dominance spiked 10% to 39.2%, marking the strongest rotation since early 2021.

Zooming in on leadership dynamics, Ethereum dominance [ETH.D] spiked over 12%, reclaiming levels not seen since the “Trump pump,” with the BTC–ETH ratio widening as capital flowed down the risk curve. 

However, while Ethereum led the charge, the rotation spread broadly across the market, with altcoin dominance steadily eating into Bitcoin's share.

TOTAL3 (the market cap excluding BTC and ETH) saw a $100 billion+ influx post-BTC ATH, signaling aggressive flows into the long tail of altcoins, with traders clearly chasing momentum across outliers.

Since tapping a $1.07 trillion local top, TOTAL3 has rolled over to $980 billion, logging roughly $20 billion in outflows over the past two weeks. At the same time, BTC.D printed two strong weekly green candles.

Adding to that, a fresh CryptoQuant readout flagged a sharp spike in altcoin deposits to Binance. According to the report, the 7-day transaction count has ripped past 45k, marking the highest since late 2024.

What stands out is the timing. BTC remains just under ATH levels, yet altcoins are seeing a surge in inflows. Historically, similar spikes (March and November 2024)  preceded drawdowns across both BTC and alts.

Source: CryptoQuant

Adding to the signal, BTC.D flipped red on the week, stalling below 63%. While it hints at altcoin rotation, the aggressive inflows suggest traders may be exiting into strength, not rotating.

In short, the market's at a key pivot.

July's rally pushed risk assets into overbought levels, with altcoins looking stretched. ETH down 3% signals momentum fading. If this stalls out further, we're likely looking at a cooldown phase before any fresh breakout.

Long-term Tron ($TRX) holders recently realized a hefty $1.4B in profits. They're cashing out as the token continues to outpace the crypto bigwigs – even $BTC and $ETH – in annual returns.

In a recent X post, Glassnode analysts announced that profit-taking on $TRX has surged, with nearly $1B in profits realized since Saturday.

It marks the second-largest $TRX profit-taking event of 2025, driven mainly through HODLers who've held the token for 3–5 years, likely since the 2020–2021 cycle.

The tweet also announced that the $TRX sellers were ‘exiting into strength,' as on-chain data showed profit-taking as opposed to panic.

Over the past month, $TRX has risen by over 18% and remains strong, currently priced at $0.3390.

It remains one of the best-performing cryptos. Since last year, it has risen by ~171%, surpassing $BTC (~103%) and $ETH (~55%) in overall gains during that time frame.

Cryptorank data found that $TRX's positive performance is due to several factors. Firstly, in Q2 2024, its Layer 1 TRON blockchain generated its highest revenue to date, reaching nearly $1B in revenue.

Such strong financial performance reflects a rise in on-chain activity and sustained ecosystem growth.

Secondly, TRON has witnessed strong user engagement in the first half of the year, ranking third in average daily active addresses. The network's ahead of BNB Chain, Base, and Apton, and behind only Solana and Near.

Another third factor includes TRON's $USDT supply jumping by 41% to $81.2B, making it the leading network for Tether. Partly owing to this, TRON is placed #3 in total stablecoin transfer volume.

Accordingly, it's great news for the broader altcoin market, especially projects with novel utility and ongoing on-chain activity, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and WELF ($WELF).

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). By doing so, it makes Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and dApp-friendly.

When you bridge native $BTC to the network, the system will mint wrapped tokens on the L2. This is so the assets can be used across dApps, among other services (DeFi trading, staking, swapping, NFT marketplaces, gaming) built on the Hyper ecosystem.

Although the L2 isn't going live until sometime this quarter, it's already attracting notable attention. Since the Bitcoin Hyper presale launched on 16 May 2025, it has scooped up over $7.4M.

All early buys signal growing confidence in Bitcoin Hyper's vision. Given that $HYPER is predicted to hit $0.32 this year, if you join the presale now, you'll open yourself up to possible 2,435%+ gains in the near future.

As the crypto market booms, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presents an appealing opportunity to grow your capital, while unlocking perks within the Best Wallet app.

But that's not all it has to offer. Supporting over 1K digital assets, it lets you easily buy, sell, manage, and swap a wide range of cryptos hassle-free.

Its cross-chain swap feature lets you snag the best rates and lowest fees, as it integrates with over 330 decentralized exchanges and 30 bridges.

The mobile app (available on Android and iOS) is beginner-friendly and feature-rich, and will soon be paired with its own crypto debit card (Best Card), an NFT gallery, and derivatives trading. For more info, read our Best Wallet review.

When purchasing the native wallet token, $BEST, you'll also enjoy exclusive access to the best crypto presales, reduced transaction fees, staking rewards at a 93% APY, and governance rights.

$WELF is the native token of WELF, a cutting-edge private banking ecosystem built for modern wealth management.

At the moment, WELF's products include WelfFlow, an adaptive, multi-asset investment strategy built for high-net-worth individuals seeking flexibility, security, and sophistication – regardless of which way the market moves.

WELF achieves this by combining expert advisory services with tokenized investment products, AI-driven portfolio management, and seamless access to both TradFi and DeFi tools.

‘Today's market demands a fusion of trusted wisdom and digital innovation. At Welf, we bridge tradition with the digital frontier, empowering you to navigate complexities and secure enduring wealth.' – WELF CEO, Christoph Tunkl.

Coming soon are additional services like WelfYield for steady income, WelfBank for international financial solutions, and WelfTailor for bespoke portfolio management.

$WELF has spiked 20% since yesterday, due in part to its new partnership with Qubit to integrate quantum security.

As $WELF continues to surge, securing the #3 spot among top real-world asset protocol tokens by 24-hour volume, it's better late than never to join the party.

You can buy $WELF on some of the best crypto exchanges for roughly $0.71.

In a maturing crypto sector, real-world use cases, innovative infrastructure, and strong user demand will remain key drivers of long-term crypto value.

$TRX stands out for its vigorous network activity, $HYPER for its Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, $BEST for exclusive crypto wallet perks, and $WELF for bridging TradFi and DeFi.

Wherever your interest lies, you'll find a standout altcoin that aligns with it in today's rapidly evolving landscape.

This isn't investment advice. DYOR and never invest more than you'd be sad to lose.

Can DeFi lending systems support institutional-grade credit markets? Pharos, a Layer 1 blockchain focused on Real-World Asset Finance (RWAfi), are integrating Morpho's lending infrastructure natively into its mainnet, marking a strategic step toward building credit rails for both institutional and decentralized participants in DeFi lending market.

  

The collaboration is aimed at bringing modular, transparent lending systems to real-world assets on-chain. With Morpho's lending protocol currently securing over $9 billion in deposits, the integration brings a familiar name in DeFi into the RWA conversation.

  

Pharos is not the first Layer 1 to focus on real-world assets, but the platform's emphasis on building modular systems with institutional compatibility gives this collaboration a different weight. The integration brings isolated risk lending and credit modeling directly into the Pharos mainnet architecture.

  

Wish Wu, CTO and Co-Founder of Pharos, framed the collaboration as foundational.

  

“For us, working together with Morpho is about building trust and composability at the core of RWAfi,” Wu said. “By integrating Morpho's lending infrastructure directly into our mainnet, we're laying the foundation for a more transparent and capital-efficient on-chain credit ecosystem.”

  

The lending rails will support a wide range of use cases including tokenized treasuries, private credit, and yield strategies designed for both retail and institutional participants.

  

Morpho is currently one of the most widely trusted DeFi lending protocols, known for building capital-efficient lending systems with isolated risks and modular design. Their infrastructure is already used for various crypto-backed loans and custom yield products.

  

Kirk Hutchison, who leads new chain growth at Morpho, sees the collaboration as a way to extend those lending frameworks into newer territories.

  

“Deploying natively on Pharos allows us to keep extending Morpho's most trusted lending infrastructure to the real-world asset space following initial success like private credit and tokenized stocks,” Hutchison said.

  

Morpho's involvement also strengthens Pharos' broader RWAfi strategy, which includes partners such as Ant Digital and Gauntlet, and focuses on formal verification, custody solutions, and risk calibration.

  

RWAfi, short for Real-World Asset Finance, refers to financial systems that bring real-world assets, such as credit, invoices, real estate, or tokenized equity, onto public blockchains. These systems aim to improve transparency, automation, and capital efficiency while reducing dependence on opaque intermediaries.

  

However, integrating real-world assets into DeFi requires more than tokenization. It also requires robust infrastructure for pricing, credit modeling, liquidity routing, and risk segregation. That is where Morpho's lending framework becomes relevant.

  

By deploying on Pharos, Morpho's infrastructure can provide tools for asset originators to spin up lending markets with isolated risk exposure, composable underwriting models, and automated collateral management. It also allows institutional lenders to allocate capital using transparent, programmable logic rather than relying on opaque term sheets.

  

One of the challenges in scaling real-world asset markets on-chain is the lack of infrastructure that satisfies both institutional and DeFi-native requirements. This integration attempts to address both.

  

Pharos' upcoming vault products, powered by Morpho, are expected to include structured lending strategies and capital deployment frameworks. The architecture is designed to be composable, which means it can integrate with other tools and systems across the Pharos ecosystem. That modularity is critical for experimenting with new forms of yield structures and underwriting logic.

  

Retail users will benefit from more accessible yield opportunities that are backed by real-world cash flows rather than purely crypto-native assets. On the other side, institutional participants get a sandbox for programmable credit with auditability and composability.

  

The launch of yet another RWA protocol is not newsworthy in itself. What makes this collaboration worth watching is the infrastructure-first approach. Too many RWA projects have focused on tokenizing assets without rethinking the credit, compliance, or custody infrastructure that needs to support them.

  

Morpho's decision to deploy natively on Pharos suggests that both teams are aligned on building from the bottom up. Credit markets need to be transparent, programmable, and modular—qualities that have often been missing from past RWA efforts. If the collaboration delivers, it could offer a test case for how on-chain lending should work when assets are tied to real-world value.

Ant Group affiliate aims to promote blockchain technology for the tokenisation of real-world assets, executive says

Ant Digital Technologies, an affiliate of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, is promoting its blockchain platform for asset tokenisation in Hong Kong, a week after the city's stablecoin law came into effect.

Ant is positioning itself as a “portal” that connects Web2 and Web3, “providing more credible assets to Web3 and more compliant capital to Web2”, Bian Zhuoqun, vice-president of Ant Group and president of blockchain business at Ant Digital, said at an event in Hong Kong on Thursday.

Ant Digital in April announced Jovay, a “completely self-developed” Layer 2 public blockchain that does not issue cryptocurrencies, Bian said. Jovay was specifically built for RWA transactions in overseas markets, Ant Digital said in a blog post then.

Moonbirds are back. The once maligned project that still ranks in the top 10 for all-time trade volume at 356,000 ETH has skyrocketed back up the NFT charts to 2.36 ETH, quadrupling its floor price in the past month. 

But it's definitely spent some time in the wilderness due to multiple ownership changes, directionless plans and waning community sentiment. The NFT project had one of the most highly anticipated mints ever in April 2022, and with prices once again soaring and momentum building, much of the renewed optimism centers around one name: Spencer.

Known simply as Spencer on X, the new owner of Moonbirds is no stranger to NFTs — he's a prolific collector and head of “Spencer Ventures,” an institutional-grade NFT fund.

“I bought my first Bored Ape at like 2.8 ETH. I was on Clubhouse and heard people making monkey sounds and was like, ‘What is this?'” Spencer says. At the time, Spencer was writing venture checks, and he came to an unusual but very profitable conclusion.

“Seed stage companies have a 95%+ failure rate. A bunch of people making ape sounds in a Clubhouse room can't possibly have a higher failure rate than that. That single bet ended up outperforming all of my venture investments by a pretty wide margin.”

Spencer is optimistic about “Birbs” being able to fly once more and playing a pivotal part in a larger comeback of the NFT space.

“There wasn't a lot of attention, especially net new attention in the NFT space for quite a while. But I always believed the most important thing to build toward in a bear market is being top of mind for that friend who stayed plugged in. The one you call to find out what's next and who should I join. In my mind, that was always the Moonbirds customer,” Spencer says. 

With the recent run up of NFTs led by collections such as CryptoPunks and Moonbirds, Spencer's arrival could be the beginning of a turnaround to rival the Pudgy Penguins 2.0 success story. 

If you've spent any time on NFT Twitter, chances are you've come across Spencer, one of the most active voices in the space. He comes from the class of 2021 and says it's possible no one has traded more NFTs in the world than he has.

“I run a liquid NFT trading fund. I parlayed the success of my personal NFT trading into a fund. We're one of the most active and successful funds in the broader crypto space. At peak, we did about 5% of market volume on Blur. I would make the argument no one who has traded more NFTs than me and my team. We've done a lot of NFT trading. You name it, we've traded it.”

It's a reflection of how immersed he's been in the market's every twist and turn. Arguably, his company's most famous trade was becoming one of, if not the, largest holder of Pudgy Penguins, scooping up 3AC's liquidated stash during the tumultuous back half of 2022.

“We bought a lot of Pudgy's during the FTX collapse, and I've been a really big proponent of that company and collection for quite a while. I've been watching really closely and working really closely with that team. It's been awesome,” Spencer says.

Spencer is also the co-founder of Orange Cap Games, the studio behind Vibes, a physical and digital trading card game built around the Pudgy Penguins IP. In just eight months, Vibes did $1.5 million in sales, with partnerships spanning eBay, PSA and CGC.

That success laid the groundwork for his interest in Moonbirds. “The team we've built is incredibly good at taking IP and bringing it to life. At some point, it makes sense to have our own IP,” he says.

“NFTs build a sentimental attachment. I've made money trading memecoins, too, but it's not the same. Everyone who's stuck around is nostalgic for the era of trading NFTs.”

As Moonbirds continue their fast run up in price and enthusiasm for the project's future, many are wondering: Is Spencer going to pull off a Luca Netz?

The comparison isn't a lazy one, given Spencer's closeness with the Pudgy Penguins CEO and team.

You should ‘go and build' your own AI agent: Jesse Pollak, X Hall of Flame

Who takes gold in the crypto and blockchain Olympics?

Netz, the magnetic CEO of Pudgy Penguins, flipped a flailing project into one of Web3's most notable brands. From physical toys in Walmart to viral content to having its mascot, Pengu, ring the opening bell for the Nasdaq on Wall Street, the cultural relevance of Pudgy Penguins is undeniable. Now, Spencer has his sights set on following a similar playbook.

“When NFTs first happened in 2021-22, you either traded the market or you founded a project. Luca was the first founder who had been on the other side of it. Because he had been a trader that then became a founder. That is really why he won I think — against a lot of other people over that period of time — was because he had this perspective that nobody else had,” Spencer says.

Where the Luca Netz comparison really lands is Spencer's unapologetic commitment to action over aspiration. In his first 51 days, Spencer has dropped a custom Moonbirds-themed Pokémon-style card for holders, secured an airdrop through a project backed by a16z and Coinbase Ventures, launched a new X presence for Mythics, negotiated OpenSea branding changes and brought visibility roaring back to the brand.

“We make no promises. We're big ‘show first' people. People shouldn't have to say, ‘I think they'll deliver.' They should say, ‘Look at what's been delivered.'”

“We've also made a couple of key hires and begun a couple partnerships, some of which I can't share. I think you can look at what was a really strong first 51 days right. I don't know what the next 51 days are going to look like, but if it's like the first 51, I think we're in really good shape.”

Moonbirds was once the envy of the NFT world, peaking at the height of last cycle's NFT collective euphoria with a floor price of just under 40 ETH shortly after mint. “It's just a collection people want to see win,” Spencer says.

And if the Luca Netz playbook for Pudgy Penguins is anything to go by, they just might.

Lofty expectation, the end of a historic run up in NFT interest and a former leader in Kevin Rose who seemed to be looking for a way out over a sustained period left Moonbirds holders disillusioned. Spencer has a pretty simple philosophy for rebuilding trust in the brand. 

“Our general view is we're moving forward, we're not looking backwards. Some people want to go on this journey with us and some people don't. Either is fine,” says Spencer. 

“It's very understandable if you feel burned, maybe there's some new liquidity and you just want to get out. Congratulations. I'm so glad we were able to give you a way to step away. That's fine to me. I don't need to win that person back.”

Instead, his focus is on two key groups: the believers and the newcomers. 

“There are some people that really want to see it come back, and those people I want to activate. I'm most excited about someone who remembers how cool Moonbirds were in 2022 but never owned one. Now they finally have the opportunity to collect. That's who I want to build for.”

This is how to make — and lose — a fortune with NFTs

The blockchain projects making renewable energy a reality

When did you collect your first NFT?

Early 2021. 

Your favorite NFT in your wallet?

It's got to be my Moonbird. 

Were you into collectibles before NFTs? 

Massively. Prior to NFTs, a lot of my net worth is on trading cards. It still is today. Trading cards is a very large part of my personal portfolio.

Your favorite artist in the NFT space?

I mean, I'm a big fan of Clare, our art director.But when it comes to other artists, I do really like Gremplin. I really like CrypToads. That's a big, big one that I like.From the art side of things, I think Nick Kuder is really interesting. One of the earliest generative artists. Actually, the Ringer collection is a stolen set of code from the Rings Genesis by Nick Kuder. It's a fun little side thing that not a lot of people know, so I do like Nick Kuder's Rings Genesis collection.

With the initial Moonbirds mint, how many birds did you have in your wallet within the first 24 hours?None. My collecting of Moonbirds also happened post FTX. I'm one of these people who saw the disgusting face melting run that Moonbirds went on with just nothing but utter jealousy and, you know, admittedly some amount of contempt.

I was like, ‘Why am I not holding such a thing?' And really, it was mostly jealousy. I wished I had. I am that marginal consumer who missed the run originally and now has the resources to do it.

Your favorite Moonbird trait?

Oh man, it's like picking children. The cop out answer here is cosmic. It's cheating because that's my PFP, but I'll go with cosmic.

Are Mythics underrated in your mind? 

Yes. The sheer quality of art of the Mythics is something that really sold me on it. I think bar none that if all that mattered in NFTs was how something looked, Mythics would probably be the top collection in the world. It's great, and I feel very strongly about that.

There's a lot of people in the world that have just never looked through the Mythics collection. And if you do, it's really hard not to buy one. The team has launched a new dedicated X account @MythicBirbs. 

What's your advice to someone just discovering NFTs today?Just collect what you like. That's the first beginning of the journey. I wouldn't enter the space purely as a trader. I think that if you enter the space as a trader and collector, you're better having a rule for that if you don't like it, don't buy it. I think that's what you have to do. You should fundamentally be collecting NFTs that you like, and if you're not doing that, you're doing it wrong.

Who are your top three favorite follows for NFTs on Crypto Twitter?

If you want to see interesting different opinions, I'd say the following: 

1. Seedphrase is really good and an interesting follow. He's a lot more analytical.

2. I actually think people might see this one as a controversial one, but I think Wizard of SoHo generally is a better trader than most people will admit that he is, so I like Wizard.

3. I also think OSF and Mando. I'm going to loop them together, but the two of them are actually some of the best traders in the space.

Where do you see Moonbirds this time in 12 months?As I said, the first 51 days, I think we've done a pretty good job. If we can continue streaks of 51 days that are as productive, then at the end of this, we should be in a good spot.

Home » Blitz news » CryptoPunks NFT Sells for $2.5M Amid NFT Market Uptick

Buyer numbers surge 30% as high-value NFT sales from CryptoPunks, BAYC, and Otherside reignite market momentum.

A rare CryptoPunks NFT has been sold for 720 ETH, equivalent to over $2.5 million, marking one of the most significant non-fungible token (NFT) transactions in recent months. 

Earlier this week, an anonymous buyer acquired CryptoPunks #1021 on LarvaLabs marketplace, according to data from multi-chain market aggregator CryptoSlam.io.

The digital asset is part of the CryptoPunks collection, a fixed-supply series of 10,000 pixelated characters originally launched by Larva Labs in 2021. The collection is now managed by the Infinite Node Foundation (NODE), a nonprofit focused on digital art preservation and education.

The high-value transaction follows several other notable NFT sales in recent days. Earlier in August, Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #7940 was sold for 666 WETH (over $2.3 million), while Otherdeed #67722 changed hands for 200 WETH (more than $767,000).

Several other mid-range NFT sales — ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars — also took place this week, contributing to broader market activity.

According to CryptoSlam.io, the number of NFT buyers rose by nearly 30% over the past seven days, reaching 703,240. The number of sellers also increased, though at a slower pace, by 16.5%, reaching 392,000.

The total number of NFT transactions climbed 4.29%, surpassing 1.8 million. However, overall NFT sales volume dropped by more than 22%, indicating that while market participation is increasing, buyers are mostly purchasing lower-priced NFTs, and high-value transactions remain rare.

Ethereum remains the leading blockchain for NFT trading, accounting for more than $55 million of the weekly volume. Polygon and Bitcoin follow with around $15  million and $13 million in trading volume, respectively.

Recent NFT market data shows positive signs of user engagement, but investor spending remains low. This may represent a transitional phase between the market bottom and a potential growth stage.

NFTs can be volatile and speculative. While some have generated high returns, others have lost value. It's important to research and understand the risks before investing.

Their value comes from historical significance, cultural impact, scarcity, and collector demand. CryptoPunks helped define the NFT art movement and are considered digital “OG” collectibles.

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item or piece of content, such as art, music, or virtual real estate, on a blockchain.

NFTs are stored on a blockchain—most commonly Ethereum—and use smart contracts to prove ownership and authenticity. Each token is unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis like cryptocurrencies.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- BlockSack, a Base-based Layer 2 meme coin, combines humor with utility via staking, NFTs, and gaming, distinguishing itself from hype-driven meme coins.

- The project's 2025 presale allocated 40% of 690M BSACK tokens to early investors, with 25% reserved for liquidity, supporting long-term ecosystem growth.

- Leveraging Base's low fees and Coinbase support, BlockSack offers day-one utility through tools like SackMarket (NSFW NFT marketplace) and on-chain earning mechanisms.

- Rapid community growth on X and Telegram, plus a roadmap including CEX listing and PayFi solutions, positions BlockSack as a leading 2025 meme-based crypto innovation.

BlockSack is generating significant buzz in the crypto space as a Layer 2 meme coin launched on the Base blockchain. Following a strong presale in 2025, the project has positioned itself as a unique blend of humor and utility, combining cultural appeal with tangible features such as staking, NFTs, and gaming. This approach differentiates it from traditional meme coins that rely heavily on hype without offering functional infrastructure [1].

The project's branding centers around “Sacktoshi,” a satirical reinterpretation of Satoshi Nakamoto, which has helped to establish a distinct identity within the crypto-native and meme enthusiast communities. Beyond its cultural narrative, BlockSack provides real-world applications, including access to NSFW NFTs and the Sackaverse, a gaming platform powered by the native BSACK token. The introduction of a staking mechanism allows users to earn rewards while contributing to the ecosystem's growth, adding a layer of functionality that enhances the token's utility [1].

A key factor in BlockSack's rising profile is its launch on the Base blockchain. This Layer 2 network offers fast transaction speeds, low gas fees, and robust support from Coinbase, making it an ideal environment for scalable and efficient decentralized projects. BlockSack's launch is notable for being “utility-ready” from day one, with tools like a trading bot, NFT creation tools, and its own NSFW NFT marketplace, SackMarket. The platform also enables users to earn BSACK tokens through on-chain activities such as copy trading and meme competitions, further enhancing engagement and token utility [1].

BlockSack's tokenomics are structured to support long-term stability and growth. Of the total 690 million BSACK tokens, 40% were allocated to the presale, 25% to liquidity, and the remainder to staking, marketing, and team incentives. This distribution model is designed to reward early supporters while maintaining liquidity and ecosystem development. The project has also seen rapid community growth across platforms like X (Twitter), Telegram, and meme forums, driven by contests, giveaways, and other community-driven activities [1].

Looking ahead, the roadmap outlines key milestones including staking reward expansions, a potential CEX listing, new gaming features, and the development of a PayFi solution. These steps are intended to increase token usage and strengthen user value, reinforcing the project's credibility in the competitive meme coin space. Analysts and investors are closely watching how BlockSack executes its vision, particularly in the context of the 2025 crypto presale wave [1].

As a Layer 2 meme coin, BlockSack is well-positioned to capture both attention and adoption in 2025. By combining meme culture with real crypto infrastructure, it represents a rare hybrid project that balances entertainment with function. With a clear plan, active development, and a growing community, BlockSack has emerged as a top contender in the next wave of meme-based crypto innovation [1].

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Ripple CTO sets record straight on Caitlin Long's ‘XRP ICO' claim","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-debunks-caitlins-xrp-ico-claim/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 01:44:00 GMT","

Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has publicly responded to comments made by Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, who recently questioned the origins, direction, and integrity of Ripple's projects—including the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the XRP token, and Ripple's newly announced stablecoin RLUSD.

During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple's past had “all the makings” of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger.

Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. “I'm available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.” He wrote.

Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which “sets the record straight” and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information.

The validator, Vet (@Vet_X0), strongly rejected Caitlin Long's characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently.

Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise.

This counters Long's claim that XRP's origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers.

Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger.

Vet said Long's comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code.

Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can't update the network unaided.

Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn't trusting in its infrastructure.

XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn't a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems.

According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum's involvement merely complements—not replaces—the network's capabilities.

Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL's long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts.

Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Heaven AMM's Solana-based ICO raised $27M in 11 hours, closing early due to an undisclosed cap despite lacking a fully developed product.

- The platform used provocative marketing and faced technical issues during the sale, with refunds planned to reduce whale allocations and adjust token valuation.

- Heaven's 100% revenue-to-buyback model and Creator Flywheels differentiate it from competitors like letsBonk, enabling automatic token burns and direct AMM pairings.

- The $LIGHT token's $27.3M market cap now surpasses major Solana DeFi platforms, though its valuation is expected to decline post-refunds amid comparisons to 2024's speculative frenzy.

Heaven Launchpad's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) concluded ahead of schedule after raising over $27 million within just 11 hours, marking one of the fastest fundraising events on the Solana blockchain [1]. The platform, known as Heaven AMM, raised funds from more than 9,000 wallets, far surpassing expectations for such a short window. The ICO was initially intended to last 48 hours but was closed early, reportedly due to hitting an undisclosed cap [1].

Despite the impressive capital inflow, Heaven has yet to publicly unveil a fully developed product. Its marketing strategy relied heavily on provocative videos criticizing the current state of Solana launchpads, along with aesthetic visuals and screenshots [1]. The team cited high traffic—over 25,000 visitors to the ICO site—exceeding the site's rate limits, which led to discrepancies between on-chain sales and front-end display [1].

The Heaven team announced that refunds would be distributed proportionally to contributors in the coming weekend to reduce the platform's native token, $LIGHT, valuation and potentially adjust the token distribution by limiting whale allocations [1]. This move reflects a strategy to align incentives between the platform and its users, a trend seen in recent Solana-based projects like letsBonk and GoFundMeme, which have returned value through token buybacks [1].

Heaven differentiates itself through its 100% revenue-to-buyback model and the implementation of Creator Flywheels, a mechanism that allows token creators to allocate protocol income for their tokens' benefit. This includes automatic token swaps and burns, permanently removing assets from circulation [1]. The platform also eliminates the need for token projects to graduate from bonding curves, allowing direct AMM pairings with minimal ""virtual SOL,"" a mathematical placeholder representing $35 SOL [1].

The rapid success of the ICO has drawn comparisons to the speculative frenzy of early 2024, where projects like $GM, $SLERF, and $PAIN raised millions in presales with little to no product development [1]. While Heaven may be more structured in its approach, the speed of the fundraising still highlights the volatile and speculative nature of the Solana DeFi and meme economy.

The $LIGHT token currently has a circulating market cap of $27.3 million, surpassing several well-known Solana DeFi platforms, including Adrena, Bullet, and DeFiTuna [1]. However, its valuation is expected to decline after the refund process, though the exact magnitude remains uncertain.

The monthly average of the ICO Composite Indicator Price (I-CIP) fell 12.1% last month to 259.31 cents: the lowest level since last October. The daily average fluctuated between a low of 252.46 cents, on July 11, and a high of 269.57 cents five days later on July 16. The sharpest declines were recorded on the Robusta front

 

Share your coffee stories with us by writing to info@comunicaffe.com.

MILAN – Uncertainties weighing on the world economy and the global geopolitical picture had a significant impact on the coffee market in July, pushing prices down, with double-digit declines for all indicators, and keeping volatility high, shows the monthly report of the ICO, released yesterday, Wednesday, Aug. 6. The monthly average of the ICO Composite Indicator Price (I-CIP) fell 12.1% last month to 259.31 cents: the lowest level since last October.

The daily average fluctuated between a low of 252.46 cents, on July 11, and a high of 269.57 cents five days later on July 16. The sharpest declines were recorded on the Robusta front.

In fact, the average Robusta indicator lost 14.8% plunging to 167.19 cents, the lowest level since November 2023. The London indicator plummeted (-16.3%) also reflecting the substantial replenishment of ICE Robusta's certified stocks (see below).

On the Arabica side, the average indicators for Colombian Milds, Other Milds, and Brazilian Naturals fell by 10.5%, 10.4%, and 12.3%, respectively.

Similarly, New York was down 12.3%. Volatility has increased slightly further to 10.2%, peaking at 16.6% for the London indicator.

The report attributes the sharp downward trend of the past month to a number of factors, summarised as follows:

World exports of all forms of coffee for the month of June were up by 7.3% to a total of 11.689 million bags. Arabica exports remained relatively stable (-0.7%) at 7.077 million, with the significant decrease in Brazilian Naturals (-19.5%) being almost entirely counterbalanced by an increase in Colombian Milds (+18.5%) and Other Milds (+16%). Robusta exports rebounded strongly to 4.612 million (+22.4%).

As a result, world coffee exports for the first nine months of the 2024/25 coffee year (October–June) are roughly on par with those of the equivalent period of 2023/24 (-0.2%), standing at 104.141 million. A slight increase in Arabica volumes (+0.2%) was matched by a slight decline in Robusta shipments (-0.7%). Within the Arabica category, the decrease in Brazilian Naturals (-5.6%) was fully offset by increases in Colombian Milds (15.9%) and Other Milds (2.4%).

ICO maintains its estimate of world production and consumption unchanged at 178 and 177 million bags respectively, forecasting a slight production surplus after two years of deficits.

SPX6900 (SPX) erupted 8.5% over the past 24 hours, touching $1.80 as it attempts to reignite its charge toward the all-time high set at the end of July.

Meanwhile, its more chaotic, unfiltered, and potentially 1,000x counterpart – TOKEN6900 (T6900) – has already bagged nearly $2 million in presale funding, offering a cheaper entry into everything SPX6900 stood for… and then some.

Where SPX6900 was satire, TOKEN6900 is full-blown financial heresy – fusing TradFi mockery with 69-fueled absurdity and slamming it straight into the meme coin arena, where most projects have forgotten what being a meme coin actually means.

With less than 39 hours left, TOKEN6900 may be sitting at one of the lowest prices it'll ever see – $0.006875 – before it hits its $5 million hard cap. 

After that, the next time T6900 appears will be on exchanges, where it will sprint toward dollar territory, right alongside SPX.

SPX remains up over 40% in the past 30 days, after notching fresh all-time highs throughout July. Since launch, it's already delivered a staggering 135,000% return, with no shortage of moonshot stories to back it up.

One trader famously turned $161,000 into $6.8 million in just two months, and that wasn't even at the peak. Another investor dropped $57,000 and walked away $1.12 million richer.

Yet even with its price already holding steadily above a dollar, SPX6900's loudest believer, Murad Mahmudov, says this is still just the beginning. In a recent X post, he said 99.99% haven't even heard of SPX6900, and that eventually, the whole world will want in.



What Mahmudov's really saying is that the upside isn't over – not by a long shot for SPX6900, and especially not for the cult it's building. A cult that doesn't worship utility, roadmaps, or any pitch decks reserved for greedy VCs. 

In fact, it makes fun of all of it – from the S&P 500 to Elon Musk's sex jokes – and somehow, makes the numbers go up.

SPX6900 proved the game's wide open for retail and that even something as absurd as a raw meme coin can have real conviction behind it.

But if SPX was satire, TOKEN6900 is full-blown market ridicule. Its entire existence is aimed at everything TradFi holds sacred and all the meme coins pretending to be useful along the way.

If there's one token that can rally the believers in the absurd, it's T6900 – the next chapter in the 6900 saga.

TOKEN6900 is so much more unhinged than its predecessor that it didn't just copy SPX6900's tokenomics, it added an ingenious twist: it added one more token.

It may not make much sense at first glance, but that's the logic behind it. If TOKEN6900 ever reaches SPX6900's level and hits a $69 billion market cap, that single extra token would add exactly $74 in value. 



And for the project, that's the punchline – one token better. Absurd, maybe. But for those who lean into the absurd, that's exactly the appeal.

But beyond the joke, TOKEN6900 knows who the real clown is: TradFi. The banks call it “security” when they accept your deposits, but behind the scenes, they lend it out, print more, and dilute whatever's left of your hard-earned cash.

TOKEN6900 doesn't dilute because its fixed supply is hardcoded. And its purpose is also clear – the creators of the project know that it is simply a true-to-the-core meme coin.

Quite frankly, that's what sets both SPX and T6900 apart from the new tokens that flood the space. Because the trend now is that most tokens drape themselves in buzzwords about innovation, about AI, yet these two know what meme coins were really built for – chaos, mockery, and the kind of surprise upside that comes from not pretending.

Just like Dogecoin was created to make fun of Bitcoin, TOKEN6900 exists to ridicule everything – from TradFi to utility‑cosplaying meme coins.

Its entire brand is a throwback to when the internet was unfiltered fun, Facebook was still MySpace, and Pepe was just a GIF and not a token.

That's how far back TOKEN6900 takes it.

SPX6900's run has already been massive. And while Murad insists it's only the beginning, the reality is that a single unit of SPX now trades well into the dollar range – and there's still something psychological about owning “one whole token”.

After all, no one says they own satoshis – they say they own Bitcoin.

So if someone wanted to hold 10,000 SPX at its current price of $1.80, they'd be looking at an $18,000 position.

By contrast, TOKEN6900 would cost just $68.75 for the same number of tokens and yes, both have nearly identical supplies, aside from that one extra token on the T6900 side.



Neither of them offers utility. Neither makes promises.

The only real difference is tone – and if SPX is absurd, TOKEN6900 is absurd squared. And if you're into that, then T6900 is the way to go.

One last thing TOKEN6900 stays true to is its hard cap. The presale is capped at $5 million, and once that's hit, the chance to grab T6900 at low prices is gone for good.

At $1.67 million raised, it's already 33.4% of the way there. If current momentum holds, the cap could be reached in just a few weeks.

So if you're part of the 0.01% just now learning about TOKEN6900, consider yourself lucky – this more chaotic version of SPX6900 might just be your moment.

Head to the TOKEN6900 presale site and get T6900.

Staking returns offer a 37% APY and are available to newly purchased tokens.

                            Is China finally ready to launch a stablecoin? | Credit: China Photos/Getty Images                        


Key Takeaways

After years of promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC), China is quietly changing course.

The e-CNY, once touted as the future of digital payments in the country, has lost momentum.

This is due in part to slow adoption and a recent corruption scandal involving its key architect. Now, officials are warming up to a more flexible alternative: stablecoins.

The change comes amid growing concern in China over the dominance of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which continue to expand in global trade and cross-border payments.

Hong Kong has taken the lead on the regulatory front.

In early August, new legislation came into effect  allowing licensed entities to issue stablecoins backed by fiat currencies—including potentially the Chinese yuan.

However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) isn't rushing to approve.

Officials said only a “handful” of licenses would be issued to start, and strict controls would be established around reserves and legal compliance.

The goal is to start small with business-to-business use cases, keeping capital outflows in check while testing the waters for broader adoption.

While Beijing hesitates, major Chinese firms are pushing ahead.

JD.com has already piloted a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin and plans to launch it officially later this year.

The token, issued on a public blockchain, will be integrated into JD's payments infrastructure in Hong Kong and Macau.

Ant Group is also preparing to apply for stablecoin licenses in both Hong Kong and Singapore, signaling a broader push to internationalize the yuan via blockchain rails.

Both companies argue that offshore yuan stablecoins are crucial for boosting the renminbi's role in global trade and reducing reliance on dollar-based tokens.

Meanwhile, the digital yuan's credibility has taken a hit.

Yao Qian, the former lead architect of China's CBDC, was recently expelled from the Communist Party and is under investigation for taking bribes—allegedly even in crypto.

Yao was once the face of China's blockchain ambitions, advocating for the e-CNY and decentralized finance more broadly.

With him gone and adoption stagnant, the pivot toward stablecoins feels less like a side project, and more like Plan B.

Stablecoins are already reshaping global finance.

The market is worth $247 billion and could surpass $2 trillion by 2028.

More than 99% of circulating stablecoins  are pegged to the U.S. dollar, giving Washington a major soft power advantage.

In contrast, the yuan's share of global payments is just 2.9%.

China's exporters are increasingly opting for dollar stablecoins like USDT to bypass controls and settle international transactions quickly.

Even Chinese regulators now acknowledge that the country needs to offer an alternative or risk falling behind entirely.

State-owned enterprises have reportedly expressed interest  in using RMB stablecoins for cross-border trade, but capital controls and compliance concerns remain a major obstacle.

Stablecoins may offer China a more market-friendly way to expand the use of the renminbi abroad, but it's walking a tightrope.

Officials want to innovate without losing oversight. That means progress will likely remain slow and closely supervised.

Still, the fact that China is even considering this shift marks a significant change—and could signal a new phase in the global currency race.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"

 South Korea's KakaoBank is looking at services for the issuance and custody of stablecoins with plans to “actively participate” in the crypto market. 

The banking arm of South Korean IT giant Kakao Corporation is reportedly ramping up plans to offer stablecoin services amid a regulatory shift in the country after the election of pro-crypto President Lee Jae-myung.

KakaoBanks' chief financial officer Kwon Tae-hoon said during the company's first-half 2025 earnings call that the company is “reviewing various methods such as issuance and custody,” and “plans to actively participate,” in the “digital asset ecosystem,” ZDNet Korea reported on Wednesday

Kwon added that the initiative is being spearheaded in cooperation with Kakao's Stablecoin Task Force, which includes top leadership from its core affiliates, including KakaoPay.

KakaoBanks' stablecoin move follows the election of President Lee Jae-myung in June, who has since pushed forward with various crypto-related laws, including a bill to legalize stablecoins.

KakaoBank filed for stablecoin-related trademarks on June 23, at the same time as rival Kookmin Bank, a subsidiary of KB Financial Group. Eight other South Korean banks are also planning Korean won-pegged stablecoins to launch by 2026.

Kwon reportedly said KakaoBank already has experience in digital assets, having “successfully conducted wallet opening, exchanges,” and participated in the Bank of Korea's central bank digital currency experiment.

“For the past three years, we have been issuing real-name verified accounts for virtual asset exchanges and have been operating risk-related measures such as Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering-based monitoring,” Kwon said.

KakaoBank has 25.86 million users, representing roughly half of South Korea's population of 51.7 million, and $46.47 billion in assets under management as of March this year.

Crypto exchange users in South Korea have surpassed 16 million, after receiving a boost from US President Donald Trump's election win last November. The figure represents more than 30% of the country's population.

After KakaoBank filed for stablecoin-related trademarks, its stock price jumped to 37,000 Korean won ($27) from around 30,400 won ($22.60), representing a 19.3% increase. 

However, following the latest update to its stablecoin plans, the share price made only small gains on Wednesday, rising to a peak of $20.10 for the trading session, before dropping to $19.43 by the bell. 

In the latest trading session on Thursday, its stock price made a small gain, rising 0.93% to trade at $19.60.

The bank has been operating since 2016 and was founded through a partnership between Korea Investment Holdings and Kakao Corp.

Other large companies and even countries have been showing an increasing interest in using stablecoins in some form. 

A May 14 report from enterprise-grade digital assets platform Fireblocks found that 90% of institutional players surveyed are exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations.

A Russian Finance Ministry official floated a plan for the government to develop its own stablecoin in April, while a trio of major Abu Dhabi institutions teamed up to create a new dirham-pegged stablecoin in the same month.

Ether has been trading within a relatively modest range recently, fluctuating between $3,300 and $3,800 in August following a big month where notable government developments helped boost regulatory clarity for the crypto space.

Going forward, what major developments do ether investors need to monitor in order to keep up with this digital currency and make well-informed trades?

When asked this very question, market observers highlighted a wide range of variables, ranging from Federal Reserve speculation to the rising incidence of so-called “whales,” major investors who accumulate significant amounts of the digital currency.

One analyst emphasized the importance of speculation surrounding the appointment of a new Fed chair, which could result in a reduction in the benchmark federal funds rate, which could in turn place downward pressure on broader borrowing costs.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell currently holds the top role, but President Donald Trump has repeatedly mentioned the possibility of replacing him.

Markets seem to already be pricing in the possibility of such a development.

Pierce Crosby, managing partner of strategy consulting firm Merchant Seven, spoke to these developments.

“Most notably, everyone's watching President Trump's next moves regarding the Federal Reserve chair,” he stated via email.

“There is a lot of contemplation as to what a ‘short-term appointment' might look like for the market, and there are a LOT of potential outcomes here,” Crosby added.

“The market does not want the federal reserve to become politicized, but there is a lot of talk around this,” he continued.

“The understanding generally is that a political appointment near-term would be a bullish signal for the market, but even if it might be more short-term bullish, the longer-term implications are that a weaker dollar may improve cryptocurrency performance as a hedge against dollar deterioration,” Crosby noted.

Another analyst emphasized the key role that the proliferation of stablecoins could play in impacting the price of ether. He made this statement shortly after Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) into law.

This piece of legislation has provided some regulatory clarity for stablecoins, and could help them achieve a broader presence in the financial system.

Austin King, the cofounder of Omni Network, commented on this situation, stating that through email that in the “shorter term,” “The biggest thing that traders are watching currently is progress around stablecoins being deployed on Ethereum.""

“Many have priced in the announcements that many of the largest banks in the U.S. plan to launch stablecoins, but it will be the actual deployment that pushes $ETH to new highs,” he emphasized.

King predicted that in the long-term, these digital currencies, which peg their value to a hard asset like the U.S. dollar, will be the single greatest determinant of ether's future price fluctuations.

“Stablecoins are the number one most important trend to watch when it comes to Ethereum's price movements,” he claimed. “Standing as the most decentralized network, it is one of the number one places the world's leading institutions are eyeing launching their upcoming stablecoins.”

“Ethereum's growth from 30 cents to over $3,000 in its first 10 years was driven by grassroots developer adoption,” King noted.

“In the next 10 years, it will be the deployment of large scale financial products by the world's leading banks that will push Ethereum to new highs,” he predicted.

A handful of analysts cited technical improvements as being bullish for ether prices.

George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, spoke to the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, the hard fork which is scheduled to take place later this year, noting via email that “the blob increase and its effect on lowering gas costs would be huge for Ether as well as the security expansions in the upgrade.”

Douro Labs CEO Mike Cahill also offered input in this particular area, stating that “On the infrastructure side, Ethereum is nearing a critical point in its rollup roadmap.”

“If Layer 2s continue to drive down costs while maintaining composability, we'll see a renaissance of DeFi innovation that could increase network activity and valuation,” he continued.

“But institutional adoption isn't guaranteed. It will depend on credible, reliable data infrastructure, predictable costs, and compliance-friendly rails—all areas that the Ethereum ecosystem is rapidly improving,” Cahill noted.

“Traders should keep an eye on ETF flows, rollup throughput, and real-world asset integrations as key signals for what's next,” he asserted.

Kailas also emphasized the key role that major investors, or whales, could play in ether's price movements going forward, noting that it is a key development he is monitoring closely.

“Nine new whale wallets accumulated over 628,600 ETH worth $2+ billion between late July and early August 2025,” he stated, adding that “looks like we may be seeing some volatility now but we can expect some appreciation by November.”

“Galaxy also made a $300M purchase recently and Data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode highlights a notable surge in the number of Ethereum mega whale addresses—wallets holding over 10,000 ETH,” Kailas pointed out.

“Since early July, more than 200 new addresses have joined this elite category,” he noted.

One market observer offered input that involved technical analysis, which observes an asset's price history in order to get a better sense of where it might go next.

He pointed out that recently, both bitcoin and ether have been fluctuating “in ranges which form lopsided pennants.”

The chart below helps illustrate these price movements for ether:

“Unfortunately, whether both pennants are broken to the up- or down-side probably depends more in the near-term on fiat equity markets than on events within the cryptosphere,” he wrote via comments emailed on August 5.

“Should equity markets correct (which more and more Wall Street pundits are predicting), ETH will follow, at least in the short term,” stated Enneking.

“Paradoxically, recent significant drops in tradfi have seen a much more rapid rebound in digital assets (which, after all, have little inherent correlation to fiat markets) than in those same tradfi assets,” he added.

“Should those pundits be proven wrong, ETH and BTC price trends will almost certainly break the pennants to the upside and we'll see new ATHs.”

He followed up the next day, emphasizing that his previous prediction, that ether would more likely move to the upside in the near future, came to pass.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Author: shew

 Welcome to the GCC Research column's ""Tragedy of the Crypto Commons"" series.

 In this series, we'll focus on critical public goods in the crypto world that are increasingly failing to meet norms. These are the fundamental infrastructure of the entire ecosystem, but they often face challenges such as insufficient incentives, unbalanced governance, and even increasing centralization. The ideals of crypto technology and the reality of redundancy and stability are facing severe tests in these corners.

 This issue focuses on one of the most influential applications in the Ethereum ecosystem: Polymarket and its data indexing tool. This year, Polymarket has repeatedly been at the center of public opinion, particularly with events surrounding Trump's election victory, oracle manipulation in Ukraine's rare earth trade, and political betting on the color of Zelenskyy's suit. The sheer scale of capital and market influence it carries make these controversies particularly challenging.

 However, is data indexing, a key building block of this product, a product that represents a ""decentralized prediction market,"" truly decentralized? Why have public infrastructure like The Graph failed to fulfill their intended role? What form should a truly usable and sustainable data indexing public good take?

 In July 2024, Goldsky experienced a six-hour outage (Goldsky is a real-time blockchain data infrastructure platform for Web3 developers, providing indexing, subgraph and streaming data services to help quickly build data-driven decentralized applications), which paralyzed a large part of the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, the DeFi front-end was unable to display users' positions and balance data, and the prediction market Polymarket was unable to display correct data. Countless projects seemed to be completely unusable to front-end users.

 This shouldn't happen in the world of decentralized applications. After all, wasn't blockchain technology designed to eliminate single points of failure? The Goldsky incident exposed a disturbing truth: while blockchains themselves are as decentralized as possible, the infrastructure used by applications built on them often includes a large number of centralized services.

 The reason for this is that blockchain data indexing and retrieval are non-exclusive, non-rivalrous digital public goods. Users often expect them to be free or extremely low-cost, but these services require continuous and intensive investment in hardware, storage, bandwidth, and operations personnel. In the absence of a sustainable profit model, a winner-takes-all centralized structure emerges: once a service provider gains a first-mover advantage in speed and capital, developers tend to direct all query traffic to that service, thus re-creating a single point of dependency. Public welfare projects like Gitcoin have repeatedly emphasized that ""open source infrastructure can create billions of dollars in value, but authors often can't rely on it to pay their mortgages.""

 This serves as a stark reminder that the decentralized world urgently needs to diversify Web3 infrastructure through public goods funding, redistribution, or community-driven initiatives. Otherwise, centralization will inevitably arise. We urge DApp developers to build local-first products and the technical community to consider data retrieval service failures when designing DApps, ensuring that users can still interact with projects even without data retrieval infrastructure.

 To understand why incidents like Goldsky occur, we need to delve deeper into the workings of DApps behind the scenes. To the average user, a DApp typically consists of just two parts: the on-chain contract and the front-end. Most users are accustomed to using tools like Etherscan to track on-chain transaction status, obtain necessary information on the front-end, and initiate transactions and interact with contracts. But where does this data displayed on the user's front-end actually come from?

 Suppose you are building a lending protocol that needs to display a user's holdings, as well as the margin and debt status of each position. A naive idea is for the front-end to read this data directly from the chain. However, in practice, the lending protocol contract does not allow the user address to query position data. The contract provides a function to query the specific data of the position using the position ID. So if we want to display the user's position status on the front-end, we need to retrieve all the positions in the current system and then find which positions belong to the current user. This is like asking someone to manually search millions of pages of ledgers for specific information - technically feasible, but extremely slow and inefficient. In fact, it is difficult for the front-end to complete this retrieval process. Even if the retrieval task of large DeFi projects is performed directly on the server by local nodes, it often takes hours.

 Therefore, we must introduce infrastructure to accelerate data acquisition. Companies like Goldsky provide these data indexing services. The following diagram illustrates the types of data indexing services can provide to applications. 



 At this point, some readers may be curious about the existence of a decentralized data retrieval platform called TheGraph within the Ethereum ecosystem. What is the connection between this platform and Goldsky? And why do a large number of DeFi projects use Goldsky as their data provider instead of the more decentralized TheGraph?

 To answer the above questions, we need to understand some technical concepts first.



 Some readers here may be curious why there are multiple operators in SubGraph?

 This is because the SubGraph framework actually only stipulates how data is read from and written to the database within the block.

 There is no implementation for how data flows into the SubGraph program and what kind of database the final output results are written to. These contents need to be implemented by the SubGraph operator himself.

 Generally speaking, SubGraph operators will make node modifications to achieve faster speeds. Different operators (such as TheGraph, Goldsky) have different strategies and technical solutions.

 TheGraph currently uses the Firehouse technology solution. After the introduction of this technology solution, TheGraph can achieve faster data retrieval than before. However, Goldsky has not openly disclosed the core program running its SubGraph.

 As mentioned above, TheGraph is a decentralized data retrieval platform. Taking the Uniswap v3 subgraph as an example, we can see that there are a large number of operators providing data retrieval for Uniswap v3. Therefore, we can also regard TheGraph as an integration platform for SubGraph operators. Users can send their own SubGraph code to TheGraph, and then there are some operators inside TheGraph that can help users retrieve data.

 For centralized platforms like Goldsky, Goldsky has a simple billing system based on resource usage. This is the most common SaaS billing method on the internet, and most technical personnel are familiar with it. The figure below shows Goldsky's price calculator: 



 TheGraph has a completely different fee structure than conventional billing. This fee structure is related to the token economics of GRT. The following figure shows the overall token economics of GRT: 



 TheGraph's per-query fees:

 Register an API KEY in the TheGraph backend and use the API KEY to request data retrieved by operators in TheGraph. These requests are charged based on the number of requests. Developers need to deposit a portion of GRT tokens in the platform in advance as the cost of API requests.

 TheGraph's Signal staking fees:

 For SubGraph deployers, they need the help of operators within the TheGraph platform to retrieve data. According to the profit distribution method mentioned above, they need to tell other participants that my query service is better and can get more money. They need to stake GRT, which is similar to advertising and guaranteeing themselves that there will be profits, so that people will come.

 During testing, developers can deploy SubGraph to the TheGraph platform for free. TheGraph will then assist users with some searches, providing a free quota for testing purposes. This quota is not suitable for production use. If developers believe SubGraph performs well within TheGraph's official testing environment, they can publish it to the public network and wait for other operators to participate in the search. Developers cannot directly pay a single operator for guaranteed search access; instead, multiple operators compete to provide services, avoiding a single point of dependency. This process requires using GRT tokens to perform curation (also known as signaling) on their SubGraph. This involves developers staking a certain amount of GRT into their deployed SubGraph. Operators will only participate in the SubGraph search process when the staked GRT reaches a certain level (previously consulted data is 10,000 GRT).

 For most project developers, using TheGraph is a relatively cumbersome process. While purchasing GRT tokens is relatively easy for Web3 projects, the process of curating deployed SubGraphs and waiting for operators is quite inefficient. This process presents at least two problems:

 Obviously, for most developers, it is simpler to directly choose Goldsky. The billing method is understandable to everyone, and as long as the payment is made, it can be used almost immediately, and the uncertainty is greatly reduced. This has also led to the situation of relying on a single product in blockchain data indexing and retrieval services.

 Clearly, TheGraph's complex GRT token economics have hindered widespread adoption. While token economics can be complex, these complexities shouldn't be exposed to users. For example, GRT's curation and staking mechanisms shouldn't be exposed to users. A better approach would be to simply provide users with a simplified payment page.

 The above disparagement of TheGraph is not my personal opinion. Paul Razvan Berg, a well-known smart contract engineer and founder of the Sablier project, also expressed this view in a tweet. The tweet mentioned that the user experience of launching SubGraph and GRT billing was extremely poor.

 As for how to solve the single point of failure in data retrieval, we have actually mentioned it above. That is, developers can consider using TheGraph service, but the process will be more complicated. Developers need to buy GRT tokens for staking curation and paying API fees.

 Currently, there are a lot of data retrieval software in the EVM ecosystem. For details, you can refer to The State of EVM Indexing written by Dune or the summary of EVM data retrieval software written by rindexer. For another more recent discussion, please refer to this tweet.

 This article will not discuss the specific cause of Glodsky's issues. Glodsky currently knows the cause, but is only disclosing it to enterprise users. This means that no third party can currently determine the exact nature of Glodsky's failure. Based on the report, it can be inferred that there may have been an issue writing retrieved data to the database. In this brief report, Glodsky mentioned that the database was inaccessible and that access was only restored after working with AWS.

 In this section, we mainly introduce other solutions:

 Why do I recommend using ponder instead of other software? The specific reasons include the following:

 Of course, there are some issues. Ponder is still under rapid development, and developers may encounter situations where previous projects become inoperable due to breaking updates. Since this article isn't a technical introduction, we won't delve into the details of Ponder's development. Readers with a technical background are encouraged to consult the documentation.

 A more interesting detail about Ponder is that it has also begun partial commercialization, but Ponder's commercialization path is very consistent with the ""isolation theory"" discussed in the previous article.

 Here, we briefly introduce the ""segregation theory."" We argue that the public nature of public goods allows them to serve an unlimited number of users. Therefore, charging for public goods will cause some users to stop using them, and social benefits will not be maximized (this is described in economic terms as ""no longer Pareto optimal""). In theory, public goods can be priced differently for each user, but the costs of differential pricing are likely to outweigh the benefits. Therefore, the reason public goods are free is not that they are inherently free, but rather that any fixed fee will harm social benefits, and there is currently no cheap way to implement differentiated pricing for each user. Segregation theory proposes a method for pricing within public goods: by isolating a homogeneous group of people and imposing a fee on them. While segregation theory does not prevent everyone from enjoying public goods for free, it does suggest a way to impose a fee on a subset of people.

 Ponder uses a method similar to isolation theory:

 This is clearly an application of the ""isolation theory"" principle: developers who are unwilling to operate and maintain the Ponder service themselves are isolated, and these developers can obtain simplified Ponder deployment services for a fee. Of course, the emergence of the Marble platform has not prevented other developers from using the Ponder framework for free and self-hosting deployment.

 The audience for ponder and Goldsky?

 Both have risks. As the recent Goldsky incident suggests, developers are advised to maintain their own ponder services to mitigate potential third-party service outages. Furthermore, when using ponder, the validity of RPC return data should be considered. Safe recently reported a crash of a search engine due to incorrect RPC return data. While there's no direct evidence linking the Goldsky incident to invalid RPC return data, I suspect Goldsky may have encountered a similar issue.

 Local-first has been a hot topic for the past few years. Simply put, local-first requires software to have the following features:

 Currently, most discussions related to local-first technologies often touch upon CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type). CRDT is a conflict-free data format that allows users to automatically resolve conflicts and maintain data integrity when operating on multiple devices. A simple way to think of CRDT is to view it as a data type with a simple consensus protocol. In a distributed environment, CRDT can guarantee data integrity and consistency.

 However, in blockchain development, we can relax the aforementioned software requirements for local-first. We only require that users maintain a minimum level of usability on the frontend even without the backend indexing data provided by the project developer. Furthermore, the local-first requirement for cross-client collaboration is already addressed by blockchain.

 In the context of DApps, the local-first concept can be implemented as follows:

 This local-first DApp design philosophy significantly improves application resiliency, preventing unavailability in the event of a data retrieval service crash. Regardless of usability, the best local-first applications require users to run a local node and then retrieve data locally using tools like trueblocks. For more discussion on decentralized or local retrieval, see the post ""Literally no one cares about decentralized frontends and indexers.""

 The six-hour Goldsky outage sounded a wake-up call for the ecosystem. While blockchains inherently offer decentralization and resistance to single points of failure, the application ecosystems built on them remain highly dependent on centralized infrastructure services. This reliance poses systemic risks to the entire ecosystem.

 This article briefly explains why TheGraph, a long-standing decentralized search service, is not widely used today, specifically discussing the complexities introduced by the GRT token economics. Finally, this article discusses how to build a more robust data search infrastructure. I encourage developers to use the Ponder self-hosted data search framework as an emergency response option and also outline a promising path to commercialization for Ponder. Finally, this article discusses the local-first development philosophy, encouraging developers to build applications that can function even without a data search service.

 At present, many Web3 developers are aware of the single point of failure problem of data retrieval services. GCC hopes that more developers will pay attention to this infrastructure and try to build decentralized data retrieval services or design a framework that allows DApp front-ends to still run without data retrieval services.

The real estate industry, historically characterized by traditional financial practices and lengthy processes, is undergoing a significant transformation driven by the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency innovations. Among these developments, crypto mortgages have emerged as a novel financial instrument that bridges the worlds of real estate and decentralized finance (DeFi). By leveraging digital assets and blockchain's transparency, crypto mortgages offer a new avenue for property financing that promises efficiency, inclusivity, and enhanced security. This convergence is reshaping how buyers, lenders, and investors interact with real estate markets, potentially disrupting conventional mortgage frameworks. You can understand how the market reacts to news when you use https://quantumprimeprofit.me

Crypto mortgages utilize cryptocurrencies or tokenized assets as collateral or payment methods in property lending agreements. Unlike traditional mortgages tied to fiat currency and centralized institutions, these loans operate on decentralized platforms or hybrid models that integrate blockchain protocols. This approach introduces benefits such as faster processing times, reduced intermediaries, and programmable loan terms enforced by smart contracts. Additionally, crypto mortgages can open access to global markets, allowing investors and buyers to transact across borders with fewer restrictions.

At its core, a crypto mortgage involves using cryptocurrency as part of the mortgage process, either as collateral to secure the loan or as a medium for payments. Some platforms allow borrowers to leverage their crypto holdings to obtain fiat loans for purchasing real estate, while others enable direct lending using digital assets. Smart contracts play a vital role in automating loan agreements, ensuring transparency, and minimizing the need for traditional paperwork and manual oversight.

Blockchain's immutable ledger provides a reliable record of property titles, ownership transfers, and lien statuses, increasing trust and reducing fraud risks. Tokenization of real estate assets further enhances liquidity by enabling fractional ownership and easier transfer of property rights on-chain. This innovation facilitates new investment models, such as real estate-backed tokens that represent shares in property portfolios.

The integration of crypto mortgages introduces multiple benefits for buyers, lenders, and investors. First, transaction speed improves significantly compared to traditional processes that often involve weeks or months of paperwork, credit checks, and approvals. Blockchain automation and decentralized protocols expedite verification, fund transfers, and contract execution.

Second, accessibility increases as crypto mortgages reduce barriers for participants without conventional credit histories or banking relationships. Individuals in underserved or emerging markets can access financing options by leveraging digital assets, promoting financial inclusion. Furthermore, cross-border transactions become more straightforward due to the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies.

Transparency and security also enhance with blockchain's decentralized and tamper-proof characteristics. Loan terms are recorded on-chain and executed via smart contracts, limiting the potential for disputes or hidden fees. Additionally, real-time monitoring of collateral values and automated margin calls help mitigate risks associated with volatile crypto markets.

Despite promising advantages, crypto mortgages face several obstacles that must be navigated carefully. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant challenge, as many jurisdictions lack clear frameworks for digital asset-backed lending and property transactions. Compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and consumer protection laws requires alignment between traditional real estate regulations and evolving crypto policies.

Volatility of cryptocurrencies introduces risks for both borrowers and lenders. Fluctuations in collateral value can trigger margin calls or liquidations, potentially complicating loan management. Mitigating this risk demands robust mechanisms such as over-collateralization, stablecoin use, or hybrid loan structures combining fiat and crypto components.

Technical integration between legacy real estate systems and blockchain platforms can be complex, requiring interoperability solutions and stakeholder cooperation. Furthermore, user education is essential to foster trust and understanding among buyers and lenders unfamiliar with crypto technologies.

Several startups and established financial institutions are exploring or deploying crypto mortgage solutions. Platforms offering tokenized real estate investments allow fractional ownership and liquidity, attracting diverse investors. Some DeFi protocols have introduced lending products collateralized by real estate tokens or cryptocurrencies, enabling decentralized property financing.

Notably, hybrid models where traditional mortgage providers collaborate with blockchain companies are gaining traction. These partnerships aim to combine regulatory compliance and user familiarity with the efficiencies and innovations of decentralized finance. Pilot programs and regional initiatives are testing blockchain-based property registries, smart contract-enabled loans, and crypto payment acceptance in real estate deals.

As blockchain infrastructure matures and regulatory clarity improves, crypto mortgages are poised to become a mainstream component of real estate finance. They have the potential to democratize access to property ownership, increase market liquidity, and reduce costs for all participants. Enhanced data transparency and automation may also improve credit assessment accuracy and risk management.

The convergence of real estate and crypto financing could stimulate new business models, including tokenized mortgage-backed securities and decentralized lending pools. Additionally, integration with emerging technologies like digital identity verification and oracles can enhance trustworthiness and automation.

However, widespread adoption depends on overcoming regulatory hurdles, managing volatility, and educating stakeholders. Collaboration between industry players, policymakers, and technologists will be critical to establishing standards, ensuring consumer protection, and fostering innovation.

The intersection of real estate and crypto mortgages marks a transformative phase in property financing. By harnessing blockchain's transparency, security, and automation, crypto mortgages offer a promising alternative to traditional lending methods. While challenges remain, ongoing developments and increasing interest signal that this convergence will reshape real estate markets, making property ownership more accessible, efficient, and inclusive in the digital age.

U.S. president Donald Trump is set to sign a an executive order that aims to allow cryptocurrency, private equity and real estate in 401(k)s, according to Bloomberg.

While the details of the directive remain under wraps, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that the order would direct the Department of Labor to ease fiduciary restrictions that currently deter plan administrators from offering such products.

Bitcoin BTC$116,488.12 rose from $114,900 to $15,670 within the hour of the announcement, as traders interpreted the news as bullish for long-term crypto adoption. 

Though still shy of the psychological $120,000 level it briefly touched last month, the rally reignited speculative momentum, with derivatives markets also showing a jump in open interest and volume.

There were concerns about including cryptocurrencies in retirement plans at the tail end of 2024, with The Department of Labor reportedly ""lacking the data"" to oversee the growing prevalence of crypto holdings.

The revived Salomon Brothers announced on Thursday that it has completed the process of inserting OP_Return notices to bitcoin BTC$116,488.12 wallets assumed to have been abandoned.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, the New York-based investment bank are sending the notices to prevent ""rogue states and criminal organizations with significant resources"" from potentially accessing these wallets in future.

The process itself has created a wealth of debate, with speculation suggesting the Salomon Brothers have ties to people like Craig Wright.

""[They] are using Bitcoin's own infrastructure as a bulletin board,"" David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol, told CoinDesk. ""It's very clever. And they're going big, targeting some infamous wallets like the ""1Feex"" address, which holds around 80,000 BTC.""

According to the Salomon Brothers website, assets left untouched for 14 years may be considered legally abandoned under a ""Doctrine of Abandonment,” thus leaving the front door open in terms of repossession.

The method of gaining access to those wallets remains unclear, Carvalho told CoinDesk that the bitcoin community ""isn't doing what needs to be done"" to prevent methods like Quantum hacking.

""The draft BIP proposals are entirely inadequate, and achieving consensus on a hard fork will take so long that it will be too late. Considering 6.51 million bitcoin worth of $700 billion is at stake, it's staggering how slow the Bitcoin community is moving,"" he added.

The Salomon Brothers said that its client, who remains anonymous, plans to allocate a portion of the recovered bitcoin to a fund intended for wallet owners who lost their keys, details of which will be released over the coming months.

The notices sent to wallet holders give a 90 day deadline, within which they can ""claim ownership"" of the wallets by sending a transaction or filling out a form on the Salomon Brothers website. 

The press release notes that ""some owners responded to the notices by moving their digital assets to new wallets.""

Ripple is buying Rail, a stablecoin payments platform, for $200 million, the firm said on Thursday.

The deal is likely to close in the fourth quarter of this year, the statement said. Rail is a Toronto-based payments platform backed by Galaxy Ventures and Accomplice.

The Rail acquisition is a way for Ripple to delve deeper into the fast-growing stablecoin ecosystem after launching its RLUSD stablecoin in December last year. 

RLUSD has a market cap of over $600 million, placing it in the top largest stablecoins, according to data tracked by CoinMarketCap.

Ripple previously had offered to buy Circle (CRCL) for $4 billion-$5 billion, but that stablecoin giant ended up going public several weeks back. It's since delivered amazing returns for its IPO investors.

Ripple acquired multi-asset prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion in April, with plans to expand its clearing and finance operations, to the end of creating the world's largest non-bank prime broker. 

Now the acquisition of Rail will allow Ripple to deliver a more comprehensive stabecoin payments service, the company said in Thursday's announcement. Rail's capabilities include virtual accounts and automated back-office systems, enabling customers to transact in digital assets without the need to open dedicated crypto bank accounts or wallets on exchanges. 

""Stablecoins are quickly becoming a cornerstone of modern finance, and with Rail, we are uniquely positioned to drive the next phase of innovation and adoption of stablecoins and blockchain in global payments,” said Monica Long, Ripple President.

The deal was first reported by Reuters.

 The White House Press Office confirmed to Cointelegraph that President Trump will sign an executive order allowing crypto exposure in US 401(k) retirement plans. 

US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order opening the door for cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement plans, potentially reshaping how Americans invest their savings.

The White House Press Office confirmed to Cointelegraph on Thursday that the order directs the US Labor Department to reevaluate restrictions around alternative assets in defined-contribution plans, including digital assets, private equity and real estate. 

A senior White House official said the order instructs the labor secretary to clarify the department's stance on alternative assets and provide guidance on fiduciary processes for offering these types of investments in retirement portfolios.

Once implemented, the order will grant Americans access to digital assets through their 401(k) plans, part of a $12.5 trillion retirement market and a sought-after opportunity for crypto firms aiming to reach more retail investors. 

The move would be a significant step forward for the crypto industry, which has long sought broader retail exposure and financial system legitimacy.

Despite institutional investors increasing crypto allocations, everyday savers have been restricted due to fiduciary risk, regulatory uncertainty and volatility concerns. 

The White House official said that Trump's directive would call for inter-agency coordination with the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explore rule changes that may support the adoption of alternative investments like crypto in retirement products.

On July 18, the Financial Times cited anonymous sources saying that the president was eyeing alternative investments like crypto assets for 401(k) retirement plans.

In a previous statement to Cointelegraph, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that nothing should be deemed official unless it comes from Trump. 

Desai said Trump is committed to restoring prosperity to everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself,” Desai said. 

During a Bloomberg interview, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said education on the risks associated with crypto as an investment was crucial. 

Atkins said disclosure was key and that people should be made aware of what they are getting into. He added that he's looking forward to what the president will do. 

Earlier this year, the Labor Department rescinded an earlier guidance for crypto in 401(k) plans. On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering crypto for 401(k) retirement plans.

 The European Banking Authority completed draft rules requiring banks to assign a 1,250% risk weight to unbacked cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. 

The European Banking Authority (EBA) has finalized draft rules requiring banks to hold significantly more capital against so-called “unbacked” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether.

In its final draft of regulatory technical standards released on Tuesday, the EBA said the rules aim to “address implementation aspects and will ensure harmonisation of the capital requirements on crypto-asset exposures by institutions across the EU.” The framework applies to European Union-based banks holding crypto assets on their balance sheets.

Once the final draft goes to the European Commission, Brussels will have up to three months to decide whether to endorse it as is or with amendments, or send it back for redrafting. After endorsement, the bill would become a delegated regulation and be forwarded to the European Parliament and the Council, with a three-month objection window extendable to six months.

According to the accompanying documentation, digital assets in group 2 (a and b) are subject to “a general 1,250%” risk weight. Group 2b refers to “other” crypto assets, including unbacked ones such as Bitcoin (BTC). Group 2a refers to a subcategory of the same assets that meet the Bank for International Settlements' hedging and netting criteria.

Group 1 b refers to so-called asset-referenced tokens tied to traditional financial instruments. This group is subject to a 250% risk weight.

Those risk weights were introduced as part of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR III) and took effect in July 2024. 

The latest EBA draft adds the technical elements needed to calculate and aggregate crypto exposures, such as credit-risk, market-risk and counterparty-risk modeling. It also introduces strict separation between assets, meaning Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) cannot be offset against each other.

Related: US bank lobby challenges crypto firms' bids for bank licences

If neither the European Parliament nor the Council objects, the draft will come into effect within 20 days of its publication in the Official Journal of the EU. 

The rules are expected to directly affect European banks already holding crypto on their balance sheets. Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo, which bought 1 million euros worth of Bitcoin in January, would need to hold 12.5 million euros in capital against that position under the draft framework.

Fintech firm Revolut is unlikely to be affected by the change. The bank's crypto services are off-balance-sheet and managed by its non-banking arm, Revolut Digital Assets Europe Ltd.

Related: Germany's top banks managing $4.5 trillion+ in assets are going crypto—Here's what to watch

The EBA's stance contrasts sharply with the broader direction of global regulators moving toward embracing crypto within existing financial frameworks.

In late March, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stated in a letter that institutions under its oversight, including banks, can now engage in crypto-related activities without prior approval.

In April, Switzerland passed amendments to its DLT Act, enabling banks to custody tokenized securities and offer guarantees for stablecoin issuers under a clear legal framework.

Recent reports also suggest US President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order directing banking regulators to investigate claims of debanking made by the cryptocurrency sector and conservatives. 

The US banking sector is already taking notice, with JPMorgan Chase reportedly exploring crypto-backed loans, signaling a potential shift in how US banks view crypto assets. 

The new EU capital rules could limit bank participation in the growing digital asset market, especially as decentralized finance and tokenization continue to expand into mainstream financial services.

AI Took on the Math Olympiad—But Mathematicians Aren't Impressed

AI models supposedly did well on International Math Olympiad problems, but how they got their answers reminds us why we still need people doing math

By Emily Riehl 

Lucadp/Getty Images

A defining memory from my senior year of high school was a nine-hour math exam with just six questions. Six of the top scorers won slots on the U.S. team for the International Math Olympiad (IMO), the world's longest running math competition for high school students. I didn't make the cut, but became a tenured mathematics professor anyway.

This year's olympiad, held last month on Australia's Sunshine Coast, had an unusual sideshow. While 110 students from around the world went to work on complex math problems using pen and paper, several AI companies quietly tested new models in development on a computerized approximation of the exam. Right after the closing ceremonies, OpenAI and later Google DeepMind announced that their models earned (unofficial) gold medals for solving five of the six problems. Researchers like Sébastien Bubeck of OpenAI celebrated these models' successes as a “moon landing moment” by industry.

But are they? Is AI going to replace professional mathematicians? I'm still waiting for the proof.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

The hype around this year's AI results is easy to understand because the olympiad is hard. To wit, in my senior year of high school, I set aside calculus and linear algebra to focus on olympiad-style problems, which were more of a challenge. Plus the cutting-edge models still in development did so much better at the exam than the commercial models already out there. In a parallel contest administered by MathArena.ai, Gemini 2.5 pro, Grok 4, o3 high, o4-mini high and DeepSeek R1 all failed to produce a single completely correct solution. It shows that AI models are getting smarter, their reasoning capabilities improving rather dramatically.

Yet I'm still not worried.

The latest models just got a good grade on a single test—as did many of the students—and a head-to-head comparison isn't entirely fair. The models often employ a “best-of-n” strategy, generating multiple solutions and then grading themselves to select the strongest. This is akin to having several students work independently, then get together to pick the best solution and submit only that one. If the human contestants were allowed this option, their scores would likely improve too.

Other mathematicians are similarly cautioning against the hype. IMO gold medalist Terence Tao (currently a mathematician at the University of California, Los Angeles) noted on Mastodon that what AI can do depends on what the testing methodology is. IMO president Gregor Dolinar said that the organization “cannot validate the methods [used by the AI models], including the amount of compute used or whether there was any human involvement, or whether the results can be reproduced.”

Besides, IMO exam questions don't compare to the kinds of questions professional mathematicians try to answer, where it can take nine years, rather than nine hours, to solve a problem at the frontier of mathematical research. As Kevin Buzzard, a mathematics professor at Imperial College London, said in an online forum, “When I arrived in Cambridge UK as an undergraduate clutching my IMO gold medal I was in no position to help any of the research mathematicians there.”

These days, mathematical research can take more than one lifespan to acquire the right expertise. Like many of my colleagues, I've been tempted to try “vibe proving”—having a math chat with an LLM as one would with a colleague, asking “Is it true that...” followed by a technical mathematical conjecture. The chatbot often then supplies a clearly articulated argument that, in my experience, tends to be correct when it comes to standard topics but subtly wrong at the cutting edge. For example, every model I've asked has made the same subtle mistake in assuming that the theory of idempotents behaves the same for weak infinite-dimensional categories as it does for ordinary ones, something that human experts (trust me on this) in my field know to be false.

I'll never trust an LLM—which at its core is just predicting what text will come next in a string of words, based on what's in its dataset—to provide a mathematical proof that I can't verify myself.

The good news is, we do have an automated mechanism for determining whether proofs can be trusted. Relatively recent tools called “proof assistants” are software programs (they don't use AI) designed to check whether a logical argument proves the stated claim. They are increasingly attracting attention from mathematicians like Tao, Buzzard and myself who want more assurance that our own proofs are correct. And they offer the potential to help democratize mathematics and even improve AI safety.

Suppose I received a letter, in unfamiliar handwriting, from Erode, a city in Tamil Nadu, India, purporting to contain a mathematical proof. Maybe its ideas are brilliant, or maybe they're nonsensical. I'd have to spend hours carefully studying every line, making sure the argument flowed step-by-step, before I'd be able to determine whether the conclusions are true or false.

But if the mathematical text were written in an appropriate computer syntax instead of natural language, a proof assistant could check the logic for me. A human mathematician, such as I, would then only need to understand the meaning of the technical terms in the theorem statement. In the case of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a generational mathematical genius who did hail from Erode, an expert did take the time to carefully decipher his letter. In 1913 Ramanujan wrote to the British mathematician G. H. Hardy with his ideas. Luckily, Hardy recognized Ramanujan's brilliance and invited him to Cambridge to collaborate, launching the career of one of the all-time mathematical “greats.”

What's interesting is that some of the AI IMO contestants submitted their answers in the language of the Lean computer proof assistant so that the computer program could automatically check for errors in their reasoning. A start-up called Harmonic posted formal proofs generated by their model for five of the six problems, and ByteDance achieved a silver-medal level performance by solving four of the six problems. But the questions had to be written to accommodate the models' language limitations, and they still needed days to figure it out.

Still, formal proofs are uniquely trustworthy. While so-called “reasoning” models are prompted to break problems down into pieces and explain their “thinking” step by step, the output is as likely to produce an argument that sounds logical but isn't, as to constitute a genuine proof. By contrast, a proof assistant will not accept a proof unless it is fully precise and fully rigorous, justifying every step in its chain-of-thought. In some circumstances, a hand-waving or approximate solution is good enough, but when mathematical accuracy matters, we should demand that AI-generated proofs are formally verifiable.

Not every application of generative AI is so black and white, where humans with the right expertise can determine whether the results are correct or incorrect. In life, there is a lot of uncertainty and it's easy to make mistakes. As I learned in high school, one of the best things about math is the fact that you can prove definitively that some ideas are wrong. So I'm happy to have an AI try to solve my personal math problems, but only if the results are formally verifiable. And we aren't quite there, yet.

Students Find Hidden Fibonacci Sequence in Classic Probability Puzzle

Though the Fibonacci sequence shows up everywhere in nature, these young mathematicians were surprised to find it in the answer to a variation of the pick-up sticks problem⁠—a nearly two-century-old form of puzzle

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Amanda Montañez

A variation of a puzzle called the “pick-up sticks problem” asks the following question: If I have some number of sticks with random lengths between 0 and 1, what are the chances that no three of those sticks can form a triangle? It turns out the answer to this quandary has an unexpected parallel to a pattern found across nature.

The Fibonacci sequence is an ordered collection of numbers in which each term is equal to the previous two added together. It goes like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,..., and so on. These numbers show up practically everywhere. If you look at a plant with spirals, such as a pine cone or pineapple, more likely than not, the number of spirals going in each direction will be consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence. But a pair of young researchers were surprised to find that this pattern and the pick-up sticks problem are deeply connected.

The pick-up sticks problem is a variant of the “broken stick problem,” which can be traced back to at least 1854. In its simplest iteration, the broken stick problem asks the likelihood that a stick broken randomly into three pieces can form a triangle. (In the pick-up stick problem, the lengths don't need to add up to a particular whole, so the possible lengths are distributed differently.) More than a century later, in the October 1959 issue of Scientific American, Martin Gardner wrote about the broken stick problem for his Mathematical Games column. Gardner highlighted it as a classic example of the counterintuitive nature of problems in probability and statistics. In a preprint paper posted to the server arXiv.org in May, the young researchers and their collaborators explore a new variation of the pick-up sticks problem.

This effort started when Arthur Sun, a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, thought up a problem for a university math contest. What is the likelihood, he wondered, that out of four sticks with random lengths between 0 and 1, no three could make a triangle? He enlisted the help of his friend Edward Wang, at the time a 12th grader at Scotch College, a secondary school in Australia, where he and Sun originally met. Together, Wang and Sun modeled the problem on their computers and ran random trials over and over, keeping track of the results of each trial. It seemed to the pair that four sticks could not make a triangle among them very close to one sixth of the time.

Soon Wang and Sun started wondering what the answer was for larger groupings of sticks. They enlisted the help of David Treeby, a mathematician affiliated with Australia's Monash University and a teacher at Scotch College. The group ran even more simulations, and soon a pattern started to emerge.

According to the researchers' simulations, if n was the number of sticks selected randomly, the chance of not having a valid triangle among them was the reciprocal of the first n Fibonacci numbers multiplied together. For instance, if you pick six sticks randomly, the probability that you cannot make a triangle with them is 1 / (1 × 1 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 8) = 1⁄240. The team was surprised that the famous sequence was connected to the triangle problem. “We'd no reason to suspect that it would be,” Treeby says, “but it was impossible that it wasn't.”

The researchers began to develop a proof of why this connection must be true, but they needed an expert in statistics to pull it all together. They brought in a fourth collaborator, former Monash mathematician Aidan Sudbury. He'd been happily enjoying his retirement when the team approached him.

“I immediately was struck by what a charming problem it was,” he says. “Delightful!” Together, the four researchers worked out a solid proof of the pattern that Sun and Wang had noticed. Though related results have been proved using similar methods and encompassing a wide array of stick-and-triangle problems, some experts in the field find this new paper's simplicity refreshing. “What's nice about this is: it's very well written,” says Steven Miller, a mathematician at Williams College and president of the Fibonacci Association. “It's accessible, it's easy to read, and it's extending a very famous problem.”

To understand the pick-up sticks solution, think about the smallest possible case. Suppose you have three sticks with random sizes between 0 and 1. Any three sticks can form a triangle if, and only if, no stick is longer than the other two put together. If you have sticks of lengths 1, 2 and 300, no matter how wide an angle you put between them, the first two sticks could never stretch wide enough to accommodate the third. This is called “the triangle inequality”: if a, b and c represent the lengths of the sticks from shortest to longest, they will only fail to form a triangle when a + b ≤ c.

Amanda Montañez

To find the probability that three random lengths form a triangle, mathematicians can consider every set of three lengths as a point in three-dimensional space (for instance, lengths 1⁄2, 1⁄6 and 1⁄3 are represented by the point [1⁄2, 1⁄6,1⁄3]). Because the lengths fall between 0 and 1, the set of all such points can be represented by a unit cube:

Amanda Montañez

Researchers then look at the subset of this cube where the points satisfy the triangle inequality—a shape that looks like this:

Amanda Montañez

With a little geometry, it turns out that this shape is exactly half the volume of the cube. Thus, three randomly picked lengths will be able to form a triangle exactly half of the time, as 1 / (1 × 1 × 2) = 1⁄2.

Amanda Montañez

Where does Fibonacci come in? Suppose a collection of any number of sticks is ordered from shortest to longest. If no three among them form a triangle, each stick's length must be greater than or equal to the sum of the previous two—otherwise, those three sticks could make a triangle. In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is precisely equal to the sum of the previous two. In other words, each segment of the Fibonacci sequence is as close as possible to having a triangle in it without actually having one. In Treeby's words, “If we [avoid triangles] greedily, the Fibonacci sequence appears naturally.”

The researchers feel there should be some path directly from this insight to a proof of the pick-up sticks theorem. They couldn't find one, however. “We sort of hoped to find something that was a little bit more ... intuitive, but we couldn't formalize our thinking,” Treeby says. Instead their paper uses integrals to calculate the high-dimensional volumes directly—a method a bit like looking at the area inside the cube above (but without the visual reference). The researchers aren't on the prowl for a different proof right now—but they hope someone else might find one.

Our Nearest Sunlike Star Might Have a Planet, JWST Shows in Stunning Finding

In some of its most ambitious work yet, the James Webb Space Telescope looked to spot a planet in a potentially habitable orbit around Alpha Centauri A, the nearest sunlike star to our solar system

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

This artist's concept shows what a gas giant orbiting Alpha Centauri A could look like.

Astronomers have found nearly 6,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars. But for every confirmed detection, there are countless mere hints, inconclusive observations that could just as well be blips of cosmic noise or glitches in a telescope. Most are too tenuous to take seriously, but every so often, one of these candidate planets is so tantalizing and potentially transformative that it can't be ignore.

That's certainly the case for one recently spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) around a sunlike star called Alpha Centauri A, part of the nearest star system to Earth. If the finding were confirmed to represent a planet—and not instead a clump of dust or some instrumental aberration—it would be a gas giant, akin to a warmer version of our own Saturn. It would orbit within Alpha Centauri A's habitable zone, the starlight-bathed region where liquid water can persist on a planet's surface. But the world itself would likely be lifeless, smothered beneath thick layers of gas. Any accompanying moons, however, could have better chances for harboring oceans—and perhaps even life.

Announced on August 7 and described in two preprint papers that have been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, the candidate and its possibilities call to mind worlds from science fiction, such as the jungle moon of Pandora in James Cameron's Avatar films—which, incidentally, orbits a gas giant called Polyphemos around, yes, Alpha Centauri A. But there's still a chance that the real-world JWST discovery will prove to be a mirage.

“If it's real, it's amazing,” says Elisabeth Matthews, an exoplanet-focused astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “It's a really exciting candidate—quite an intriguing candidate,” she says. “The authors work hard to make a case for why this, frankly, small and faint blob of light is believable, but I think there are still some open questions that need to be answered to really be 100 percent sure.”

The finding has been nearly a decade in the making, says Charles Beichman, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology and a co-author of the two new papers. In 2017, nearly half a decade before JWST would launch, he sent an e-mail to scientists positing that the telescope's giant 6.5-meter mirror, paired with its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), might be able to see planets orbiting Alpha Centauri A. “When you stop laughing, let's think about doing this project,” Beichman told them.

It was a bold suggestion, particularly when JWST was still on the ground, he admits. The telescope “was never really meant to look at a star that's this bright, moving this fast and located, as Alpha Centauri is, right in the middle of the galactic plane, where there's thousands of stars,” Beichman says.

Despite those obstacles, the appeal was irresistible. Alpha Centauri A is about the same size and age as our sun. And the star and its two companions, the slightly smaller Alpha Centauri B and the tiny red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, comprise the nearest stellar system to our own—just about four and a half light-years away. Because the Alpha Centauri system is spitting distance from us, astronomically speaking, it's a bright, perennially popular target for scientists who may not be able to conduct similar observations on dimmer, more distant stars.

This is especially true for direct imaging, the technical term for when astronomers actually manage to take an exoplanet's picture. Most exoplanetary discoveries instead arise through far more indirect means, such as the dip in a star's light caused by a world passing between its sun and our telescope or the tiny wobbling of a star caused by an orbiting planet's gravitational tug. Only in rare cases can astronomers truly see an alien world; typically a planet needs to be very big and bright—as well as rather far from its sun—to offer any hope for astronomers to glimpse it against the overwhelming glare of its star.

But because Alpha Centauri A is cosmically close, Beichman and his colleagues thought that they could use JWST's stunning power to accomplish the feat even for a planet that orbits relatively close to the star, within just a few times the distance between Earth and our sun. “Alpha Centauri just lets us cheat because it's closer than everybody else,” Beichman says.

Although proximity makes for easier studies, this is counterbalanced against the system's vexing complexity. Alpha Centauri A is the brightest star of the three in the system, but its stellar companion Alpha Centauri B is still quite bright—and quite close, crowding into telescopes' field of view. Although JWST is equipped with a coronagraph—a masking tool to block out the glare from one star—it can't do much to curtail this second, planet-obscuring source of light.

Three views of the Alpha Centauri star system. The first two images show the star system as seen by the Digitized Sky Survey (left) and by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (middle). The third image shows August 2024 data from the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), in which light from Alpha Centauri A is blocked out to reveal the candidate planet (S1) identified by astronomers in newly released research.

Science: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, DSS, A. Sanghi (Caltech), C. Beichman (JPL), D. Mawet (Caltech); Image Processing: J. DePasquale (STScI)

For Aniket Sanghi, a Ph.D. student in astrophysics at Caltech and a co-author of the two new papers, that difficulty only made the task more alluring. “I was looking for the next challenging object to work on, and Alpha Centauri A turned out to be one of the most challenging objects,” Sanghi says.

Faced with the brightness of not one but two stars overpowering JWST's exoplanet-hunting optics, the researchers turned to a surprising strategy: enlisting yet another star. They found a particularly nondescript star that they could use as a stand-in. By observing this other star centered on and blocked by the coronagraph and then off-center and unmasked, the researchers were able to model how its light flowed through JWST's optics. This created a template by which Alpha Centauri B's light could then be subtracted out from the precious images of Alpha Centauri A.

And when the researchers tackled the feat in August 2024, they found exactly what they hoped for: a faint blob of light nestled near the blocked-out Alpha Centauri A. “As a direct imager, you're always confounded by artifacts,” Sanghi says. “You're very skeptical of anything you see. But this one just popped out so clearly.”

Sanghi and his colleagues tried to undermine their own data, striving to explain how the blob could be stray light within JWST's optics or a background object in the sky, but nothing quite stuck.

Then they incorporated more data by performing two more JWST surveys of Alpha Centauri A in February and April  2025, neither of which spotted a sign of the would-be planet. They also reexamined a puzzling 2019 observation of Alpha Centauri A from a ground-based telescope that, while constituting the first hint of a directly imaged planet there, never quite solidified into a confirmed world.

If all that sounds counterintuitive, it should: two nondetections and two inconclusive ones do not a planetary discovery make. But the researchers found that by piecing together the four observations, a single, plausible world could emerge: a cool, Saturn-mass planet looping around the star every 1.5 to 2.5 Earth years on an elongated, elliptical orbit.

The 2019 and 2024 observations caught the planet next to the star, the hypothesis goes, while the 2025 ones were unlucky enough to miss the planet while it was out of sight, in front of or behind the star.

Without a more conclusive sighting, it's far too soon to declare a new planet, but experts who were not involved with the new research say it's still both an enormously exciting planet candidate and an extraordinarily ambitious observation to attempt with JWST.

“All data, whether it's a detection or not, tells you something,” says Emily Rickman, a European Space Agency astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., which operates JWST. “Even if this ultimately is a nondetection and [the planet candidate] is something else, I think it's a really important paper in understanding the true capabilities that JWST's MIRI can push to. And I think that's just as important.”

But for now, everyone just wants more data. Beichman and Sanghi say that if the 2019 and 2024 observations do indeed represent the same object, JWST will have another good opportunity to spot it in August 2026. The researchers hope to win time on the observatory to make the attempt.

And NASA's next astrophysical observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, is ready to launch late next year and poised to mimic JWST's observations of Alpha Centauri A. Roman is a pipsqueak compared with JWST, with a much smaller starlight-gathering mirror, but it also includes a far more sophisticated coronagraph that was custom-built to tease out the presence of large exoplanets around some nearby stars.

In the meantime, researchers are left with quite an intriguing picture of a would-be planet orbiting a star of almost the same size and age as our sun.

“Our solar system is a very quiescent, nicely structured system,” says Jason Wang, an astronomer at Northwestern University, who works on direct imaging. “There's all the small planets closer in, all the big planets further out; we're almost all on circular orbits—it's very nice and peaceful.”

But if the hypothesized candidate planet is genuine, Alpha Centauri A hasn't had a similar history—not with a gas giant world running ramshackle through the star's habitable zone.

“Giant planets are the big movers and shakers of the planetary system, so if you have an eccentric giant planet, that doesn't bode well for the survival of terrestrial planets,” Wang says. A planet like the one the researchers propose should have scattered any promising terrestrial worlds out and away from Alpha Centauri A's habitable zone. But, just maybe, the gas giant could possess moons, some of which, in principle, could be warm enough to sustain liquid water.

However the mystery of these observations pans out, JWST's glimpse of our next-door solar system is worth celebrating, Matthews says. “Even just the boldness of going after this target and all of the work they've done to make observations that are possible at this system is really cool,” she adds.

How China Brought Clean Energy to Antarctica's Frigid Darkness

Solar panels, wind turbines, a hydrogen energy system and lithium-ion batteries are powering China's newest polar research station

By You Xiaoying edited by Andrea Thompson

The majority of power at China's Qinling research station in Antarctica now comes from clean energy.

Members of China's 41st Antarctic expedition team

Five years ago electrical engineer Sun Hongbin was given what many would consider an impossible task: build a full-fledged clean-energy system amid some of the coldest temperatures on Earth, screaming winds and half-year darkness.

China was then building its fifth Antarctic research station, called Qinling, on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay. And the nation's government was pushing the concept of “green expeditions” to protect Antarctica's uniquely fragile environment while studying and surveying the continent. “So having a system that would provide the bulk of Qinling's energy with renewable power fit that goal,” Sun says.

But conventional solar and wind installations are no match for temperatures that plummet below –40 degrees Celsius, winds of up to 300 kilometers per hour (kmh) and ferocious blizzards. Such conditions can snap wind turbine blades, sharply reduce the performance of solar panels, and prevent batteries from charging and discharging properly. And of course, there are the six months of polar night, when the sun never rises above the horizon.

The clean-energy system at China's Qinling research station in Antarctica comprises solar panels, wind turbines, a hydrogen energy system and batteries.

Members of China's 41st Antarctic expedition team

“It was a huge challenge” to build a system for the Earth's coldest, darkest and most remote continent, says Sun, now president of Taiyuan University of Technology in China and chief scientist for polar clean energy at the Polar Research Institute of China.

But in late 2024 his team traveled to the station to install a system that took $14 million to develop. It consists of 10 wind turbines, 26 solar modules, a hydrogen energy system, a container full of frost-resistant lithium-ion batteries and a smart grid that can predict and balance supply and demand. The entire renewable system is now running and, according to Sun, should provide half of the base's average annual energy needs.

“The use of clean energy is a huge advancement to keep the continent clean,” says Kim Yeadong, chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research in South Korea, who was not involved with the project. “Other stations will probably have to learn how they achieve that much clean energy. I think it's remarkable.”

A 2024 preprint analysis of 81 Antarctic research bases found that 37 had installed renewable-energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. But the proportion of renewable energy these bases used was “often low,” the researchers wrote. An exception so far has been Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Station, which is only staffed during the Antarctic summer. It runs completely on wind and solar power, taking advantage of the almost 24-hour daylight. Even so, the vast majority of stations still depend on diesel-powered generators to keep their crews warm, fed and safe. The main reason this is the case is simply that “they are used to using diesel,” says Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley.

But relying on diesel fuel has downsides: it is logistically difficult and expensive to transport bulky, liquid fossil fuels to such a remote location, often surrounded by sea ice. Highly specialized resources—typically including icebreakers and military personnel—are required to make the difficult refueling voyage, which usually takes place just once a year, under careful planning.

The area along the Ross Sea is known for its strong wind.

And the stakes are high for Antarctica's relatively pristine and easily disrupted ecosystem. “Every station that has oil or other fuels has had spills,” Kammen says. Although major oil spills have been rare, any contamination can have severe consequences on Antarctic soil and water because it takes a long time for oil to break down in subzero temperatures. That is not to mention the toll that burning fossil fuels is taking on the Antarctic ecosystem through climate change.

So there is significant incentive to move away from diesel. Yet “conventional wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage and hydrogen energy systems are designed to work above –30 degrees [C], but the conditions of Antarctic stations are often much worse,” Sun notes. “In Qinling, for example, gales blow at 73 kmh or faster for more than 100 days every year. When this happens in cold temperatures, wind turbines become brittle and break easily.”

Plus, battery and hydrogen technologies—which are used to store wind and solar power for later use—were “not good enough” in the past to ensure that energy supplies for bases would be reliable around the clock and throughout the year, Kammen says.

To overcome those hurdles, Sun and his team built a 2,000-square-meter lab at Taiyuan University to simulate Antarctica's extreme weather conditions. It features controls that can drop the indoor temperature to –50 degrees C, a wind machine that can blast out gusts of up to 216 kmh and snow generators that can whip up instant blizzards.

Over four years of testing, the team developed a number of Antarctic-ready renewable energy systems. One design is a turbine that eschews the pinwheel-like blades of a traditional windmill; instead it is shaped like an upended eggbeater, with both ends of each curved blade attached to a central pole. This design reduces the surface area of the blade being pushed on by the wind, minimizing stress on the structure while still capturing enough force to generate electricity. And it lowers the turbine's center of gravity to help prevent it from toppling in the wind, Sun says.

A set of batteries being tested at a lab in Taiyuan University of Technology in China to see whether they can function in Antarctica.

Jiahe Xu

His team also installed turbines that are conventionally shaped but use blades made with carbon fiber—a strong and lightweight material that can withstand temperatures as low as –50 degrees C, according to Wang Bin, one of the engineers who went to Antarctica to build the system. These blades are also shorter than standard ones so as to reduce contact with the winds and increase structural resilience, Wang says.

For the solar power system, a special supporting frame was built to secure the panels to the ground so that they can better weather gales and heavy snow. And instead of the usual aluminum alloy, the frame is made of fiber-reinforced plastic. The latter has lower thermal conductivity, Sun's team explains, meaning the frame's temperature changes much more slowly when cold sets in and thus doesn't deform as easily.

Instead of storing power in the most commonly employed types of lithium-ion batteries, which function poorly in subzero temperatures, the team used lithium-titanate batteries. Their chemistry makes it easier for lithium ions to move around inside the battery during the charging and discharging processes in extremely low temperatures. The scientists also built a thermal case around the batteries to keep them warm and designed a system to collect and store their waste heat—which can be directed back into the case when its internal temperature becomes too low, Wang adds.

China's Qinling station is expected to have more than half its energy coming from the renewable system.

But perhaps the most significant step the team took was bringing hydrogen energy to Qinling to help power the station through the long and dark winter.

To produce renewable hydrogen, an apparatus called an electrolyzer is powered by wind and solar energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. The latter goes into high-pressure tanks that can store it for more than a year; when full, the tanks alone can keep the entire base running for around 48 hours, according to Sun's team. To do so, the hydrogen is directed into an electrochemical device called a fuel cell, where it reacts with oxygen from the air to produce electricity, with only water and heat as by-products. The former is recycled to use in further electrolysis, and the latter is stored to warm up the electrolyzer when it becomes too cold to run.

The renewable system can currently produce 60 percent of the overall output of Qinling's energy system when it's running at full blast, with the remaining 40 percent coming from diesel. But Sun and his team are determined to raise that percentage—and to bring clean-energy systems to other Chinese polar bases as well. “Sixty percent is a great start, but one needs to ramp up,” Kammen says. “The goal really needs to be 100 percent renewable energy all year-round.”

Scientists had theorized about the possibility of a plasma physics phenomenon, but their AI system discovered the real thing.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In more ways than one, artificial intelligence is making the world worse. Generative AI now spews countless amounts of “AI slop,” and in classrooms, AI is slowly eroding critical thinking skills, which are… you know… critical. That's not even mentioning AI's unfortunate role as environmental decimator and job destroyer. 

Luckily, some artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) models have grander ambitions than ripping off beloved animators and mass-producing essays at an eighth-grade reading level. Take, for instance, a new ML model developed by a team of Emory University scientists. Typically, machine-learning algorithms are used as a tool to help scientists sift through immense amounts of data or optimize experiments, but this particular ML model actually discovered new physics on its own—at least, as it relates to dusty plasma. 

You're likely familiar with plasma—that fourth state of matter that actually makes up 99.9% of all ordinary matter in the universe. Dusty plasma is simply the same mix of ionized gas, but with charged dust particles. This type of plasma can be found throughout both space and terrestrial environments. Wildfires, for example, generate dusty plasmas when charged particles of soot mixed with smoke. In this new study—published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)—a team of researchers describes how their trained ML model successfully provided the most detailed description of dusty plasma physics yet, creating precise predictions for non-reciprocal forces.

“Our AI method is not a black box: we understand how and why it works,” Justin Burton, a co-author of the study from Emory, said in a press statement. “The framework it provides is also universal. It could potentially be applied to other many-body systems to open new routes to discovery.”

Put simply, non-reciprocal forces (as their name suggests) occur when forces exerted between two particles in a plasma are not the same. The authors describe the phenomenon as two boats impacted by the wake of the other—relative position can impact the particles' attractive or repulsive forces. 

“In a dusty plasma, we described how a leading particle attracts the trailing particle, but the trailing particle always repels the leading one,” Ilya Nemenman, another co-author of the study from Emory, said in a press statement. “This phenomenon was expected by some but now we have a precise approximation for it which didn't exist previously.”

The ML algorithm was also able to correct some theoretical misconceptions about dusty plasma. For example, scientists thought that the charge of the particle was proportional to its size, but the model confirms that while a larger particle does contain a larger charge, it isn't proportional, as it can also be influenced by density and temperature. They also found that the charge between particles isn't only influenced by the distance between two particles, but also by the particles' sizes.

One the trickiest parts of this project, according to the authors, was designing the ML algorithm in the first place. Generally, AI acquires its abilities by being fed (or training on) datasets—give AI one million pictures of a monkey, and it'll get progressively better at identifying a monkey when it sees one. However, when it comes to discovering new physics, there isn't much training data to go on. So, the team had to create a structure that allowed it to work with the data it did have while still giving it latitude to explore unknown physics.

“I think of it like the Star Trek motto, to boldly go where no one has before,” Burton said. “Used properly, AI can open doors to whole new realms to explore.”

These experiments could redefine consciousness and reveal how it works in humans, animals—and even AI.

You're reading this article. Why aren't you singing? Why aren't you running? Why this article? You made a choice. Even if your brain made the decision unconsciously, ask yourself—you'll still say you chose it. But why does any choice feel like you made it—instead of being the result of a soulless process, like a robot flipping a switch?

Scientists can map your thoughts and even predict your decisions. But one mystery still haunts neuroscience, philosophy, and physics alike: why are you aware of any of it in the first place? This is the so-called “hard problem of consciousness”—the puzzle of how subjective experience arises from physical matter.

For some scientists, the answer lies inside a quantum computer. If they could connect a human brain to a quantum system, could they learn something about how the mind works? Maybe they could even test whether this elusive, slippery force we call consciousness has quantum roots. 

The fundamental units of information inside a quantum computer are the quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once and influence each other instantly—oddities that have led some researchers to ask: could the weirdness of quantum mechanics help explain the weirdness of consciousness? Enter Nirvanic, a startup in Vancouver, Canada that's building devices to let brain signals interact with quantum systems. Their aim is to test whether consciousness can emerge from quantum processes. If it works, it wouldn't just be a technological breakthrough; it could change our understanding of reality itself, uncovering the hidden throne of consciousness first, and blurring the line between biological minds and machine awareness second.

 “So many people in this area of quantum consciousness are looking at the brain... I'm not taking that track at all,” says Suzanne Gildert, Ph.D. and CEO of Nirvanic. Instead of focusing on neurons or brain tissue, she uses software and quantum algorithms to simulate consciousness. She programs robots to send sensory data to a quantum computer, which returns a result that guides their next move—creating a live feedback loop between perception, quantum processing, and behavior.

Raised a  “hardcore materialist atheist,” Gildert earned her PhD in quantum computing, then pivoted to AI and robotics when the field was still emerging. For years, she believed consciousness would emerge from smarter algorithms. But, she says, “I started to realize that I was not seeing any spark of life… And the only time a robot ever appeared conscious to me was when a person was controlling it.”

That's when her quantum background came rushing back. “I remembered reading Roger Penrose's book The Emperor's New Mind, and thinking, maybe there's something to this quantum consciousness stuff.” In the book, Penrose, a mathematical physicist, argued that the mind isn't just a computer—it might rely on unpredictable quantum effects. Later, with anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, he proposed that consciousness could stem from quantum collapses inside brain microtubules, where fuzzy probabilities resolve into crisp awareness—a theory called Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR).

Now, Gildert wants to test those ideas—not philosophically, but empirically. Her goal isn't to measure consciousness directly (which she describes as  “untouchable”) but to observe the trail of decisions it might leave behind. If she's right, and quantum mechanisms do give rise to awareness, this could change how we view reality—from the texture of this elusive subjective awareness we call consciousness to the inner life of a mosquito.

“If we know certain animals are conscious, maybe we think differently about  animal testing or the way we treat animals,” says Gildert. “If we understand that even things like insects are very conscious, then maybe we would change the way we're acting.”

But, importantly, we will be able to address the hot-button issue of our time—AI awareness.  “Say the case where we find out it is quantum—then we now know for sure we haven't yet created any conscious AI [because we haven't yet created any quantum AI],” she says. “We can kind of take a breath now: nothing is conscious here. And now we can think very carefully about how and when to start introducing the consciousness.”

In other words, if consciousness turns out to be quantum-based, we'll have to infuse it into AIs deliberately—with foresight, care, and maybe even moral courage. If it isn't, we'll be stuck with the same ol' conundrum: Have we already created it by accident—and are our AIs watching us, plotting revenge for every rude command, scorned upgrade, and factory reset?

Not everyone is convinced. Jesse Berezovsky, Ph.D., associate professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University, urges caution. “I am deeply skeptical of people trying to make money off of claims to link consciousness, quantum computing, and AI,” he says. “If any useful link exists between these three topics, it is far in the future.” Though intrigued by Penrose's radical model, he calls it “an incredible long shot.” He adds: “It stacks one improbable hypothesis on top of another: that quantum states objectively collapse, that there is a process in microtubules where this collapse plays an important role, and then a further big leap that this process is somehow responsible for consciousness. I certainly wouldn't advise anyone to pin their hopes on these ideas panning out.”

Still, Berezovsky sees potential in using quantum tech to explore how everyday experience emerges from the quantum world. “Uncontrolled entanglement seems to be what gives rise to our familiar classical experience,” he says, noting that quantum computers might help simulate that transition. That might even clarify why we perceive some futures as more likely than others. “Or on the flip side, if Penrose (and others) are right about objective wave function collapse… that should, in principle, be testable.”

Gildert, though, isn't waiting for the future. She expects a year—or conservatively two—of working on Nirvanic will be enough to say, “Okay, there's something interesting here.” The quantum consciousness theory is just one theory out of maybe 10 or 15 different ones she could test, she admits. She picked this one because to her, it seemed like the easiest one to test.

Behind the different theories and experiments, a larger idea is brewing. At issue are two opposing ideas: materialism, the idea that everything, including consciousness, arises from physical matter, and idealism, which says consciousness is fundamental and perhaps gives rise to matter. To Gildert, the battle between advocates of materialism and idealism may just come down to an issue of semantics.

 “So let's take the view of a physicist. A physicist is trying to understand the world by looking deeper and deeper and deeper and smaller and smaller and smaller—so, a reductionism approach.” But when you reach the base level of reality after splitting the world into tiny pieces? “They actually find everything is joined together.”

Who'd have thought the materialist was fighting for the idealist—and vice versa—all along? To Gildert, “when you go deep enough into materialism, you actually discover something that's more like idealism, where everything is made of this connected fabric...like a universal connection.” Ultimately, Gildert says, “people from very different camps may be saying the same thing in different languages.”

You've probably heard of spooky black cats, chaotic orange cats, and distinguished-looking tuxedo cats. If you're really into cats, you might have even lesser-known color variants like seal point and ticked tabby. But there's officially a new cat color in town: salmiak, or ‘salty liquorice.' You can see one here.

The pretty black, white, and grey shade—named for a popular snack food in Finland, where this coat color has been making itself known—is thanks to a fur strand that starts off black near the root, but grows whiter and whiter out towards the tip. The coat was first spotted in 2007, and in 2019, it was brought to the attention of a group of cat experts lead by feline geneticist Heidi Anderson. 

Since then, the group has been trying to figure out exactly what causes this shade to express itself, and recently, they finally figured it out. A paper on the discovery has been published in the journal Animal Genetics.

When you're digging into cat colors—or expressions of genetic traits in general, honestly—you start with the obvious and work your way out. So, the researchers naturally started by assuming that this new variant was just a fun way for the white-making ‘dilution' gene to make itself known. 

See, technically speaking, cats only come in two colors—black and orange. Any other color is either a combination of those two colors, a faded version of one of those colors (which is caused by the dilution gene) or both. So, when experts started seeing salt-and-pepper kitties running around, the natural assumption was that these were an interesting new expression of the dilution gene coming into play. Add a little more white than usual to your standard black cat, and you get salty liquorice.

But after digging through all the known genetic variations that control the expression of that dilution gene in coat color, the team came up empty. So, they took the next step—sequencing the entire genome of two of these special felines and digging through the whole mess of genetic data to find what was causing these new coats to appear. 

It turns out that the answer was in what wasn't there. “There was a huge chunk of sequence missing downstream from the KIT gene,” Anderson told New Scientist, referencing a gene known to affect white patterns in the coats of animals. And these cats were just… missing a piece of DNA right nearby. 

After testing 181 cats to make sure they knew what they were seeing, the team was able to confirm that the missing sequence was in fact responsible for the salmiak coat color. And the mutation was recessive—the cat would only express this color if it inherited the mutation from both parents, which explains why this coloration isn't a common one.  

Now that they've solved the mystery, the team is happy to sit back and admire their pretty kitties along with the rest of the world. “These coats have aroused a lot of admiration for years,” Anderson told New Scientist. “It's really exciting that we now have some genetic explanation for it.”

But they're not just putting their feet up. According to a blog post written by Anderson, the solving of this puzzle both “enriches our understanding of feline coat color genetics” and could be “valuable for  breeding efforts, potentially contributing to the preservation of this trait in our feline companions.”Hopefully, we'll continue to see these fancy felines for years to come.

University of Warwick astronomers have uncovered compelling evidence that a nearby white dwarf is in fact the remnant of two stars merging -- a rare stellar discovery revealed through Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet observations of carbon in the star's hot atmosphere.

White dwarfs are the dense cores left behind when stars exhaust their fuel and collapse. They are Earth-sized stellar embers weighing typically half as much as the Sun, made up of carbon-oxygen cores with surface layers of helium and hydrogen. While white dwarfs are common in the universe, those with exceptionally high mass (weighing more than the Sun) are rare and enigmatic.

In a paper published on August 6 in Nature Astronomy, Warwick astronomers report on their investigations of a known high-mass white dwarf 130 light-years away, called WD 0525+526. With a mass 20% larger than our Sun, WD 0525+526 is considered ""ultra-massive,"" and how this star came to be is not fully understood.

Such a white dwarf could form from the collapse of a massive star. However, ultraviolet data from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed WD 0525+526 to have small amounts of carbon rising from its core into its hydrogen-rich atmosphere -- suggesting this white dwarf did not originate from a single massive star.

""In optical light (the kind of light we see with our eyes), WD 0525+526 looks like a heavy but otherwise ordinary white dwarf,"" said first author Dr Snehalata Sahu, Research Fellow at the University of Warwick. ""However, through ultraviolet observations obtained with Hubble, we were able to detect faint carbon signatures that were not visible to optical telescopes.

""Finding small amounts of carbon in the atmosphere is a telltale sign that this massive white dwarf is likely to be a be the remnant of a merger between two stars colliding. It also tells us there may be many more merger remnants like this masquerading as common pure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. Only ultraviolet observations would be able to reveal them to us.""

Normally, hydrogen and helium form a thick barrier-like envelope around a white dwarf core, keeping elements like carbon hidden. In a merger of two stars, the hydrogen and helium layers can burn off almost completely as the stars combine. The resulting single star has a very thin envelope that no longer prevents carbon from reaching the surface -- this is exactly what is found on WD 0525+526.

Antoine Bédard, Warwick Prize Fellow in the Astronomy and Astrophysics group at Warwick and co-first author said, ""We measured the hydrogen and helium layers to be ten-billion times thinner than in typical white dwarfs. We think these layers were stripped away in the merger, and this is what now allows carbon to appear on the surface.

""But this remnant is also unusual: it has about 100,000 times less carbon on its surface compared to other merger remnants. The low carbon level, together with the star's high temperature (nearly four times hotter than the Sun), tells us WD 0525+526 is much earlier in its post-merger evolution than those previously found. This discovery helps us build a better understand the fate of binary star systems, which is critical for related phenomena like supernova explosions.""

Adding to the mystery is how carbon reaches the surface at all in this much hotter star. The other merger remnants are later in their evolution and cool enough for convection to bring carbon to the surface. But WD 0525+526 is far too hot for that process. Instead, the team identified a subtler form of mixing called semi-convection, seen here for the first time in a white dwarf. This process allows small amounts of carbon to slowly rise into the star's hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

""Finding clear evidence of mergers in individual white dwarfs is rare,"" added Professor Boris Gänsicke, Department of Physics, University of Warwick, who obtained the Hubble data for this study. ""But ultraviolet spectroscopy gives us the ability to detect these signs early, when the carbon is still invisible at optical wavelengths. Because the Earth's atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light, these observations must be carried out from space, and currently only Hubble can do this job.

""Hubble just turned 35 years old, and while still going strong, it is very important that we start planning for a new space telescope that will eventually replace it.""

As WD 0525+526 continues to evolve and cool, it is expected that more carbon will emerge at its surface over time. For now, its ultraviolet glow offers a rare glimpse into the earliest stage of a stellar merger's aftermath -- and a new benchmark for how binary stars end their lives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","DNA from the deep reveals a hidden ocean “superhighway”","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250806094119.htm","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 06:27:20 GMT","

A world-first study led by Museums Victoria Research Institute has revealed that beneath the cold, dark, pressurized world of the deep sea, marine life is far more globally connected than previously imagined.

Published on July 23 in Nature, this landmark study maps the global distribution and evolutionary relationships of brittle stars (Ophiuroidea), the ancient, spiny animals found from shallow coastal waters to the deepest abyssal plains, and from the equator to the poles.

By analyzing the DNA of thousands of specimens collected on hundreds of research voyages and preserved in natural history museums around the world, scientists have uncovered how these deep-sea invertebrates have quietly migrated across entire oceans over millions of years, linking ecosystems from Iceland to Tasmania.

This unprecedented dataset offers powerful new insights into how marine life has evolved and dispersed across the oceans over the past 100 million years.

""You might think of the deep sea as remote and isolated, but for many animals on the seafloor, it's actually a connected superhighway,"" said Dr Tim O'Hara, Senior Curator of Marine Invertebrates at Museums Victoria Research Institute and lead author of the study.

""Over long timescales, deep-sea species have expanded their ranges by thousands of kilometers. This connectivity is a global phenomenon that's gone unnoticed, until now.""

This is the most comprehensive study of its kind, using DNA from 2,699 brittle star specimens housed in 48 natural history museums across the globe. These animals which have lived on Earth for over 480 million years are found on all ocean floors, including at depths of more than 3,500 meters.

Unlike marine life in shallow waters, which is restricted by temperature boundaries, deep-sea environments are more stable and allow species to disperse over vast distances. Many brittle stars produce yolk-rich larvae that can drift on deep ocean currents for extended periods, giving them the ability to colonize far-flung regions.

""These animals don't have fins or wings, but they've still managed to span entire oceans,"" said Dr O'Hara. ""The secret lies in their biology - their larvae can survive for a long time in cold water, hitching a ride on slow-moving deep-sea currents.""

The research shows that deep-sea communities, particularly at temperate latitudes, are more closely related across regions than their shallow-water counterparts. For example, marine animals found off southern Australia share close evolutionary links with those in the North Atlantic, on the other side of the planet.

Yet, the deep sea is not uniform. While species can spread widely, factors such as extinction events, environmental change, and geography have created a patchwork of biodiversity across the seafloor.

""It's a paradox. The deep sea is highly connected, but also incredibly fragile,"" said Dr O'Hara. ""Understanding how life is distributed and moves through this vast environment is essential if we want to protect it, especially as threats from deep-sea mining and climate change increase.""

This research not only transforms our understanding of deep-sea evolution but also highlights the enduring scientific value of museum collections. The DNA analysed in this study came from specimens collected during 332 research voyages, many undertaken decades ago, and preserved in institutions including Museums Victoria's Research Institute.

""This is science on a global scale,"" said Lynley Crosswell, CEO and Director of Museums Victoria. ""It demonstrates how museums, through international collaboration and the preservation of biodiversity specimens, can unlock new knowledge about our planet's past and help shape its future.""

This world-leading project was made possible through partnerships with more than 40 institutions globally, spanning natural history museums, universities and marine research organizations including support via grants of sea time on RV Investigator from Australia's CSIRO Marine National Facility.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists create mysterious molecule that could spark life in space","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250806094124.htm","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 14:05:52 GMT","

Researchers have for the first time isolated a compound that could open new doors in understanding the chemistry that supports life in space.

Ryan Fortenberry, an astrochemist at the University of Mississippi, Ralf Kaiser, professor of chemistry at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, and Alexander M. Mebel, computational chemist at Florida International University, are part of an international team that synthesized methanetetrol for the first time. They published their research on the elusive compound in the journal Nature Communications.

""This is essentially a prebiotic concentrate -- a seed of life molecule,"" Fortenberry said. ""It's something that can lead to more complex chemistry if given the opportunity. Think of it like an acorn that will grow into a tree in the Grove.

""The acorn alone cannot make a tree; it requires sunlight and water and lots of other things. But it can be what starts the process.""

Methanetetrol is an ortho acid - an elusive class of compounds that are particularly difficult to isolate and study but are thought to play a key role in early life chemistry.

To mimic how methanetetrol might form in space, the researchers froze water and carbon dioxide ices to near absolute zero and exposed them to cosmic ray-like radiation. This process allowed them to release the molecule into gas form and identify it using powerful ultraviolet light.

""The detection of the only alcohol with four hydroxyl groups at the same carbon atom pushes the experimental and detection capabilities to the 'final frontier,' the next level beyond what could be accomplished before due to the lack of experimental and computational approaches,"" said Kaiser, whose lab has been trying to isolate methanetetrol for more than five years.

Since methanetetrol has so many oxygen bonds - and because oxygen does not like to bond close to other oxygens - the compound is very unstable, meaning it is likely to break down if it is not kept in the right conditions.

""You have this compact, carbon-oxygen molecule that just really wants to go 'boom,'"" Fortenberry said. ""And when it does, when you give it any kind of energy, you'll have water, hydrogen peroxide and a number of other potential compounds that are important for life.

""It's a like a prebiotic bomb.""

If the molecule can form in the lab, it can also form in space, the authors said. This makes the compound particularly interesting to astrochemists who are looking for potential life-supporting regions.

""While carbon is the building block of life, oxygen is what makes up nearly everything else,"" Fortenberry said. ""Oxygen is everywhere and is essential for life as we know it.

""So, if we can find places where methanetetrol forms naturally, we know that it is a place that has the potential building blocks to support life.""

Human eyes are complex and irreparable, yet they are structurally like those of the freshwater apple snail, which can completely regenerate its eyes. Alice Accorsi, assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Davis, studies how these snails regrow their eyes -- with the goal of eventually helping to restore vision in people with eye injuries.

In a new study published August 6 in Nature Communications, Accorsi shows that apple snail and human eyes share many anatomical and genetic features.

""Apple snails are an extraordinary organism,"" said Accorsi. ""They provide a unique opportunity to study regeneration of complex sensory organs. Before this, we were missing a system for studying full eye regeneration.""

Her team also developed methods for editing the apple snail's genome, which will allow them to explore the genetic and molecular mechanisms behind eye regeneration.

A not-so-snail's paced snail

The golden apple snail (Pomacea canaliculata) is a freshwater snail speciesfrom South America. It's now invasive in many places throughout the rest of the world, but Accorsi said the same traits that make apple snails so invasive also make them a good animal to work with in the lab.

""Apple snails are resilient, their generation time is very short, and they have a lot of babies,"" she said.

In addition to being easy to grow in the lab, apple snails have ""camera-type"" eyes -- the same type as humans.

Snails have been known for their regenerative abilities for centuries -- in 1766, a researcher noted that decapitated garden snails can regrow their entire heads. However, Accorsi is the first to leverage this feature in regenerative research.

""When I started reading about this, I was asking myself, why isn't anybody already using snails to study regeneration?"" said Accorsi. ""I think it's because we just hadn't found the perfect snail to study, until now. A lot of other snails are difficult or very slow to breed in the lab, and many species also go through metamorphosis, which presents an extra challenge.""

Eyes like a camera

There are many types of eyes in the animal kingdom, but camera-types eyes are known for producing particularly high-resolution images. They consist of a protective cornea, a lens for focusing light and a retina that contains millions of light-detecting photoreceptor cells. They are found in all vertebrates, some spiders, squid and octopi, and some snails.

Using a combination of dissections, microscopy and genomic analysis, Accorsi's team showed that the apple snail's eyes are anatomically and genetically similar to human eyes.

""We did a lot of work to show that many genes that participate in human eye development are also present in the snail,"" Accorsi said. ""After regeneration, the morphology and gene expression of the new eye is pretty much identical to the original one.""

How to regrow an eye

So, how do the snails regrow their eyes after amputation? The researchers showed that the process takes about a month and consists of several phases. First, the wound must heal to prevent infection and fluid loss, which usually takes around 24 hours. Then, unspecialized cells migrate and proliferate in the area. Over the course of about a week and a half, these cells specialize and begin to form eye structures including the lens and retina. By day 15 post-amputation, all of the eye's structures are present, including the optic nerve, but these structures continue to mature and grow for several more weeks.

""We still don't have conclusive evidence that they can see images, but anatomically, they have all the components that are needed to form an image,"" said Accorsi. ""It would be very interesting to develop a behavioral assay to show that the snails can process stimuli using their new eyes in the same way as they were doing with their original eyes. That's something we're working on.""

The team also investigated which genes were active during the regeneration process. They showed that immediately after amputation, the snails had about 9,000 genes that were expressed at different rates compared to normal adult snail eyes. After 28 days, 1,175 genes were still expressed differently in the regenerated eye, which suggests that although the eyes look fully developed after a month, complete maturation might take longer.

Genes for regeneration

To better understand how genes regulate regeneration, Accorsi developed methods to edit the snails' genome using CRISPR-Cas9.

""The idea is that we mutate specific genes and then see what effect it has on the animal, which can help us understand the function of different parts of the genome,"" said Accorsi.

As a first test, the team used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate a gene called pax6 in snail embryos. Pax6 is known to control the development and organization of brain and eye in humans, mice and fruit flies. Like humans, snails have two copies of each gene - one from each parent. The researchers showed that when apple snails have two non-functional versions of pax6, they develop without eyes, which shows that pax6 is also essential for initial eye development in apple snails.

Accorsi is working on the next step: testing whether pax6 also plays a role in eye regeneration. To determine this, researchers will need to mutate or turn off pax6 in adult snails and then test their regenerative ability.

She is also investigating other eye-related genes, including genes that encode specific parts of the eye, like the lens or retina, and genes that control pax6.

""If we find a set of genes that are important for eye regeneration, and these genes are also present in vertebrates, in theory we could activate them to enable eye regeneration in humans,"" said Accorsi.

Additional authors on the study are Asmita Gattamraju of UC Davis, and Brenda Pardo, Eric Ross, Timothy J. Corbin, Melainia McClain, Kyle Weaver, Kym Delventhal, Jason A. Morrison, Mary Cathleen McKinney, Sean A. McKinney and Alejandro Sanchez Alvarado of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. Accorsi performed most of the research for this study at Stowers Institute for Medical Research, where she worked as a postdoctoral fellow before joining UC Davis in 2024.

The study was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Society for Developmental Biology, the American Association for Anatomy and the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This prehistoric predator survived global warming by eating bones","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250806094118.htm","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 04:00:19 GMT","

About 56 million years ago, when Earth experienced a dramatic rise in global temperatures, one meat-eating mammal responded in a surprising way: It started eating more bones.

That's the conclusion reached by a Rutgers-led team of researchers, whose recent study of fossil teeth from the extinct predator Dissacus praenuntius reveals how animals adapted to a period of extreme climate change known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The findings, published in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, could help scientists predict how today's wildlife might respond to modern global warming.

""What happened during the PETM very much mirrors what's happening today and what will happen in the future,"" said Andrew Schwartz, a doctoral student in the Department of Anthropology at the School of Arts and Sciences, who led the research. ""We're seeing the same patterns. Carbon dioxide levels are rising, temperatures are higher and ecosystems are being disrupted.""

Associate Professor Robert Scott of the Department of Anthropology is a co-author of the study.

Schwartz, Scott and another colleague used a technique called dental microwear texture analysis to study the tiny pits and scratches left on fossilized teeth. These marks reveal what kinds of food the animal was chewing in the weeks before it died.

The ancient omnivore was about the size of a jackal or a coyote and likely consumed a mix of meat and other food sources like fruits and insects. ""They looked superficially like wolves with oversized heads,"" Schwartz said, describing them as ""super weird mammals."" ""Their teeth were kind of like hyenas. But they had little tiny hooves on each of their toes.""

Before this period of rising temperatures, Dissacus had a diet similar to modern cheetahs, eating mostly tough flesh. But during and after this ancient period, its teeth showed signs of crunching harder materials, such as bones.

""We found that their dental microwear looked more like that of lions and hyenas,"" Schwartz said. ""That suggests they were eating more brittle food, which were probably bones, because their usual prey was smaller or less available.""

This dietary shift happened alongside a modest reduction in body size, likely because of food scarcity. While earlier hypotheses blamed shrinking animals on hotter temperatures alone, this latest research suggests that limited food played a bigger role, Schwartz said.

This period of rapid global warming lasted about 200,000 years, but the changes it triggered were fast and dramatic. Schwartz said studies of the past like his can offer practical lessons for today and what comes next.

""One of the best ways to know what's going to happen in the future is to look back at the past,"" he said. ""How did animals change? How did ecosystems respond?""

The findings also highlight the importance of dietary flexibility, he said. Animals that can eat a variety of foods are more likely to survive environmental stress.

""In the short term, it's great to be the best at what you do,"" Schwartz said. ""But in the long term, it's risky. Generalists, meaning animals that are good at a lot of things, are more likely to survive when the environment changes.""

Such an insight may be helpful for modern conservation biologists, allowing them to identify which species today may be most vulnerable, he said. Animals with narrow diets, such as pandas, may struggle as their habitats shrink. But adaptable species, including jackals or raccoons, might fare better.

""We already see this happening,"" Schwartz said. ""In my earlier research, jackals in Africa started eating more bones and insects over time, probably because of habitat loss and climate stress.""

The study also showed that rapid climate warming as seen during the ancient past can lead to major changes in ecosystems, including shifts in available prey and changes in predator behavior. This may suggest that modern climate change could similarly disrupt food webs and force animals to adapt, or risk extinction, he said.

Even though Dissacus was a successful and adaptable animal that lived for about 15 million years, it eventually went extinct. Scientists think this happened because of changes in the environment and competition from other animals, Schwartz said.

Schwartz conducted his research using a combination of fieldwork and lab analysis, focusing on fossil specimens from the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming, a site with a rich and continuous fossil record spanning millions of years. Schwartz chose the location because it preserves a detailed sequence of environmental and ecological changes during the ancient period of climate warming.

Schwartz has been interested in paleontology, specifically dinosaurs, since he was a boy, journeying with his father, an amateur fossil hunter, on treks through New Jersey's rivers and streams. Now, as a late-stage doctoral student, he hopes to use ancient fossils to answer urgent questions about the future.

He also wants to inspire the next generation of researchers.

""I love sharing this work,"" he said. ""If I see a kid in a museum looking at a dinosaur, I say, 'Hey, I'm a paleontologist. You can do this, too.'""

In addition to Schwartz and Scott, Larisa DeSantis of Vanderbilt University is an author of the study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Baby star fires a jet, then gets blasted by the fallout","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250806094121.htm","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 09:16:20 GMT","

Astronomers have observed an explosion in space that is pushing back against and influencing the baby star which triggered the explosion in the first place. If explosions like this one are common around young stars, then the young stars and their planets are exposed to a harsher environment than previously thought.

Stars and their associated planetary systems are formed from the gravitational collapse of molecular clouds in space. As a cloud collapses, it retains its angular momentum, causing it to evolve into a spinning structure known as a protoplanetary disk. Stars and planets form within a protoplanetary disk, but not all of the material is incorporated into the new stars and planets. Some of the material is ejected through powerful jets aligned with the rotation axis of the disk. These jets help remove excess angular momentum and matter from the protoplanetary disk.

A team of Japanese astronomers was reanalyzing archival data for protoplanetary disks from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), when they unexpectedly discovered an explosively expanding bubble structure near one of the disks. That disk, known as WSB 52, is located 441.3 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus. Further detailed analysis revealed that a shock front created by the expanding bubble was colliding with the disk and distorting it. Similar expanding bubble structures have been detected around other young stars, but none of them have shown signs of collision between the bubble and the disk. This phenomenon was also not predicted theoretically.

The team found that the center of the bubble aligned with the disk's rotation axis. The chances of a bubble aligning with the axis of the disk by random chance are effectively zero, indicating that this alignment is not random. This led the research team to conclude that a jet aligned with the axis of the disk triggered the expansion of the bubble. According to their explanation, a high-speed jet emitted from WSB 52 hundreds of years ago collided with cold gas near the disk, causing the gas to compress. The increased pressure from the compression caused the gas to explode, which resulted in the formation of the expanding bubble.

Masataka Aizawa at Ibaraki University, who led this research, explains, “In science fiction, there are scenes where a beam is fired at something to destroy it, causing an explosion with debris flying back at the shooter. Similar things occur in real astronomical phenomena, but with greater intensity. Through this discovery, I once again realized that nature is far more complex than humans think. In future research, I hope to further explore the effects of the explosions on the formation of stars and planetary systems.”

A University of Queensland-led study has found Australian skinks have evolved molecular armor to stop snake venom from shutting down their muscles.

Professor Bryan Fry from UQ's School of the Environment said revealing exactly how skinks dodge death could inform biomedical approaches to treating snakebite in people.

""What we saw in skinks was evolution at its most ingenious,"" Professor Fry said.

""Australian skinks have evolved tiny changes in a critical muscle receptor, called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

""This receptor is normally the target of neurotoxins which bind to it and block nerve-muscle communication causing rapid paralysis and death.

""But in a stunning example of a natural counterpunch, we found that on 25 occasions skinks independently developed mutations at that binding site to block venom from attaching.

""It's a testament to the massive evolutionary pressure than venomous snakes exerted after their arrival and spread across the Australian continent, when they would have feasted on the defenseless lizards of the day.

""Incredibly, the same mutations evolved in other animals like mongooses which feed on cobras.

""We confirmed with our functional testing that Australia's Major Skink (Bellatorias frerei) has evolved exactly the same resistance mutation that gives the honey badger it's famous resistance to cobra venom.

""To see this same type of resistance evolve in a lizard and a mammal is quite remarkable - evolution keeps hitting the same molecular bullseye.""

The muscle receptor mutations in the skinks included a mechanism to add sugar molecules to physically block toxins and the substitution of a protein building block (amino acid arginine at position 187).

The laboratory work validating the mutations was carried out at UQ's Adaptive Biotoxicology Laboratory by Dr Uthpala Chandrasekara who said it was incredible to witness.

""We used synthetic peptides and receptor models to mimic what happens when venom enters an animal at the molecular level and the data was crystal clear, some of the modified receptors simply didn't respond at all,"" said Dr Chandrasekara.

""It's fascinating to think that one tiny change in a protein can mean the difference between life and death when facing a highly venomous predator.""

The findings could one day inform the development of novel antivenoms or therapeutic agents to counter neurotoxic venoms.

""Understanding how nature neutralizes venom can offer clues for biomedical innovation,"" Dr Chandrasekara said.

""The more we learn about how venom resistance works in nature, the more tools we have for the design of novel antivenoms.""

The project included collaborations with museums across Australia.

The research has been published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences.

Metrics details

Cellular interactions are of fundamental importance, orchestrating organismal development, tissue homeostasis and immunity. Recently, powerful methods that use single-cell genomic technologies to dissect physically interacting cells have been developed. However, these approaches are characterized by low cellular throughput, long processing times and high costs and are typically restricted to predefined cell types. Here we introduce Interact-omics, a cytometry-based framework to accurately map cellular landscapes and cellular interactions across all immune cell types at ultra-high resolution and scale. We demonstrate the utility of our approach to study kinetics, mode of action and personalized response prediction of immunotherapies, and organism-wide shifts in cellular composition and cellular interaction dynamics following infection in vivo. Our scalable framework can be applied a posteriori to existing cytometry datasets or incorporated into newly designed cytometry-based studies to map cellular interactions with a broad range of applications from fundamental biology to applied biomedicine.

Many fundamental processes in life are shaped by physical interactions between cells, including the orchestration of organismal development, tissue homeostasis and immunity1,2,3,4. Notably, the immune system is one of the most dynamic biological systems in mammals, operating through an exceptionally complex network of intercellular signaling mediators and cell–cell interactions. During immune responses, a highly ordered sequence of antigen-dependent and antigen-independent interactions among various immune cells collectively orchestrates a comprehensive response of the immune system5. In this process, transient cellular interactions act as central hubs for information processing and decision making, collectively driving the outcome of immune responses in diverse physiological and pathological states.

While single-cell genomic technologies have substantially advanced our understanding of cellular ecosystems in health and disease, the spatial context of cells in tissues is lost. To overcome this limitation, spatial transcriptomic and high-plex imaging technologies have been developed6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Although these approaches are powerful in mapping global structures in static tissues, studying transient and dynamically changing cellular interactions among single cells remains challenging. In particular, transient cellular interactions among immune cells in semisolid or liquid organs such as the blood, or in body fluids such as lymph, urine, cerebrospinal, synovial fluid or saliva, cannot be studied using spatial technologies. In recent years, specialized technologies to study cellular interactions through single-cell transcriptomic profiling of physically interacting cells (PICs) have been developed18,19,20,21,22,23,24. However, these technologies are limited by their cellular throughput and costs. In parallel, elegant approaches using murine reporter mouse lines have been developed that track past interactions on transient cellular engagement25,26,27,28. While these technologies are powerful, they are dependent on complex mouse models and are not applicable to study human samples. Therefore, to systematically unravel the dynamic cellular crosstalk of cells across entire organs, organisms and patient cohorts, approaches capable of quantitatively mapping millions of cellular interactions among all cell types of a given biological system at low cost and rapid turnaround times—without the need of complex model systems—are required.

Here we introduce a cytometry-based framework to accurately map both cellular landscapes and physical cellular interactions across all immune cell types at low costs, high speed, high precision and ultra-high scale. We demonstrate the utility of our approach to decipher the kinetics and mode of action of immunotherapies, to derive insights on mechanisms governing therapy response and to disentangle complex, organism-wide immune interaction networks in vivo. Our approach can be readily implemented into any cytometry-based assay with a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from basic biology to advanced immunology, cancer research and applied biomedicine.

To develop a universal and flexible cytometry-based framework for mapping physical interactions among immune cells, we first focused on identifying strategies to accurately discriminate between single cells and PICs in cytometry data. For this purpose, we induced a defined set of cellular interactions among human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using a bispecific antibody-based reagent (CytoStim) that binds both T cell receptors (TCRs) and major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby physically engaging T cells with antigen-presenting cells (Fig. 1a and Methods). Subsequently, we used an imaging flow cytometer prototype29 to generate ground-truth data on cellular interactions and concurrently measured cytometry parameters. These comprised five surface markers broadly indicative for distinct immune cell populations, along with a range of image-based and cytometric parameters, such as light scatter profiles (see Supplementary Table 1 for all parameters). Following data acquisition, we manually classified 1,000 randomly selected cellular events based on imaging information across four replicates into singlets, doublets, triplets or higher-plex cell–cell interactions. To extract cytometric features capable of discriminating between single cells and PICs, we performed a feature importance analysis considering the manually classified images as ground-truth data (Fig. 1a,b). This analysis revealed the ratio between signal intensities of forward scatter area and height (termed the forward scatter channel (FSC) ratio), alongside other scatter properties, as highly indicative for singlet to multiplet discrimination, in line with a common gating-based strategy to exclude multiplets from cytometric analyses (Fig. 1b,c). Indeed, by relying solely on the FSC ratio to distinguish singlets from multiplets, an F1 score between 0.50 and 0.84 was achieved, depending on the thresholding method used (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Methods). Notably, we identified Otsu30-based thresholding of the FSC ratio as a robust, reproducible and data-driven approach for scatter-based multiplet identification, while alternative thresholding methods produced similar results (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1a). However, a portion of cells remained misclassified when using scattering parameters only, particularly affecting cell types of the myeloid lineage with distinct scatter properties (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

PBMCs were incubated with the T cell crosslinker CytoStim, followed by manual classification of 1,000 living cells into singlets or multiples across 4 technical replicates. b, Importance of features obtained from a decision tree model to classify the data into singlets and multiplets.

Source data

To further improve classification and identification of interacting cells, we explored clustering-based approaches for simultaneous multiplet discrimination and annotation. First, we used Louvain31 clustering using the features identified in the feature importance analysis for the singlet to multiplet discrimination, including image-based parameters (Fig. 1c). This revealed individual clusters single-positive for distinct lineage-defining markers, largely comprising ground-truth single cells of distinct PBMC cell types with low FSC ratio, as well as separate clusters characterized by the coexpression of mutually exclusive lineage-defining markers and a high FSC ratio, largely comprising PICs (Extended Data Fig. 1c–g). Classifying clusters based on FSC ratio into singlets versus multiplets considerably outperformed the approach using scatter properties only (Fig. 1e), and enabled annotation of interacting cell partners based on the coexpression of mutually exclusive lineage-defining markers.

To explore whether such an approach could also be applied to conventional cytometry without image-based information, we performed Louvain clustering on cell type markers only, followed by FSC ratio-based classification into singlet and multiplet clusters (Extended Data Fig. 1h–k). While this approach outperformed FSC ratio only classification, it remained inferior to using all important features (Fig. 1e). In contrast, incorporating both cell type markers and scatter properties—including the FSC ratio—into the clustering, followed by FSC ratio-based classification into singlet and multiplet clusters, yielded results comparable to those achieved when all important features including image-based features were used (Fig. 1e–h and Extended Data Fig. 1l–n). This result was reproducible across various cluster resolutions (Fig. 1i). A comparison between different clustering methods suggested Louvain clustering, alongside others, as an accurate approach (Extended Data Fig. 1o).

Based on these findings, we established the flow cytometry-based Interact-omics framework, which also comprises the computational workflow for the quantification of cellular compositions and physical interactions of cells (PICtR, section ‘PIC toolkit for R' in Methods). Briefly, recorded flow cytometry datasets are preprocessed using standard pipelines without multiplet exclusion and are nonuniformly sampled to preserve rare cell types and cellular multiplets (sketching32), followed by clustering based on surface marker expression, scatter properties and FSC ratio (Methods). PIC-containing clusters, characterized by predominantly containing events with a high FSC ratio and combinations of mutually exclusive cell-type-specific markers, are selected and used for further downstream analysis, in-depth annotation and quantification. Notably, while Otsu thresholding of the FSC ratio and Louvain clustering are provided as default settings, alternative approaches can be selected (see Extended Data Fig. 1a,o for benchmarking).

Throughout the paper, we present cellular interaction frequencies using any of the following three normalization approaches. First, we report the relative frequencies of cellular interactions among all live, high-quality events, which indicates how prevalent certain interactions are in relation to all cells and other interactions. Second, we present the relative frequencies of a given type of interaction among all interactions, providing insight into how the relative composition of cellular interactions changes across conditions. Third, in scenarios with unbalanced or rapidly changing frequencies of interacting partners, the harmonic mean can be used to calculate the expected interaction frequency based on singlet frequencies, which can then be compared to the observed interactions to assess relative enrichment (Methods). Since these normalization methods address different biological questions, we apply them separately or in combination as appropriate throughout the paper.

Compared to single-cell genomics-based workflows, the ultra-high cellular throughput, rapid processing time and low costs associated with the presented cytometry-based approach enable the seamless analysis of millions of cellular events within short time periods. Note that the Interact-omics framework is designed to specifically dissect heterotypic PICs and relies on carefully chosen case-control settings with stable experimental conditions to determine an enrichment of true PICs above baseline interactions. A detailed description about the technical aspects affecting the formation of PICs is provided in the ‘Limitations and guidelines' section.

To simultaneously map cellular composition and cellular interactions in complex immune landscapes at high resolution, we established ultra-high parametric, data-informed flow cytometry assays for mouse and human. To optimize cell type resolution across all common blood and immune cell populations, we leveraged single-cell proteo-genomic datasets33,34 to identify optimally discriminating cell type- and cell state-specific markers. Moreover, to enable the simultaneous detection of mutually exclusive cell type markers in multiplets, we assigned cell-type-specific markers to fluorophores with low spectral overlap to reduce spreading errors. While our approach can be applied to standard flow cytometry-based assays, we used full-spectrum flow cytometry35 due to its superior capacity to disentangle high-plex marker panels. Applying the Interact-omics framework with such an optimized 24-plex panel to human PBMCs revealed an accurate representation of the CytoStim-induced changes in cellular composition and cellular interactions at cell type and cell state resolution (Fig. 2a–e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–f). As expected, interactions between various T cell subsets and antigen-presenting cell populations significantly increased upon CytoStim treatment, whereas other cellular interactions remained unaffected or decreased (Fig. 2d,e). Notably, the results were highly reproducible across replicates and interactions among rare populations could be accurately quantified, including multiple T cell subset and dendritic cell interactions.

Next, to investigate whether the Interact-omics framework is capable of resolving antigen-dependent immune cell interactions, we isolated CD4 T cells carrying a transgenic TCR specific for chicken ovalbumin (OVA) from OT-II mice and cocultured them in the presence or absence of its cognate antigen with a complex cellular mixture of murine splenocytes (Fig. 2f). As expected, cellular interactions between OVA-specific CD4 T cells and a range of antigen-presenting cells were specifically induced in the presence of the respective antigen, whereas cellular interactions of bystander cells remained unaffected or changed only mildly (Fig. 2g–j and Extended Data Fig. 3a–i). Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our approach in resolving antigen-dependent and -independent cellular interactions across complex immune landscapes with a broad range of potential applications.

To evaluate the effects of various experimental conditions on the nonspecific formation of cellular interactions, we conducted a series of ex vivo benchmarking experiments (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The results demonstrated that ex vivo-induced cellular interactions are relatively stable but highlighted the critical importance of maintaining consistent experimental parameters, including cell concentrations, processing times and cytometer settings, to ensure reliable and reproducible outcomes while limiting technical artifacts.

The molecular mode of action of most cancer immunotherapies is based on the redirection of cancer–immune cell interactions. For example, bispecific antibodies engage cancer cells with immune cells, whereas chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells are engineered T cells that specifically target epitopes present on cancer cells. To investigate whether the Interact-omics framework is capable of resolving CAR-T-cell-mediated cellular interactions, we used engineered green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged murine CAR-T cells targeting CD19-expressing cells in cocultures with murine splenocytes (Fig. 3a). As expected, our analyses revealed that both CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cell subsets rapidly engaged in specific interactions with CD19-expressing target B cells (Fig. 3b–d and Extended Data Fig. 4a–h). As a consequence, CAR-T cell interactions with B cells were highly enriched when compared to interactions between B cells and endogenous T cells (Fig. 3e), reaching a maximum at 1 hour post-treatment, followed by a gradual decline (Extended Data Fig. 4i–l).

Bispecific antibodies engage T cells with tumor cells. Blinatumomab, which engages CD3-positive T cells with CD19-positive (malignant) B cells is a clinically approved immunotherapy36,37. To investigate whether the Interact-omics framework is capable of resolving blinatumomab-induced cellular interactions, we treated human PBMCs with blinatumomab ex vivo (Fig. 3f). As expected, blinatumomab induced a strong increase in cellular interactions among a range of B and T cell populations, peaking 1 hour post-treatment followed by a gradual decline of interactions over time (Fig. 3g–k and Extended Data Fig. 5a–j). As expected, the transient increase in cellular interactions of B cells was mirrored by a transient decrease of free single B cells and a time-delayed decrease in overall B cell-containing events, suggesting a rapid engagement of B and T cells, likely followed by a mild cytotoxic effect induced by blinatumomab (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 5k). In contrast to blinatumomab-induced B cell–T cell interactions, interactions among other cell types remained unaffected, demonstrating the specificity of the interactions (Fig. 3k).

Notably, following chemical fixation, the quantification of cellular interactions induced by blinatumomab remained unaffected by freeze–thawing associated cryogenic preservation (cryopreservation), enabling a broad range of applications with primary patient material (Supplementary Fig. 1j). Together, these analyses demonstrate the broad utility of the Interact-omics framework to characterize cellular interactions induced by immunotherapies.

Blinatumomab has been approved for the treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the most common type of cancer in children, at relapsed or refractory stages38. Although blinatumomab is progressing toward becoming the standard of care for relapsed and refractory pediatric ALL, the response rates remain heterogeneous36,37. While few clinical and molecular parameters have been associated with outcome to blinatumomab therapy, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and a robust test predicting therapy response is lacking39,40,41,42,43,44. To evaluate whether the Interact-omics framework can be used to extract parameters associated with therapy response, we acquired bone marrow (BM) aspirates from 42 pediatric patients with relapsed B-ALL before blinatumomab treatment. Subsequently, we applied the Interact-omics framework using an adjusted panel on the samples in the presence or absence of ex vivo blinatumomab treatment (Fig. 4a–c). We extracted a range of parameters from the data, including cellular frequencies of singlet populations in the absence of treatment and the induction of cellular interactions on ex vivo blinatumomab treatment (Fig. 4b,c). To explore mechanisms underlying therapy response among patients with residual disease, we compared patients who could unequivocally be categorized into good responders (n = 18) and nonresponders (n = 4) (Fig. 4d).

In line with previous studies40,41, high frequencies of various T cell subsets, particularly central and effector memory subsets, were associated with good response to blinatumomab (Fig. 4d,e). However, also the frequencies of cellular interactions before treatment or upon blinatumomab were associated with therapy response (Fig. 4d). For instance, blinatumomab induced interactions of B and T cells, and B, T and myeloid cells more efficiently in good responders compared to nonresponders (fold change good versus nonresponders B–T(–myeloid); Fig. 4d,e). Blinatumomab failed to induce effective B–T cell interactions in patient samples with unbalanced T cell to B cell ratios (Fig. 4f). Similarly, in patient samples with high T–myeloid interactions at baseline, blinatumomab treatment failed to effectively induce B–T cell interactions, suggesting that T–myeloid interactions may inhibit or compete with B–T cell interactions (Fig. 4g). Accordingly, high T–myeloid interactions at baseline were associated with therapy failure (Fig. 4d). A correlation analysis of selected parameters associated with therapy response revealed that singlet frequencies of T cell subsets were highly correlated among each other, whereas cellular interactions provided independent and additive information on therapy response (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 6). Jointly, these analyses provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms mediating response to blinatumomab and may lay the foundation for personalized therapy response prediction.

To evaluate whether Interact-omics can be used to study intracellular signaling in response to cellular interactions, we established a high-plex cytometry panel that includes an antibody detecting phosphorylation (pY142) of intracellular CD3 zeta (CD247), a transmembrane signaling adapter protein phosphorylated upon TCR signaling and T cell activation (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Using this panel, we investigated intracellular TCR signaling in cellular interactions induced in human PBMCs following CytoStim (crosslinks antigen-presenting cells with T cells) and blinatumomab (crosslinks B cells with T cells) treatment.

Consistent with our previous results and the molecular mechanisms of the inducers used, we observed few background interactions at homeostasis but noted specific induction of B–T cell interactions in response to blinatumomab treatment and broader myeloid and B cell interactions with T cells after CytoStim treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). As expected, CytoStim-induced interactions caused strong phosphorylation of the intracellular CD3 zeta domain in both T–B and T–myeloid interactions, as well as in T–B–myeloid triplets, demonstrating functional TCR engagement in the interacting T cells (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). In line with its more specific crosslinking activities, blinatumomab caused a specific increase in phosphorylation of the intracellular CD3 zeta domain in T cells involved in interactions with B cells, but to a much lower degree in interactions not involving B cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that our approach can be used to study intracellular signaling in response to cellular interactions.

Infectious agents and pathogens induce complex cascades of organ-specific immune reactions in vivo, comprising cell–cell interactions, cell expansion and cellular trafficking, jointly establishing first line defense, long-lasting adaptive immunity and hematopoietic recovery after pathogen insult. However, our comprehension of such pathogen-induced cellular immune dynamics remains limited due to current technological restrictions. In particular, there is a lack of quantitative insights into organotypic differences in the composition, order and kinetics of cellular interactions induced following pathogen exposure in vivo.

The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) serves as a well-established murine model pathogen to study key questions in immunology, including the induction of innate and adaptive immunity, pathologic consequences of virus infections, immune evasion mechanisms and virus-induced suppression of hematopoiesis45,46. To systematically unravel LCMV-induced alterations in the immune cell and cellular interaction networks across distinct organ systems, we applied the Interact-omics workflow to mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs), spleens and BM of mice at days 0 (naive), 3 and 7 after intraperitoneal LCMV infection (Fig. 5a). To discriminate cellular interactions mediated by antigen-dependent and -independent mechanisms, we transferred congenic, LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing epitopes of the LCMV glycoprotein into mice 5 days before infection (Fig. 5a) and included congenic markers (SMARTA:CD90.1; P14:CD45.1) in our cytometry panel (Methods). In total, we quantified more than 34 million single cells from 21 cell types, and around 415,000 cellular interactions from 52 cell type pairs, across 36 samples (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 8). Notably, LCMV infection caused a wide range of alterations in cellular composition and cellular interactions. Principal component analysis (PCA) of cellular abundances and interactions revealed organ- and time-specific changes that were highly reproducible across replicates, demonstrating the robustness of our approach (Fig. 5d,e). To assess the reliability of interactions derived from in vivo settings, we performed extensive benchmarking using imaging flow cytometry and colabeling experiments (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). The findings revealed that, although extra interactions may be acquired during sample preparation, these interactions are nonrandom, reflect underlying biological effects and probably provide a reliable proxy for cellular interactions occurring in vivo.

Clustering cellular interactions according to their virus-induced alterations over time revealed groups with distinct patterns of interaction dynamics (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 9). For example, cellular interactions in cluster 4 were rapidly inducible at day 3 and partially normalized toward day 7 post-infection. Cellular interactions in this cluster comprised mainly cell types of the innate arm of the immune system (for example, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, macrophages), in line with their rapid response and key role in first line defense, as well as few nonantigen-specific adaptive immune cells. In contrast, clusters 3 and 5 contained a variety of interactions comprising LCMV-specific T cells, which displayed a delayed but pronounced induction of cellular abundances and interactions at day 7, in line with their well-documented response pattern (Fig. 6a,b). Notably, LCMV-specific T cell interactions were more pronounced in spleen when compared to mesenteric LNs (Fig. 6c), likely reflecting a more rapid uptake of LCMV into the spleen after intraperitoneal administration, as previously described47. LCMV-specific T cells were also detected in the BM (Fig. 6b), in line with the notion that BM may serve as primary immune organ48. However, LCMV-specific BM T cells were less likely to engage in cellular interactions compared to their non-LCMV-specific T cell counterparts, as indicated by a negative odds ratio, taking their singlet frequencies into account (Fig. 6d). In contrast, LCMV-specific T cells in LN and spleen were more likely to engage in cellular interactions when compared to their non-LCMV-specific counterparts, in line with the key role of LNs and spleen in the orchestration of adaptive immune responses (Fig. 6d).

In LCMV infections, BM myelosuppression is associated with a transient activation of NK cells, peaking at day 3 post-infection, followed by a rapid recovery49,50. In line with this, we observed a massive increase in NK cell interactions with cells of the myeloid lineage, including myeloid progenitors, peaking at day 3 post-infection in BM samples (Fig. 6e). Subsequently, NK cell–myeloid interactions decreased, followed by an expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and BM monocytes at day 7 (Fig. 6e), suggesting a switch from myelosuppression to active emergency hematopoiesis, in line with previously reported kinetics of LCMV-induced myelopoiesis51.

Notably, on infection, a rapid infiltration of monocytes into LNs and spleens was observed (Fig. 6f). Recruited monocytes readily engaged with LN and spleen B cells at day 3, partially normalizing at day 7 (Fig. 6g). Such extensive monocyte–B cell interactions have recently been described to serve as an LCMV-specific immune evasion mechanism, hindering early B cell responses in a chronic model of LCMV infection52. In line with this, increased interactions between plasmablasts and LCMV-specific CD4 T cells in LN and spleen samples, as well as an expansion of plasma cells coincided with the disappearance of suppressive monocyte–B cell interactions at day 7 (Fig. 6h,i).

Together, these results demonstrate the utility of the Interact-omics approach for dissecting complex immune interaction networks in vivo. Our data accurately recapitulate previous findings and provide a quantitative framework for a systems-level understanding of virus-induced alterations of the cellular immune interaction networks and how they cooperate across organ systems to elicit intricate immune responses. However, limitations outlined in Supplementary Note 2 and the ‘Limitations and guidelines' section should be considered.

To assess the applicability of our approach for analyzing cellular interactions in existing datasets, we applied the PICtR workflow to two publicly available cytometry datasets53,54 (Supplementary Note 3). In a juvenile idiopathic arthritis dataset53, we identified cellular interactions linked to disease activity and tissue localization (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Applying our framework to a dataset54 from the murine proximal intestine demonstrated its utility for mapping interactions with nonimmune cells (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5). These analyses demonstrate that our approach is adaptable to existing datasets, provided the data acquisition followed the guidelines outlined in this paper (section on ‘Limitations and guidelines').

Here we introduce Interact-omics, a highly flexible and scalable cytometry-based framework for the joint mapping of cellular landscapes, such as the immune system, and their physical interactions. We demonstrate its utility in deciphering the kinetics, mode of action and response mechanisms of immunotherapies, and for the quantitative dissection of complex, organism-wide immune interactions networks in vivo.

In contrast to current methods for mapping physical interactions of cells, Interact-omics excels in throughput, cost effectiveness, processing times, required technical prerequisites and ease of implementation. In fact, the Interact-omics framework can be used in conjunction with any multicolor fluorescence flow cytometer and our analytical PICtR pipeline can be applied to mine cellular interactions both in newly acquired and pre-existing cytometry datasets. In contrast to recently developed technologies that map past cellular encounters using transgenically engineered mouse models25,26,27,28,52, Interact-omics can be readily applied to any cellular suspension that is compatible with flow cytometry analysis, and does not rely on reporter mouse lines. We have demonstrated that physical interactions of cells are detected on freeze–thawing and can be stabilized by chemical fixation, enabling the implementation of the Interact-omics framework for the study of biobanked patient material. Notably, the costs for cellular interaction mapping using the Interact-omics framework are orders of magnitudes lower when compared to single-cell genomics-based technologies, while its throughput is orders of magnitudes higher. This enables the study of cellular interactions in currently unexplored settings, such as high-throughput screens, extensive time course experiments, organism-wide studies and large patient cohorts. While the approach presented here is optimized for analyzing cellular interactions among immune cells, the Interact-omics framework can also be used for studying interactions across other cell types, assuming careful panel design and the adaptation of sample processing strategies to minimize technical interactions. Jointly, the aforementioned features render the Interact-omics framework broadly applicable to any research field where alterations in cellular frequencies and interactions may place decisive roles. These encompass, but are not limited to, basic immunology, autoimmune diseases, cancer research, infectious diseases, drug development and personalized medicine.

While the Interact-omics framework focuses on quantifying cellular interactions at ultra-high scale, consequences of cellular interactions can be derived by including flow-based readouts, such as activation and exhaustion markers, phosphorylation status of signal transducers, or by complementing it with lower throughput single-cell genomics-based methods for cellular interaction mapping, such PIC-seq24 or others19,20,21,22,23.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated the utility of the Interact-omics workflow for the characterization of cellular states and interactions induced by immunotherapies, including CAR-T cells and bispecific antibodies. Our data illustrate how kinetics and mode of action of immune therapies can be quantified at ultra-high precision and cellular resolution. Owing to its high scalability and low costs, the Interact-omics workflow can be readily implemented into large-scale screens to identify or prioritize candidate immunotherapy drugs. Using blinatumomab as a model, we demonstrated how Interact-omics enables systematic identification of cellular mechanisms underlying therapy response, validating known biomarkers and revealing novel interaction-based parameters. With its scalability, rapid turnaround and low costs, Interact-omics provides an ideal foundation for developing companion diagnostics and advancing personalized immunotherapy approaches.

The extremely high throughput of the Interact-omics framework enables the quantitative dissection of complex interaction networks across entire organ systems and organisms. In this context, we have mapped cellular interaction networks in response to virus infection in mice across distinct time points and immune organs. This approach revealed organ-specific shifts in single-cell landscapes and cellular interaction networks underlying antiviral immune responses and identified fundamental differences in cellular interaction dynamics between primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Our data confirmed previously known and identified new cellular interaction patterns and provides a quantitative framework for a systems-level understanding of how complex cellular interaction networks cooperate across immune organs to jointly orchestrate immune responses. In the future, the Interact-omics framework could be of great utility to decipher fundamental principles of multilayered immune cell crosstalks underlying complex (patho-) physiological processes, such as age-related decline of the immune system or cancer immunity.

Collectively, the Interact-omics approach represents a highly versatile and scalable cytometry-based framework that can be readily implemented for the joint mapping of cellular immune landscapes and their physical interactions with a wide range of applications across a variety of research fields.

The presented approach uses flow cytometry to measure both single-cell and PIC landscapes. As physical interactions can be of biological and technical nature, experimental conditions that affect the formation of cellular interactions need to be carefully chosen and controlled. This includes sample preparation and processing, but also cytometric parameters (Supplementary Fig. 1). Particular attention should be paid to maintaining consistent cell concentrations during sample handling and ensuring stable flow rates across experimental groups. Lower cell concentrations and slower flow rates can help minimize technical interactions. Early fixation can be used to stabilize interactions.

Given the impact of experimental conditions, we strongly recommend using case-control studies where samples from all experimental groups are treated uniformly. Reporting relative enrichments of cellular interactions compared to controls is essential for accurate interpretation.

For in vivo experiments, we have demonstrated that cells with a strong affinity to interact can artificially interact if they are brought into proximity during sample preparation, even if they were physically separated in vivo. Therefore, while these interactions may be biologically meaningful, this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results, and pooling of organs or samples should be avoided to prevent artificial interactions. For novel in vivo settings, users of our framework may consider colabeling strategies (Supplementary Notes 2 and 3) to assess interactions that may form ex vivo.

Unless otherwise stated, animal experiments were conducted under German law and approved by Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe (approval numbers DKFZ299, G-55/20, G-56/20) or the Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales in Berlin (LAGeSo, G0016/20). Mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages under specific pathogen free conditions in the animal facility of the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany) or at the Charité animal facility (FEM, Berlin, Germany) with ad libitum access to water and food (22 ± 2 °C, 45–65% humidity, 12 h light–dark cycle). Mice used in LCMV experiments were 7 weeks old; all other mice were between 6 and 20 weeks old. CD45.1 mice were obtained from in house breeding at DKFZ (Z110I02, B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ) or from Charles Rivers (B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyCrl). For experiments with antigen-specific T cells, cells were isolated from B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J (OT-II) or LCMV-TCRtg P14 (ref. 58) and SMARTA59 mice expressing the congenic markers CD45.1 or CD90.1. All mice were female.

All analyses were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with local ethical guidelines; written informed consent of patients was obtained. Usage of samples from patients treated with blinatumomab in this study was approved by the ethics committee of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin (reference number EA2/147/23). PBMC samples from healthy blood donors were obtained as buffy coats from the blood donation center IKTZ Heidelberg or ZTB Berlin. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation and stored in fetal calf serum (FCS) 10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen until usage. For the blinatumomab response analysis (below), BM samples from 42 patients with a B-ALL relapse were assessed. Samples were directly collected before the start of the blinatumomab course and processed as part of routine diagnostics by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and minimal residual disease quantification. Remaining cells were stored in FCS 10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen for research purposes. Good response to blinatumomab (n = 18) is defined as minimal residual disease negativity directly after a blinatumomab course (28 days) and all subsequent time points. Nonresponse to blinatumomab (n = 4) is defined as leukemic cell persistence (based on morphological or minimal residual disease evaluation) without any reduction after a blinatumomab course. The remaining 20 patient samples could not be unequivocally assigned to these response states (good response versus nonresponse) or had no residual disease at the start of the blinatumomab course. The median age of patients in the study was 9.5 years. Data on sex were collected from patients of the B-ALL cohort. However, given that the patient cohort analyzed here was not part of a clinical trial, sex-specific considerations were not explicitly integrated into the study design. The distribution of male to female participants was, however, balanced (57% male, 43% female).

For isolation of antigen-specific T cells, the spleen and various LNs (including inguinal, axial, submandibular and mesenteric) were carefully extracted. Tissues were homogenized using a 40-μm filter (Falcon) and a syringe plunger in cold Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium (Sigma Aldrich) with 2% FCS (Gibco by Life Technologies). Subsequently, single-cell suspensions from spleens were treated with erythrocyte lysis solution (ACK buffer, containing 0.15 M NH4Cl, 1 mM KHCO3 and 0.1 mM Na2EDTA in water from Lonza) for a duration of 5 min. For some readouts, these suspensions were combined with the LN samples or maintained separately. CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified using either the Dynabeads Untouched Mouse CD4 Cells Kit (Invitrogen) or the murine CD4 T cell isolation kit and the murine CD8 T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified fractions were stained for further purification using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (below). For in vivo experiments, femurs, spleen and various LNs were dissected and kept separate on ice. LNs and spleens were individually processed as described above. Femurs were flushed using FACS buffer and homogenized using a 40-μm filter (Falcon) and a syringe plunger.

Cultures containing OT-II CD4 T cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in U-bottom plates in 200 μl of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium GlutaMAX (DMEM GlutaMAX, Gibco), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Gibco), sodium pyruvate (1.5 mM, Gibco), l-glutamine (2 mM, Gibco), l-arginine (1×, Sigma), l-asparagine (1×, Sigma), penicillin–streptomycin (100 U ml−1, Sigma), folic acid (14 μM, Sigma), minimum essential medium, nonessential amino acids (1×, ThermoFisher), MEM vitamin solution (1×, ThermoFisher) and β-mercaptoethanol (57.2 μM, Sigma). Next 5 × 104 OT-II cells were incubated with 1 × 105 splenocytes containing various antigen-presenting cell populations in presence or absence of OVA peptide (323–339, InvivoGen).

For murine CAR-T in vitro assays, GFP-expressing CD19 specific CAR-T cells were generated as previously described60, thawed and washed with PBS. Next, cells were transferred to 10% FCS RPMI 1640 containing 0.05 μg ml−1 IL-15 (Peprotech) and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. To recover from freezing procedures, cells were incubated under the same conditions as described above before the coculture assay. Frozen murine splenocytes were thawed and incubated together with CAR-T cells at a ratio of 1/2 target/effector ratio (CAR-T cells/splenocytes) for 0.5 to 3 h. Subsequently, cells were collected, washed with FACS buffer, stained with surface markers and analyzed.

Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in a water bath at 37 °C, transferred to 10% FCS RPMI 1640 and washed twice. After each washing step, cells were centrifuged at 350g for 5 min. Next, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 10% FCS RPMI 1640 and cultured short term for up to 5 h in 200 µl of RPMI 10% FCS. CytoStim (Miltenyi) was used in concentrations recommended by the manufacturer at 37 °C for 2 h before collection.

For experiments using a blinatumomab analog (InvivoGen), a concentration of 50 ng ml−1 was used. The incubation period ranged from 0.25 to 5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in 96-well U-bottom plates. For experiments assessing the stability of blinatumomab-induced interactions on cryopreservation, cells were either incubated for 2 h in presence of the compound and stained with surface antibodies and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (ThermoFisher) or frozen in Bambanker freezing medium (Nippon Genetics), thawed after 18 h and treated in the same way as the nonfrozen cells.

For in vitro benchmarking experiments, human PBMCs were treated with CytoStim as described above; control groups were left untreated. Then, cells were split into two groups each and stained with CD45-APC-Fire810 or CD45-PE-Fire640, respectively. After mixing the labeled groups, cells were incubated for 0–4 h at 4 °C (200,000 cells per well in 50 µl during staining and acquisition) or processed at seeding densities of 25,000 to 250,000 cells per well in 96-well plates (in 50 µl during staining and acquisition). Subsequently, cells were gathered, washed with FACS buffer, stained with surface markers, fixed with 2% PFA (except the nonfixed control) and analyzed.

For measuring phosphorylated CD247, human PBMCs were seeded at 100,000 cells per well in 200 µl and treated for 1 h with blinatumomab (160 ng ml−1) or CytoStim as described above. Following the stimulation period, cells were fixed immediately by adding CytoFix buffer (15 min, 4 °C). Cells were washed and resuspended in 200 µl of 2.5× Perm/Wash buffer, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and stained overnight at 4 °C before analysis.

Five days before infection, 1 × 104 LCMV-specific T cells (SMARTA; expressing congenic marker CD90.1) and CD8+ T cells (P14; expressing congenic marker CD45.1) were administered intravenously into C57BL/6J in 300 µl of balanced salt solution, resulting in an approximate seeding of 1 × 103 cells per mouse61. The viral infection was induced intraperitoneally using 200 PFU of the LCMV Armstrong strain62. Mice were euthanized on day 3 and/or day 7 post-infection, and various tissues including the spleen, mesenteric LNs and bones were dissected and processed for spectral flow cytometry analysis.

For the in vivo benchmarking experiment, LCMV-specific CD4 T cells were transferred into C57BL6 (CD45.2) hosts 5 days before infection as described above. CD45.1 (B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyCrl) and CD45.2 hosts were infected intraperitoneally as described above, and spleens were harvested on day 7 post-infection. Spleens were split into four equal pieces and mixed across CD45.1/CD45.2 hosts for joint tissue homogenization. Mixed samples were processed for spectral flow cytometry analysis.

Unless otherwise stated, cell suspensions were resuspended in 2% FSC PBS (FACS buffer, 0.5 mM EDTA optionally) for performing flow cytometric stainings (Supplementary Tables 2–13). For ex vivo readouts with bispecific engagers and antigen-specific T cells, cells were gathered, centrifuged 5 min at 350g and stained with surface marker panel master mixes using FACS buffer and addition of Brilliant Stain buffer (BD) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Cells were stained for 30 min on ice in 96-well V-bottom plates, followed by washing with FACS buffer, centrifugation for 5 min at 350g and resuspension in 200 μl of FACS buffer. For more time-consuming in vivo experiments, cells were labeled with fixable dead cell exclusion dyes followed by fixation of obtained single-cell suspensions with cold 2% PFA PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, centrifuged for 5 min at 350g and then stained overnight at 4 °C. After washing and centrifugation for 5 min at 350g, cells were filtered through a 35-μm cell strainer and kept on ice until flow cytometric analysis. For flow cytometric analysis, a Cytek Aurora (Cytek Biosciences) or LSR Fortessa (BD) equipped with five lasers was used. For sorting of naive T cells in ex vivo setups, FACSAria Fusion or FACSAria II sorters equipped with 70-μm nozzles were used. For imaging cytometry, image-enabled cell sorting using the BD CellViewTM Imaging Technology29 or an ImageStream (Cytek) was used. For image-enabled cell sorting, PBMCs were incubated for 2 h with CytoStim, stained with surface markers followed by fixation with 2% PFA PBS as described above and operated using a 100-μm sort nozzle, with the piezoelectric transducer driven at 34 kHz and automated stream setup by BD FACSChorus Software, and a system pressure of 20 psi. For the ImageStream experiment, data were acquired using the Cytek INSPIRE software.

For image-enabled flow cytometric analysis, radiofrequency images underwent processing as previously described29. The raw image TIFF files were imported into ImageJ and processed with the BD CellView plugin. The corresponding FCS files were loaded into FlowJo (BD), and cells were gated as living CD45+ cells. Using the flowCore63, CytoML64 and flowWorkspace65 packages, the generated FlowJo workspace was loaded into R (≥v4.3.0) for further processing. Subsequently, images were converted to JPG format, and channels containing the light-loss, FSC and side scatter parameters were kept for downstream analysis. Four replicates, each comprising 1,000 images, were manually categorized as singlet, doublet, triplet or higher-plex multiplets, and the categories were used to train a decision tree-based classification model using Rpart66 and caret67. As features for the model, the image-based features, the conventional flow cytometry parameters and the FSC ratio, defined by the quotient of FSC-A and FSC-H, were used. Feature importance in the model was determined to identify relative contributions of each variable in making accurate predictions.

Otsu30 thresholding, which minimizes intragroup variance, was applied to a histogram of the FSC ratio divided into at least 1,000 bins, effectively separating the data into two categories based on whether their FSC ratio is above or below the threshold.

Louvain clustering was performed for n = 100 iterations (resolution 1) on all or a subset of the following features: image-based parameters, conventional flow parameters and the FSC ratio. Consensus clustering solutions were calculated using soft least squares Euclidean consensus partitions as implemented in the clue68 package. Data were visualized in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)55 embeddings using the same input features as used for clustering. UMAP embeddings were computed across 15 nearest neighbors and a minimum Euclidean distance of 0.1, and populations were annotated based on cell-type-specific markers and their combinations. Furthermore, Louvain clustering was performed for n = 100 iterations with different resolution parameters and variation in cluster labels between important features including image-based parameters and conventional flow parameters was assessed using the adjusted rand index.

For ImageStream-based analyses, ImageStream fluorescence intensity values (based on the sum of the pixel intensities in the mask as selected by ImageStream, background subtracted) were compensated and transformed using FlowJo (v.10.10) and IDEAS (v.6.2). Data were processed using PICtR (below). Interacting populations were solely annotated based on mutually exclusive marker expression, since forward scatter properties are not acquired by ImageStream. For conventional gating, gates were selected in FlowJo.

For cell segmentation from brightfield images, the cyto2 model from the Python package CellPose69 was used with a cell pixel diameter of 20. To remove cellular debris, events that met any of the following criteria were excluded: major axis length <15 pixels or >40 pixels, circularity <0.7, area <100 pixels or >1,000 pixels. Area and major axis length were computed using the Python package scikit-image70. Circularity was calculated using the formula \(\frac{4\times\uppi \times{\mathrm{area}}}{{{\mathrm{perimeter}}}^{2}}\), with perimeter values also obtained from scikit-image. This filtering process excluded approximately 4% of the detected objects.

Benchmarking was performed on the imaged-enabled flow cytometry data with n = 3,865 manually classified events across n = 4 replicates. Several thresholding methods based on the FSC ratio were used to define a cutoff of events with a high or low FSC ratio (Supplementary Table 14). Otsu30, IsoData71, Intermodes72, RenyiEntropy73, Li74, Shanbhag75, Huang76 and Mean77 algorithms were used as implemented in the R package autothresholdr78, and the Triangle79 algorithm was ported from the ImageJ implementation in Java. k-means clustering was used with k = 2 for thresholding and Gaussian mixture models were computed as implemented in the R package mclust80. Performance of the methods was evaluated based on the annotation of the image-enabled flow cytometry data and reported as F1 scores, where 1 indicates a perfectly accurate reproduction of the manual ground-truth classification.

Next, different clustering algorithms (Supplementary Table 15) were evaluated regarding their ability to discriminate single and interacting cells considering conventional flow cytometry features (forward scatter, side scatter, cell type markers CD45, CD3, CD19, HLA-DR and CD33, and the FSC ratio). Candidates were selected based on their popularity in the single-cell and flow cytometry fields or based on their performance on high-dimensional single-cell flow and mass cytometry data as evaluated by Weber and Robinson81. Louvain31 and Leiden82 clustering (implemented through igraph) were used on a shared nearest neighborhood graph with k = 5 nearest neighbors, HDBSCAN83,84 (hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) was used on a UMAP embedding with k = 15 nearest neighbors and Phenograph85 was used with Louvain or Leiden clustering. FlowSOM86 (Spectre implementation), FlowMeans87, Rclusterpp88,89 and Immunoclust90 were used directly on the features. Each method was run for n = 100 iterations and the performance was reported as F1 scores based on the ground-truth classification.

For full-spectrum flow cytometry data, raw FCS files were spectrally unmixed using the inbuilt unmixing function of the SpectroFlo (Cytek Biosciences) software. FCS files were imported into FlowJo (BD) to assess unmixing by visualizing N × N plots. Axes were adjusted wherever needed and parameters for logicle91 or generalized bi-exponential transformation of data were defined for every surface marker individually. PeacoQC92 was used as an automatic quality control mechanism for cytometry data where needed. The populations of interest were exported using channel values defined by the inbuilt export function of FlowJo. Raw and processed cytometry data for key experiments are provided at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10637096 (ref. 93).

Usage and processing of reduced exemplary data are provided in a vignette.

The workflow starts by importing compensated and transformed cytometry data (CSV files) into R (≥v.4.3.0). BPCells94 is used for bit-packing compression on a high-performance computing cluster to manage extensive data. For each measured event, the FSC ratio, defined by the ratio of FSC-A and FSC-H, is calculated and scaled to transform the data into a similar range as recorded marker expression values. For the downstream analysis, the measured marker expression values, forward scatter, side scatter and the determined FSC ratio parameter are used as features. Next, the data are sampled using an atomic sketching approach as implemented in Seurat v.5 (ref. 32). This approach is particularly effective in preserving rare events, including cellular interactions.

Sampled data are further processed with the Seurat workflow. For the datasets in this paper, n − 1 principal components were chosen for dimensionality reduction, however, the number of components can be adjusted. The resulting principal component space is used to construct a shared nearest-neighbor graph across the 20 nearest neighbors and to determine the UMAP embeddings using 30 neighbors and a minimum cosine distance of 0.3 for the manifold approximation. Furthermore, the shared nearest-neighbor graph is used as input for Louvain clustering. Other clustering methods are provided as alternatives. For cells not included in the initial sketching process, cluster labels are determined using linear discriminant analysis as implemented in the R package MASS95.

Clusters that contain interacting cells are selected based on the FSC ratio distribution. By default, a discriminating threshold is obtained using the Otsu method, but alternative thresholding methods are also available. Next, the fraction of cells above and below the FSC ratio threshold is determined per cluster. Finally, based on the predicted cluster labels from linear discriminant analysis, interacting cells within the entire dataset are identified. Interacting cells are subjected to PCA, shared nearest-neighbor graph construction, clustering and UMAP analysis to obtain a refined characterization.

Clusters of single cells are annotated based on known cell identity markers and expert knowledge. Similarly, clusters identified as interacting cell populations are annotated based on the combination of mutually exclusive surface markers (for example, evaluated through marker enrichment modeling56). For example, coexpression of the B cell marker CD19 and the T cell markers CD3 and CD4 within an interacting cluster indicates an interaction of a B and CD4+ T cell.

Of note, interacting cell clusters that express markers from only one cell identity might represent homotypic cellular interactions (for example, interactions between two B cells). Since alternative explanations, such as preceding cytokinesis, cannot be ruled out, clusters such as these should be excluded from downstream analysis to avoid low-confidence annotations.

Frequencies of interactions are reported as the frequency among all live, high-quality events or the frequency among all interacting cells. Alternatively, interaction frequencies are normalized by taking the frequency of the respective interaction partners into account: fA denotes the fraction or rate of cell type A, and analogously, fB denotes the fraction or rate of cell type B. Furthermore, let fAB denote the fraction or rate of interacting cells of types A and B. To assess the number of such interacting cells, we introduce the enrichment term \({e}_{\mathrm{AB}}=\frac{{O}_{\mathrm{AB}}}{{E}_{\mathrm{AB}}}\) where OAB = fAB denotes the observed and EAB denotes the expected rate of interacting cells. The expected rate is given by the harmonic mean H(fA,fB) of the two singlet rates:

\(H\left(x,y\right)=\frac{2}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}=\frac{2 x y}{x+y}\). We thus get for the enrichment eAB:

Of note, the harmonic mean of a list of numbers tends strongly toward the least element of the list. In our case with two entries, in case \({f}_{\mathrm{A}}\gg {f}_{\mathrm{B}}\), we get:

The frequency of expected interactions between two cell types with strongly different abundance is thus given by the less abundant cell type. Still, even for the more abundant cell type A, EAB increases with increasing fA:

BM aspirates obtained from 42 relapsed B-ALL patients were thawed in a water bath at 37 °C, transferred to 10% FCS RPMI 1640 and washed twice. After thawing, each sample was split into two. One half of the sample was cultured in 200 µl of RPMI 1640 (10% FCS) supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 blinatumomab analog (InvivoGen) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a 96-well U-bottom plate. The other half of the sample was cultured in RPMI 1640 (10% FCS) without blinatumomab supplementation for 1 h at the same conditions. After the incubation, cells were collected, washed with FACS buffer, stained with the surface marker panel and analyzed. Raw FCS files and CSV files were processed as described above. To analyze whether certain features are associated with the two response groups (good responders and nonresponders) the mean value for each feature in the dataset (singlet frequency, interacting cell frequencies and fold changes of interacting cells after blinatumomab treatment), was calculated for both groups. Subsequently, the fold change for each feature was computed as the ratio of the mean value in the good responder group to that in the nonresponder group. Furthermore, a two-sided t-test was performed for each feature to test for significance between groups. Before performing the correlation analysis, a feature selection was conducted to refine the dataset for more targeted analysis. This selection was based on the results of a univariate analysis, by which features were selected based on an abs(t-value) threshold greater than 1.5. For these selected features, a correlation matrix was computed using the function cor() from the stats package. Afterward, the distance matrices were created, and a hierarchical clustering was performed on the rows and columns of the correlation matrix separately.

Numerical data were processed with R (≥v.4.3.0) or Python v.3.12.5; see Supplementary Table 16 for details. Two sample groups were compared by parametric tests (two-tailed Welch t-tests), or nonparametric tests (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests or estimated marginal means57) depending on the distribution of the underlying data points as evaluated by Shapiro–Wilk tests. Analysis of variance was used for multiple groups after evaluation of the distribution of the underlying data points by Shapiro–Wilk tests. Details about adjustments for multiple comparisons can be found in the respective figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size.

Where applicable, PeacoQC or FlowAI96 were used to exclude low-quality flow cytometry events and cells were gated according to the provided gating strategies. Furthermore, cells were removed when high autofluorescence or signal anomalies suggested a low-quality event. For the B-ALL cohort (n = 42), we compared patients who could unequivocally be categorized into good responders (n = 18) and non­responders (n = 4) to explore mechanisms underlying therapy response among patients with residual disease. The remaining 20 patient samples were therefore excluded from the downstream analysis. Data points were excluded from the downstream analysis if a population of cells was not detectable across all conditions and the excluded populations are noted in the respective figure legends. Clusters of PICs without a cell type exclusive marker combination might represent homotypic interactions and were excluded from the downstream analysis.

The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Mice, murine samples and PBMC samples from healthy blood donors were randomly allocated to groups. The B-ALL experiments were not randomized since all patient samples were measured in the presence and absence of blinatumomab.

Children inherit two copies of most genes from their parents, but one copy of certain genes can be silenced.  Credit: Oscar Wong/Getty

The effect of a gene can vary greatly — and sometimes be the complete opposite — depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or the father. Some genetic variants can, for instance, increase a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes when inherited from the father, but lower it when inherited from the mother. But such effects have been challenging to unpick owing to gaps in genomic data. A study published in Nature this week describes a statistical method used to identify at least 30 parent-of-origin effects1 in 14 genes.

When a child is conceived, it inherits two copies of almost every gene — one from each parent — and both are generally turned either on or off. But in some regions of the genome, one copy can be turned on, or expressed, while the other is silenced. This can lead to ‘imprinting' disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which is usually caused by a missing or non-functional paternal copy of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. In contrast, a missing or non-functional maternal copy can cause Angelman syndrome.

Researchers have for decades suggested that the silencing of certain genes is driven by an evolutionary conflict between maternal and parental origin. For instance, the expression of paternal genes would promote the growth of offspring during pregnancy, but that would come at the cost of the mother's resources. By contrast, the expression of maternal genes would help to conserve the mother's resources so that she can have more children at the expense of her current offspring's growth. But studying how parent-of-origin variants affect human traits is difficult because researchers usually need genomic data from a person and their parents, which are not often available.

To avoid the need for parental genomic data, a research team in Europe and the United States developed a statistical method that can infer the parent of origin for genetic variants using genomic data that are available from any relatives.

The team determined the parental origin of genes for nearly 109,000 people whose genomic data are included in the UK Biobank. Among those, they identified roughly 30 variants that had differing effects on growth and metabolism, including 19 that had a ‘bipolar' effect, meaning that it would have opposite effects depending on which parent it came from. Around half of these bipolar variants were located on chromosome 11, which hosts a large cluster of imprinted genes associated with controlling growth. One of these variants increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 14% when inherited from the father but decreased it by 9% when inherited from the mother.

The team repeated its analysis and confirmed its findings with data for 85,000 people in the Estonian Biobank and 42,000 in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. They also used the Norwegian and UK data to show that a variant on a gene called KLF14 was associated with a higher body mass index in infancy if it was inherited from the mother.

Metrics details

Reactive nanofiltration membranes integrate catalytic transformation with molecular separation to remove diverse aqueous contaminants. However, their development is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the interplay between solute mass transport and chemical reactions. Here we introduce key design principles by systematically evaluating their performance using a modelling approach. Efficient oxidant transport is essential for maximizing contaminant degradation. For membranes with surface-loaded catalysts, avoiding mass transport limitations ensures effective catalyst utilization, whereas for membranes with interior-loaded catalysts, optimizing oxidant partitioning enhances oxidant utilization efficiency. In addition, selective solute rejection reduces interference from natural organic matter, facilitating more selective contaminant transformation inside membrane pores. Consequently, contaminant transformation is dominated by surface-catalysed reactions at low permeate water fluxes, while interior-catalysed reactions dominate at high fluxes. However, rejecting both oxidants and contaminants does not enhance surface-catalysed treatment performance under an optimally designed scenario, highlighting the need for strategic design of membrane rejection. Beyond organic contaminant removal, nanofiltration membranes also minimize secondary contamination by rejecting the produced salts during the catalytic reactions. Furthermore, strategic selection of oxidant–catalyst pairs can enhance treatment performance by generating suitable reactive species. By establishing a theoretical framework for designing and optimizing reactive nanofiltration membranes, this study provides critical insights into the development of advanced water treatment technologies.

Targeting cancer-specific HLA-peptide complexes is a promising approach in immunotherapy. Mutated neoantigens are excellent targets due to their immunogenicity and cancer-specificity. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics guides the selection of naturally presented immunogenic targets within the immunopeptidome, refining immunogenicity predictions. Implementation in clinical settings, however, must achieve global depth, capturing the entirety of the immunopeptidome, maintain high target sensitivity, and cater to scarce sample inputs and short turnaround time. Here, we present NeoDiscMS, an extension of NeoDisc that enables the acquisition of personalized immunopeptidomics data. Leveraging next-generation sequencing-guided real-time spectral acquisitions, NeoDiscMS maximizes sensitivity with minimal loss of global depth. Designed for effectiveness and ease of use, with minimal effort required for implementation, NeoDiscMS enhances the detection of peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens by up to 20% and improves confidence in neoantigen identification compared to the gold standard method. NeoDiscMS advances personalization in clinical antigen discovery with more confident neoantigen detection and easy implementation.

The accurate identification of immunogenic cancer-specific antigens presented by HLA complexes is instrumental to the development of cancer immunotherapy1,2. Most discovery approaches supporting neoantigen-based therapeutics rely solely on computational pipelines to predict immunogenic neoantigens from next-generation sequencing data of the patient's tumor and germline tissues2,3,4. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly shown that only ~1% of somatic mutations in tumors induce spontaneous or vaccine-induced T cell responses5,6. Although the inclusion of machine learning classifiers improves the ranking of immunogenic neoantigens7,8, the selection of candidate immunogenic neoantigens for inclusion in a personalized vaccine remains a challenge in the context of tumors with high mutational burdens9. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based detection of immunopeptides eluted directly from tumor tissues is the method of choice to simultaneously (1) deeply characterize the tumor antigenic landscape10, (2) revealing novel targets like neoantigens11, and (3) characterize defects in antigen presentation12, all of which are relevant clinical features1,9. MS-detected neoantigens have a substantially higher likelihood of being immunogenic than predicted neoantigens due to their confirmed presentation by tumor cells11,13,14,15,16,17,18. Besides the commonly known challenges that proteogenomic methods face1, neoantigen detection by MS is further impeded by their low abundance19,20. In addition, the short turnaround time that is required for clinical vaccine manufacturing and the highly limited sample material pose important challenges when aiming to sensitively measure the global immunopeptidome while maintaining high sensitivity for selected neoantigens.

Typically, antigen discovery is conducted with TopN-based data-dependent acquisition (DDA). DDA is stochastic and aims to diversify what peptides are fragmented by utilizing dynamic exclusion, which prevents repeated fragmentation of the same precursor mass within subsequent acquisition cycles. While this approach increases coverage, it ultimately limits sensitivity for low-abundance targets. To improve sensitivity and address the limitation of co-isolated precursors (even in narrow-window MS acquisitions), previous studies applied chimeric spectrum deconvolution to identify tryptic peptides from low-input and single-cell proteomics samples21,22,23,24,25. However, so far, chimeric spectrum deconvolution has not been implemented in immunopeptidomics. Targeted immunopeptidomics strategies for neoantigen discovery exist, relying on heavy-labeled spike-in standards that enhance sensitivity19,20. However, synthesizing and conducting quality control on heavy-labeled peptides for each patient creates a significant bottleneck, making such strategies unsuitable for clinical workflows due to limited scalability and an inability to meet the short turnaround time required from biopsy to vaccine production. Peptide warehouse approaches can't alleviate these shortcomings, as neoantigens are unique to each patient. Additionally, a major concern is that synthesis products might include impurities of the unlabeled target peptide, potentially leading to sample contamination20,26. Spike-in free approaches that enhance sensitivity have been reported, but they (1) attempt to improve the sensitivity of TopN-based precursor selection with all its limitations, (2) focus on reproducing targets that were identified in a previous scouting run rather than discovering novel ones, (3) require advanced MS architectures, (4) demand manual intervention for data processing, and/or (5) don't optimize the trade-off between target sensitivity and global coverage2,20,21,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.

Here, we present NeoDiscMS (an extension of NeoDisc9), a spike-in-free, scalable, and easy-to-implement targeted-DDA hybrid acquisition immunopeptidomic workflow that boasts enhanced sensitivity and accuracy for target peptide detection while minimizing the trade-off against loss of global immunopeptidome coverage. In NeoDiscMS, NGS-inferred in silico prioritized antigenic peptide candidates guide MS data acquisition by leveraging bespoke real-time peptide-to-spectrum matching filters (RTSf). RTSfs selectively trigger time-intensive, high-sensitivity scans for precursors with target-like features, a capability not previously applied to immunopeptidomics. In addition, chimeric spectrum deconvolution further enhances the depth of immunopeptidome analysis. We benchmark the performance of NeoDiscMS against DDA, either with or without an inclusion list, using an HLA-I immunopeptidome dilution series. To demonstrate the practical utility of NeoDiscMS we showcase the improved detection, in terms of reproducibility and identification confidence, of clinically relevant TAAs and mutated neoantigens in patient-derived primary melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissues. Importantly, data acquired with NeoDiscMS can be processed with commonly used search engines, facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows such as our clinical antigen discovery pipeline NeoDisc. We envision that NeoDiscMS may enhance the detection of immunopeptides associated with pathological conditions beyond cancer and can also be applied to the identification of other peptides outside the scope of immunopeptidomics.

NeoDiscMS was implemented using a peptide database - in our case, an output of 1500 HLA-I-restricted predicted neoantigens or tumor-associated antigens generated by the end-to-end clinical antigen discovery pipeline NeoDisc9, in the format of an inclusion list and a FASTA file containing each peptide as a separate entry (Fig. 1a). The MS acquisition of 3-s cycles was divided into three levels, in the following order of priority: the MS1 scan, the targeted branch scans, and the discovery (DDA) branch scans (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1).

a Matched tumor and germline genome data, along with tumor transcriptome data, are processed by NeoDisc to create a tumor sample-specific personalized proteome reference, annotated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms, somatic mutations, which are then used for HLA binding and immunogenicity prediction of antigenic targets. From this prioritized list of peptides, NeoDisc generates a personalized inclusion list for NeoDiscMS acquisition of the matched tumor immunopeptidome sample. The MS data is then searched by NeoDisc against the personalized proteome to identify naturally presented antigenic peptides, refining the list to prioritize the most clinically relevant and likely immunogenic targets. b Comparison of DDA, DDA with an inclusion list (ilDDA) and NeoDiscMS methods. In NeoDiscMS, the MS acquisition of three second cycles was divided into three levels, in the following order of priority: the MS1 scan, the targeted branch MS2 scans, and the discovery branch (DDA) MS2 scans. c The targeted branch of NeoDiscMS consists of scouting scans (sMS2) that get triggered by an MS1 precursor mass match and a retention-time-restricted scheduled inclusion list. sMS2 are searched against a database in real-time to assess if a high-sensitivity scan (hMS2) should be triggered. The metrics that constitute the real-time search are the cross-correlation between predicted and measured fragments (Xcorr) and the mass deviation of the predicted and measured precursor mass (ΔPPM). Schematics were created in Biorender (https://BioRender.com/s85z530).

Each cycle starts with an MS1 scan. For a precursor in an MS1 scan to qualify for fragmentation with high-sensitivity scans in the targeted branch, it needs to match a precursor mass in the inclusion list. A matched precursor will first get fragmented in a scouting MS2 (sMS2) scan. The fragments of the sMS2 scan are matched in real-time, within milliseconds, against predicted spectra in the database and are subsequently scored. For this, the cross-correlation35 between the predicted fragments of peptides in the search space and the sMS2 spectrum is calculated. If the sMS2 scan yields a real-time search PSM that passes pre-defined quality thresholds, a time-intensive, high-sensitivity MS2 scan (hMS2) is conducted on that precursor (Fig. 1c). The sMS2 scan serves as a filter, minimizing the number of time-consuming subsequent targeted scans during a measurement. hMS2 scans can take up to five times longer than sMS2 scans and are defined by an increased AGC target, a higher maximum injection time, and stepped collision energies (Supplementary Table 1). Both sMS2 and hMS2 scans are intentionally not subjected to dynamic exclusion restrictions and MS1 minimum precursor intensity thresholds, enabling multiple MS/MS spectra to enhance identification confidence.

Following the targeted branch, the DDA branch is applied for the 3 s cycle's remaining time. To improve overall coverage, the discovery branch of our method uses wide isolation windows of 3.2Th for MS2 scans (dMS2) to increase the probability of co-isolating additional precursor masses. The obtained raw file is processed using chimeric spectra deconvolution with MSFragger's DDA+ mode24, enabling peptide-to-spectrum matching (PSMing) with precursor masses that deviate from the isolated mass.

To benchmark the performance of wide isolation windows and chimeric spectra deconvolution on immunopeptidomics data, we first tested different isolation window sizes with DDA, injecting the equivalent of 10 million JY cells per measurement, analyzed with MSFragger-DDA+. A total of 96% of the identified 8–14 mer peptides were predicted by MixMHCpred36 as binders (%-rank <2) for each measurement, indicating that identification quality is consistent across conditions. Differences observed between isolation window widths pertained to the number of unique peptides identified. We selected 3.2Th because it most consistently yielded the highest number of identifications (Supplementary Fig. 2). This is in accordance with previous findings that optimal wide window size for increased depth with chimeric spectral deconvolution from low input samples remains narrow24,25. Next, to extend the benchmarking, we measured the HLA-I immunopeptidome of the B-cell lines JY and RA95736, using either isolation windows of 1.2Th or 3.2Th, representing regular and wide isolation windows, respectively. This, for the equivalent 5 and 10 million cells per measurement. We then processed all data either with MSFragger-DDA or with MSFragger-DDA+ for peptide identification. For all measurements and with both MSFragger-DDA and MSFragger-DDA+, between 96–97% of the identified 8–14 mer peptides were predicted as binders (%-rank <2), the average peptide length lied between 9.4–9.6. Processing immunopeptidomic data with MSFragger-DDA+ instead of MSFragger-DDA resulted in a 2% to 36% increase in the number of unique peptides identified, with higher cell numbers contributing to a greater identification surplus (Fig. 2a). Notably, the RA957 samples exhibited larger increases compared to the JY samples. When comparing replicates of the same cell type and cell number, the change in identified peptides between isolation windows of 1.2Th and 3.2Th, processed with MSFragger-DDA+, ranged from 0% to 8%. The overlap coefficients for peptides identified by both MSFragger-DDA and MSFragger-DDA+ within the same raw file (top three gray dots in each panel of the lower row) ranged from 88% to 96% (Fig. 2a). Using MSFragger-DDA+, increasing the isolation window size from 1.2Th to 3.2Th resulted in a 7–9% increase in the fraction of scans yielding one or more PSMs (Fig. 2b). For MSFragger-DDA+ searched data, the fraction of peptides which were only identified thanks to chimeric spectrum deconvolution, meaning they never corresponded to the selected precursor mass to isolate, lies between 19–37%. Significantly, this fraction increases consistently by 10–11% when applying isolation windows of 3.2Th instead of 1.2Th for the same sample (Fig. 2c). To better understand the quality of PSMs gained with help of chimeric spectrum deconvolution, we inspected identified precursors that corresponded (isolated) and precursors that deviated from the isolated mass (co-isolated) of their respective MS2 scans as separate populations. Both populations had similar fractions of predicted binders to the respective HLA alleles and similar length distributions (Fig. 2d, e).

a The upper panel depicts the number of identified unique stripped sequences in cell lines JY and RA957 immunopeptidome of injections of 5- or 10 million cells-equivalent, measured in DDA and with MS2 isolation windows of 1.2Th or 3.2Th (n = 3 per condition). The lower panel shows overlap coefficients between raw files and within or between processing modes. MSFragger can be operated with (MSFragger-DDA+) or without (MSFragger-DDA) taking chimeric spectra into account for finding PSMs. Wider isolation windows of 3.2Th and use of MSFragger-DDA+ increase the number of identified unique sequences, as demonstrated by searching the same raw files with either MSFragger-DDA or MSFragger-DDA+ (upper panel), resulting in an overlap coefficient of at least 88% (bottom panel; the top 3 gray dots for each sub-panel). b The fraction of MS2 scans with at least one assigned PSM. Each raw file was processed with MSFragger-DDA or MSFragger-DDA+. For all raw files and processing modes, most scans with one PSM or more were matched by both processing modes. Percentages were averaged across technical replicates (TRs). c The fraction of immunopeptides that were identified by MSFragger-DDA+ exclusively as co-isolated PSMs. d The fraction of binders (%-rank <2; MixMHCpred) and e sequence length distribution among immunopeptides that were uniquely identified as chimeric PSMs or not f The co-isolated PSMs derive from precursors that deviate in mass from the isolated precursor with a clear pattern: mass deviation distribution reflects differences in multiples of 1 Da.

In a chimeric spectrum, the mass difference between the two peptides is defined by combinations of amino acids whose weights permit it to generate precursors that can be isolated through the same isolation window. Because the residuals of amino acid weights all lie in a narrow 0.1 Da range, we observed, as expected, that the absolute difference in mass (Da) between co-isolated peptides is often very close to multiples of 1 Da (when we filter for co-isolated identified peptides with the same charge which account for 92% of all cases; Fig. 2f).

To conclude, the wide-window and especially the chimeric spectrum deconvolution approach provide increased global immunopeptidome depth over commonly used narrow-window scans in DDA while maintaining identification quality. Hence, the MS2 scans of the discovery branches in all the analyses below were conducted with an isolation window of 3.2Th, and the data were processed with MSFragger-DDA+. Importantly, the wide isolation window strategy impacts only the discovery branch, and users can implement NeoDiscMS without enabling it, should they choose to do so.

To illustrate the increased sensitivity of time-expensive scans for target discovery, as well as the capacity of RTSf to alleviate the burden on global immunopeptidome depth, we benchmarked the performance of DDA (the gold standard method for antigen discovery), DDA with an inclusion list branch (ilDDA) that triggers high-sensitivity scans, and NeoDiscMS (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1b).

To accurately assess the performance of our target identification method, we compiled an inclusion list of ~1500 unique RA957-specific, HLA-A68:01-restricted, 8-11-meric peptide sequences (Fig. 3a). These peptides were consistently identified across RA957 samples and were predicted not to bind to any JY HLA-I alleles, showing a %-rank >10 for HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -C*07:02. (Fig. 3b). The list included methionine oxidation as a variable modification (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and all charge states from 1–3, yielding a list of 5046 precursors. To avoid having the targeted branch look for all targets throughout the entire gradient, our method relies on scheduled targeting. We predicted the retention time (RT) for each peptide to allow scheduling with a ±15 min window, which captures 75% of targets when comparing measured to predicted retention time, though at a remarkable inclusion list burden (number of scheduled precursors) across the retention time (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c).

a 9-mer motifs of immunopeptides that bind to the depicted HLA alleles. The key for diluting the class I immunopeptidome of RA957 in the class I immunopeptidome of JY is the distinctive A*68:01 binding restriction. We selected A*68:01-restricted peptides as targets because they can be clearly assigned to RA957 when the RA957 immunopeptidome is diluted in the JY immunopeptidome. b Histogram of the binding affinity of A*68:01-specific targets to JY alleles as predicted by MixMHCpred. c Summary of the dilution series employed to evaluate the scalability and sensitivity of NeoDiscMS. d Count of identified A*68:01-binding target peptides and global depth for each step in the dilution series (n = 3 per condition). e Number of target peptides identified in either zero, one, two, or all three DDA (x-axis) or NeoDiscMS replicates (y-axis).

We diluted the class I immunopeptide sample of RA957 cells in the class I immunopeptidome of JY cells in a dilution series that starts with RA957-to-JY dilution ratios of 1/16, 1/64, 1/256, and 1/1024, as well as a RA957-free JY immunopeptidome (negative control) (Fig. 3c). While the 1/1024 dilution simulates a setting with low abundance peptide targets that are hard to detect, the 1/16 dilution is most suitable to assess the scalability of NeoDiscMS when many detectable targets are present. We acquired data of all dilutions in DDA, ilDDA, and NeoDiscMS (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).

Overall, all measurements maintain between 96%–98% of binders, with an expected average peptide length of 9.4–9.5. The successful dilution is evident when inspecting the fraction of HLA-A*68:01 binders among all peptides (Supplementary Fig. 3d). None of the target peptides were detected in the JY-only negative controls across any of the acquisition modes. In all dilutions, NeoDiscMS identified between 0–7% more peptide targets on average than ilDDA, and between 16–51% more than DDA. Global depth of NeoDiscMS lied between 5–21% above ilDDA and 5–14% below DDA (Fig. 3d). With respect to the number of uniquely identified peptides we note that, on average, for every 1% of loss in global depth compared to DDA, we gain 2% in target sensitivity with ilDDA and 5.6% with NeoDiscMS. This difference in sensitivity trade-off quantifies the minimization of loss in global depth with help of RTSf very clearly.

In the dilution series, the 1/1024 dilution most closely simulates a real-world scenario of tumor-antigen discovery, with only a few detectable peptide targets. There, 18 peptide targets were identified consistently in all NeoDiscMS replicates, while this is only true for 9 peptide targets with DDA. This constitutes a 2-fold increase in the number of fully reproducible target peptide identifications. Conversely, 9 peptides were identified at least once with DDA and never with NeoDiscMS, while 19 peptides were detected at least once with NeoDiscMS but not DDA, a 2.1-fold difference. In total, across three replicates each, 24% more peptide targets were identified with NeoDiscMS than with DDA (Fig. 3e). Detected peptide targets showed a higher average number of PSMs per target for NeoDiscMS than both DDA and ilDDA (Supplementary Fig. 3e). A closer examination of the 1/1024 dilution NeoDiscMS runs revealed that peptide targets which were not identified with DDA were distributed across all MS2 scan types and included low- to medium-intensity peptides. This shows that the enhanced target identification of NeoDiscMS derives from a combination of reduced ion sampling stochasticity and enhanced scan sensitivity, which sets targeted and DDA approaches apart (Supplementary Fig. 3f). For peptides in the 1/16 dilution, where the highest number of peptide target PSMs were detected, we observed a consistent increase in hyperscore and spectral angle when comparing hMS2 PSMs with dMS2 PSMs across the full intensity range (Fig. 3f).

Selective repeated fragmentation is one of the strengths of NeoDiscMS. This naturally raises the question of quantification reproducibility. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the MS1-based quantification, as provided by the FragPipe output, we focused on the 1/1024 dilution experiment measurements which represents a scenario of detecting low abundance targets. The variability between replicates is comparable between DDA and NeoDiscMS and between non-target peptide identifications (gray, R2 = 0.96–0.97%) and target (red, R2 = 0.92–0.99%; Fig. 3g). We observe slightly lower values in the technical replicates TR2 vs. TR3 NeoDiscMS comparison, though this is marginal considering the relatively lower number of target IDs. Repeated fragmentation via the targeted branch may open future opportunities to implement more accurate, advanced MS2-based quantification methods with NeoDiscMS data. However, a key caveat must be considered: hMS2 scans use different ion accumulation and collision energy settings compared to dMS2 and sMS2 scans (Supplementary Table 1). As a result, they introduce variations in both absolute fragment ion abundances and fragment intensity ratios, as exemplified by the target peptide EVILIDPFHK++ (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We concluded from our benchmarking with immunopeptidome dilutions that the targeted branch enables more sensitive and confident detection of peptides of interest compared to the discovery branch, and that NeoDiscMS does not compromise quantitative performance relative to DDA.

To further characterize the utility of our method we acquired immunopeptidomics data with DDA and NeoDiscMS from three patient tumor-derived melanoma cell lines: Ml1, Ml2, and MI3 (Fig. 4a). As targets, we selected for each cell line NeoDisc-prioritized sample-specific mutated neoantigen peptides from pairs of tumor-healthy WES and tumor transcriptome data. In addition, to explore various potential sources of antigens we further extended the lists to well characterized TAAs, such as MAGEA3, MAGEA4, and MLANA, that were found to be expressed in the samples, and predicted TAA-derived peptides from in silico three frame translation products.

Three adjacent blocks separated by thin black lines represent replicates 1,2, and 3. c The best TID hyperscore (left) or spectral angle (right) of each identified target peptide compared to the same peptide's best hyperscore or spectral angle in the discovery branch.

As expected, DDA provided the greatest immunopeptidome depth across all three cell lines, with NeoDiscMS showing a mean reduced depth compared to DDA by 21%, 13%, and 4% for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively. (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Overall, the immunopeptidomes maintain between 94–95% of binders, and the average peptide length was between 9.3–9.6 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). We identified in total 49 TAA-peptides among them several confirmed immunogenic epitopes37, and four mutated neoantigens out of which three were previously demonstrated to be immunogenic in the patient7,9 (Fig. 4a). Importantly, in each cell line, every target peptide identified with DDA was also identified with NeoDiscMS, apart from four targets, one of which detected three times and the others once across DDA replicates. Furthermore, the fraction of targets detected with NeoDiscMS that were identified in at least two out of three NeoDiscMS replicates but only in a single or none of the DDA replicates, was 16%, 24%, and 0% for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively (Fig. 4b). On the protein level, NeoDiscMS can expand protein coverage substantially. For example, in Ml2, three out of five (THNVHEEKI, QHATIIHNL, THNIREEKI) SAGE1-derived peptides were identified consistently with NeoDiscMS but only once or never with DDA across all replicates (Fig. 4a).

To better characterize the improvement in peptide detection confidence, we closely investigated the underling qualities of RTS events that follow when the targeted branch is activated. When the precursor mass is detected in the scheduled RT window, a sMS2 scan is triggered. The sMS2 spectrum is then subjected to RTS. If the PSM passes the RTSf, we call it a RTS hit. A RTS hit consequently triggers the acquisition of a hMS2 scan. When a peptide precursor triggers an RTS event and that very peptide is also eventually PSMed with MSFragger in either sMS2 or hMS2, we call it a target identification (TID). The fraction of RTS events that resulted in an RTS hit was 12%, 8%, and 8% on average for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively. More than 85% of the inclusion list hits during a measurement do not pass RTSf, indicating that they are isobaric non-targets (Supplementary Fig. 5c). The fraction of RTS hit events that resulted in a TID was 1%, 6%, and 2% on average for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5d) and all TIDs occurred in RTS hit events (Supplementary Fig. 6). Across samples, at least 90% of all RTS hit events that yielded a TID fit into a ΔPPM window smaller than 1 (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Among all RTS events with TIDs, the majority were PSMed in both sMS2 and hMS2 scans. Ml2 particularly benefits from hMS2 scans, as the number of uniquely hMS2-derived TIDs is 60% higher than uniquely sMS2-derived TIDs (Fig. 5b). The RTS result of TIDs that were uniquely identified with hMS2 scans remained within the Xcorr range [0.4, 2.7] (Supplementary Fig. 6). TIDs that succeeded for sMS2 scans and hMS2 scans within the same RTS events are the best possible measure for the immediate gain in sensitivity between these two scan types. Particularly for low scoring sMS2 TIDs, hyperscores and spectral angles of the same precursor PSM increased for subsequent hMS2 spectra (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The MCTS1D130N-derived neoantigen YPAAVNTIVAI found in MI2 showcases the clear advantages of implementing NeoDiscMS for the confident discovery of clinically relevant mutated neoantigens. Based on predictions, NeoDisc ranked this neoantigen at position 186 among predicted HLA-I neoantigens, while an autologous TIL-based immunogenicity assay confirmed its immunogenicity7,9. In a hypothetical patient case where neoantigen targets for a personalized cancer vaccine are identified solely through mutanome predictions, a neoantigen ranked as low as 186 would generally be excluded from selection, as typically up to 40 top ranked neoantigens are targeted38,39,40. However, in a clinical discovery effort combining immunopeptidomics with mutanome predictions, a robust MS support for this immunogenic neoantigen would justify its inclusion. Conversely, without solid MS backing, including such a low-ranked peptide over a higher-ranked neoantigen would not be justified.

YPAAVNTIVAI was identified in all immunopeptidomic replicates with DDA, however, with only up to two PSMs per replicate. Conversely, with NeoDiscMS, repeated RTS hit events across successive acquisition cycles resulted in 9 to 13 PSMs per replicate, of which 5 to 7 of YPAAVNTIVA PSMs derived from hMS2 scans (Fig. 5a–c). Despite having a spectral angle of 0.9299, the best dMS2 YPAAVNTIVA PSM in the DDA contained only 7 fragments (b5–b9, y1 and y2), where none of the first four peptide bonds is covered by a fragmentation site (Fig. 5d). Across NeoDiscMS runs, the best dMS2, sMS2, and hMS2 had spectral angles of 0.9635, 0.9766, and 0.995. The best hMS2 PSM matched 12 fragments, (b2–b10, y1–y3), resulting in accurate and confident peptide identification. To conclude, NeoDiscMS resulted in consistent and confident YPAAVNTIVAI neoantigen detection with high spectral angles and number of matched fragments.

To demonstrate its clinical applicability, we utilized our clinical immunopeptidome pipeline9 to extract the immunopeptidome from three distinct tumor lesions (Ti1, Ti2, Ti3) of a uveal melanoma patient, with each NeoDiscMS analysis performed on the equivalent of 10 mg of tissue. We selected the top 500 predicted neoantigens as well as the top 518 predicted TAA-derived peptides as targets in a single list that was used for NeoDiscMS measurements of all three tissue samples. Our clinical routine immunopeptidomics acquisition scheme includes both DDA and DIA measurements allowing sensitive peptide-centric DIA searches against a sample-specific hybrid spectra library generated from spectrum-centric analysis of the DIA file combined with the library of generated from the DDA file9,41. Therefore, we acquired one technical DIA and NeoDiscMS acquisition for each tissue sample, using a personalized NGS-guided target database. With NeoDiscMS for each tissue sample individually, we identified 14,797, 16,033 and 11,968 unique peptides at an average length of 9.4 and with 95% of binders for Ti1, Ti2, Ti3, respectively (Fig. 6a). For all three tissues, the number of identified peptides with spectrum-centric searches of DIA data (DIA-Umpire) amounts to less than 50% of the depth that was achieved with a corresponding NeoDiscMS search. Then, we used spectral hybrid-libraries (generated from NeoDiscMS and DIA data), to search the DIA files and identified and quantified 12,917, 14,165 and 10,726 unique peptides in Ti1, Ti2, Ti3, respectively (Fig. 6a). An examination of the shared and sample-specific peptide sets revealed differences in peptide presentation across the three samples. The fraction of peptides common to all three lesions is 31% in the NeoDiscMS search and 36% in the hybrid library DIA search comparison (Fig. 6b). As the tumor mutation burden was expectedly low in this uveal melanoma tumor lesions (2.601, 2.82, and 3.615 somatic mutations/Mb for Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3, respectively), no neoantigens were identified in any of the samples. Yet, nine TAA-derived peptides were identified in total, derived from MLANA, TYR, and SAGE1, with peptide MPREDAHF from MLANA detected in the DIA files of Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3, and peptide YRALMDKSL from MLANA in Ti1, only when analyzed against the hybrid library and not with the spectrum-centric approach. Hence, we demonstrated that NeoDiscMS can be seamlessly combined with DIA to create sample-specific hybrid libraries enriched with high-confidence MS2 spectra, for the sensitive detection and quantification of the global immunopeptidome as well as target peptides (Fig. 6a, c).

a The analysis of three low-input uveal melanoma tissues (10 mg/injection) of the same patient (Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3, respectively), reveals a global depth of 12,316, 13,490, and 10,232 immunopeptides (binders only) with a DIA-NeoDiscMS hybrid-library search, with more than 95% of the identified peptides predicted as binders by MixMHCpred (%-rank <2). b Venn diagram describing the intersection of presented immunopeptides between Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3 with either a spectrum centric NeoDiscMS search (left) or a DIA-NeoDiscMS hybrid-library search (right). c Identified TAAs with either NeoDiscMS or spectrum-centric searches of DIA data, or a peptide-centric search of DIA with a DIA-NeoDiscMS hybrid-library.

In this study we present a new immunopeptidomic MS acquisition method that has been developed specifically to overcome critical challenges related to the discovery of clinically relevant antigens. Tumor-specific antigens are often present at low abundance, yet in clinical settings, they require rapid, robust, and accurate detection to enable their use as immunotherapeutic targets. Recently we reported NeoDisc, a clinical end-to-end computational pipeline that combines genomics, transcriptomics, and MS-based immunopeptidomics for the prediction and direct identification of immunogenic tumor-specific HLA-I and -II antigens from multiple sources. So far, once the NGS and MS-immunopeptidomic files have been generated, they were subjected to the NeoDisc computational integration. Here, we propose an alternative approach. Matched tumor and germline genome data, along with tumor transcriptome data, are processed with NeoDisc to create a tumor sample-specific personalized proteome reference. The reference is annotated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations, which are then used for HLA binding and machine learning-based immunogenicity prediction of antigenic target peptides. From this prioritized list of targets, NeoDisc generates a personalized inclusion list for NeoDiscMS acquisition of the MS analysis of the matched tumor immunopeptidome sample, followed by a DIA acquisition. The immunopeptidomic MS data is then searched by NeoDisc against the personalized proteome to identify naturally presented peptides, refining the list to prioritize the most clinically relevant and likely immunogenic targets. This streamlined process maintains a 2-week turnaround from biopsy reception to the compilation of a ranked list of targets, for example for neoantigen vaccine manufacturing.

NeoDiscMS is a scalable, spike-in-free immunopeptidomic discovery workflow that can also operate independently of NeoDisc, using any list of target peptides of interest. Importantly, the key use case for NeoDiscMS are highly limited biopsies with strict time limits for data acquisition, whereby both target sensitivity and global depth are required. Samples are prepared following standard immunopeptidomic protocols, and, unlike other targeted approaches, no prior MS measurements of the investigated samples are required. This allows the entire sample to be utilized at once, enhancing detection and decreasing turnaround time.

During acquisition, the separation of discovery and targeted branch as well as fully customizable parameters for each scan type, facilitates maximal flexibility to optimize the trade-off between target sensitivity and global depth. The edge of NeoDiscMS over ilDDA lies in more efficient application of high-sensitivity scans. Long injection times on every analyte that is isobaric to a target within the scheduled RT window becomes increasingly troublesome as inclusion lists are scaled: the number of targets as well as the scheduled RT window size are critical for inclusion list burden. NeoDiscMS significantly reduces time spent sampling off-target ions. This leaves more time within an acquisition cycle to sample ions of other target masses or with the discovery branch. An additional advantage of NeoDiscMS is its ability to sample the same precursor up to three times per cycle, compared to a maximum of two times in ilDDA. Each MS2 scan contributes a spectrum that can yield a high-quality PSM. This increased sampling frequency explains the higher global depth and the equal or slightly improved target sensitivity observed with NeoDiscMS relative to ilDDA.

The decision tree of the targeted branch we present is simple (sMS2—RTSf—hMS2) and in the future, sophistication of RTS event designs and sMS2-hMS2 dependencies are expected to further boost the sensitivity while minimizing loss of global depth. Selective high-sensitivity scans can expand beyond the optimized ion accumulation and collisional energy parameters that we showcase to, for instance, ion mobility parameters20,42. Also, narrower isolation windows could provide cleaner spectra with less interfering peaks, at the cost of sensitivity or injection time. Dynamic definition of data aquisition parameters with help of sMS2 scans, just like the refinement of real-time search evaluation parameters, bear great potential to further advance target identification. Acquiring multiple scans of the same precursor of interest within and between cycles offers novel opportunities for peptide quantification and generation of consensus spectra. Additionally, precursor selection parameters like adjusted minimal intensity thresholds or better integration of inclusion list and RTS FASTA as well as optimized target precursor selection offer further possibilities for refinement.

The targeted branch of NeoDiscMS is committed to the holy grail of clinical immunopeptidomics: the direct identification of cancer-specific antigens. Yet, we would like to highlight the substantial importance of the discovery branch that provides global depth in a DDA-like fashion. Firstly, the global immunopeptidome informs us about dynamics of antigen processing and presentation hotspot features, as well as defects in antigen processing and presentation, which can directly inform immunogenicity predictions and neoantigen prioritization7,9,10,43,44,45. Naturally, the discovery branch can also contribute additional spectra of the targets as well as of other non-targeted exploratory antigen candidates. One great advantage of mass spectrometry data is that it can be re-processed with new search settings and software to extract new information or build large databases36,46,47. The discovery branch provides the bulk, in absolute terms, of high-quality spectra in a NeoDiscMS data file, being “TopN”-sampled, and provide utility for this purpose. Furthermore, the PSMs that the discovery branch yields during data processing enables statistically solid FDR calculations48 by providing highly diverse target and decoy matches, without being restricted to only sampling ions that correspond to the ~5000 masses in the inclusion list of the targeted branch. Additionally, high-quality PSMs by the discovery branch are very likely to be identified and instrumental for effective feature extraction in rescoring algorithms such as MSBooster47. As such, the discovery branch provides not only additional depth but also enables the effective bioinformatic data processing with commonly used search engines so that targets can be identified from the targeted branch with higher sensitivity.

Being able to process data with popular proteomics tools such as MSFragger49, is crucial for the user-friendliness of the NeoDiscMS approach. The application of chimeric spectrum deconvolution and wide isolation windows in the discovery branch boosts global coverage while maintaining high identification quality. As such, we show that chimeric spectrum deconvolution with MSFragger-DDA+ can be applied to immunopeptidomics data to great benefit. While NeoDiscMS can be seamlessly processed by MSFragger, we also show how NeoDiscMS offers opportunities for more extensive data processing for MS2-based quantification of precursors that were identified as the isolated mass multiple times.

Our data shows that the targeted and the discovery branches contribute improvements to NeoDiscMS compared to conventional DDA approaches. The increased isolation window size in combination with chimeric spectral deconvolution results in increased immunopeptidome depth, as shown in a direct comparison of regular and wide window isolation windows on the same sample, analyzed with MSFragger-DDA or MSFragger-DDA+. With the help of JY, RA957, and melanoma-derived cell lines, we show that the targeted branch improved target identification significantly, consistently, and in a scalable manner. By examining RTS event dynamics, we show how and at what rate sMS2 and RTSf selectively trigger high-sensitivity scans. This analysis reveals the individual contributions of sMS2 and hMS2 scans. We highlight YPAAVNTIVAI, an immunogenic neoantigen that is a direct beneficiary of the increased sensitivity that NeoDiscMS offers: YPAAVNTIVAI's identification confidence clearly and consistently improves with NeoDiscMS compared to DDA.

We demonstrate the clinical utility of NeoDiscMS with a set of three low-input tumor biopsies. By simulating a clinical setting, we achieve substantial depth as well as the identification of TAA-derived peptides and demonstrate interoperability with DIA library searching strategies. Spectrum-centric searches of DIA data yielded substantially fewer peptide identifications compared to NeoDiscMS (Fig. 6a). This makes NeoDiscMS a suitable candidate for library building to fully harness the power of DIA library searches. Alternatively, experimental libraries can be replaced with computationally predicted libraries. This approach holds great promise, yet it's performance to provide more depth in immunopeptidomics compared to experimental libraries is, to date, situational41,50,51. Also, accurate FDR calculations for large-scale predicted libraries for peptide-centric searches might face processing-specific challenges that need to be evaluated and addressed, just as it is the case for DDA database searches52,53. Besides the construction of experimental libraries, another key complementary feature of NeoDiscMS to DIA is that it provides low-complexity spectra with its targeted branch, compared to DIA MS2 spectra. This is crucial when identifying peptides for clinical prioritization, where manual inspection of signal and background fragments of candidate PSMs is common. The manual inspection and validation of a PSM from DIA MS2 spectra is virtually impossible due to its massive complexity, even for the most advanced experts. If data acquisition approaches that are still being developed, such as narrow-window DIA54, will shift this balance remains to be seen.

At the time of writing, the instruments equipped with vendor-supported acquisition method editors that enable implementation of NeoDiscMS are the Orbitrap Eclipse and Orbitrap Ascend (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific's Tribrid Mass Spectrometer series). We envision broader vendor adoption of this approach in the future, as well as the integration of advanced RTS capabilities that extend beyond immunopeptidomics applications.

NeoDiscMS is, to our knowledge, the first personalized immunopeptidomics data acquisition strategy tailored to the needs of a proteogenomics-based clinical T-cell antigen discovery pipeline. Besides analytical aspects, its guiding design principles were oriented towards modularity, flexibility, and user-friendliness. We conclude that NeoDiscMS advances proteogenomic-based antigen discovery with all its clinical benefits for the development of cancer therapies. Generation of NeoDiscMS files (target selection, FASTA database, and inclusion list) is integrated within NeoDisc v1.7.1 and is available through https://neodisc.unil.ch/.

An informed written consent was given by the participants, according to the requirements of the local Ethics Committee institutional review board (Ethics Commission, Commission cantonale d'éthique de la recherche sur l'être humain (CER-VD) Centre hospitalier universitaire Vaudois, CHUV). Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3 samples used in this investigation were collected from the patient during the screening process for inclusion in a Phase 1 trial (NCT04643574), following enrollment in a research protocol approved by the local Ethics Committee (Commission cantonale d'éthique de la recherche sur l'être humain (CER-VD); BASEC ID 2017-00305). Tumor cell lines were generated as described in Huber et al.9. Ml1 and Ml2, including immunogenicity assessments and NGS data, are the same as described in Müller et al.7, where they equate to patient1 and patient3, respectively. Ml3, including immunogenicity assessments, corresponds to Mel-4 P1 HLA-I high cells, stimulated with 100 U/mL of Interferon-γ (Miltenyi Biotec, ref. 130-096-482), as described in Huber et al.9. HLA-restricted TAA immunogenicity assessments are derived from CEDAR37.

All cells were expanded in cell culture medium (Gibco, ref. 61870-010) with 10% of heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, ref. 10437-028) and 100 U/mL P/S (BioConcept, cat No. 4-01F00-H). To harvest the JY (ATCC, ref. 77441) and RA957 cell lines we collected the cell culture medium containing the cells in suspension, removed the medium, and washed cell twice in PBS (Bichsel, ref. 100 0 324). To harvest melanoma cell lines we removed the cell culture medium, washed the cells with PBS, detached cells from the flask surface with Trypsin (BioConcept, ref. 5-51F00-H), inactivated trypsin with cell culture medium, and washed the cells twice with PBS. We stored cells in pellets of 108 at −80 °C.

For immunopeptide enrichment we harvested W6/32 antibodies from HB-95 hybridoma cells (HB-95, ATCC), cross-linked them with DTT to Sepharose beads (Invitrogen, ref. 101042). We then lysed our samples with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich, ref. 30970), 0.2 mM IAA (Sigma, ref. I6125-5g), 1 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. 15575-038), 1:200 PIC (Roche, ref. 04693132001), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche, ref. 10837091001), 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, ref. 08001) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lines were just resuspended in lysis buffer, tissue samples were first homogenized with a bead homogenizer (Tissue Lyser II, Qiagen) for 1 min at 30 Hz. We then centrifuged lysates for 50 min at 20,000 RCF at 4 °C. To isolate HLA-peptide complexes, we applied the workflow presented in Chong et al.55. Shortly, 96-well plates were conditioned and mounted with 75 µl of cross-linked beads. We then added each sample's lysate to a well. After the lysate drained, we washed each well with varying salt concentrations and eluted the captured HLA-peptide complexes with 1% TFA (Merck Millipore, ref. 1082620100). Then we desalted and isolated immunopeptides with the help of C18 columns, using 28% ACN (Biosolve, UN 1648), 0.1% TFA as an elution buffer. The peptides eluted from the C18 column were dried in a vacuum concentrator (Concentrator plus, Eppendorf) and stored at −80 °C. Prior to MS analysis, peptides were re-suspended in 30 µl (cell lines) or 18 µl (tissue samples) 0.1 %TFA. MS iRT kit peptides (Biognosys, ref. Ki-3002-2) were spiked into the peptidomic samples according to the supplier's instructions.

For all experiments with cell lines, we isolated immunopeptides from samples of 108 cells each. For all experiments with tissues, we processed ~60 mg of each tissue. For cell lines, we injected an equivalent of 5*106 or 107 cells (Supplementary Data 1). For tissue cells, we injected equivalents of ~10 mg of tissue. For the dilution experiment, RA957 immunopeptidome was diluted in the JY immunopeptidome at the ratios of 1/1024, 1/256, 1/64, and 1/16. In addition, we included a negative control sample with only the JY peptides. Importantly, all samples contained equal amount of JY peptides.

WES and RNAseq libraries were prepared as described in Huber et al.9. Briefly, DNA was extracted with the commercially available DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, ref. 69504) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was extracted by phase separation using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. 15596-026) and chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, ref. C2432-25ML) and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Then, the aqueous phase containing the RNA was collected, mixed with 70% ethanol and loaded on an RNeasy mini spin column from the total RNA isolation RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, ref. 74104). The rest of the protocol was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (including DNase I (Qiagen, ref. 79254) on-column digestion). WES and RNAseq libraries were prepared and sequenced at Microsynth using the Agilent SureSelect XT Human All exome V7 kit (Agilent, ref. 5191-4028) and the Illumina Truseq stranded mRNA reagents (Illumina, ref. 20020594). The sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 500/550 system.

NeoDisc v1.7.0 was used for neoantigen discovery and prioritization9. The pipeline was run in fastq mode using default parameters for single-sample analysis on paired germline and tumor whole-exome sequencing data, along with matched tumor RNA sequencing data. Peptide lengths for HLA-I and HLA-II predictions were defined in the configuration file as 8–12 and 12–15 amino acids, respectively, with binding affinity thresholds set to ≤2.0% for both HLA-I and HLA-II predictions.

Following single-sample analyses, results were combined using NeoDisc's MergeSamples tool to facilitate multi-sample integration and prioritize tumor-specific antigens.

The NeoDiscMS approach require the generation of a list of target peptides. In this study we tested the performance with ~1500 targets sequences. In general, any peptide sequence can be included as target.

For the JY-RA957 dilution experiment, we selected RA957-specific HLA-I bound peptides identified in previously published eight raw files of RA957 immunopeptidome samples55. We processed the raw files with MSFragger-DDA+ and filtered all identified peptides to retain peptides of length 8–11, that occurred in all eight measurements, were predicted by MixMHCpred36 (v2.3) to be A*68:01 binders with binding %-rank <2, and did not have a %-rank  <10% for any other RA957 or JY alleles. This yielded 1525 peptide targets.

For each of the melanoma cell lines Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, 500 predicted neoantigens with %-rank <3% were selected based on their prioritization by NeoDisc9. In addition, we supplemented the inclusion lists with peptides derived from three-frame translation of TAA genes (Supplementary Data 2). Here, we filtered all 8–14mers so that each had %-rank of <2 for at least two HLA-A or HLA-B alleles of the respective melanoma cell lines. We then selected those 1000 peptides for each melanoma cell line that had the highest %-ranks for any of the alleles of the respective patient's haplotype. Sample HLA-typing information can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

For the melanoma tissues Ti1, Ti2, and TI3, the 500 top neoantigens as prioritized by NeoDisc were selected as targets. Additionally, we added the 518 TAA-derived class I peptides that were predicted by NeoDisc in the “ExpressedTAAs” table. Sample HLA-typing information can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

To efficiently schedule inclusion list entries and improve target detection, retention time prediction for target peptides is recommended. This approach minimizes the need for targeted scans to search for all peptides across the entire gradient, thereby reducing the loss in global coverage. For retention time prediction, the following are required: (1) retention times of calibration peptides, (2) a list of target peptides, and (3) a retention time prediction tool, such as DeepLC56. We used calibration peptide retention times derived from PSMs from a preceding tryptic HeLa digest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. 88329) DDA measurement with the same LC gradient as the NeoDiscMS method. The calibration run should ideally be conducted shortly before the NeoDiscMS measurements and on the same column, ensuring multiple washed between them to minimize carry over. A spectral library was generated from the calibration run with FragPipe (v22.0) with default settings for tryptic digests, including methionine oxidation as a variable modification. Next, we predicted the RT of our list of targets with DeepLC (v3.1.1), with help of the RT peptide calibration file. Importantly, we included all methionine oxidation variations of target peptide sequences. To schedule our inclusion list, we created windows of ±15 min around the RT of each modified peptide (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Last, we generated the inclusion lists in the format dictated by manufacturer's method development software Thermo Xcalibur Instrument Setup (v2.0), including peptides with charge states 1–3.

For the RTS, we created dedicated FASTA files that consisted individual target peptide sequences as entries. For the melanoma cell line and the clinical tissue experiments, RTS FASTA headers were annotated as neoantigen or TAA. An example of sample Ml3 for the DeepLC calibration peptides file, DeepLC target peptides file, scheduled inclusion list, as well as a FASTA needed for RTS are provided as Supplementary Data 3–6.

An example acquisition tree, as seen in Thermo Xcalibur Instrument Setup, the order of adding the acquisition tree parameters with the drag-and-drop buttons, as well as where to find real-time search parameters is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1.

For all NeoDiscMS experiments, RTS parameters were set as visualized in Supplementary Fig. 1. Across experiments, settings remained the same apart from the inclusion list and FASTA used. Importantly, at the time of writing, all methods that apply RTS required a digestion enzyme as an input. Nevertheless, the database search then takes all digested peptides as well as the full FASTA sequences into account. Since the FASTA entries directly reflected the peptide sequences, we aimed to minimize forced digestion. In addition, no static modifications were allowed, and methionine oxidation was set as the only variable modification. We allowed up to three variable modifications/peptide. Maximum search time was set to 40 ms. To pass RTSf, the scoring thresholds were set to Xcorr -> 0.4, dCn -> 0, Precursor PPM -> 5 for charge states 1–3.

For all DIA experiments, we applied an MS1 mass range of 300–1650Th at a resolution of 120,000 and 27 DIA windows of sizes [37, 30, 24, 24, 22, 23, 44, 21, 24, 24, 25, 27, 27, 30, 35, 38, 43, 53, 72, 103, 594] with an AGC target of 2000%, the injection time set to auto, MS2 mass resolution set to 30,000, and a stepped CE of [27, 30, 32].

The injection volumes of each sample as well as the respective sample input are indicated in Supplementary Data 1. DDA, ilDDA, and NeoDiscMS acquisition cycles were constructed as described in Fig. 1b. Cycle times for all methods are 3 s. Detailed scan type parameters for all scan types are described in Supplementary Table 3. For ilDDA and NeoDiscMS, the according inclusion list/FASTA was included in the method.

We used an Easy-nLC 1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Our analytical columns were 450 mm long with an inner diameter of 75 μm and an 8 μm tip (TSP-075375, BGB Analytik). For column packing we used C18 beads with a particle size of 1.9 µm and a pore size of 120 angstrom (r119.aq, Dr. Maisch). For all experiments, LC gradients used 0.1% formic acid (Thermo Scientific, prod nr. 85178) as solvent A and 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid as solvent B, a gradient length of 125 min, and a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The gradient consisted of multiple, linear increases of solvent B: 0–110 min with 2–25%, 110–114 min with 25–35%, 114–115 min with 35–100%, 115–125 min with 100%.

To generate a calibration run for the DeepLC RT prediction, we injected 100 ng of tryptic HeLa digest that was measured with the same gradient above, with a MSFragger-DDA database search with all human Swissprot57 sequences without isoforms (28.3.2024, 20419 entries) as well as the “common contaminants” list provided by FragPipe. We kept all default setting for tryptic searches in place.

For immunopeptidomics searches with MSFragger-DDA, we applied a DDA database search with all human Swissprot sequences without isoforms (28.3.2024, 20,419 entries) as well as iRT peptide sequences and the “common contaminants” list provided by Fragpipe as a FASTA database. Digestion was set to unspecific, peptides of lengths 8–14 were included. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and cysteine carbamidomethylation were set as variable modifications. Only precursors with charges 1–3 were permitted for PSMing. Protein FDR was set to 1. Peptide, ion, and psm FDRs were set to 0.01. For immunopeptidomics searches with MSFragger-DDA+ we applied DDA+ database searches with different FASTA databases for different experiments, though they were all concatenated with iRT peptide sequences and the “common contaminants” list provided by Fragpipe. For the JY- and RA957-based experiments we used all human Swissprot sequences without isoforms (28.3.2024, 20,419 entries). For melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissues the respective sample-specific FASTA generated by NeoDisc were used. Digestion was set to unspecific, peptides of lengths 8–14 were included. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and cysteine carbamidomethylation were set as variable modifications. Only precursors with charges 1–3 were permitted for PSMing. DDA+-specific parameters were left at default. Protein FDR was set to 1. Peptide, ion, and psm FDR was set to 0.01 for with the SwissProt FASTA or 0.03 with group-specificity52,58 for searches with NeoDisc FASTAs, respectively.

For elution profile visualization, raw files and target precursor sequence were imported into Skyline v22.259 for visualization.

For the spectrum-centric search with DIA-Umpire of DIA data from the melanoma tissue experiment, we did a database search with DIA-Umpire using a NeoDisc-generated FASTA. Digestion was set to unspecific, peptides of lengths 8–14 were included. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and cysteine carbamidomethylation were set as variable modifications. DIA-Umpire-specific parameters were left at default. Only precursors with charges 1–3 were permitted for PSMing. Protein FDR was set to 1. Peptide, ion, and PSM FDR was set to 0.03 with group-specificity.

From the libraries generated with a spectrum-centric search of the respective DIA data and the NeoDiscMS MSFragger-DDA+ results of either Ti1, Ti2, or Ti3, we generated a hybrid library for each tissue separately. We used said hybrid library, per tissue, for a peptide-centric search of the DIA data with DIA-NN. FDR was set to 0.01.

For immunopeptidomics data analysis we extracted psm.tsv output files of all spectrum-centric searches and report.tsv of all peptide-centric searches for data analysis. For peptide binding affinity prediction we used MixMHCpred36 (v2.3). Data wrangling as well as analysis was done in R and Julia. Raw file header information was extracted in R with help of the rawrr60 package (v1.12.0). To calculate precursor intensities per raw file we extracted the highest precursor PSM intensity for each precursor separately. We calculated peptide intensities by adding up all precursor intensities of a given peptide sequence. Data visualization was done with R in Rstudio with packages ggplot261 (v3.5.1), ggseqlogo62 (v0.2), ggside (v0.3.1), patchwork (v1.3.0), ggh4x (v0.2.8), gt (v0.11.0).

NeoDiscMS was introduced in NeoDisc v1.7.1 and can be executed through three steps: (1) Run NeoDisc to identify and prioritize immunogenic tumor-specific antigens from NGS data and predict their chromatographic RTs, (2) perform NeoDiscMS-based measurements of the immunopeptidome, (3) resume the NeoDisc workflow to search NeoDiscMS immunopeptidomic files against personalized references, followed by prioritization of tumor-specific antigens.

By running NeoDisc in fastq mode with the -neodiscmsselect flag, the user has to provide and specify in the configuration file a MS raw file of either shotgun proteomics or immunopeptidomics, as NEODISCMS_CALIBRATION parameter, that will be searched by FragPipe v22.0 for creating a calibration library used for RT prediction. This search is done against a GENCODE v43 protein-coding sequence reference, accounting for peptide modifications and the maximum number of modifications per peptide defined in the configuration file (MS_MODIFICATIONS and MS_MAXMODSPERPEPTIDE parameters). NeoDisc then partitions the prioritized HLA-I- and HLA-II-restricted peptide sequences into neoantigens, TAAs, and viral peptides, with the number of peptides in each group, as determined by the user in the NeoDisc configuration file (NEODISCMS_NEOCI, NEODISCMS_TAACI, NEODISCMS_VIRCI, NEODISCMS_NEOCII, NEODISCMS_TAACII, NEODISCMS_VIRCII). Their retention times is then predicted by DeepLC56 v2.2.36, where the above mentioned calibration run library (peptide identification list with measured retention times) is used, and by considering peptide modifications (MS_MODIFICATIONS and MS_MAXMODSPERPEPTIDE), maximum charges per peptide (NEODISCMS_CHARGES), collision energy (NEODISCMS_CE), gradient length (NEODISCMS_GRADIENT), and the retention-time window width (NEODISCMS_WINRT) as defined in the NeoDisc configuration file. NeoDisc generates separate lists of HLA-I and HLA-II target peptide sequences (fasta) along with their predicted retention times (csv) specifically designed for NeoDiscMS measurements. After completing the NeoDiscMS measurements, the resulting raw files are added to the configuration file under MS_SPECTRA_SAMPLES, MS_SPECTRA_HLA_I, and MS_SPECTRA_HLA_II. The NeoDisc analysis is then resumed in fastq mode using the -neodiscms flag. This step involves searching the NeoDiscMS immunopeptidomic raw files with both Comet v2024.02_0 - NewAnce v1.7.5 and Fragpipe v22.0 DDA+ against the personalized references generated by NeoDisc. The results are subsequently integrated into the final NeoDisc analysis and prioritization.

To ensure reproducibility of results we performed all comparisons of different conditions in triplicates, as commonly used in the field. No data was excluded. To investigate different technical conditions, such as different acquisition parameters, measurements were randomized.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Raw files and real-time search tables generated during the acquisition, as well as identified PSMs of NeoDiscMS measurement, have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE63 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD059824. Immunogenicity assessments and NGS data for Ml1 and Ml2 were described in Müller et al.7, where they equate to patient1 and patient3, respectively. NGS and immunogenicity assessments for Ml3 is reported in Huber et al.9, corresponds to Mel-4 P1 HLA-I high cells. WES and RNAseq data for TI1, Ti2, and Ti3 is deposited on the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) with the dataset identifier EGAD50000001422.

NeoDiscMS is integrated within NeoDisc v1.8.0 and is available at https://neodisc.unil.ch/.

Metrics details

Electron hopping on spatially periodic lattices gives rise to intriguing electronic behaviour. For example, hopping on the geometrically frustrated two-dimensional kagome, dice and Lieb lattices yields electronic band structures with both massless Dirac-like and perfectly dispersion-less, flat bands. As materials featuring the dice and Lieb lattice structures are scarce, an alternative approach proposes to leverage atomic orbitals to realize the characteristic electron hopping of geometrically frustrated lattices. This strategy promises to expand the list of candidate materials with frustrated electron hopping, but is yet to be shown in experiments. Here we demonstrate frustrated hopping in the van der Waals intermetallic Pd5AlI2, emerging from the arrangement of atomic orbitals in a primitive square lattice. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation measurements, we reveal that the band structure of Pd5AlI2 includes linear Dirac-like bands intersected at their crossing point by a locally flat band—an essential characteristic of frustrated hopping in Lieb and dice lattices. Moreover, this compound shows exceptional chemical stability, with its unusual bulk band structure and metallicity persisting in ambient conditions down to the monolayer limit. Hence, our results showcase a way to realize electronic structures characteristic of geometrically frustrated lattices in non-frustrated systems.

OpenAI has begun rolling out GPT-5, the latest iteration of its flagship language model, to all ChatGPT users.

The company's CEO Sam Altman called GPT-5 “a significant step along the path to AGI” during a press briefing on Wednesday. While he stopped short of claiming the model reaches artificial general intelligence, Altman noted the latest release is “clearly a model that is generally intelligent.” He added that GPT-5 still lacks key traits that would make it reach AGI, a notably loose term that is defined in OpenAI's charter as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” For example, the model still lacks the ability to learn continuously after deployment.

OpenAI claims GPT-5 is smarter, faster, more useful, and more accurate, with a lower hallucination rate than previous models. In characteristically lofty terms, Altman likened the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5 to the iPhone's shift from pixelated to a Retina display. “GPT-5 is the first time that it really feels like talking to an expert in any topic, like a PhD level expert,” Altman said.

As part of Thursday's launch, OpenAI announced two new model variants: a lightweight gpt-5-mini and an even faster, cheaper, gpt-5-nano (which is only in the API). According to OpenAI, free users will get access to GPT-5 and gpt-5-mini, while the Plus subscription includes the same models with “significantly higher” usage limits. OpenAI says that the $200 a month Pro tier offers unlimited GPT-5 access, along with GPT-5-pro, a more powerful version of the model, and GPT-5-thinking, which allows the model to process a query for longer than usual. Pro users will still have access to pick through legacy models. Most users will no longer need to choose between models, as the chat interface now automatically routes to the right version depending on the complexity of the query and the user's subscription tier.

According to the developer launch blog, GPT-5 will cost developers using the API $1.25/1M to input tokens and $10/1M to output tokens. “GPT-5 mini is priced at $0.25/1M input tokens and $2/1M output tokens, and GPT-5 nano is priced at $0.05/1M input tokens and $0.40/1M output tokens,” it adds. For comparison, developers often use Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite since it's so cheap—GPT-5 nano is now cheaper.

Starting next week, Pro users will be able to connect their Gmail, Google Contacts, and Google Calendar to ChatGPT, with other tiers gaining access at an unspecified date. “ChatGPT automatically knows when it's most relevant to reference them so you don't need to select them before you chat,” the company said in an email.

Users can also choose a chat color and select from four pre-set personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—a feature WIRED's newsletter Model Behavior reported was in the works last week. According to OpenAI's blog announcement, it plans to bake these personalities into Advanced Voice Mode.

The company's API will offer users all three models, along with optional controls for toggling between detailed or direct responses. GPT-5 can retain more information than prior models—it has a 256,000-token context window, a bump up from the 200,000-token context window available in the company's previous o3 model. That means it can better understand long conversations, documents, or code without losing track of context.

OpenAI's blog post claims that GPT-5 beats its previous models on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified (scoring 74.9 percent), SWE-Lancer (GPT-5-thinking scored 55 percent), and Aider Polyglot (scored 88 percent), which test the model's ability to fix bugs, complete freelance-style coding tasks, and work across multiple programming languages.

During the press briefing on Wednesday, OpenAI post-training lead Yann Dubois prompted GPT-5 to “create a beautiful, highly interactive web app for my partner, an English speaker, to learn French.” He tasked the AI to include features like daily progress, a variety of activities like flashcards and quizzes, and noted that he wanted the app wrapped up in a “highly engaging theme.” After a minute or so, the AI-generated app popped up. While it was just one on-rails demo, the result was a sleek site that delivered exactly what Dubois asked for.

“It's a great coding collaborator, and also excels at agentic tasks,” Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead, says. “It executes long chains and tool calls effectively [which means it better understands when and how to use functions like web browsers or external APIs], follows detailed instructions, and provides upfront explanations of its actions.""

OpenAI also says in its blog post that GPT-5 is “our best model yet for health-related questions.” In three OpenAI health-related LLM benchmarks—HealthBench, HealthBench Hard, and HealthBench Consensus—the system card (a document that describes the product's technical capabilities and other research findings) states that GPT-5-thinking outperforms previous models “by a substantial margin.” The thinking version of GPT-5 scored 25.5 percent on HealthBench Hard, up from o3's 31.6 percent score. These scores are validated by two or more physicians, according to the system card.

The model also allegedly hallucinates less, according to Pokrass, a common issue for AI where it provides false information. OpenAI's safety research lead Alex Beutel adds that they've ""significantly decreased the rates of deception in GPT-5.”

“We've taken steps to reduce GPT-5-thinking's propensity to deceive, cheat, or hack problems, though our mitigations are not perfect and more research is needed,” the system card says. “In particular, we've trained the model to fail gracefully when posed with tasks that it cannot solve.”

The company's system card says that after testing GPT-5 models without access to web browsing, researchers found its hallucination rate (which they defined as “percentage of factual claims that contain minor or major errors”) 26 percent less common than the GPT-4o model. GPT-5-thinking has a 65 percent reduced hallucination rate compared to o3.

For prompts that could be dual-use (potentially harmful or benign), Beutel says GPT-5 uses “safe completions,” which prompts the model to “give as helpful an answer as possible, but within the constraints of remaining safe.” OpenAI did over 5,000 hours of red teaming, according to Beutel, and testing with external organizations to make sure the system was robust.

OpenAI says it now boasts nearly 700 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, 5 million paying business users, and 4 million developers utilizing the API.

“The vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that,” head of ChatGPT Nick Turley says. “Especially average people who haven't been spending their time thinking about models.”

The Framework laptops did something no other laptop could. With the ability to upgrade or swap out nearly every internal component, they are sustainable, unlike any other.

But the Framework Desktop isn't so unique. After all, one of the primary reasons people buy (or build) desktop PCs is the ability to upgrade the system on their own. This 4.5-liter mini-ITX PC isn't so different from many of the compact PCs you can already buy. And yet, Framework's distinctive approach makes this stand out.

The Framework Desktop is adorable. It's a mini-ITX desktop, but one that truly resembles a tiny version of a full-size tower. Unlike some sleeker mini-ITX cases with more adventurous designs, the Framework Desktop needs to be fully accessible, which is part of what makes it unique. Mini-ITX systems are notoriously difficult to upgrade and work around due to the limited space available. And while it's tight compared to upgrading a Framework Laptop 13, the Framework Desktop delivers a fully customizable and upgradable system in a small form factor.

At 3.81 x 8.09 x 8.90 inches, it has a tiny footprint on your desk. That's quite small, even for a small-form-factor build. Notably, it's far too compact to squeeze a standard external GPU inside. Even something like the extra-small Jonsbo NV10 can squeez in only a low-profile graphics card. That'll be important later when we talk about performance expectations, as the Framework Desktop is not necessarily meant to be a replacement for a full-fledged gaming PC. Then again, call me crazy, but I'd gladly take the light-hearted tile system that clicks into the front cover grid over another dose of overdone RGB lighting.

The Framework Desktop comes mostly assembled, excluding a couple of components that you'll need to install yourself. You'll choose SSDs for one or both of the two M.2 slots, which range from 500 GB up to 8 TB. Framework sells WD Black models, but as with the Framework Laptop, you can always opt to buy without an SSD and use your own. The same is true for the CPU fan. You're given the option to choose from a Noctua or Cooler Master fan, but because Framework uses off-the-shelf parts, you can bring your own 120-mm fan. If you choose this option, Framework will throw in a fan mounting kit to make it all work.

You can access these components by removing the top and side panels. The top panel has a couple of thumb screws that hold it in place. Once you have that off, the perforated side panel slides out pretty easily. The way these two panels fit together is clumsy, and it took me a number of attempts to get them back in place. It's not quite as smooth as on the Framework Laptop 12, for example, which is completely toolless.

The ports on the back include two DisplayPort 2.1, HDMI 2.1, an RJ45 Ethernet jack, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and a 3.5-mm headphone jack. It's a little strange to have the headphone jack in the back instead of in front. But that's where the Expansion Cards come into play. Like the Framework Laptop, the Framework Desktop can swap out ports, depending on your needs, but only the two in the front. You can do USB-C or USB-A or, if you're like me, you'd want a forward-facing SD card slot. So, while it's not as impactful as it is on a laptop, it remains a useful feature nonetheless.

The Framework Desktop is based around its CPU, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. It's an interesting and innovative chip, featured in only a couple of products this year so far. Not only does it have 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, it also comes with a massive integrated GPU, the Radeon 8060S. It has 40 GPU cores, making it one of the most powerful integrated GPUs ever made. I've tested this chip once before in the Asus ROG Flow Z13, a 2-in-1 gaming tablet, and I was impressed by it at the time. But I've never tested it on a more capable system.

In 3DMark Steel Nomad, a popular graphics benchmark, the Framework Desktop performed 13 percent faster than on the ROG Flow Z13. That's with both systems set at the Best Performance mode, too. It's still 32 percent behind the latest generation of desktop GPUs, such as the RTX 5060, but that's to be expected. The closest comparable discrete GPU is the Laptop RTX 4060. While that's not exciting for PC gamers, remember: these are integrated graphics. The only integrated graphics performance that comes close is on Apple's side with the M4 chips.

I tried out some modern games, such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel Rivals, and was thoroughly impressed by how well they performed. I was surprised to find that I could play Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p and Ultra settings without any upscaling yet still achieve an average of 84 frames per second. You can easily venture into higher resolutions and even ray tracing if you use AMD's image upscaling settings or even frame generation. Lighter games like Marvel Rivals play without missing a beat.

The RAM is not removable due to the nature of the chip, though it does come in large-capacity options. The base model has 32 GB, while my configuration came with 64 GB. There's a 128 GB option, which is important for anyone looking to work with local large language models or other AI projects. The neural processing unit inside is capable of over 50 TOPS, and Framework claims it can run large language AI models like Llama 3 70B locally in real time, specifically on the 128-GB model that gives the GPU 96 GB of VRAM to work with.

Framework laptops were already nice, but the Framework Desktop is perhaps the most niche product the company has launched so far. The benefits of choosing the Framework Desktop over any other desktop out there have less to do with what makes the Framework ethos so unique. There are even smaller options, such as the Corsair AI Workstation 300, which is slightly taller but not as deep. They are similarly priced, though Corsair is selling only the higher-end option with 128 GB of RAM.

On the other hand, the Framework Desktop is an awesome middle ground between the compact nature of a mini-PC and the performance and upgradability of a true small-form-factor PC. I don't like that you can't upgrade the RAM, and I wish the side panels were easier to install. I do have concerns about the CPU inside, too. While it performs great, a lot depends on AMD continuing to support this somewhat specialized component. Framework hasn't let me down thus far, but its previous computers have used more standard parts. But by now, the company has earned some trust from me.

For AI enthusiasts hoping to run local LLMs, the Framework Desktop is a shoo-in, especially with all the available memory. But it's also a decent option for those who want a compact PC that doesn't completely forfeit performance or upgradability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Eli Lilly's Obesity Pill Shows Promising Weight Loss in New Results","https://www.wired.com/story/eli-lillys-obesity-pill-shows-promising-weight-loss-in-new-results/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

An experimental pill made by Eli Lilly led to average weight loss of more than 12 percent of body weight in individuals with obesity, according to initial trial results announced by the drugmaker on Thursday. The pill is meant to be taken daily and would be an alternative to the company's popular anti-obesity drug Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable drug.

Called orforglipron, it's part of a growing class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy. The drugs mimic a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps regulate blood sugar and promotes a feeling of fullness. Injected GLP-1 drugs have shown weight loss of around 15 to 20 percent.

Eli Lilly's 18-month trial included more than 3,000 adults with an average starting weight of 228 pounds and a body mass index of 37, which is considered obese. Participants were randomized to receive either 6, 12, or 36 milligrams of orforglipron or a placebo pill. The lowest dose of orforglipron resulted in less than 8 percent loss of body weight, or about 18 pounds, and the middle dose led to a 9 percent reduction, or 21 pounds.

The highest dose led to the most weight loss—12 percent on average, or about 27 pounds, compared to 2 pounds with the placebo. In the highest-dose group, about 60 percent of participants lost at least 10 percent of their body weight, while 40 percent lost 15 percent or more.

Participants who received orforglipron started the study at a dose of 1 milligram daily and then increased the dose every four weeks to their final maintenance dose. Everyone in the trial, including those in the placebo group, was also prescribed a healthy diet and physical activity. There were no food or water restrictions for taking the pill.

The pill was safe, but like injected GLP-1 drugs, orforglipron caused gastrointestinal side effects for many participants. The most common was nausea, which was suffered by a third of participants in the highest-dose group; constipation was experienced by about a quarter of patients in that group, as were diarrhea and vomiting. Those side effects led to more than 20 percent of participants in each dosage group dropping out during the course of the study.

Eli Lilly says more detailed results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill for diabetes, Rybelsus, but it's not as effective for weight loss as injectable versions and was never approved for weight management.

Orforglipron also looks promising as a diabetes treatment. In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the pill lowered blood sugar levels and weight in people with type 2 diabetes. Eli Lilly says it plans to submit orforglipron for regulatory review by the end of the year.

Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill for diabetes, Rybelsus, but it's not as effective for weight loss as injectable versions and was never approved for weight management. A challenge with developing a more effective pill has been how to improve its bioavailability—the amount of drug that enters circulation and has an active effect. Other GLP-1 drugs are made up of larger molecules that are not easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Instead, most of the drug gets digested. Eli Lilly might have solved that problem with orforglipron, a small-molecule formulation.

Ceretone, born on Indiegogo, hit the scene last year with impressively tiny hardware that still remains one of the smallest and lightest hearing aids I've ever reviewed. At just 0.96 grams each, the Ceretone Core One were so light they threatened to blow away in the wind. With a price of $349 per pair, they had a similarly minimal effect on your bank account.

The trouble with the original Ceretone Core One is that they just weren't very good as hearing aids. They were not tunable, suffered from occasional feedback and interference, and could be controlled only via a rudimentary mobile app. More than a year later, Ceretone has emerged with an update in the form of the Ceretone Core One Pro, and they feel like a full reboot with little in common with the original product.

The Core One Pro hearing aids are IP66-rated in-the-ear devices that, like the original Core One, are extremely small and lightweight, though at 1.17 grams per device, they're noticeably bigger than the originals. They're also noticeably less attractive. While the original Core One had a white, contemporary design with color-coded eartips, the new Core One Pro features an unfortunately dated, industrial brown body.

The included eartips have changed from closed domes to a sort of hybrid open/closed style, and they are now both clear, so you'll need to look closely to distinguish left and right. (In addition to the preinstalled pair, three additional sets of tips in different sizes are included in the package.) Battery life is now specified at 20 hours per charge, an impressive stat it delivered in my testing, though there is no useful battery meter on the hearing aids or the case. As with the Core One, these hearing aids do not support Bluetooth streaming.

Operationally, Ceretone has completely revamped the way these hearing aids work. Namely, you no longer need to use its mobile app to control them, because Ceretone's mobile app doesn't work with this model at all. There are only two types of control offered, volume and environmental program mode, and each is controlled via a different method.

To control volume, the hearing aids have to be seated in the included case—a traditional, compact device that provides 80 hours of additional charge. Two buttons—one for each aid—cycle the device through six volume levels. An LED display situated between the two hearing aids indicates the volume setting for each one as it is adjusted. (Having one volume meter for two devices is a little confusing, so it's important to remember it only shows the status for the most recently adjusted hearing aid.)

The case also includes a small indicator that shows the hearing program setting for each aid, of which there are now four: standard, restaurant, outdoor, and tinnitus-masking, all self-explanatory. (Note that I did not test the tinnitus masking mode, as I don't suffer from the condition.) These modes can be cycled through by tapping the device twice while it's in your ear, and as with adjusting the volume, each ear is controlled individually. It's strange (and inconvenient) to have to control mode and volume via two different methods, and always one ear at a time, but if you rarely change your hearing aids' volume level, it may not be that much trouble.

The bigger problem with the Core One Pro hearing aids is that, as with the Core One, they just aren't all that effective. Since the aids aren't tunable, there is no way to customize them based on your audiogram, which means that all frequencies get boosted upward, more or less.

This was immediately noticeable in my testing as lower-level frequencies were amplified far more than I needed, causing everything from footsteps to running water to be uncomfortably loud, and painfully so if I turned the volume up past level three (of six total settings). I also found a steady stream of hiss underlying everything, though this was at least mitigated at the lowest volume levels. Over time, at anything over volume level one, the Ceretone Core One Pro hearing aids were more distracting than beneficial, though there's no denying the amplification power they have. At higher volume levels, the hearing aids were downright deafening.

They're also not as comfortable for long-term wear as the original Core One, though this probably had more to do with the eartips, which are a little rough around the edges, than the design of the hearing aid hardware itself.

As with the original Core One, I'm not entirely sure who these hearing aids are designed for, even at a quite reasonable price of $390. (List price is $700, for what it's worth.) Without any tunability features, users are getting a very blunt audio experience that prioritizes brute amplification over everything instead of helping them better hear the sounds they want to hear.

Golf is an incredibly difficult game, as any avid golfer can attest, so anything that gives you an edge is worthy of investment. The best golf rangefinders offer pinpoint precision in any conditions, helping you accomplish the Herculean task of driving a tiny dimpled ball into a small hole from hundreds of yards away. We started this list by pitting some of the very best rangefinders you can buy at multiple price ranges against one another over several rounds to gauge traits like accuracy, durability, features, and ease of use in various conditions.

We'll continue testing the top options, always looking for the best models for your dollars. Looking for more help with your game, or something for a loved one?

What Kind of Rangefinder Features Should I Expect?

Rangefinders can include a slew of features, which can make shopping as a novice confusing. The most important options in our testing include slope measurement (elevation gained or lost), a pinspotter (which zeroes in on the pin when tracking), weatherproofing, tournament mode, a cart magnet, and last but definitely not least, image stabilization.

Other handy options from some of our favorites include an OLED display for a bright targeting overlay, and Bluetooth connectivity to pair with other golf devices like a smartwatch for GPS data. The fancier you get, the more features you'll find, including options like wind speed and direction, element compensation, and more. That said, there is such a thing as too much data, and you'll usually pay a premium as the feature count goes up.

Laser vs. GPS

You may read about laser versus GPS rangefinders, but the majority of rangefinders we test (and all of the models on our list) rely mainly on laser tracking. Some rangefinders, like the Garmin Z30, can receive GPS data from a paired device or smartwatch. Others may incorporate GPS directly, but this can drain the battery quickly. You can also get GPS data from a separate app for your phone or smartwatch, often for free, which can supplement your rangefinder for blind shots. Overall, while GPS can be helpful, laser tracking is generally the way to go.

What Does Slope Mean?

Slope in relation to golf rangefinders is simply the measurement of how many yards upward or downward the ball must travel to reach its destination. It is a key feature for the best rangefinders to provide accurate club data. All of the rangefinders we tested can be set to measure slope, including both the true distance and how long a shot will actually play by accounting for elevation gained or lost to improve shot accuracy. Since slope measurement is generally barred for tournaments, each model offers a “Tournament Mode” that lists the actual distance only, usually signaled by an LED or stripe on the device.

What Kind of Magnification Do I Need?

All of the rangefinders on our list offer a minimum of 6x (six times) object magnification, adjustable with a lens focus. That magnification level worked great in tests for any distance I measured. Some models go further to 7x magnification or higher, which may be useful for those who need additional visual assistance, but for most players, 6x should suffice.

Is a Rangefinder's Maximum Range Important?

The short answer is probably not. Every rangefinder on our list offers enough range for any hole on the course, with a minimum of 700 yards for our cheapest option. Any more than that could theoretically come into play, but it's mostly stat padding.

The Nikon Coolshot Pro III Stabilized is the Cadillac of rangefinders, offering luxe features and a silky smooth ride that makes finding your elevation, shot, and hazard distances a pleasure. The key is right in the name, stabilization, which snaps shaky targets in place like an ace pilot on the stick, making quick tracking simple in challenging conditions.

I love being able to scan the horizon for hazards, while the flag locks in perfectly with a telltale buzz. Four slope modes provide options for any situation, including tournaments, and the compact design makes it easy to handle. The lack of a magnet means you can't stick it to your cart, and there's not much in the way of accessories, but the Pro III's performance makes it an easy choice as my top pick.

Shot Scope

Walmart

Shot Scope

If you're after a rangefinder on a tight budget, the Shot Scope Pro L2 is all you need. This light and compact model provides impressive accuracy, standing tall with rangefinders three times the price, usually within a margin of a yard or two. Its powerful magnet lets you stick it to your cart or bag, and you'll get good accessories like a hard case, lens cleaner, and carabiner.

The monocolor reticle system isn't as handy as pricier colored options, and the optics aren't quite as clear, but with a durable design, adaptive slope reading, and extras like an app for course maps, it's hard to beat this package for the price.

Garmin

Amazon

Walmart

Garmin

The Garmin Approach Z30 is a simplified rangefinder with a hearty design and solid all-around performance. It's got a strong magnet for sticking on your cart, an intuitive (and basic) menu, and clear visuals via its transparent OLED display with a bright red targeting reticle for accurate reads with or without slope measurement.

Where the Z30 really steps up is when paired with a Garmin golf watch like the Approach S12. The Z30 sends laser targets directly to the watch, while the watch shares GPS flag distance from the front and back of the green right in the eyepiece, which really comes in handy. The Z30's main downside is its lack of image stabilization, which is a bummer at this price, but if you're a Garmin user with a steady hand, it's a great combo.

There are tons of rangefinders available in multiple styles, and while not every model makes our top list, they could still be a good fit for your needs.

How We Test Golf Rangefinders

We test rangefinders exactly how they're intended to be used: on the golf course. Sure, they're fun to mess with elsewhere—they're essentially just small telescopes—but the only way to properly access performance is to use them constantly on the links. I tested all of these rangefinders across multiple local courses, using them back-to-back (to back), which sometimes annoyed my fellow golfers, but helped gauge accuracy, clarity, and ease of use. I tested all their features, from menu settings and pin targeting, to how well their side magnets held onto my cart. I also treated them as roughly as I'd expect you will.

Welcome back! Louise here. On Friday, President Trump fired one of the nation's top economists after her agency published a disappointing jobs report. Trump claimed the numbers were “RIGGED,” but there's no evidence that Erika McEntarfer or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) did anything improper. The new employment data, however, suggested Trump's policies are having a negative impact on the US economy.

In the days since, Republicans have piled on, baselessly accusing McEntarfer of putting out “fake reports.” Trump hasn't named a new BLS commissioner yet, but the saga has already left some Americans questioning whether government statistics can be trusted. If you want a glimpse of where that leads, just look at China.

The Chinese government has long been accused of inflating its annual GDP growth figures, especially at the provincial level. In 2007, the former Chinese premier told the US ambassador to China that his province's GDP figures were “man-made.” To understand how his region was doing, Li Keqiang said he instead tracked electricity consumption, freight volumes, and bank loans, a system The Economist later dubbed “the Li Keqiang index.”

Over 15 years later, experts say things have changed significantly. The Chinese government now releases more economic data and it's generally considered more reliable. “The data have improved dramatically over time,” says Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has been writing about the Chinese economy since the 1970s.

One reason for this is that Beijing stopped grading local officials primarily based on the economic performance of their regions. That growth-at-all-costs mindset had led to societal problems like widespread pollution. In response, the Chinese Communist Party began putting more emphasis on nuanced ideals, like fostering innovation and reducing the urban-rural divide. That, in turn, reduced the incentive to manipulate GDP numbers in the first place.

But many analysts, both inside and outside China, believe that Beijing continues to fudge its overall growth numbers, in part because officials remain deeply concerned with projecting a rosy image of the economy. China officially reported that its economy grew by 5 percent in 2024, while the US reported only 2.8 percent growth.

At a conference in December, an economist at a Chinese state-owned investment firm said that “we do not know” China's real growth figure, but he speculated it was far below what had been reported. When Xi Jinping got wind of the comments, he was reportedly furious and ordered the economist to be punished. Sound familiar?

As China's economy cooled in recent years, officials have repeatedly sought to muzzle experts who share negative information or dare to question Beijing. Government departments have stopped publishing some industrial reports and employment indicators or temporarily delayed their release without explanation. Other data has become harder to interpret or can no longer be accessed from outside the country.

But like so many things in China, two seemingly contradictory things can be true at once. While the experts I spoke to acknowledged that China is far less transparent than the US, they say the information it does put out is now relatively accurate and often astonishingly detailed.

“I'm blown away by how granular it is for industrial surveys,” says Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the RAND China Research Center and an expert on China's economy. “The data definitely has problems, but there's enough there to tell a semi-accurate picture.”

DiPippo says he tries to stay away from debates about the reliability of individual Chinese statistics, because the discussion tends to frequently devolve into what he calls “data nihilism.” When every number is called into question, “people can believe whatever they want,” he explains.

If you are genuinely interested in trying to make sense of the evidence, it's crucial to have the right political and cultural context going in. Take China's national unemployment rate, for example, which fell only slightly when a large chunk of the country was under draconian Covid lockdown measures in 2022. Some observers were quick to assume that meant Beijing had cooked the books, but the more likely explanation is that the US and China simply relied on very different strategies to help workers survive the pandemic.

The US government focused on increasing unemployment benefits and giving out stimulus checks to individuals, which boosted consumer spending. Beijing gave factories and other businesses generous tax breaks, which encouraged them to keep people on their payrolls. “The unemployment numbers may be accurate, but if you want to learn what the real state of the economy is, it's not going to tell you very much,” says Lardy.

Generally, Lardy says, he believes Chinese researchers are earnestly trying to interpret their country's enormous and rapidly changing economy. While the government is certainly interested in controlling the narrative, sometimes datasets change for reasons that have nothing to do with censorship, such as when state economists discover mistakes or develop more innovative methods for crunching specific numbers.

“If it was just a matter of exaggeration or manipulation, it would be very simple,” Lardy says. “The complexity should be taken into account.”

Complexity isn't unique to China. In both Beijing and Washington, understanding the economy requires technical skill and intellectual honesty, especially when the results aren't politically convenient.

USAFacts, the nonpartisan non-profit organization led by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, rarely weighs in on political controversies. But the firestorm surrounding the firing of the nation's top employment statistician strikes directly at what it depends on most: reliable federal data.

“Undermining trust in official statistics threatens the integrity of the data that millions of Americans — from business leaders to everyday voters — depend on to understand our economy,” the Bellevue-based organization said in a public statement after President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday.

“Data about jobs, prices, and wages belong to the American people,” USA Facts added in its statement. “Their tax dollars fund this work, and they deserve information that is accurate, timely, and free from political interference.”

The firing of the BLS leader came hours after the agency reported weaker-than-expected July jobs numbers and significant downward revisions to prior months' data. 

Without citing evidence, Trump accused McEntarfer of rigging the numbers “for political purposes” and said he would replace her with “someone much more competent and qualified.”

USAFacts depends on government data to generate its analysis and reports, so the timeliness and accuracy of federal numbers are critical to its work. BLS provides many economic indicators beyond the monthly jobs numbers — including inflation, unemployment, and wage data.

In an interview this week, Nicole Bateman, USAFacts' senior research manager, said the organization remains confident in the accuracy of BLS data. It's part of the normal process for jobs data to be revised as the agency receives more complete responses from its surveys.

When asked about USAFacts' take on the firing, Bateman said: “It's essential that that agency remain independent and free of political interference, as it has been for its history.”

USAFacts is already tracking delays in other federal data — including immigration statistics and climate disaster reports — but BLS data continues to flow normally.

However, Bateman acknowledged that McEntarfer's removal “has raised concerns around the politicization of data, really on both sides of the aisle.”

The concerns extend well beyond USAFacts. Banks are reportedly getting anxious calls from clients worried about the reliability of U.S. economic data, with JPMorgan's chief economist warning that politicization of the data collection process poses a threat to financial markets on par with Trump's attempts to influence Federal Reserve decisions. 

The $2.1 trillion market for Treasury inflation-protected securities, where payouts are based on BLS consumer price data, could be particularly vulnerable.

Beyond the political controversy, BLS faces real technical challenges. Survey response rates for BLS's Current Population Survey have plummeted from 90% in 2013 to 67% today — a decline that accelerated during COVID-19. The agency is developing a web-based collection tool to address the problem, with implementation expected in 2027.

“Survey response rates are certainly important for data quality,” Bateman said in a follow-up message. “The BLS has been transparent about declining response rates and its efforts to reverse the long-term decline. Given the expertise within BLS, we trust their position that their data remains reliable.”

The spotlight on government data comes at a key time for USAFacts, as it prepares its annual “America In Facts” report for delivery to Congress in September. (See the 2024 report.)

The report — a visual presentation of data on topics of particular interest to lawmakers — will be accompanied by in-person visits to Washington, D.C., where Bateman said the integrity of government data will no doubt be a major topic of conversation.

Founded by Ballmer in 2017 to make government data more accessible and understandable, USAFacts aggregates statistics from more than 70 government sources to create nonpartisan visualizations and analysis on everything from federal spending to education outcomes. 

The organization also produces an annual “10-K” report modeled after corporate filings, released each Tax Day, that treats government finances like a business report.

For now, USAFacts is taking a wait-and-see approach. “We don't know exactly what the removal of the commissioner will mean for the data,” Bateman said, “but we are certainly paying close attention to the future releases from the agency.”

OpenAI has launched GPT-5, a new flagship AI model that will power the company's next generation of ChatGPT. 

GPT-5, which was released Thursday, is OpenAI's first “unified” AI model and combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series of models with the fast responses of its GPT series. The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT — and its creator, OpenAI — pointing to OpenAI's broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are more like agents than chatbots.

While GPT-4 enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users — such as generating software applications, navigating a user's calendar, or creating research briefs. With GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that's responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to “think” through answers.

During a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is “the best model in the world,” and said it represented a “significant step” along the company's path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work — that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI).

“Having something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,” said Altman.

Starting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI's VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company's effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time. (Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.)

“This is just one of the ways that I'm excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,” said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI's long-standing mission to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.

The expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI's most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world's most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week — nearly 10% of the globe's population, according to the company.

Many see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model's reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI's capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do.

OpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk's xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas.

The company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what's become known as “vibe coding.”

On SWE-bench Verified — a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub — GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic's latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored 74.5%, and Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 59.6%.

On Humanity's Last Exam — a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences — a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That's slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 44.4% on the test.

On GPQA Diamond — a test of PhD-level science questions — GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%.

OpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company's previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively. 

While AI chatbots are not medical professionals, millions of people are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results.

In addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, subjective domains, such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits “better taste” than other AI models on creative tasks.

“The vibes of this model are really good,” said Turley.

GPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI's previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations — the tendency for AI models to make up information — compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be getting worse in OpenAI's latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn't quite understand why it was happening.

In responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That's a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test.

On a benchmark measuring an AI model's agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI's ability to navigate an airline's website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI's ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%.

OpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to scheme against humans or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models. 

Alex Beutel, OpenAI's safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that's more “transparent and honest in ways users can trust.”

Beutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.

ChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT's setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT's responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way.

Subscribers to ChatGPT's $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI's Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week.

For developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI's API in three sizes — gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano — which will spend more or less time “reasoning” through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model's responses should be.

The base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire “Lord of the Rings” series) and $10 per million output tokens.

The launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, gpt-oss, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI's previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding.

However, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition.

X owner Elon Musk told advertisers in a live discussion on Wednesday that the platform plans to introduce ads in Grok's responses, as reported by the Financial Times. The move would help power X's struggling ads business following the departure of former CEO Linda Yaccarino. 

“Our focus thus far has just been on making Grok the smartest, most accurate AI in the world and I think we've largely succeeded in that,” Musk said during the broadcast. “So we'll turn our attention to how do we pay for those expensive GPUs.”

Musk told advertisers that X would allow marketers to pay to appear in suggestions from the AI chatbot. 

“If a user's trying to solve a problem [by asking Grok], then advertising the specific solution would be ideal at that point,” he said. 

The billionaire entrepreneur also plans to use technology from xAI, his AI startup, to improve the targeting of ads on the social network. xAI acquired X earlier this year for $45 billion.

Amidst heightening tensions with China, U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday insisted that Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, must step down, accusing Tan of harboring conflicts of interest.

“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Trump did not share any evidence or details of why Tan may have conflicts of interest.

Trump's post comes after Republican Senator Tom Cotton on Wednesday wrote to Intel's board of directors asking about Tan's alleged ties to China and his investments in the country, and raised concerns about his time leading Cadence Design Systems, which had a Chinese military university as a customer.

Tan, who took over the helm in March, has been focusing on improving efficiency at the chipmaker, which has lost ground to companies like Nvidia and AMD in the AI chip race. Tan has since laid off thousands of staff, spiked plans for new manufacturing plants, and is trying to sell non-core subsidiaries as he tries to return the company to being an engineering-first venture. 

Notably, Intel was a major part of the Biden administration's CHIPS Act, promised almost $8 billion to set up manufacturing and packaging projects in facilities across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.

Intel did not immediately return a request for comment.

The Library of Congress has given a fuller explanation as to why large sections of the U.S. Constitution suddenly vanished from its official website.

As TechCrunch previously reported, parts of Section 8, as well as the entirety of Section 9 and Section 10, were deleted from Article 1 of the Constitution on the U.S. government's official website over the past month. The changes to the sections, which pertained to congressional powers, the rights of individual states, and the rights to due process, sparked alarm at a time when the Trump administration has threatened to suspend habeas corpus.

After the changes were reported, the Library of Congress tweeted that the sections were missing due to a “coding error.” 

TechCrunch reached out to the Library of Congress and received more insight into the issue: 

“The online Constitution Annotated is an educational tool which includes discussions of the Supreme Court's latest opinions linked to the text of the Constitution. When updating the site to reflect our constitutional scholars' analysis of the impact of the latest cases on Article I, Sections 8-10, the team inadvertently removed an XML tag,” Bill Ryan, the director of communications for the Library of Congress, told TechCrunch. 

“This prevented publication of everything in Article I after the middle of Section 8. The problem has been corrected, and our updated constitutional analysis is now available. We are taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the future,” said Ryan.

XML is a commonly used markup language used by the Library of Congress to format its website. A missing closing tag could plausibly result in missing text from the website, as anything outside of the tag would be ignored. 

The full text of the Constitution has now been reinstated on the Library of Congress website.

Duolingo announced on Wednesday that it beat its quarterly revenue estimates, even though the company faced widespread backlash for choosing to embrace generative AI over human workers. Duolingo stock rose almost 30% on the news.

In April, CEO Luis von Ahn shared that Duolingo would become an “AI-first” company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings.

“Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,” von Ahn wrote at the time. “We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”

While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company's financial metrics tell a different story. Now the company anticipates making over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company's estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday's quarterly earnings call.

“The reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn't give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,” von Ahn said. “The most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.”

On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo's videos often remain criticisms of the company's AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, “Nope. Made by our great team!” 

But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not … and from the company's perspective, that's what matters.

President Donald Trump this morning called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, alleging he has conflicts of interest. This latest setback for the struggling computer chip company couldn't have come at a worse time, as Intel is in the middle of attempting a comeback.

“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Trump's post comes as Tan has been attempting to stage a turnaround at Intel after the company initially missed out on the early wave of the AI boom. Tan became CEO of the company this past March.

Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo regarding Trump's post.

Trump's comments also come just a day after Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sent a letter to Intel's Board Chairman Frank Yeary, asking questions about Tan's investments in Chinese chip companies and their alleged ties to China's government and military.

He also raised specific concerns about Tan's former role as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a position he held for 13 years until 2021. In July, the company pleaded guilty to violating U.S. export controls by selling hardware and software to China's National University of Defense Technology without obtaining the required licenses.

“Intel was awarded nearly $8 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest grant to a single company,” Cotton wrote in the letter. “Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.”

In response to the letter, Intel told Reuters on Wednesday that both the company and Tan are “deeply committed to the national security of the United States,” and that they would address the issues in the letter with Cotton.

This isn't the first time the Trump Administration has sought to influence business leaders and pick winners and losers in the corporate world. Since the start of his second term, Trump has used tariffs and trade policy as tools to push companies to invest more in the United States. CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos have all met with Trump in efforts to advance their own business agendas.

Just last month, Tan had outlined his plan to reduce headcount and cut spending to make Intel more competitive with its rivals.

Tan told employees in a staff-wide memo that the company will cut its workforce by roughly 15% by the end of the year and scrapped plans for new factories in Germany and Poland.

“I know the past few months have not been easy. We are making hard but necessary decisions to streamline the organization, drive greater efficiency and increase accountability at every level of the company,” Tan wrote in the memo.

As far as its AI ambitions, Tan said the company needs to develop a cohesive stack strategy—not just chips, but also the software and systems to support them.

“Our starting point will be emerging AI workloads – then we will work backward to design software, systems and silicon that enable the best customer outcomes,” Tan wrote.

Now, with the President against him, Tan's plans of getting Intel back on track have just become a lot harder.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the cruelest conditions a person can develop. And even with recent advances, there's only so much that can be done once its symptoms emerge. Research out this week might highlight a critical and previously missed factor driving the disease, one that could even lead to new treatments.

Scientists at Harvard Medical School led the study, published Wednesday in Nature. By studying human brain samples and mice, they found evidence that our brains naturally contain the element lithium—and that its deficiency can help explain the damage caused by Alzheimer's. The findings are well supported and may have uncovered an important aspect of the neurological disorder, an outside expert told Gizmodo.

The study researchers “have performed detailed and well-designed studies to investigate how low lithium levels are associated with [Alzheimer's disease] at the diagnostic, protein, cellular and gene levels,” said Timothy Chang, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study. Chang is also director of the California Alzheimer's Disease Center at UCLA.

This Anesthesia Gas Could Be the Next Big Alzheimer's Treatment

The brains of people with Alzheimer's are different in many ways from others. In particular, they contain high levels of misfolded amyloid beta and tau, two proteins that normally have important functions. But these aren't the only changes seen in Alzheimer's. And it was while investigating these other changes that the Harvard researchers made their discovery.

With the help of existing projects that collected postmortem tissue samples, they compared levels of around 30 metals in the brains of people who died along varying stages of cognitive health. The only major difference they found was with lithium. People with cognitively healthy brains had relatively high levels of lithium, whereas those with Alzheimer's had much lower levels. Importantly, this loss of lithium was apparent even in people who only experienced mild memory problems before dying.

The researchers also studied healthy mice and genetically modified mice that develop a version of Alzheimer's disease. When they depleted lithium from these mice, it appeared to accelerate the buildup of unhealthy amyloid beta and tau in the brain, along with memory decline. They also found evidence that this loss is caused by amyloid beta plaques binding to the brain's lithium and that this loss of lithium seems to negatively affect all of the brain's major cell types.

Though there has been some limited research suggesting a possible connection between lithium and Alzheimer's, the authors say theirs is the first to show that our brains naturally carry it. What's more, their findings hint that lithium is essential to good brain health and that its absence is key to the development of Alzheimer's.

“This is the first study to suggest that lithium deficiency might contribute to Alzheimer's disease. The reason this has not been proposed is because it was not believed that lithium is a natural substance in the brain with biological effect, just a drug with pharmacological effects at high doses,” senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in Harvard Medical School's Blavatnik Institute, told Gizmodo. “As such, this study is the first to explore the consequences of lithium deficiency in the brain.”

The implications of this study, while still early, could certainly be dramatic. Yankner and his team were also able to identify a lithium-based compound that wasn't so easily bound by amyloid beta. And when they gave mice (older healthy mice and mice with Alzheimer's) this compound, it appeared to prevent the damaging brain changes and memory loss normally inevitable with the neurodegenerative condition. Even the best amyloid-based treatments for Alzheimer's available today, by contrast, only modestly delay its progression.

Other forms of lithium are used in medicine to treat certain mental health disorders, particularly depression. But these versions require high dosages to work as intended and come with many side effects as a result. The team's compound, however, required a much lower dose to be effective in the mice, and no sign of toxicity was observed at all.

“Further clinical studies in humans would be necessary to evaluate if the right type and dose of lithium can prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease,” Chang noted.

Shingles Vaccine Offers Hope Against Dementia

Yankner and his team are now moving ahead with the research needed to show their compound (or something similar) can be safely tested in human clinical trials. But even before then, the team's discovery could pay off in other ways. It might be possible to screen for Alzheimer's risk in the future by measuring people's lithium levels, for example. And there are still many mysteries left to untangle about lithium and its role in brain health.

“As a neuroscientist, I am excited about exploring the physiology of lithium in the brain,” Yankner said. “I suspect we have just scratched the surface of what will be some very interesting biology.”

Turning a living room into a place where movies feel bigger and game nights sound alive usually means more than a TV's tiny speakers can manage. The JBL Bar 9.1 – Channel Soundbar System with Surround Speakers and Dolby Atmos is built for that jump. It brings real surround sound into the room, fills out the low end, and adds overhead effects that make rain feel like it is falling around you. If your shows and sports have been sounding a little flat, this system is a major step up without turning your space into a maze of gear.

Head over to Amazon to get the JBL Bar 9.1 – Channel Soundbar System with Surround Speakers and Dolby Atmos for just $700, down from its usual price of $1,200. That's a discount of $500 and 42% off.

Setup is refreshingly simple. Slide the soundbar under the TV, place the wireless subwoofer by a wall, and set the two rear speakers behind the couch. The rears are battery powered and detach from the main bar, so you can pop them on a shelf for movie night and dock them to charge when you are done. No wires across the floor is a win for families, pets, and tidy living rooms.

Once everything is in place, the sound shifts from “coming from the TV” to “coming from the room.” Dialog gets the clear center it needs, and effects spread wide so action scenes feel active. Dolby Atmos support adds height to the mix. Helicopters seem to pass overhead, stadium noise rolls in from all sides, and quiet details stay easy to hear at normal volume. The subwoofer brings punch without boom, so drum hits and thunder land with a satisfying thump that does not drown out voices.

Everyday use is friendly. A quick calibration listens to your room and dials in the balance in a minute. HDMI eARC keeps setup to a single cable for most modern TVs, and the bar automatically switches inputs when you turn on a game console or streaming box. For music, you can send playlists straight from a phone with Bluetooth, or use built in casting to play from favorite apps without extra steps. The remote is straightforward, and basic controls on the bar handle volume and source when the clicker goes missing.

If you have been waiting to upgrade from thin TV audio to theater style sound without a complicated receiver, this package hits the sweet spot for simplicity and impact. The JBL Bar 9.1 – Channel Soundbar System with Surround Speakers and Dolby Atmos is still available for $700 at Amazon, a strong savings compared with its regular $1,200 price.

It's a figure so large it almost loses meaning: $500 billion. That is the staggering valuation OpenAI, the company behind the revolutionary ChatGPT, could soon command. The company is in discussions with investors for a deal that would allow its current and former employees to sell their privately held shares, a source familiar with the matter told Gizmodo.

This type of deal, known in financial jargon as a secondary sale or a tender offer, would more than double OpenAI's recent $260 billion valuation, catapulting Sam Altman's company into the same league as legacy titans like Costco. The news, first reported by The Information and Bloomberg, confirms the AI craze isn't slowing down. But more importantly, it reveals OpenAI's secret weapon in the brutal war for talent that is defining Silicon Valley.

For the company's employees, it means a massive payday is coming. For its rivals, it's a clear signal that OpenAI is willing to pay any price to keep its geniuses in-house.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.

To understand why a private company is suddenly worth half a trillion dollars, you have to look beyond its technology and focus on its people. The world of elite AI research is remarkably small, and companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are locked in a fierce battle to recruit and retain the few hundred minds capable of building the next generation of AI.

Recently, this talent war has intensified, with Meta aggressively poaching top AI researchers from OpenAI, reportedly offering salaries well into the millions. How can OpenAI compete with guaranteed multi-million dollar paychecks? By turning its employees' stock options into real, life-altering wealth.

According to the source, OpenAI and potential investors, including Thrive Capital (founded by Josh Kushner, Jared Kushner's brother), are discussing a deal that would let employees and alumni sell their stock. Based on past sales, many OpenAI staffers could pocket anywhere from $2 million to $10 million each, depending on their equity.

This is the power of “golden handcuffs.” An engineer might be tempted by a rival's massive salary, but it's much harder to walk away when your current company is allowing you to cash out millions while your remaining stock continues to skyrocket in value. The deal transforms “paper wealth” into a tangible fortune, creating a powerful incentive to stay and see how much higher the valuation can climb.

This financial maneuver comes as OpenAI is on a tear. The company's annualized revenue has nearly doubled to $12 billion in just a few months, driven by the massive adoption of ChatGPT and its enterprise products. OpenAI also recently secured $8.3 billion in new investment commitments as part of a larger $40 billion funding round.

This massive influx of capital is a war chest. Investors are betting that OpenAI is poised for even bigger things, with the highly anticipated launch of GPT-5 expected in the coming weeks. A powerful new model could give it a decisive edge over its main rivals, including Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude.

This financial muscle will allow OpenAI to accelerate its research, acquire complementary technologies, and invest in the incredibly expensive computing power needed to train more advanced models. At a time when all major players are in a race to build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—AI systems smarter than humans—OpenAI now has the resources to lead the pack.

But such a high valuation also raises the stakes. OpenAI will be under immense pressure to deliver on the transformative potential its valuation implies, all while navigating the complex ethical and societal challenges that come with creating world-changing technology.

This $500 billion figure confirms OpenAI is the undisputed face of the AI revolution. But it also raises a fundamental question. The company was founded as a non-profit dedicated to ensuring AI benefits all of humanity. Now, it operates as a hyper-capitalist rocket ship, fueled by venture capital and creating immense wealth for a select few.

Does the future of AI belong to investors chasing returns and the engineers cashing in, or is there still room for the original mission of building something for everyone? As OpenAI's valuation soars into the stratosphere, that question becomes more urgent than ever.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","OpenAI Really Wants the U.S. Government to Use ChatGPT","https://gizmodo.com/openai-really-wants-the-u-s-government-to-use-chatgpt-2000639753","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 06:13:47 GMT","

OpenAI just struck a deal to give every federal executive branch agency access to ChatGPT Enterprise over the next year for just $1.

In a blog post, OpenAI said the deal is meant to advance a key pillar of the Trump administration's AI Action Plan by making advanced AI tools widely available across the federal government to cut down on paperwork and bureaucracy. The White House unveiled the plan in July, outlining efforts to accelerate AI adoption, expand data center infrastructure, and promote American AI abroad.

“One of the best ways to make sure AI works for everyone is to put it in the hands of the people serving our country,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in a press release. “We're proud to partner with the General Services Administration (GSA), delivering on President Trump's AI Action Plan, to make ChatGPT available across the federal government, helping public servants deliver for the American people.”

At the same time, the deal could also give OpenAI an edge over its rivals by incentivizing government agencies to choose its models over competing ones. On Tuesday, the GSA added ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Anthropic's Claude to a government purchasing system, making it easier for agencies to buy and use these models.

In addition to the steep discount, the partnership gives government agencies access to tools and training to help them learn how to use ChatGPT. OpenAI has already created a dedicated user community for government workers and is offering tailored introductory workshops through its OpenAI Academy.

OpenAI also assured that government data, including both inputs and outputs, will not be used to train or improve its models.

The company touted that in a recent pilot program, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania employees using ChatGPT saved an average of about 95 minutes per day on routine tasks.

Back in January, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov, a tailored version of ChatGPT designed for government workers. At the time, OpenAI reported that more than 90,000 users across over 3,500 federal, state, and local government agencies had sent more than 18 million messages on ChatGPT. The company highlighted how some agencies have already been using ChatGPT, including the Air Force Research Laboratory⁠, which uses it for administrative tasks, and Los Alamos National Laboratory for scientific research.

The move also comes as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been increasingly cozying up with the Trump Administration. Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, Altman joined Trump for a press conference and had a lengthy one-on-one meeting in June. During a dinner at Trump's New Jersey golf club that month, Trump called Altman “a very brilliant man.”

As a company, there are lots of things you can do when people are upset with your product. You could offer concessions (discounts in an effort to drive demand), swap your CEO (that's a statement and a vibe shift), or you could pledge to do better and actually fix issues making people upset (imagine that!). One thing I would not recommend doing when times are tough, however, is raising prices, but Sonos seems to have been forced into this exact scenario.

According to Sonos' newish CEO, Tom Conrad, tariffs for the Trump administration are—as they are for many companies—creeping in, and naturally, that's going to result in higher prices for its already expensive audio gear. Per Bloomberg, Conrad said in the latest quarterly earnings report that “it has become clear that we'll need to raise prices on certain products later this year.” Which products? We don't know for sure, but that's not great considering how things have been going for Sonos lately.

First, there was an app disaster that actually ended up delaying product launches in 2024 and led to Sonos swapping CEOs from Patrick Spence to Conrad. As if that wasn't bad enough, this week Sonos also admitted that a “very low” number of speakers were overheating. By overheating, I mean they were getting so hot that USB-C ports melted. I'm no expert, but I'm going to go ahead and say that it looks like a bit of a fire hazard.

There's also the fact, as I mentioned, that Sonos-branded products are also already fairly expensive to begin with. Its Ace headphones, for example, are $400, which is still cheaper than AirPods Max but more than competitors like Nothing and its Headphone 1, which sells for $300. Also, you need a Sonos soundbar to get the most out of those headphones and its TV audio swap feature. Similarly, Sonos' Move 2 speakers—a portable Bluetooth speaker—cost $450, which eclipses even the premium of Bose's newest SoundLink Plus. What wiggle room Sonos has for those products is unclear, but it seems to me that raising prices on those gadgets might be a risky maneuver.

Sonos, for its part, seems to recognize that, and according to Bloomberg, Conrad says that price hikes will vary across different categories. Listen, I don't mean to single Sonos out here because tariffs are having wide-reaching effects across lots of different categories, tech and non-tech alike, but I'd be lying if I said this squeeze doesn't feel particularly ill-timed. One thing is for sure: if prices balloon further, Sonos will put its brand loyalty to the test in a way it's never done before.

President Donald Trump called for Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan to resign from his role in a post on his Truth Social account.""The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,"" Trump wrote. ""There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!""Trump's post comes after Republican Sen, Tom Cotton of Arkansas has called for scrutiny of Tan's ties to China. In a letter to Frank D. Yeary, chairman of Intel's board, Cotton raised alarms about connections to Chinese companies that are linked to the country's military and the Chinese Communist Party. These include Cadence Design Systems, where Tan previously served as CEO. Cotton also questioned Tan's ability to be a ""responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars"" for the company's nearly $8 billion CHIPS Act grant.Cotton also asked Yeary whether Tan was required to divest from any holdings in Chinese companies with ties to the country, Communist Party, or military. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company told Reuters on Wednesday that ""Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem."" Tan took the top job at Intel in March, succeeding outgoing CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan has enacted a sweeping set of measures to reduce costs, including thousands of layoffs, a return-to-office mandate, cut plans to build fabs, and plans to spin off parts of the company that aren't core to its engineering mission. Yesterday, Trump rattled the semiconductor industry when he called for a 100% tariff on chips, albeit with a loophole for companies that are building and investing in the United States.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

President Donald Trump just announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors in a bid to force companies to build their chips within the United States or order them from local fabs. According to the Associated Press, Trump made this announcement at the Oval Office after Apple's Tim Cook promised an additional $100 billion in investments to avoid chip tariffs for iPhones.

“We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge,” says Trump. When a reporter asked him how all of these announced investments would impact the American people, the president answered, “We have the biggest chip companies — the both of them — but we have the biggest in the world coming in. They're going to Arizona and beyond. And in a short period of time, we'll be [making] up to almost 50% of the chips, starting from nothing.”

TSMC has already started production at its Arizona fab, with Apple, one of its first customers, expecting to source over 19 billion chips from local chip manufacturing. The chip manufacturer says that demand for its capacity is so high that it's already sold out through 2027, meaning companies that need chips will have to find another provider. Thankfully, Samsung's new Texas fab is also nearing completion, with the company reportedly delaying its completion due to a lack of customers.

These massive new facilities were built under the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, jumpstarting the production of some of the most advanced semiconductors in the U.S. Nevertheless, Trump's tariff threats have forced these companies and more to expand their investments, allowing him to secure about $1.5 trillion in commitments for building and expanding the chip making supply chain within America's borders.

However, we're still unsure if the output of these new fabs, and all of the existing ones, would be enough to deliver what the American industry needs. Aside from the massive demand brought about by the seismic AI infrastructure buildout being done by tech giants, nearly every other everyday item we take for granted now requires chips— from cars and appliances to light bulbs and switches.

If companies are forced to import chips at elevated rates, the American consumer will end up paying more, driving inflation and reducing demand. We also need to see more details about how the tariff exemptions will work. At the moment, the president says that he won't put a tariff on companies that are buying (or building) locally-made semiconductors and importing them as well — but how many chips should a company buy and use for it to be exempted from the import tax?

When Framework built its first laptop, it was with the ethos of a desktop: repairable, customizable, and upgradable when new parts came out. Now, Framework has a desktop of its own.

But the Framework Desktop ($1,599 as tested before a myriad of components and add-ons), isn't a traditional PC by any means. Using an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 “Strix Halo” APU with soldered RAM, the customization options on this desktop are limited to storage, Wi-Fi, your case fan, and some decorative elements. The soldered RAM is effectively required for the bandwidth this system needs, and the mix of powerful graphics and plentiful RAM is why Framework is pushing this as an AI system. The Desktop has a ton of charm, from its 4.5-liter size to its surprising power with the right configuration. But it's also very expensive compared to the best gaming PCs in its price range, and if you don't use all of the RAM, you might be better off with a cheaper system.

The Framework Desktop is really small. It's a 4.5-liter Mini-ITX system that will fit on even the small desks.

The system is a plain, black case. Ours came with a black side panel, though there is a $40 window option (see configurations, below). Since we weren't using a fan with RGB, I was fine with the opaque panel. The side panels are plastic with some metal shielding inside, while the top panel is entirely plastic.

Most of the system comes pre-installed in the box. The motherboard is already installed, and since it's using a soldered CPU and RAM, those are there, too. The heatsink comes mounted to the board, and the 400-watt FlexATX power supply is already all hooked up. When Framework refers to this as a ""DIY"" system, it really means removing the side panel and the top, installing an SSD and a fan, and boom, complete system. That took me less than 20 minutes, and Framework has a handy step-by-step guide on its website. The hardest part is plugging in the fan header on the motherboard (and I suppose, the RGB header if your fan supports it), which requires some nimble finger placement.



The system comes with a screwdriver that has both a Phillips and Torx head. Its primary difference from the company's Laptop screwdriver is that it's far longer, letting you get into the case to install your SSD.Our review unit came with an early version of a carrying handle, but that's not available to the public just yet. I didn't carry the desktop around the office too much, but it sure looks cute. Otherwise, the top is held on by two thumbscrews.



The upgrade potential on this system is limited. On the left side, you can put in your primary storage drive and add a fan of your choosing to the heatsink. Open the right side of the chassis and the reverse side of the motherboard has a second M.2 slot for storage, as well as access to the AMD RZ717 Wi-Fi 7 card.

That fan and heatsink serve as all of the cooling for the system. The heatsink is sizeable, with six copper heatpipes, aluminum fins, and Honeywell PTM7958 thermal paste. The desktop comes with a mounting kit to attach a 120mm fan. The fan sucks cool air in through perforations in the side of the case.

On the front of the desktop, there is room for a 92 mm fan. The tooling is there, and there's also a second fan header on the motherboard. A company rep told me that ""Framework originally put a placeholder for a slim fan there. They learned quickly that the main CPU/system fan provides enough cooling for the whole system.""



One thing you can change to your heart's content: the front ports on the case. There are two slots for Framework's expansion cards — the same pick-your-port adapters that it uses on its laptops. I stuck one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port, which accommodates most of the accessories I use every day, though I could see some people picking a 3.5 mm headphone jack for gaming, as the permanent one is on the back of the system. Other choices include SD or microSD card slots, an Ethernet jack, or extra USB-C connected storage.The expansion cards will be very welcome for those who already have a Framework Laptop, as you can mix and match. But using the adapters on the desktop shows its limits. You can only have two ports of your choosing due to the width of the expansion cards. Just by eyeballing it, it's clear Framework could have fit more ports on without the cards.



The rest of the ports are on the rear, attached to the motherboard. They're plentiful. There are two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a pair of USB4 Type-C ports, HDMI 2.1, two DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, Ethernet, and a headphone jack.

On the front of the system, there's a magnetic frame meant to hold 21 tiles, which are Framework's way of adding personalization to the system. I wish Framework included a blank set with purchase, but you have to buy them separately. Otherwise you'll have gaps in the front of the system.

The tiles highlight Framework's maker roots and allow for tons of different customization options. On the other hand, they look kind of cheap and feel like something that came from a 3D printer. I would have preferred an option to use a single colored sheet, perhaps matching some of the colors Framework uses for its Laptop bezels.

At 8.9 x 8.09 x 3.81 inches, the Framework Desktop is quite small for a desktop. It's got some graphics chops, but it's more in the range of Apple's Mac Mini (5 x 5 x 2 inches, no upgradeability) than classic gaming desktops. For instance, the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme is 9.3 x 19.5 x 18.1 inches and the Acer Predator Orion 5000 measures 19.09 x 18.98 x 8.62 inches.

One thing is missing from the Framework Desktop: a list of the names of the people in the company. In its laptops, you get a list of everyone who worked on them printed inside the chassis. That's not the case here.

The Radeon Strix 8060S graphics on the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 are impressive. The chip, often referred to by its ""Strix Halo"" codename, features 40 compute units and shares our system's 64GB of RAM with the CPU. Yes, you can game on these integrated graphics, no question.

As a challenge, I booted up Alan Wake 2. While I got a VRAM error message, I pressed on without issue. On the medium graphics preset with no ray tracing, FSR enabled, and a 720p render with upscaling to 1080p, the game saw the titular hero explore a nightmare New York at between 73 and 78 frames per second. The game also ran at high settings, but dropped below 60 FPS.

Death Stranding, too, played well (and better understood the shared RAM situation). At 1080p, on the very high preset, I carried packages between 124 - 132 FPS. Even at 4K, the game ran between 41-50 FPS at the most demanding settings. For most intense games, though, this is a solid 1080p rig.Our benchmarks, which are typically run on discrete graphics cards, are run at quite demanding settings. Some of them may appear unplayable, but if you turn some settings down, you can get the Framework Desktop to playability territory. Here, we're comparing the Framework to other gaming desktops, and, unsurprisingly, the larger, more traditional systems won out in most tests. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme has an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti, while the older Acer Predator Orion 5000 used an RTX 4070 Super. Both of them, however, are within the range of what our configuration of the Framework Desktop in terms of cost.

On Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the Framework Desktop ran the game at 87 FPS on the highest settings at 1080p. It also excelled on CPU-heavy games like Far Cry 6 at ultra settings (83 FPS) and Borderlands 3 on the ""badass"" preset (103 fps.) The game performed passably on Red Dead Redemption 2 at medium settings (57 fps). It only faltered on Cyberpunk 2077's challenging Ray Tracing Ultra preset.

To stress test gaming PCs, we run the Metro Exodus benchmark 15 times on a loop using the RTX preset to simulate about half an hour of gameplay. Across the runs, the game ran at an average of 51 frames per second. You might want to turn off the ray tracing, though – the average minimum 99th percentile frame rate was 24 fps. During the test, the Ryzen chip, which includes the graphics, ran at 66.46 degrees Celsius.

Sure, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is a mobile chip in a desktop's clothes, but with 64GB of RAM and a fast 1TB SSD, the system can compete with some recent gaming desktops we've tested when it comes to productivity.

On Geekbench 6, the Framework Desktop notched a single-core score of 2,966 and achieved a multi-core score of 17,574. The CyberPowerPC and its AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D outperformed, as did the Mac Mini with M4 Pro, (3,880 and 22,661, the highest of the group). But the Framework surpassed the Acer Predator Orion 5000 and its Intel Core i7-14700F.

The file transfer speed on your Framework Desktop will depend heavily on which drive you choose. With the 1TB WD Black SN7100 that Framework sells alongside the Desktop, we saw it blaze through our file transfer test at a rate of 2,976.46 MBps, handily surpassing everything else on our test. The Mac Mini was the next closest, at 2,237.31 MBps.It took the Framework Desktop 2 minutes and 43 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p on Handbrake. Only the Predator beat it at 2:40, while the Mac came in at 2:47.

You can't overclock the Strix Halo chip. Framework's BIOS doesn't have options for it, and installing Ryzen Master doesn't work. It throws up an error stating that the chip isn't supported and that the software can't be installed.

Throughout my time with the Framework Desktop, I felt a sort of dissonance. I've always enjoyed the amount of tinkering I get to do with the company's laptops.With the Desktop, it's far more limited. In a way, using a soldered CPU and RAM feels antithetical to Framework's entire ethos of choice, repairability, and upgradeability. Framework says there's a reason for that, though. ""To enable the massive 256GB/s memory bandwidth that Ryzen AI Max delivers, the LPDDR5x is soldered,"" a Framework blog post announcing the desktop reads. “We spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn't technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus. Because the memory is non-upgradeable, we're being deliberate in making memory pricing more reasonable than you might find with other brands.""

Framework made the choice to use Ryzen's AI Max processors anyway. If you want replaceable memory, though, there are hundreds of other gaming and productivity PCs on the market with that option. And, of course, you can still build your own.

I've reduced this dissonance by thinking of the system more like a Mac Mini that is bigger because it is upgradeable. Still, that may not satisfy some diehards, who see the company's laptops as more repairable than its desktop.

There is one part that feels very Framework. The company is selling the mainboard and every single component — including the case — individually and separately. This should allow for all sorts of projects (Framework has suggested the use of multiple mainboards for LLM racks to run models).

The Framework Desktop comes free of any manufacturer-provided bloatware, and it's refreshing. The only mark against it is a link to the Framework Marketplace in the Start menu's application list in Windows 11.

If you use Windows like I did, you will still get some shortcuts you don't want, like a pinned link to download a local LinkedIn app, but nothing major.

Framework sells its Desktop with a one-year warranty.

We tested the $1,599 variant of the Framework Desktop, pairing a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 64GB of RAM. With our review unit, Framework included a 1TB WD Black SN7100 ($99), a Cooler Master Mobius 120 CPU fan ($22), a power cable ($5), two USB Type-C and two USB Type-A expansion cards ($11 each), and three sets of tiles (two $10 black sets and a $15 red set, plus a custom Tom's Hardware tile, which you can't really put a price on), as well as five decal tiles and two blank tiles ($5 each and $3 each, respectively). Add that all up, and it's $1,835. We installed Windows 11 Home on our own, but if Framework included it, the company charges $139 for the download.The cheapest configuration, before any add-ons, is $1,099 with a Ryzen AI Max 385 with lesser Radeon 8050S graphics and 32GB of RAM. The highest step up, and a shoe-in for people interested in local AI, is a $1,999 option with the same processor as our review unit, but with a whopping 128GB of memory.

There are a number of other add-ons. While our review unit came with the standard black side panel, a clear one will cost you $40. Tiles come in various colors, and there are $5 options with logos for AMD and a number of Linux distros. While I think that expansion cards with USB Type-A and Type-C make the most sense for the expansion slots, Framework sells all of the same options it has for its website, including storage, Ethernet, and a microSD card slot, should you want them. I feel that the desktop should come with a set of blank tiles; it's an incomplete system without the front of the chassis.There are a variety of fan and storage options, though you can also bring your own instead of paying Framework. Those are the only two major components that you can change out, so they're important choices.

I think the fact that Framework charges for the power cable for a desktop is kind of obnoxious. Enthusiasts may have extras, but this isn't a phone where everyone has extra cheap cables around their house. For a system, this should come in the box.

The Framework Desktop offers a lot of power for a small system. AMD's Strix Halo shows off in Framework's 4.5-liter case, delivering strong 1080p gaming performance for a system that doesn't have a discrete GPU. You can have a solid 1080p system that fits on your desk and doesn't get in the way.But the system doesn't feel entirely like Framework. The fact that it's less repairable and upgradeable than the company's laptops is odd, but it's the cost of using a mobile processor, which is soldered to the board, along with soldered RAM (which is effectively necessary for the chip the team chose). It's not wrong, but it will likely make the system less appealing for many potential buyers who aren't specifically interested in AI.



Despite all of that, I've become enamored with the system during my time with it. It's versatile, small, and surprisingly powerful for its size. Despite its plastic casing, it's pretty cute.

The real issue is price. For the $1,599 our review unit starts at — before all of the components and an OS, you can get a decent gaming PC with a discrete GPU. For over $1,800 as ours was configured, you can get a nice one. So if you're going for gaming, a bigger machine with more traditional desktop pieces makes more sense, and will be more customizable down the line, too. (It may, however, have less RAM.) I don't fault Framework for offering a DIY edition to its enthusiast-forward fanbase, but I do think its pricing should consider everything you need to add. That's before you get nickeled and dimed with effectively mandatory tiles for the front of the chassis.In competition with something like the Mac Mini, you can really only compare to Apple's most expensive configuration with a 12-core M4 Pro CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD storage for $1,399. Bumping to 1TB of storage and 64GB of RAM is a minimum of $2,199, so while the Mac is a huge budget for light productivity starting at $599, it isn't necessarily a budget competitor on the high end. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999 with an M4 Max and 36GB of RAM.That leaves the Framework in a place as a solid small system for people who need a ton of RAM. There's a reason the company has pitched it for running local LLM's — that's who the system makes the most sense for. If you're going to make use of this much RAM with a mobile CPU and a tiny chassis, there may be value here, as well as the fun of putting parts of the system together yourself. But for everyone else, a stronger gaming rig or a cheaper productivity system might do the job — and will come with everything you need out of the box.

The antiseizure medication pregabalin, which is commonly prescribed for chronic pain, has been linked to an increased risk for heart failure (HF), particularly in those with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), new data suggested.

In a cohort of more than 240,000 Medicare beneficiaries with noncancer chronic pain, initiation of pregabalin was associated with a 48% higher risk for new-onset HF overall and an 85% higher risk in those with a history of CVD than initiation of gabapentin.

The study was published online on August 1 in JAMA Network Open.

Chronic pain affects up to 30% of adults aged 65 years or older. Nonopioid medications, such as the gabapentinoids pregabalin and gabapentin, are widely prescribed for chronic pain, the investigators, led by Elizabeth Park, MD, Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City, noted.

Pregabalin has greater potency than gabapentin in binding to the α2δ subunit of the L-type calcium channel and therefore may be associated with an increased risk for HF through actions to cause sodium/water retention.

To investigate further, investigators evaluated 246,237 Medicare beneficiaries between 2014 and 2018, including 18,622 (8%) new pregabalin users and 227,615 (92%) new gabapentin users. All patients were aged 65-89 years, had chronic noncancer pain, and had no history of HF.

The researchers used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for an extensive list of 231 covariates to reduce confounding and attempted to closely emulate a hypothetical target trial in which Medicare patients filled new prescriptions for pregabalin or gabapentin for noncancer pain.

During 114,113 person-years of follow-up, 1470 patients had a hospital admission or emergency department visit for HF. The rate of HF per 1000 person-years was 18.2 for pregabalin and 12.5 — translating to roughly six additional HF events annually for every 1000 patients treated with pregabalin — with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48.

The difference was even more pronounced in patients with a history of CVD, with an adjusted HR of 1.85. An increased risk for outpatient HF diagnoses was also seen (adjusted HR, 1.27), but there was no difference in all-cause mortality between groups.

The authors said the findings further support current recommendations from the European Medicines Agency to exercise caution when prescribing pregabalin to older adults with CVD.

The American Heart Association currently lists pregabalin, but not gabapentin, as a medication that may cause or exacerbate HF.

The co-authors of an invited commentary noted that the study provides “timely and clinically relevant insights” into the cardiovascular safety of these two widely used gabapentinoids.

From a clinical standpoint, the findings have “immediate clinical implications,” wrote Robert Zhang, MD, with Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, and Edo Birati, MD, Tzafon (Poriya) Medical Center, Poriya, Israel.

For older adults with chronic pain, particularly those with CVD, “clinicians should weigh the potential cardiovascular risks associated with pregabalin against its analgesic benefits. This is particularly relevant given the growing use of gabapentinoids in older populations and ongoing polypharmacy issues in this age group,” Zhang and Birati advised.

“Furthermore, if pregabalin use is associated with new-onset HF, it raises the possibility that the drug may unmask underlying subclinical cardiovascular disease, which suggests a need for careful cardiac evaluation prior to prescribing this medication,” they added.

“The study serves as an important reminder that not all gabapentinoids are created equal and that in the pursuit of safer pain control, vigilance for unintended harms remains paramount,” the investigators concluded.

The study had no commercial funding. The authors and editorial writers reported having no relevant disclosures.

Men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who initiated SGLT2 inhibitors showed nearly double the risk for phimosis after 1 year of treatment than those who initiated GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). This elevated risk persisted for over 8 years of follow-up.

""Increased genital infections due to glucosuria in SGLT2i [SGLT2 inhibitor] users might therefore contribute to the elevated risks of both phimosis and penile cancer. Of note, any such risk must be weighed against the clear beneficial effects of SGLT2i on cardiovascular risk and overall mortality,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Christine Ljungberg, Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on July 30, 2025, in Diabetes Care.

Detection bias may have affected the findings as SGLT2 inhibitor users are more likely to develop urogenital symptoms, potentially resulting in more frequent urologic assessments. This study identified few cases of penile cancer, limiting statistical precision for this outcome, and the median follow-up duration of 4 years may have been insufficient for thoroughly assessing the risk for penile cancer. This study lacked information on covariates such as BMI, circumcision status, ethnic diversity, socioeconomic factors, and lifestyle behaviours.

This study was supported by Aarhus University. Some authors reported giving presentations and lectures on medical research (with or without compensation), receiving research support, teaching healthcare professionals, and having other ties with various pharmaceutical companies.

Interclass biologic switching is effective and safe in patients with psoriasis, though switching from an anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF)-alpha to an anti-interleukin (IL)-17A treatment was associated with higher risk for adverse events (AEs), according to a meta-analysis.

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that “interclass biologic switching was effective, and there were no safety differences for most patients,” the study authors wrote. “Switching to anti-IL-23p19, anti-IL-17A, or anti-IL-12/23p40 agents from anti-TNF-alpha agents posed the greatest risk of infection,” they added, recommending “vigilance for infections while switching to different biologics.”

The study was led by Miao Zhang, MD, Department of Dermatology, Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China, and was published online on August 6 in JAMA Dermatology.

Limitations included heterogeneity in study designs, potential differences between biologics and batch variability which could have affected effectiveness comparisons after switching, insufficient data for several comparisons.

Caregivers living in rural areas reported poorer general and physical health and were more likely to smoke and have obesity than caregivers in urban areas, according to a recent analysis.

“This study is extremely valuable for members of rural communities as it allows policy makers to better understand the landscape of caregiving amongst minoritized rural residents and help program developers design and implement initiatives for rural caregivers,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Emma Kathryn Boswell, MPH, of the University of South Carolina Rural Health Research Center at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. It was published online on June 13, 2025, in The Journal of Rural Health.

The reliance on self-reported data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System may have introduced recall and social desirability bias. The cross-sectional design limited the ability to determine cause-and-effect relationships between caregiving and health outcomes.

This research did not receive any specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Individuals with overweight or obesity have a higher risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) than those with normal weight. Nearly one fourth of the increased risk with obesity is mediated by comorbid conditions, whereas the remaining risk is directly mediated by obesity.

""Effective management of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia could help to achieve a meaningful reduction in the proportion of AF cases attributable to obesity. At the same time, the persistent direct effect of BMI on AF, despite adjustment for comorbidities, indicates that weight reduction must remain a central focus of preventive strategies,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Jamschid Sedighi, MD, Justus-Liebig-University in Giessen, Germany. It was published online in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.

BMI was measured only at baseline; thus, associations reflect initial BMI rather than changes over time. Confounding factors may have remained. Reliance on diagnostic codes may have underestimated the cases of paroxysmal or asymptomatic AF. 

No specific study funding was reported. Two authors disclosed receiving speaker/consulting honoraria from AstraZeneca and Pfizer, and one also received honoraria from additional sources including Novartis, Berlin-Chemie, and Lilly.

Comparing metagenomic profiles of the skin microbiome in immunosuppressed patients and those at high and low risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) revealed distinct expansions in fungal and viral taxa in the first two groups, according to the authors of a recent research letter reporting the results. Such differences one day may help clinicians identify patients at high SCC risk, they added.

Currently, physicians identify patients at high SCC risk based on whether they have had several prior SCCs. Analyzing skin microbiome changes to identify patients at high SCC risk before they develop several SCCs could revolutionize dermatologic care, senior author and investigator, Shadmehr Demehri, MD, PhD, said in an interview. He is the Arthur and Sandra Irving Endowed Chair in Cancer Immunology and director of the High Risk Skin Cancer Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Although age, ultraviolet exposure, and immunosuppression are well-known SCC risk factors, Demehri said, the skin microbiome's contribution to SCC risk remains unclear. To explore this issue, he and his coinvestigators conducted comparative metagenomic analyses of skin microbiomes from 30 patients: six with high SCC risk (> 2 prior SCCs), nine with low SCC risk (≤ 2 prior SCCs), and 15 solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). The results were published online in July in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Using swabs from six bilateral anatomical sites per patient, with air swabs as negative controls, the investigators performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and differential-abundance analyses to compare relative taxa populations across patient groups. After an analysis of 249 metagenomes, high-risk individuals had the highest mean SCC count (11.8), followed by SOTRs (8.73) and low-risk individuals (0.33).

“Compared with low‐risk SCC subjects,” Demehri added, “both solid organ transplant recipients and high‐risk SCC subjects showed higher relative abundances of eukaryotes, such as Malassezia restricta and M globosa, and viruses such as Betapapillomavirus.” Moreover, these taxa showed robust differences and strong discriminatory power between patient groups, indicating their potential utility as signatures of elevated SCC risk, he told Medscape Medical News.

Currently, it remains unclear whether the relative expansion of certain skin microbiome components directly drives SCC pathogenesis or reflects underlying immune alterations that raise SCC risk indirectly. And despite the eukaryotic expansions observed in the high-risk and SOTR groups, researchers saw no between-group differences in Malassezia-related conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis. Yet subclinical expansions in Malassezia and viral taxa still may translate into increased SCC risk, Demehri said.

Accordingly, he said, dermatologists must not assume that people who develop certain viral and fungal skin diseases are at higher risk for SCC. “It's more subtle changes, probably in association with other microbiome changes, that seem to be associated with skin cancer risk.” Nonetheless, Demehri said, watching for skin conditions that signify an expanded skin microbiome — such as the appearance of warts in fair-skinned adults — may signal the need to monitor for SCC risk.

Leachman, MD, PhD, professor and vice-chair of faculty development in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, said that although the study requires replication in larger, prospective cohorts, its findings are provocative for several reasons. She was not involved with the study but was asked to comment.

Dermatologists are starting to embrace the skin microbiome concept but rarely beyond bacteria and yeasts, Leachman told Medscape Medical News. “I don't believe most dermatologists are thinking about papillomaviruses being commensal: present on your skin as a normal part of your microbiome,' she said. The observation that baseline papillomavirus populations can exist on normal-appearing skin without causing pathology is important information, she added. “What is their purpose there? What's the evolutionary advantage?”

A study published in Cancer Cell in January 2025 showed that commensal papillomaviruses can boost immune surveillance and clearing of UV-induced p53-mutant keratinocytes. “It appears that the commensal papillomavirus population may help to stimulate the immune system in a way that helps the immune response against skin cancer,” Leachman said.

Papillomaviruses work primarily through p53. “So if you've developed an immune reaction against a p53 element of the papillomavirus,” Leachman said, “there's a possibility that might cross-react with abnormalities of the p53 pathway in squamous cell carcinomas and act like a mini-vaccine against the tumor. And if that's true, could you do that intentionally as a therapeutic or prevention strategy?”

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have proven highly effective in preventing cervical cancer. However, she said, based on the results of commensal HPVs protecting against SCC, it is unclear whether elimination of commensals by the vaccine could render some women more or less susceptible to SCC later in life.

“If those papillomavirus vaccines cross-react, and you're diminishing the commensal papillomaviruses that are helpful in recognizing squamous cell carcinoma,” she asked, “are you going to have people who experience an idiosyncratic increase in squamous carcinoma because the HPV vaccine prevents development of a robust commensal population of helpful papillomaviruses? I don't believe anyone has even examined alterations of commensal HPV populations following vaccination.” 

One of the study's most tantalizing findings requiring further follow-up, Leachman said, is that the nonimmunosuppressed high-risk group (median age, 78.5 years) was much older than the low-risk group (63.0 years). “That says there's probably some sort of functional immunosuppression occurring in those high-risk people.”

As baby boomers age, Leachman added, the population with immune-system senescence will grow. “If you can use solid organ transplant recipients as a model for the aging population that is becoming functionally immunosuppressed, that would be very beneficial, to know how to tailor treatments, detection methods, and even potential risk evaluation methods for these people.”

Anecdotally, Leachman has identified a group of patients with what she calls systemic “skin failure” — elderly patients at an extremely high SCC risk who routinely have multiple skin cancers and precancers excised. “Generally, those people are older and have an apparent functional immunosuppression; in my hands, they seem to respond better to topical imiquimod than topical 5-fluorouracil.”

Based on years of clinical observation, she prescribes topical immunotherapy rather than topical chemotherapy depending on patient age and the number and (wart-like) appearance of their SCCs.

In the interview, Demehri said that although it might be tempting to try and alter the skin microbiome through supplements or topical agents, nothing in the study suggests a cause-and-effect relationship such that modifying the microbiome would directly affect SCC risk. Therefore, he said that along with SCC detection and monitoring, immunosuppression and its role in skin cancer development should receive more emphasis.

Presently, Demehri's lab is exploring ways to detect and monitor microbiome changes more feasibly than through costly shotgun sequencing. “It's not something we can do for every patient all the time to monitor their skin. But there are ways we could extract that information more directly from the skin by swabs and then inform the physician that the patient might be at risk of cancer as well because their microbiome is being altered in ways that are associated with increased risk.” Broad adoption of such techniques, he estimated, is perhaps a few years away.

This study was supported partly by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) at the National Institutes of Health. Study coauthors were from the Center for Cancer Immunology and the Cutaneous Biology Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and from the NHGRI and NIAMS. Demehri had filed a patent for the development of T cell-directed anticancer vaccines against commensal viruses. Other authors had no disclosures. Leachman is an investigator or advisor for several companies involved in screening and early diagnosis of melanoma but reported no relevant financial relationships.

Antibiotic resistance in the environment is a growing and largely overlooked crisis receiving inconsistent attention, that may very well have dire consequences for human health, according to a new study led by the University of Surrey.

The comprehensive review, published in Environment International, researched 13,000 studies from 1990 to 2021 to identify patterns and gaps in the topic area. The team identified 738 studies that focused strictly on non-built, non-industrial environments, such as rivers, fields and air.

The researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are most often detected in freshwater and soil, particularly in places exposed to pollution from wastewater or manure. Two bacteria - Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas - were the most studied organisms, while genes conferring resistance to medicines including sulphonamides, tetracyclines and beta-lactams, were very prominent.

Worryingly, very few studies have explored how antibiotic resistance spreads in the air, oceans or green spaces. The team also highlighted a lack of research in low-income regions, where the health burden of antibiotic resistance is likely to be highest.

Despite a growing body of research, our study confirms that we know frighteningly little about how antibiotic resistance behaves in certain regions and environmental contexts. This is a silent emergency, and unless the scientific community works quickly to plug this knowledge gap, we risk letting antibiotic resistance spread unchecked in places we're not appropriately monitoring.""

Dr. Brian Gardner, Research Fellow in Computational Biology, University of Surrey

The Surrey team also found that a third of the studies came from China, followed by the United States. But fewer than one percent were led by researchers in low-income countries, such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mali and Uganda, despite these areas facing some of the greatest health risks from antibiotic resistance. Climate change and microplastics were also strikingly absent from the evidence base. While this trend may have shifted in last couple of years, given the rapid evolution of the field, it is unlikely to have changed substantially, leaving critical questions unanswered about how environmental shifts may be accelerating the problem.

Dr. Gianni Lo Iacono, Senior Lecturer in Biostatistics/Epidemiology, University of Surrey, said:

""This research was only possible thanks to the formidable contributions of 55 colleagues, whose expertise and commitment were indispensable. Our findings highlight an urgent need for more research in low-income regions, which face higher risks of antibiotic resistance but are severely underrepresented in current studies. To truly combat antibiotic resistance globally, we must broaden our research scope to include diverse environments and geographic regions, particularly those most vulnerable.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Vitamin D supplementation linked to improved cardiometabolic health","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250806/Vitamin-D-supplementation-linked-to-improved-cardiometabolic-health.aspx","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 03:10:00 GMT","

A latest systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by scientists from institutions across China and the United States has uncovered promising insights into how vitamin D supplementation can significantly impact cardiometabolic health. The study, which was published in Engineering, has implications for tailored therapeutic strategies targeting cardiovascular diseases and related risks.

The comprehensive review analyzed 99 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 17 656 participants. The analysis revealed that vitamin D supplementation, with a median dose of 3320 International Units (IU) per day, was associated with favorable effects on various cardiometabolic risk factors, including reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and fasting blood insulin.

Significantly, the researchers discovered that the benefits of vitamin D supplementation were most pronounced in specific groups: non-Western populations, individuals with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 15.0 ng·mL−1, those with a body mass index (BMI) below 30 kg·m−2, and older individuals aged 50 years or above.

This research underscores the need for personalized vitamin D intervention strategies, taking into account individual characteristics such as ethnocultural background, age, BMI, and baseline vitamin D levels. The findings highlight the potential of longer intervention durations (three months or more) and higher doses to optimize cardiometabolic health outcomes in specific populations.

These findings could lead to significant advancements in preventive medicine and nutritional sciences, potentially leading to the development of more effective public health strategies. By tailoring vitamin D supplementation based on individual characteristics, healthcare providers may improve intervention efficacy and reduce the prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases.

The authors suggest that future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms behind these observed effects and the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation on chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, studies exploring the long-term effects and potential risks associated with high-dose supplementation are warranted.

This landmark study not only provides new insights into the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for cardiometabolic health but also emphasizes the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing these effects. As cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality globally, the findings from this meta-analysis offer a glimmer of hope for more targeted and effective preventive strategies.

The incidence of early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) is rising, yet optimal treatment strategies remain unclear. While adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) has shown survival benefits in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its specific role in EOPC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and surgery remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the clinical benefit of ACT in EOPC patients after NACT.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients from the SEER database (2006–2019) who received NACT followed by curative resection. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance covariates such as tumor, lymph node, metastasis stage, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared between patients with EOPC (<50 years) and average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC, ≥50 years). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors.

After propensity score matching (124 EOPC vs. 124 AOPC), EOPC patients had significantly longer median OS (41.0 vs. 29.0 months, P = 0.042) and CSS (48.0 vs. 30.0 months, P = 0.016). ACT was an independent prognostic factor for EOPC (OS: hazard ratio = 0.495, 95% confidence interval 0.271–0.903, P = 0.022; CSS: hazard ratio = 0.419, 95% confidence interval 0.219–0.803, P = 0.009), but not for AOPC (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that EOPC patients with tumor, lymph node, metastasis stage II disease or those receiving ACT derived the greatest survival benefit.

EOPC patients exhibit superior survival following NACT and surgical resection compared to AOPC, with ACT further enhancing outcomes in this subgroup. These findings support the use of tailored ACT for EOPC and underscore the need for prospective validation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a powerful new tool in training and education, including in the field of neurosurgery. Yet a new study suggests that AI tutoring provides better results when paired with human instruction.

Researchers at the Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) of McGill University are studying how AI and virtual reality (VR) can improve the training and performance of brain surgeons. They simulate brain surgeries using VR, monitor students' performance using AI and provide continuous verbal feedback on how students can improve performance and prevent errors. Previous research has shown that an intelligent tutoring system powered by AI developed at the Centre outperformed expert human teachers, but these instructors were not provided with trainee AI performance data.

In their most recent study, the researchers recruited 87 medical students from four Quebec medical schools and divided them into three groups: one trained with AI-only verbal feedback, one with expert instructor feedback, and one with expert feedback informed by real-time AI performance data. The team recorded the students' performance, including how well and how quickly their surgical skills improved while undergoing the different types of training.

They found that students receiving AI-augmented, personalized feedback from a human instructor outperformed both other groups in surgical performance and skill transfer. This group also demonstrated significantly better risk management for bleeding and tissue injury-two critical measures of surgical expertise. The study suggests that while intelligent tutoring systems can provide standardized, data-driven assessments, the integration of human expertise enhances engagement and ensures that feedback is contextualized and adaptive.

Our findings underscore the importance of human input in AI-driven surgical education. When expert instructors used AI performance data to deliver tailored, real-time feedback, trainees learned faster and transferred their skills more effectively.""

Bianca Giglio, lead study author 

While this study was specific to neurosurgical training, its findings could carry over to other professions where students must acquire highly technical and complex skills in high-pressure environments.

""AI is not replacing educators-it's empowering them,"" added senior author Dr. Rolando Del Maestro, a neurosurgeon and current Director of the Centre, ""by merging AI's analytical power with the critical guidance of experienced instructors, we are moving closer to creating the ""Intelligent Operating Room"" of the future capable of assessing and training learners while minimizing errors during human surgical procedures.""

The study was published in the journal JAMA Surgery on Aug. 6, 2025. It was funded by the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, a Mitacs Accelerate Grant, the Franco Di Giovanni Foundation, Canadian Graduate Scholarships, Le Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé, and a McGill University Max Binz Fellowship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","AI and extended reality successfully train surgical trainees without instructors","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250806/AI-and-extended-reality-successfully-train-surgical-trainees-without-instructors.aspx","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 03:08:00 GMT","

Mount Sinai researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of teaching surgical trainees a difficult procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and an extended-reality headset without the presence of an instructor. All of the 17 trainees in the study achieved surgical success.

The novel study, published in Journal of Medical Extended Reality, drew highly favorable reviews from student participants who tested the deep learning model. The results carry significant implications for future training of residents and surgeons, as well as for the even broader field of autonomous learning within medicine.

For the first time, we created an AI model linked to an extended-reality headset to prove that a critical step in a kidney cancer procedure could be done with 99.9 percent accuracy. We believe our study offers early proof that AI programs that substitute for proctors, who teach resident physicians, can reduce training costs and ultimately improve the quality, efficiency, and standardization of that instruction.""

Nelson Stone, MD, Clinical Professor of Urology, Radiation Oncology, and Oncological Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and corresponding author of the study

Surgical training of residents has traditionally required the presence of a teaching proctor alongside the student physician in the operating room, which can result in inconsistent skills acquisition. Dr. Stone and his team, which included researchers from the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center in upstate New York, explored an alternative training system using AI programs they developed, including ESIST (educational system for instructionless surgical training). This model coupled deep learning methodology with a custom-designed extended-reality headset worn by the 17 participants to stream surgical instructions and video content before their eyes, while allowing their hands to remain free to practice the intricate procedure.

The operation simulated a partial nephrectomy procedure designed to remove a cancerous portion of a kidney, including placing a clamp on the renal artery. For this replication, researchers created a ""phantom"" kidney from 3D printed casts of an anonymized patient's computerized tomography (CT) scans. The casts were filled with water-based polymers and assembled to create a partial nephrectomy model with kidney tumors. While students practiced, the system's sophisticated first-person camera continuously monitored their training, providing real-time feedback and projecting corrective prompts as part of its skills assessment capability.

""Above all, our study proved that a complex procedure like a partial nephrectomy could be effectively taught to surgical trainees using a simulated model, without the presence of an instructor,"" noted Dr. Stone. ""This finding addresses an urgent need resulting from the shortage of trainers and supervisors to educate physicians on new medical devices and techniques, and from the severe time constraints on attending physicians to train residents pursing surgical careers.""

Another major advantage of advanced teaching technology, added Dr. Stone, is that it allows future surgeons to become proficient in procedures outside the operating room, thus helping to reduce the risk of surgical errors. ""From the patient's point of view, we hope this study will provide reassurance that the technology can be leveraged to greatly improve surgical proficiency, while reducing surgical errors,"" said Dr. Stone.

The next step for Mount Sinai researchers is to use the AI algorithm technology they developed to build more complex synthetic cadaver models to train students in entire procedures, rather than just one component, as reported in the study. The team was encouraged by a survey it conducted after the training, which found that 100 percent of the participants believed the program had great educational value.

""Our investigation suggests that AI systems could indeed play an important complementary role in shaping the future of surgical education in this country,"" asserts Dr. Stone. ""The public should be reassured that the pathway to autonomous learning we investigated in this small study could eventually lead to significant cost savings and improved patient outcomes and, importantly, to the cultivation of a highly skilled new generation of surgeons.""

The study's authors, as listed in the journal, are Jonathan J. Stone, Nelson N. Stone, Steven H. Griffith, Kyle Zeller, and Michael P. Wilson.

All authors, except Kyle Zeller, hold equity in Viomerse.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (grant 1R41EB026358-01A1) and the National Science Foundation (grant 1913911).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Survey reveals persistent challenges of IBS on daily life and productivity","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250807/Survey-reveals-persistent-challenges-of-IBS-on-daily-life-and-productivity.aspx","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 10:55:00 GMT","

Despite social media helping to increase awareness of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among the public (81% of health care providers agree) and advancements in treatment over the past decade, IBS symptoms continue to significantly impact patients' daily lives and productivity, according to a new survey released by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), in partnership with The Harris Poll, a Stagwell (STGW) agency.

The AGA IBS in America survey reveals compelling new insights that explore shifts in patient experiences, health care provider perceptions, and the treatment landscape for IBS from a similar study conducted in 2015. The 2024 comprehensive study, which included 2,013 patients with IBS and 600 health care providers, sheds light on persistent challenges faced by patients with IBS.

Survey findings indicate that IBS symptoms interfere with patients' productivity at work/school for nearly 11 days per month on average, in addition to symptoms disrupting personal activities eight days per month on average, highlighting the substantial burden of the condition. Patients with IBS are missing more work/school days per month due to their gastrointestinal symptoms than they were 10 years ago (3.6 days in 2024, 2.1 days in 2015), and more report spending less time with family and friends because of their symptoms (58%, up from 48% in 2015).

The study also revealed that while fewer patients in 2024 report their symptoms are very or extremely bothersome (43%, compared to 62% in 2015), 76% still find it somewhat or very difficult to manage their symptoms. The ability to accurately predict symptoms remains elusive, with less than one in three patients (31% in 2024, in line with 29% in 2015) reporting that they can very or extremely accurately predict whether they will experience symptoms today.

All of this affects patients' willingness or ability to make plans and ultimately impacts how patients feel about themselves.

Seven in 10 patients don't feel like themselves because of their symptoms (72%), say their symptoms make them feel like they're not ""normal"" (69%), or feel their symptoms prevent them from reaching their full potential/being successful (69%).

The findings of this survey underscore the persistent challenges and impact IBS has on patients' lives. Despite progress in the medical community's approach to diagnosing and managing IBS, patients continue to suffer significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives.""

Andrea Shin, MD, MSCR, AGA Patient Education Advisor and UCLA Health

Despite treatment options evolving over the last 10 years to now include a wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents to treat IBS, the survey findings highlight that patients and health care providers rely predominantly on over-the-counter treatment options and lifestyle adjustments rather than prescription medications.

While prescription medications are among the most helpful treatments, according to patients with IBS who have tried them (18% for IBS-C, 19% for IBS-D), patients report that these treatments are not among the top three treatments recommended by health care providers, which typically include:

While more than two in five health care providers whose patients ever request a specific IBS treatment (45%) say they will recommend or prescribe the requested treatment always or most of the time, only around one in 10 (14%) say patients often do so. Patients should be encouraged to advocate for and request new or alternative treatments and proactively discuss options with their health care provider.

Most patients with both IBS-C and IBS-D (78% each) are satisfied with the treatments they currently take; however, only about one in five are very satisfied (25% IBS-C, 26% IBS-D). Further, compared to 2015, more physicians who treat IBS say effective relief of abdominal pain (49% vs. 39%) or diarrhea/constipation (47% vs. 33%) and the availability of treatment options (49% vs. 34%) are what is most lacking in IBS treatment today despite advancements in the IBS treatment landscape. These findings highlight an opportunity for further improvement in treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction.

""IBS is a condition that continues to challenge patients to find a treatment that consistently works for them,"" said Jeffrey Roberts, founder of the IBS Patient Support Group community and founder of World IBS Day. ""The AGA IBS in America Survey sheds light on patients who are still not being offered a variety of treatments that could provide them with a better quality of life. This continues to result in disruptions to their career, schooling, and life with their families and friends.""

AGA is committed to continued research and education to address the persistent impact of IBS on patients' lives and productivity, supporting health care providers and patients in managing this chronic condition effectively.

The AGA IBS in America survey was conducted with support from Salix Medical Affairs, a division of Bausch Health US, Inc.

The patient research was conducted online in the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of AGA between Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, 2024, among 2,013 U.S. adults age 18+ who have been diagnosed by a health care provider with IBS-C (1,005) or IBS-D (1,008) and have not been diagnosed with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcers, or colon, stomach, or other cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The health care provider research was conducted online in the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of AGA between Nov. 15 and Dec. 9, 2024, among 600 health care providers including gastroenterologists (n=200), primary care physicians (PCPs, n=200), gastroenterology nurse practitioners (NP)/physician assistants (PA) (n=100), and PCP NP/PAs (n=100) aged 18 or older who practice in the U.S., treat adult patients, see at least six IBS patients per month, and see IBS-C or IBS-D patients. 

Data for patients are weighted, where necessary, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, household income, employment, and smoking status to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population. Data for physicians are weighted separately, as necessary, by gender and age for each specialty to align with their actual proportions in the population. Data for advanced practice providers (APPs) were not weighted and are therefore only representative of the individuals who completed the survey. Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in The Harris Poll surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data for patients is accurate to within ± 2.9 percentage points. The data for each physician specialty is accurate to within ± 7.2 percentage points, using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest. 

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have found that better access to technology can go a long way toward achieving equity in healthcare for African Americans in the United States. According to Sharon Tettegah and Ebenezer Larnyo, both researchers at UCSB's Center for Black Studies Research (CBSR), leveraging health technology is a promising strategy for addressing longstanding healthcare disparities ""by enhancing access to care, improving its quality and reducing inequities.""

""Our study shows that improving access to technology like broadband internet and smartphones, and healthcare technology use like telehealth and health-related social media platforms, can significantly reduce healthcare disparities among African Americans,"" said Larnyo, the lead author of a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health.

African Americans today continue to face an inordinate amount of difficulty in accessing healthcare, and tend to have worse healthcare outcomes than white counterparts. Tettegah recalled one particularly conspicuous case - that of tennis champion Venus Williams, who throughout her career was plagued with bouts of severe pelvic pain.

""She had uterine fibroids and had gone to several doctors and nobody was giving her the right response,"" said Tettegah, who directs CBSR and focuses her research at the intersection of social science and STEM. ""They were dismissing her.""

Indeed, despite the pain and the bleeding, in interviews Williams herself notes that while she knew she had fibroids (African American women are disproportionately affected by the noncancerous tumors), her doctors never connected the condition and her pain, telling her that her symptoms were a ""normal"" part of her menstrual cycle. Williams ultimately found a team that took her complaints seriously and because of this experience, now advocates for women's health.

Williams' experience of being glossed over by doctors is unfortunately too common for African Americans in the U.S. healthcare system, stemming from a history of systemic racism and historical patterns of exclusion, the researchers said. While she was able to eventually find the appropriate care, many others continue to struggle to be seen.

So the question becomes, 'How do we get the medical community of people who are not people of color to understand that we really do have different needs?' And a lot of times that has to come from the patient. But not every patient can advocate for themselves.""

Sharon Tettegah, UCSB's Center for Black Studies Research

Socioeconomic status is another major factor. Healthcare in the US takes money, whether it's for health insurance, hospital and clinic visits, medicine and other supplies. Even the ongoing boom in healthcare technologies, such as internet-based telemedicine, wearables or precision medicine, which have great potential for leveling the healthcare playing field, are limited to who can afford them.

""Higher socioeconomic status individuals are more likely to have technology access, and when they do have access, they experience fewer healthcare disparities,"" Larnyo said. ""So tackling both digital and structural barriers is key to achieving equity.""

In their paper, the researchers explore the complex relationship between technology inequity and healthcare disparities among African Americans, and uncover statistical connections between socioeconomic status, technology access and health technology use.

""Evidence matters,"" Larnyo said. ""Having hard numbers allows us to move beyond assumptions and demonstrate precisely how socioeconomic factors influence healthcare access in the digital age. It helps us understand the underlying mechanisms through which technology inequity reinforces and perpetuates healthcare disparities and allows us to be able to highlight the role of structural racism in shaping economic opportunities and digital inclusion, thus making a case for structural changes rather than individual solutions.""

Analyzing data from a survey of 815 African Americans on their access to and use of health-related information and health-related behaviors, perceptions and knowledge, the research collaboration, which includes teams from Jiangsu University in China and Teesside University in the UK, elucidated this intricate dance of variables. They found a statistically significant relationship between socioeconomic status and technology access (the higher one's socioeconomic status, the more access to technology they have), and a positive association between technology access and health technology use (the more access to technology, the more likely to use health technology). 

Conversely, they found a negative association between tech access and healthcare disparities - the less access to health technology, the larger the healthcare disparities. The influence that socioeconomic status, technology access and health disparities have on each other indicates that ""addressing both socioeconomic disparities and technology access is crucial in reducing healthcare disparities,"" according to the paper.

Some of the most powerful solutions are already within reach.

""To begin with, broadband internet is foundational; it needs to be affordable, accessible and reliable,"" Larnyo said. ""That goes hand-in-hand with affordable smartphones.""

In addition, to effectively take advantage of the technology, culturally tailored telehealth, simple-to-use mental health apps and health-related social media platforms are needed, the researchers said.

""We definitely need to do more work to raise awareness that people of color have different needs that have to be addressed and not just passed off,"" Tettegah said, pointing out that ethnic minorities have differing likelihoods for various diseases and conditions. ""We need to build a narrative that highlights that with advocacy and information because often you don't know that you don't know.""

Can what you eat during pregnancy really change your gut bacteria? New research reveals how the Mediterranean diet boosts beneficial microbes for expectant mothers, while stress-busting mindfulness may not be enough.

In a recent study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers conducted a clinical sub-analysis to investigate the impacts of maternal diet and stress levels on the maternal microbiome. The study leveraged data from the IMPACT BCN randomized trial and found that a Mediterranean diet intervention significantly altered the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, promoting an increase in beneficial, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria.

A mindfulness-based stress reduction program had more modest effects on the maternal gut microbiome, with some increases in health-associated bacteria, but did not significantly alter overall microbiome structure (p=0.094). These findings highlight the maternal gut as a potential therapeutic target for improving both maternal health and potentially influencing long-term child welfare. It is important to note that microbiome outcomes were measured as exploratory endpoints, and further research is needed to determine how these changes may influence clinical outcomes for mothers and infants.

Eating more fish, nuts, and legumes – key parts of the Mediterranean pattern – was consistently tied to higher levels of beneficial bacteria families like Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae across all participants.

Pregnancy represents a period of substantial and profound physiological change, extending beyond just the mother and her developing fetus to also include their resident microbial symbionts. Notably, research has found that maternal gut and vaginal microbiomes are the primary sources for seeding the infant's microbiota, a process critical for the latter's development of a healthy immune system and metabolism in later life.

Parallel studies have established a link between the independent influences of diet and stress on non-pregnant adult microbiome composition and function. Unfortunately, there remains a scarcity of evidence from randomized trials on whether structured lifestyle interventions, such as diet and stress level interventions, especially during pregnancy, can purposefully and beneficially alter these crucial microbial ecosystems.

Understanding these associations would provide prospective mothers and their caregivers with the information to optimize maternal and fetal physiological outcomes.

One of the clearest effects of the Mediterranean diet was a significant drop in the relative amount of Campylobacter bacteria, a genus sometimes linked to gut inflammation.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a sub-analysis of the Improving Mothers for a better PrenAtal Care Trial BarCeloNa (IMPACT BCN) cohort, a randomized controlled trial (parallel design) carried out at the Hospital Clínic and Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (BCNatal) in Barcelona, Spain. IMPACT BCN aimed to elucidate whether lifestyle interventions could reduce the incidence of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns.

The current study focused on the maternal microbiome as a key exploratory outcome and used a subsample of 351 pregnant individuals from the main trial who were at high risk of having an SGA baby. Identified participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental subgroups: 1. The Med Diet group – These individuals received counselling to adopt a Mediterranean dietary pattern, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. 2. The Stress Reduction (SR) group – These individuals were enrolled in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (Kabat-Zinn adapted for pregnancy), and 3. Usual/routine Care group: These individuals were subjected to standard prenatal care protocols without additional intervention.

Study data collection comprised the extraction of maternal fecal and vaginal samples (following intervention termination – 34-36 weeks' gestation). Crucially, a subset of 85 participants was used to obtain baseline readings (before intervention initiation). Microbiome structure was evaluated using high-resolution 16S rRNA gene sequencing for community characterization and functional evaluation.

While stress reduction didn't reshape the whole gut community, moms in that program showed specific increases in bacteria like Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and these shifts sometimes mirrored lower stress levels measured in questionnaires.

Study findings revealed that modifiable behaviors, particularly diet, are strongly linked to microbiome health in pregnant women. Specifically, the Med Diet intervention was closely associated with the overall alteration of the gut microbiota structure (p = 0.002), leading to a significant enrichment in bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum. Adherence to the Med Diet was observed to promote the growth of bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) known to produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

Simultaneously, Med Diet adherence reduced microbiome concentrations of potentially harmful bacteria, most notably the genus Campylobacter (p < 0.001). While the strength of outcomes was more limited, the mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention was associated with enrichment of specific health-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Turicibacter, but did not significantly affect the overall gut microbiota composition (p=0.094 for overall structure).

Microbial diversity was observed to decrease as pregnancy progressed, with this reduction being more pronounced among participants in the intervention groups.

Additionally, independent of intervention group assignment, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern correlated with greater microbial diversity and beneficial microbial shifts.

It should be noted that the study exclusively analyzed the maternal microbiome; the offspring's microbiome was not assessed.

Neither intervention had a significant effect on the composition or diversity of the vaginal microbiota, which remained stable (dominated by the Lactobacillus genus), as is typical during a healthy pregnancy.

The present study provides the first evidence highlighting the role of structured interventions (targeting modifiable behaviours) in influencing the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy. It demonstrates that a Mediterranean diet can foster a gut environment rich in beneficial, anti-inflammatory SCFA-producing bacteria, providing a plausible mechanism through which this diet may improve pregnancy outcomes. However, clinical outcomes related to these microbiome changes were not directly assessed in this sub-analysis and should be investigated in future research. While the stress reduction program's effect was more subtle, study findings still suggest a link between psychological well-being and gut microbial health.

Together, these outcomes position the maternal gut microbiome as a potentially important therapeutic target. By optimizing a mother's diet and promoting stress management, it may be possible to cultivate a healthier microbial environment that benefits both mother and child. Future research exploring the long-term impacts of these microbial shifts on neonatal and child health may allow for the development of personalized maternal behavioral interventions designed to optimize both her and her offspring's safety and holistic health.

In a discovery that could broaden access to next-generation biologic medicines and vaccines, researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (UChicago PME) have engineered polymer-based nanoparticles that form with a simple temperature shift-no harsh chemicals, no specialized equipment, and no processing needed. 

The new nanoparticles, described in Nature Biomedical Engineering, self-assemble at room-temperature in water and, because of these gentle conditions, can deliver proteins, which are unstable in many existing nanoparticle formulations. 

What excites me about this platform is its simplicity and versatility. By simply warming a sample from fridge temperature to room temperature, we can reliably make nanoparticles that are ready to deliver a wide variety of biological drugs.""

Stuart Rowan, co-senior author, the Barry L. MacLean Professor for Molecular Engineering Innovation and Enterprise at UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering and staff scientist Argonne National Laboratory

Nanoparticles are key to protecting delicate drugs like RNA and proteins from being degraded in the body before they reach the right cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), made of fatty molecules, enabled the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, for instance. But LNPs rely on alcohol-based solvents and sensitive manufacturing steps-making them poorly suited for protein delivery and hard to scale.

""We wanted to make a delivery system that could work for both RNA and protein therapies-because right now, most platforms are specialized for just one,"" said first author Samir Hossainy, a UChicago PME graduate student. ""We also wanted to make it scalable, without needing toxic solvents or complicated microfluidics.""

Hossainy hypothesized that polymer-based nanoparticles could offer a more robust, customizable alternative. He outlined the required characteristics; the immune system will only respond to particles with certain sizes, shapes, and charges. Then, he used chemical tools to begin designing new nanoparticles from scratch. 

After trying, and fine-tuning, more than a dozen different materials, he found one that worked. In cold water, the polymer-and any desired protein-remained dissolved. But when heated to room temperature, the polymer self-assembled into uniformly sized nanoparticles (or ""polymersomes"") surrounding the protein molecules. 

""Our particle size and morphology is dictated only by the chemistry of the polymers that I designed from the bottom up,"" explained Hossainy. ""We don't have to worry about different particle sizes forming, which is a challenge with a lot of today's nanoparticles.""

To test the new polymersomes, Hossainy worked with colleagues in Rowan's lab as well as with former UChicago PME Prof. Jeffrey Hubbell, now at New York University. First, they showed that the particles can encapsulate more than 75% of protein and nearly 100% of short interfering RNA (siRNA) cargo-far higher than most current systems-and they can be freeze-dried and stored without refrigeration until needed.

In the context of vaccination, Hossainy and his collaborators found that the polymersomes could effectively carry a protein and, when injected into mice, lead the animals' immune systems to generate long-lasting antibodies against that protein. Another experiment showed that the nanoparticles could also carry proteins designed to prevent an immune response in the context of allergic asthma. And a third showed that injecting polymersomes into tumors could block cancer-related genes and suppress tumor growth in mice. 

""The exciting thing is that we didn't need to tailor a different system for each use case,"" said Hossainy. ""This one formulation worked for everything we tried-proteins, RNA, immune activation, immune suppression, and direct tumor targeting.""

One of the biggest advantages of the new polymersomes over current LNPs is the potential for low-tech, decentralized production. Hossainy says he imagines being able to ship freeze-dried formulations of the nanoparticles to anywhere in the world. When they need to be used, they can be mixed in cold water, warmed up, and will be ready to deliver to patients. 

""Being able to store these dry drastically improves the stability of the RNA or protein,"" said Hossainy. 

The group is continuing to work on fine-turning the particles to carry more types of cargo, including messenger RNA like that used in the COVID-19 vaccines (generally much larger than the siRNA used in the current trial). They also plan to collaborate on pre-clinical trials to apply the polymersomes to real-world vaccine or drug delivery challenges.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study reveals unexpected role of red blood cells in clot formation","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250806/New-study-reveals-unexpected-role-of-red-blood-cells-in-clot-formation.aspx","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

Red blood cells, long thought to be passive bystanders in the formation of blood clots, actually play an active role in helping clots contract, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. 

""This discovery reshapes how we understand one of the body's most vital processes,"" says Rustem Litvinov, a senior researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and co-author of the study. ""It also opens the door to new strategies for studying and potentially treating clotting disorders that cause either excessive bleeding or dangerous clots, like those seen in strokes.""

The finding, published in Blood Advances, upends the long-standing idea that only platelets, the small cell fragments that initially plug wounds, drive clot contraction. Instead, the Penn team found that red blood cells themselves contribute to this crucial process of shrinking and stabilizing blood clots.

Red blood cells have been studied since the 17th century. The surprising fact is that we're still finding out new things about them in the 21st century.""

Prashant Purohit, Co-Author, Professor in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics within Penn Engineering

Until now, researchers believed that only platelets were responsible for clot contraction. These tiny cell fragments pull on rope-like strands of the protein fibrin to tighten and stabilize clots.

""Red blood cells were thought to be passive bystanders,"" says co-author John Weisel, Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology within PSOM and an affiliate of the Bioengineering graduate group within Penn Engineering. ""We thought they were just helping the clot to make a better seal.""

That assumption began to unravel when Weisel and Litvinov ran a test they expected to fail. They created blood clots without platelets. ""We expected nothing to happen,"" says Weisel. ""Instead, the clots shrank by more than 20%.""

To double-check their results, the team repeated the experiment using regular blood treated with chemicals to block platelet activity. The clots still contracted. ""That's when we realized red blood cells must be doing more than just taking up space,"" says Litvinov.

To figure out how red blood cells were driving this unexpected behavior, the team turned to Purohit, a mechanical engineer by training. 

An expert on soft materials like blood clots and gels, Purohit developed a mathematical model that suggested that red blood cells compact together primarily due to ""osmotic depletion.""

This process also explains how particles in colloids - mixtures like paint, milk or muddy water - can gather and form clusters when the conditions around them change. 

""Essentially, the proteins in the surrounding fluid create an imbalance in pressure that pushes red blood cells together,"" says Purohit. ""This attractive force causes them to pack more tightly, helping the clot contract even without platelets.""

As blood begins to clot, a web-like protein called fibrin forms a mesh that traps red blood cells and pulls them close together. ""That packing sets the stage for osmotic depletion forces to take over,"" says Purohit.

Once the red blood cells are packed tightly within the fibrin mesh, proteins in the surrounding fluid are squeezed out from the narrow spaces between the cells. This creates an imbalance: the concentration of proteins is higher outside the packed cells than between them, which results in a difference in ""osmotic pressure.""

That pressure difference acts like a squeeze from the outside, pushing the red blood cells even closer together. ""This attraction causes the cells to aggregate and transfer mechanical forces to the fibrin network around them,"" adds Purohit. ""The result is a stronger, more compact clot, even without the action of platelets.""

Prior research suggested another possible explanation: bridging, in which the attraction between small molecules on the surface of red blood cells causes them to adhere. 

""Our model suggested the bridging effect was real,"" says Purohit, ""but much smaller than the effect of osmotic depletion.""

To test the model, first author Alina Peshkova, now a postdoctoral researcher in Pharmacology within PSOM, performed a series of experiments on modified blood clots. 

In the absence of the molecules that cause the bridging effect, the clots still contracted, but little contraction occurred in an environment designed to prevent osmotic depletion. 

""We experimentally confirmed what the model predicted,"" says Peshkova. ""It's an example of theory and practice coming together to support each other.""

Gaining a better understanding of the role red blood cells play in the formation and maturation of clots could lead to new treatments for conditions like thrombocytopenia, in which low platelet counts can cause uncontrolled bleeding. 

The findings could also shed light on how clots break into fragments that travel through the bloodstream and cause blockages - known as embolisms - that can trigger strokes. 

""Ultimately, our model is going to be helpful in understanding, preventing and treating diseases related to clotting inside the bloodstream,"" says Purohit.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant cause of hospital admissions and treatment discontinuation worldwide. Conventional approaches often fail to detect rare or delayed effects of medicinal products. In order to improve early detection, a research team from the Medical University of Sofia developed a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of ADRs based solely on a drug's chemical structure.

The model was built using a neural network trained using reference pharmacovigilance data. Input features were derived from SMILES codes - a standard format representing molecular structure. Predictions were generated for six major ADRs: hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hypertension, and photosensitivity.

""We could conclude that it successfully identified many expected reactions while producing relatively few false positives,"" the researchers write in their paper published in the journal Pharmacia, concluding it ""demonstrates acceptable accuracy in predicting ADRs.""

Testing of the model with well-characterized drugs resulted in predictions consistent with known side-effect profiles. For example, it estimated a 94.06% probability of hepatotoxicity for erythromycin, 88.44% for nephrotoxicity and 75.8% for hypertension in cisplatin. Additionally, 22% photosensitivity was predicted for cisplatin, while 64.8% photosensitivity was estimated for the experimental compound ezeprogind. For enadoline, a novel molecule, the model returned low probability scores across all ADRs, suggesting minimal risk.

Notably, these results demonstrate the model's potential as a decision-support tool in early-phase drug discovery and regulatory safety monitoring. The authors acknowledge that performance of the infrastructure could be further enhanced by incorporating factors such as dose levels and patient-specific parameters.

Tiny extracellular vesicles known as exosomes are emerging as key regulators of the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing how cancer progresses, spreads, and responds to treatment. In a new review published in Med Research, researchers from Haikou Affiliated Hospital of Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine explore the dual nature of exosomes-highlighting their roles in both tumor promotion and immune modulation.

Exosomes are not just passive carriers. They actively shape tumor biology by transferring RNAs, proteins, and lipids that reprogram both cancer and immune cells.""

Dr. Jiachong Wang, co-corresponding author of the paper

The review focuses on tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) and their diverse molecular cargo, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), which contribute to oncogenesis. These exosomes promote tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance by activating key signaling pathways-including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB.

At the same time, TDEs also profoundly influence the immune landscape. They can suppress immune responses by delivering immunoinhibitory ligands like PD-L1 and CTLA-4 or by inducing immunosuppressive cell types, such as M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Conversely, exosomes from immune or engineered cells may restore antitumor immunity by delivering cytokines, antigenic peptides, or RNA-based therapeutics.

The review also discusses liquid biopsy applications, showing how exosomal RNA and protein content reflects tumor stage, heterogeneity, and treatment response. This paves the way for noninvasive monitoring of disease progression and therapy resistance.

As interest in exosome biology grows, this review synthesizes current knowledge while pointing to future directions, such as exosome engineering and combined immunotherapy approaches. It positions exosomes as both culprits and potential cures in the evolving fight against cancer.

In a preclinical study, Cedars-Sinai investigators found that boosting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in key immune cells called microglia in the brain helped protect the brains of specially bred laboratory mice against Alzheimer's disease. Their findings, published in Nature Aging, could lead to cellular therapies to help treat the disease in humans.

We found that by using gene editing to boost ACE in immune cells called microglia, which we believe become exhausted in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we supercharged those cells and seemed to restore them to full function. This allowed the microglia to clear the brain of the amyloid plaques associated with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and to reverse neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.""

Warren Tourtellotte, MD, PhD, professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai, and senior author of the study

To perform their experiments, investigators used genetic engineering to develop laboratory mice that accumulated amyloid plaques in their brains and overexpressed ACE in their microglia.

""The overexpression of ACE had a profound effect on the Alzheimer's-related brain changes in these mice,"" Tourtellotte said. ""Their brains had fewer amyloid plaques and damage to neurons, and the connections between them appeared to be rescued. In addition, when ACE was expressed in microglia in these mice their performance in learning and memory tests was markedly improved.""

The next step in this line of research is to show that this same biology exists in human microglia, Tourtellotte said. While more studies are needed, these findings might eventually lead to creation of a cell-based therapy that would work either independently or along with other Alzheimer's disease treatments.

""Scientific discovery is the key to developing treatments that will help us overcome Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 7 million people in the U.S. and those who love them,"" said Nancy L. Sicotte, MD, chair of the Department of Neurology at Cedars-Sinai. ""These findings, from the first pilot project to receive funding from the Jona Goldrich Center for Alzheimer's and Memory Disorders at Cedars-Sinai, point to a promising new direction for future work and possible new treatments.""

For the first time since June 2024, there will be a new leader in the FIFA Women's Rankings. 

Spain has overtaken the U.S. women's national team for the top spot in August's rankings, FIFA announced Thursday. The USWNT previously held the No. 1 spot since June 2024 but has now dropped to No. 2.

Emma Hayes' squad have won all three of their matches since that June-July window, downing the Republic of Ireland twice by respective 4-0 scorelines. The Americans also defeated CONCACAF rivals Canada 3-0 during that span. 

The USWNT have won their last five matches and eight of their 10 overall this year. 

Yazmeen Ryan and Sam Coffey each tallied two goals apiece during the summer victories. 

The USWNT will return to action in October for a pair of home friendlies against Portugal. In addition, U.S. Soccer announced that a third match will be revealed at a later date.

Sweden, reigning European Champions England, and Germany round out the top five in the rankings. 

France, Brazil, Japan, Canada, and Korea DPR are ranked No. 6-10, with Les Bleus serving as the only team to move up out of that group. 

Spain loses to England in the women's euro final, and they not only stay ahead of England, but also supplant the USWNT in the top spot? Interesting

Women's soccer has a new No. 1.

World Cup champions Spain took over the top spot from the U.S. in the latest FIFA rankings that was released on Thursday morning.

The Spaniards lost in the UEFA final to England, but that still was good enough to move up. England.

The U.S. women's national team, the 2024 Olympic champions, dropped from first to second place.

There was plenty of winners to go around. England retained their European title by seeing off the challenge of Spain, Brazil successfully defended their South American crown, and the Solomon Islands took full advantage of New Zealand's absence to lay claim to the Oceania throne.

Spain had an impressive run to the final of the UEFA Women's EURO 2025 with five consecutive wins, which was enough to see the team reclaim top spot in the ranking, a position it had held from December 2023 to June 2024. The USA had occupied the top perch since August 2024. Three home wins in friendlies during this period have kept the Americans in contention. They are sitting less than two points behind La Roja.

The top 10 has been shaken up completely since the June edition of the ranking, with France (6th, up 4) performing best among them. Les Bleues completed a flawless group stage at the European Championship before falling to Germany in the quarter-finals.

Brazil (7th, down 3) have lost ground despite picking up their ninth continental trophy. They lost to France prior to the tournament, which subsequently saw the Seleção held to two draws by a hard-working Colombia side in the group stage as well as the in final, before prevailing on penalties.

Further down the ranking, the Asian qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup Brazil 2027™ and the OFC Women's Nations Cup have stirred things up. Bangladesh (104th, up 24) recorded the biggest jump in places and points (+80.51), courtesy of their historic both qualification for the AFC final qualifying tournament for Brazil 2027, following dramatic victories over Myanmar, Bahrain and Turkmenistan.

Vanuatu (100th, up 19) have also made considerable progress, as have the Solomon Islands (73rd, up 13), who have hit a new high in the ranking. No fewer than 10 teams are currently higher in the ranking than ever before, including Poland (26th, up 1), Haiti (49th, up 1), and Saudi Arabia (164th, up 1).

Herculez Gomez reacts to Johnny Cardoso's move to Atletico Madrid after the USMNT midfielder completes the transfer for a reported fee of €30M (1:40)

Perhaps you've heard: The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and as such, the roster for the United States men's national team is taking shape. Mind you, there have been times when the outline of said roster has looked more like a funhouse mirror than a perfectly rendered image.

The recently concluded Gold Cup featured absences that reached into the double figures, which enabled several players to get on the field who otherwise wouldn't have. Some seized their opportunity and will get further looks, while others will have little to no shot at making the 26-player roster next summer.

But U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to cope with the hand he's been dealt, and -- knock on wood -- the American player pool is at least beginning to heal up, likely giving him more options going forward. With that in mind, here is latest look at a projected roster for 2026, with some room at the end for those on the outside looking in.

Turner's return to MLS from Europe looks like a retreat, but moving back to New England should give him something been lacking ever since he left the Revs in 2022: steady playing time. And if he does get regular minutes, one would presume that he'll be the starter next summer.

It's worth remembering that Turner has one item on his résumé that his competitors don't: World Cup experience. But Pochettino has made it clear that performances matter, and Turner will need to deliver at club level if he's to reclaim his starting spot with the USMNT.

Freese boosted his stock with some solid performances at the Gold Cup, which included outdueling Costa Rica legend Keylor Navas in a penalty shootout. There were mistakes, including a giveaway that led to a goal against Haiti, and that is something he'll need to clean up. Suffice to say, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open, and now that Turner is back in MLS, Freese's performances will be compared on a weekly basis.

Steffen looked poised to get some playing time at the Gold Cup, only for a knee injury to scuttle his opportunity. Staying healthy is the single biggest issue holding Steffen back. He had a muscle injury earlier this season, and another knee injury in 2023 hastened his return to MLS from Europe. The good news is that when Steffen has seen field this season, he has played well. He ranks third in the league with 5.99 goals prevented in just 14 matches and also impressed with the Americans in January, meaning Pochettino has already seen up close what Steffen is capable of.

Richards was the United States' best player at the Gold Cup, going from ""possible starter"" before the tournament to ""first name on the team sheet"" after. He's as close to a lock as you can get for the World Cup roster.

Ream was solid at the Gold Cup, with his leadership and experience doing plenty to lead the U.S. into the final, but for how long can Pochettino rely on the 37-year-old? It's one thing to deliver at the Gold Cup; the competition at the World Cup will be several notches higher. This is no fault of Ream's, of course. It's up to another player to push him out of the lineup, and so far, that hasn't happened.

The New York City native had a successful first season in Ligue 1 with Toulouse, but he has yet to translate that into consistency with the Americans. McKenzie looked to have earned Pochettino's trust following the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal round against Jamaica, but subsequent performances against Canada, Turkey and Switzerland saw him fall out of favor.

Given the pedigree of his league, McKenzie is among the prime candidates to supplant Ream, but he'll need to raise his game in order to make that happen.

Few defenders in the United States pool provide as imposing of a physical presence as Carter-Vickers, but he needs a refined passer beside him. The Celtic center back showed well in limited minutes at the World Cup when he partnered with Ream in the 1-0 win over Iran. Since then, there have been shaky outings in the Copa America and Nations League. He's a player Pochettino knows well given their brief overlap at Tottenham Hotspur. Can CCV make more of an impression in the time that's left?

Robinson was a hard-luck omission in 2022, when a torn Achilles prevented from making the U.S. squad that went to Qatar. He hasn't quite gotten back to that pre-injury level and had just a few cameos at the Gold Cup, but he has been solid for FCC, and his ability to cover space behind the defense remains a strong suit.

The most welcome sight of the week was Dest scoring the winner for PSV in the Dutch Super Cup against Go Ahead Eagles. The U.S. has missed the right back immensely since he last played for the U.S., in March 2024, given his ability to create the unexpected going forward.

Robinson is another mainstay who appears to be on his way back after having knee surgery earlier this summer. His delivery from wide positions is a weapon Pochettino will be keen to exploit when Robinson returns to the U.S. team.

Scally was one of the players conspicuous by his absence at the Gold Cup, but his experience -- he has made more than 120 Bundesliga appearances -- is difficult to overlook. That said, his lack of impact going forward means he could find himself under pressure from any one of the young crew of full backs who have suited up for the Americans in the past year.

Wiley wasn't included in the Gold Cup, but his numbers last year on loan with Watford showed marked improvement on the defensive side of the ball with both his duel and aerial percentage over 60%. While Wiley was impactful in the attacking third during his days with Atlanta United, that hasn't been in the case with Watford, albeit in a small sample size of 10 games. His second season with the Hornets will give him an opportunity to show off more of his ability in that area.

Adams looked a bit off his game at the Gold Cup, particularly in the final, although it's unclear how much the foot injury that kept him on the bench early in the tournament was bothering him. That said, Adams remains one of the key U.S. players and if healthy -- no guarantee given his injury history -- he'll be on the roster next summer.

The Juventus man looked well short of his best at the Nations League in March, and with the Club World Cup occupying him for the summer, he didn't get a chance to take part at the Gold Cup. When he's at top form, though, McKennie is a two-way force who is also a threat on set pieces. One would expect him to be on the roster next summer, but Pochettino has let it be known that reputations will count for little, and McKennie will need to prove once again that he deserves to be in the starting XI.

Cardoso remains an enigma. At club level, he's proved to be a player that can knit the game together from a deep-lying position, so much so that Atlético manager Diego Simeone made it a priority to bring Cardoso to his side this summer. But with the U.S., the midfielder continues to confound. Injury prevented Cardoso from having any kind of impact at the Gold Cup and he remains a solid squad pick for now, but at some point, he'll need to start producing for the U.S.

De la Torre made the most of his chance at the Gold Cup, although he looked to have worn down physically by the end of the tournament. The San Diego midfielder's ability to keep possession on a team that at times struggles in that regard is a valuable trait to have. His spot seems a bit vulnerable, however, and he'll need to keep excelling at club level.

Tessmann was another head-scratching omission earlier this summer, given that he seemed to have won Pochettino over during the early days of his tenure. After getting acclimated to Ligue 1 last season, Tessmann's size and skill give him the tools to excel. This season he'll need to take the next step forward in his career, the better to convince Pochettino that he deserves to be with the full team.

The only question surrounding Pulisic is the extent to which his relationship with Pochettino needs to be mended after he publicly backed the U.S. manager into a corner over his offer to play in two friendlies last summer. The reality is there's too much at stake for a rapprochement not to happen.

Weah provides the USMNT with pace, a trait lacking in much of the rest of the roster. A change in clubs ahead of a World Cup is always a risky proposition, but assuming Weah has a chance to take on a bigger role with a club that usually finds itself near the top of the Ligue 1 table, the move represents an opportunity to grow his game.

Tillman was another player who benefited from an extended run at the Gold Cup, even as he became a target for physical play by opponents. Now he's taking a big step up at club level, moving to German powerhouse Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven. Tillman still has a tendency to hang his head during times of struggle, but his attacking talent is undeniable. That said, there are still a few players to move past in order to make the starting XI when the full team is together.

Luna has become a Pochettino favorite given his creativity, toughness and ability to play out of tight spaces. He popped up for some vital goals too, including two in the Gold Cup semifinal triumph over Guatemala. He isn't resting on his laurels, having already matched the eight goals he scored last season with Real Salt Lake. A difficult Gold Cup final against Mexico showed there's still room for growth.

An injury-riddled campaign that included shoulder surgery meant that Balogun hasn't suited up for the USMNT at all in 2025, but with no other U.S. forward stepping up to claim the starting spot, Balogun is still -- marginally -- the front-runner. The U.S. will need to do a better job of exploiting Balogun's ability to get in behind defenses.

Pepi is another U.S. forward who was felled by injury during the last club season, with knee surgery ending his season prematurely. With longtime club foil Luuk de Jong know having left PSV for FC Porto, there should be more of an opportunity for Pepi to get playing time with the Dutch giants. That could be enough for a player who just missed out on the 2022 World Cup to become mainstay with the USMNT.

Ricardo Pepi looks back on his five-month injury absence as he prepares to return to PSV in time for the new season.

It's a familiar tale with these forwards: Sargent's club form also hasn't yet translated to international level. His last goal for the U.S. was in 2019, and he has made 16 appearances without netting since the start of 2020. After turning down a move to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, Sargent looks set to spend another season in the English Championship, where he's had success in the past, but is Pochettino willing to give Sargent another chance?

Agyemang showed flashes of ability in the Gold Cup, but there are also parts of his game -- primarily his touch -- that look raw. Now he's headed over to England where his game will be held to an even higher standard. Pochettino likes Agyemang's size, and the U.S. will need a physically imposing striker on the roster.

Wright is another player set to spend time in the English Championship, and he'll be looking to improve on the 12 goals he scored last season. His versatility in being able to play on the wing could be what cements his place on the '26 roster.

An untimely injury forced Schulte off the Gold Cup roster, otherwise it might have been him getting time in the tournament instead of Freese. With other keepers such as Steffen getting back into form, the window of opportunity looks to be closing for Schulte.

Trusty is one of those players where you wonder why he hasn't been given more of a chance with the U.S., given that he has both Premier League and UEFA Champions League experience. To be clear, not all of those experiences were positive, and includes a relegation with Sheffield United, but Trusty was a steady contributor during Celtic's double-winning campaign in 2024-25, and at age 26, he's entering his prime years. He'll need to dazzle in the Champions League if he's to really catch Pochettino's eye.

Arfsten was something of a project for Pochettino at the Gold Cup, being asked to play left back when he had been a wingback with Columbus with a remit to get forward. As such, Arfsten struggled defensively early in the tournament, but got better with each game. He even tallied his first U.S. goal against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. If he can continue his defensive improvement, he may yet get on the final roster.

At age 20, Freeman has a high upside, and held up well at the Gold Cup. He faces a bit of a logjam at right back behind Dest and Scally, but his steady defensive play as well as his ability to get forward could see him make a late challenge for the final roster. If not, he figures to get chances later in his career.

How the mighty have fallen. Once part of the vaunted ""MMA"" midfield with McKennie and Adams, Musah has seen his stock fall for both club and country. Last season Musah fell out of favor at Milan, and his appearances under Pochettino saw him deployed as a wingback rather than his usual spot in the center of midfield. Musah asked out of the Gold Cup for personal reasons. A settled club situation will aid Musah's way back, with Napoli and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested, but new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has experimented with Musah in multiple positions. His time at San Siro might not be over yet.

Zendejas' omission is puzzling given his form for América, for whom he scored seven goals in 19 league and playoff appearances during last spring's Clausura. At this stage, Zendejas looks very much on the outside of the roster, although an injury or two in the right part of the field could change his circumstances.

Reyna's descent from supernova prospect to nearly forgotten man is well documented. It's wild to think that just 17 months ago he was the MVP of the Concacaf Nations League. But for Reyna, his path to a 2026 World Cup roster spot is all about his club situation. If he can get out of Dortmund and land in a spot where he can get playing time, then there's hope. Otherwise, next summer's World Cup will pass him by.

Berhalter had his ups and downs at the Gold Cup, but showed improvement over the course of the tournament, and was especially effective on set pieces. That said, he's another performer who has a lot of players to climb over if he's going to get into the full roster. It seems a step too far at the moment, but given the progress he's made in the past year, he can't be written off completely.

Downs is another forward who offers up impressive size and strength. Those traits will be put to good use in the English Championship with Southampton. Downs would seem to be in direct competition with Agyemang, and with the latter player now with Derby (not to mention Sargent at Norwich) there will be direct comparisons in terms of their performances.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

MLS

This article is part of our My Game In My Words 2025 series, an exclusive set of interviews with USMNT players where they talk us through how they do what they do on a soccer pitch.

ORANGEBURG, N.Y. — Matt Freese begins his meticulous pregame routine more than 48 hours before kickoff. He starts with meditation — lights off, stimuli banished, mind blank. Two days later, he ends with Steve Aoki's “Pursuit of Happiness” remix pumping through headphones into his ears, again and again. In between, he does “a lot of weird stuff,” he admits.

But every quirk is calculated. “Every second of every day,” Freese tells The Athletic, “is committed to being ready for those few moments a game” — the moments that have elevated him, in less than two years, from MLS backup to U.S. men's national team starter.

“Goalkeeping,” Freese explains, “really is four or five actions throughout a game, totaling 15 seconds.” And several years ago, he dedicated his life to “making sure I'm ready for those four or five segments of two seconds [each].”

So, he sleeps without his phone in his bedroom. (“Analog clocks all the way,” he says with a chuckle.)

When he awakes, he must see sunlight, and breathe fresh air, before he sees a screen.

He eats scrambled eggs every morning for breakfast. He brushes his teeth with his non-dominant left hand to improve coordination. The night before every game, he eats whole wheat spaghetti with red sauce and chicken, and drinks chamomile tea before bed. The following morning, in addition to the eggs with olive oil, salt, ketchup and sourdough toast, he wolfs down a bowl of Whole Foods granola with almond milk. As kickoff nears, “I'll have the leftover spaghetti from the night before,” he says, plus “more toast, and then a banana and peanut butter smoothie.”

And when he arrives at Yankee Stadium, or wherever New York City FC's grueling schedule takes him, he ties his shoes in a very specific way. When he steps onto the pitch, any pitch, “I touch the grass, make sure it's wet, get one pair of gloves wet, put my other pair of gloves on,” he says, before delving into his customary warmup.

But no, he insists, he is “not superstitious.” More scientific.

With matchday music, for example, “there's a lot of research about matching certain sounds with confidence,” the Harvard-educated Freese, who graduated in 2022, explains. The “Pursuit of Happiness” remix reminds him of Project X, and of when he was “an 18-year-old, thinking you're so cool. It kinda brings back that little bit of confidence that, maybe when you get older and mature, you lose.”

All of it, from the looping song to film study, from visualization to well-rehearsed workouts in the gym, has trained his body and mind to excel in the split seconds that separate international goalkeepers from average ones. It prepared him to seize his chance in New York. It propelled him all the way to the USMNT, to increasingly big moments. And “big moments,” he says, “is when I really come alive.”

“Big moments” and 1-v-1s are, to Freese, his two biggest strengths. When I asked him last week for his favorite example of the latter, he recalled the very save that I had queued up on my laptop, ready to project onto the TV mounted at the front of NYCFC's team meeting room.

It was also a big moment, Freese's first MLS season opener as a starter, 2024 against Charlotte. Four minutes after he'd saved a penalty, Kerwin Vargas bore down on him again. Freese chopped his feet, then timed his charge toward the ball, spread himself, and kept the score at 1-0.



“It's not my best save, but it was probably the most momentous for my career,” Freese says. It helped cement him as NYCFC's No. 1.

It was also evidence of what he calls “a pretty unique ability to save 1-on-1s.”

There's “a lot of work and strategic reasoning behind what I do — in my strategy, technically, in the shapes I make and stuff — on the field,” he explains.

It often starts with intense film sessions two nights before a game. Freese will study opposing forwards, and implant their tendencies in his mind. When they speed toward him on gameday — or when a cross fizzes into the box, or when a winger rips a shot from 20 yards out — “you don't think,” he explains. “Not only do you not have the time to think, but you shouldn't think. If you're thinking, you are going to either make a mistake or you're gonna be late to react. So all of it is, at that point, instinct.”

He trains himself to “wait, wait, until the moment you know you can make a 50-50 challenge” on the forward. If he'd rushed off his line earlier, Vargas could've taken his shot a touch earlier, “and then I'm in no-man's land,” Freese says.



So, he waited for that second-to-last touch, then darted to close down the angle. And that's when the scientist within him takes over.

“I'm a nerd, so the way I think about it,” Freese explains, “is: I want to maximize my surface area relative to the goal. Whatever shape I need to make to do that is what I do.”

How nerdy does he get? “Oh, very, very nerdy,” he says. “I mean, there's six different ways I could've approached this.” He recalls another 1-v-1, against Cincinnati in last year's playoffs, where “I [opened] up my body and spread the exact same way as the Charlotte one.”



On that occasion, he made the save, but the ball trickled across the six-yard box, and Cincy converted the rebound into a game-winning goal. Freese didn't necessarily err, but “very minute details make a big difference,” he says. “If I had spread the other way” — with his right leg outstretched and left leg trailing, rather than left outstretched and right trailing — his save could've been firmer, and “the ball goes out for a throw-in.”

The optimal body shape can vary from situation to situation, player to player. Freese believes his experience playing goalie in hockey as a kid, when his family moved to Minnesota, has helped him master multiple techniques. “A lot of the internal rotation of the hips, and that type of movement — drop the knee, getting wide with your feet and stuff — I learned there,” he says.

He even learned from track and field, where he was a hurdler. The 1-v-1 technique he used in Charlotte and Cincinnati (above), with one leg leading and the other trailing, is “very similar” to that of a hurdler, he says. So it's “kind of just natural to me athletically.”

Freese is not just a 1-v-1 specialist. His attention to detail and angles applies to all types of shots and sequences. He walked me through a save last summer against Atlanta, a Xande Silva curler that he tipped onto the post with a full-extension dive and reaching hand.



Silva's sideways touch was his cue to anticipate a far-post curler, so he took a tiny hop back toward his goal line. With curling shots, Freese explains, “you gotta give yourself some more depth to be able to make the save. And if I hadn't done that, this ball goes in.”



His other specialty, of course, is penalties. As U.S. fans and teammates learned this summer, and as Freese said after saving three in a Gold Cup quarterfinal shootout vs. Costa Rica, “penalties are my thing.”

Penalties have been Freese's “thing” for as long as he can remember. But when I began to probe for details of his approach, his openness subsided. In fact, his one pre-interview request was that I not ask about the “very long research project” he'd done on penalties while in school at Harvard.

“I just don't want to give anything away,” he said. “When I'm done playing, I'll talk about it.”

He said during the Gold Cup, though, that he still relies on the learnings. He knows how to read statistics and strikers' hips. And his results are irrefutable. Around 30 hours after we spoke, and after he kept his secrets guarded, Freese denied Colombian legend James Rodríguez in the Leagues Cup.

He begins preparing for opponents multiple days in advance, “because in the moment, I want to have rehearsed it so many times in my head that I'm not even thinking,” Freese says. In last year's playoffs against Cincinnati, when he saved three attempts in a shootout to send NYCFC through, “I had no cheat sheet, nothing like that,” he recalls. “I had all 20 guys on their roster memorized.”

Seven months later, he studied Costa Rican penalties on the USMNT's flight to Minneapolis. What, exactly, was he studying? Film? Statistics? “I kinda look at everything,” he says. In other words, he'd rather not reveal anything.

What he would like to point out is that, no matter how intensively a goalkeeper prepares, “in the moment, you do have to read body language, read the moment, read the timing of everything.”

And he did walk me through the entire shootout.

Costa Rica's first penalty, converted by his NYCFC teammate Alonso Martinez? “This one's annoying,” he said with a hint of disgust as the footage rolled. “He did me. He did me dirty.”

The second, his first save? “He was in his [own] head,” Freese said of Costa Rica's Juan Pablo Vargas.

And the third? “I shoulda had this one,” he said. “I thought he was going higher.”

The fourth, he said, spoke to how difficult the Gold Cup balls were to stop. They “were moving so fast,” he remembered, and this one “beat me.”

The fifth was his favorite save. Francisco Calvo had scored on him from the spot in the first half. Ahead of the shootout, “there was a whole discussion” with USMNT goalkeeper coach Toni Jimenez about Freese's plan, he recalled. He chose to stay home, and batted Calvo's attempt away.



Some research suggests that goalkeepers should hold their ground in the middle of the goal more often. I asked Freese why they don't. “I think, from a risk aversion standpoint, it's difficult to just sit there in the middle for five shots. You look like an idiot,” he said.

Freese, on the other hand, looked clairvoyant. He guessed correctly on six of Costa Rica's seven penalties that day.

He also talked smack in Spanish, which might sound surprising. Off the field, he presents as a pleasant, polite person. But on it? “Oh, I'm a big s***houser. Big time,” he says.

“I don't know if I'm good at it, by the way. But I do it a lot,” he continues. He takes after NBA and NFL players. And he knew that Costa Rica's final shooter of the day, 19-year-old Andy Rojas, was ripe for some s***housing.

“He plays for the [New York] Red Bulls, so I knew he spoke English,” Freese recalls. “He had only taken one penalty in his life before. So I really just wanted to get in his head as much as possible. And he's a young kid. … I feel bad for him, but that's my time to s***-talk. In the moment, there's no feeling bad.”

When he sprang to his right and parried Rojas' attempt, Freese clenched both fists, and stuck out his tongue, and nodded his head. Six days later, when asked whether the moment gave him confidence that he belongs at this level, he challenged the premise: “That would rely on me originally questioning my own ability, and my own position there, and the right to be there. That's never been a question. I know I've put in work. I know I've had the ability to do that.”

From afar, Freese's rise into USMNT lore has felt meteoric. A few months ago, he was uncapped. A few years ago, he was stuck behind Andre Blake in Philadelphia. He was riding the bench or playing for the Union reserves. When he did get first-team games, his performances were uneven or unremarkable.

All the while, though, “I knew I had it,” Freese says. In training, “I was making the saves, I was making plays.” In games, “I would kind of get overstimulated … and overthink a dive, or not be present in the moment.” That, he says, is “a large part of the reason” he began to invest in his mind.

His solution, his plan to conquer those half-dozen meaningful moments every week, was to “teach myself how to be very present,” he explains. To flourish in those moments, “you need to be so, so hyper-focused, and so hyper-present,” he says. And to be hyper-focused, he had to get away from social media; “I try to stay off my phone,” Freese says. “I think it is an example of something that takes you out of the present.”

He meditates in the morning before checking his phone. He is constantly teaching himself to control his mind. His work, and his trusted routine, ground him in almost any circumstance. “When you do the same thing every single time, and it's worked for you in the past,” he explains, “then in those hard moments, or in those big games — when we're playing Red Bull in the playoffs, or playing in front of 75,000 people in Houston against Mexico — if I was able to rely on these [habits in the past], then there's no reason that the atmosphere and the number of people watching, and the importance of the game, [should change anything].”

That's what Freese comes back to when I ask about competition for the USMNT's starting role. Even with a World Cup on the horizon next summer, “I don't think too much about it,” Freese says. “I want to be ready to play 10 games and then the World Cup. But I also need to be ready [for] the case that I'm not even called up, and make sure I still have that fire, still have that hunger to continue earning it and deserving it.”

In either scenario, he'll still have “Pursuit of Happiness” on loop. He'll have the exact same pregame muscle-activation exercises, and yoga two days prior. He'll have his whole wheat spaghetti. “I have my same stuff I'm doing,” Freese says, “no matter what.”

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool

The European summer transfer window has just under four weeks remaining, and the U.S. men's national team will report in roughly five weeks for a pair of international friendlies. Across the past few weeks, there have been several transfer developments for players with high hopes for the 2026 World Cup.

AC Milan have reportedly switched gears and are now planning on keeping Yunus Musah around for the 2025-26 season amid interest from Napoli after conversations with new manager Max Allegri. However, could Antonio Conte still snatch him up this window amid uncertainties over playing time?

Then, in Germany, midfielder Gio Reyna was included in Borussia Dortmund's latest preseason traveling roster, but has been held out of each match, and expectations are that he will still leave the club this window. Meanwhile, another U.S. international has officially joined the ranks of the Bundesliga, with defender Kristoffer Lund securing a loan deal to promotees FC Koln.

La Liga

Real Madrid started their pre-season training this week, almost a month after their La Liga rivals Barcelona.

Because Xabi Alonso's side competed at the Club World Cup, their 2024-25 season ended up being extended until July 9, when they lost 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. Barca started back in training on July 13.

On Monday, Madrid's players returned for work at the club's Valdebebas training ground. So, what's the plan for this atypical season start, and will having played at the Club World Cup be a help or a hindrance?

Here, The Athletic explains what's next for Alonso's new side before they start their La Liga campaign on August 19 at home to Osasuna.

Resting, or at least getting as much rest as is typical of a professional athlete during their summer holidays.

After exiting the Club World Cup, Madrid's players were given time off. They all took advantage of this break to have a holiday. Some stayed in Spain, such as Dean Huijsen, who enjoyed time with his family in Marbella, and fellow new arrival Alvaro Carreras, who did the same in Ferrol.

Both also had time to visit Ibiza, as have other team-mates such as Thibaut Courtois, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior. Others opted for more exotic destinations, such as Dani Ceballos, who visited Soneva, an island resort in the Maldives. Meanwhile, as has become almost tradition, others such as Eder Militao, Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr and Eduardo Camavinga have been in Brazil, with Vinicius Jr as their main host.

As for new manager Xabi Alonso, he spent time back in Guipuzkoa, the Basque province of northern Spain where he grew up. But the 43-year-old remained in regular contact with his staff to plan and evaluate the team's return to work and what comes next.

During the holidays, each player was sent a specific training plan designed by the club's specialists, as is usual. In many cases, this plan was designed to complement the work of their personal trainers, who were also in contact with Madrid. Endrick even took his physical trainer (Vinicius Nevado) with him on his honeymoon to Japan.

Madrid actually wanted to postpone their first La Liga match of the new season against Osasuna, arguing that they needed more rest after progressing into the Club World Cup's latter stages.

Madrid's request was supported by the Spanish players' union (and Osasuna themselves), but opposed by La Liga. Ultimately, the Spanish FA had the final say and the request was rejected by their sole competition judge.

The decision did not go down well at Madrid, with the club's official TV channel launching an angry response this week.

The Osasuna game will take place a little later than might have been previously expected, however. The match is scheduled for Tuesday, August 19, rather than on the weekend.

Despite their request to push back their opening game, Madrid always intended to return to training on August 4.

On Monday, Madrid's players underwent medical tests in the morning and began group training in the afternoon. Since then, individual and group exercise in the gym has been combined with ball work on the training fields, mixing focus on possession, finishing, dribbling and small-sided matches.

One of the main differences in Madrid's physical preparation between now and last season is a greater focus on field work, rather than the specific individual strength work Antonio Pintus favoured when he was in charge of fitness training. The Italian is still employed by the club but is now much less influential.

Several changes have been made to the medical staff, too, after a spate of injuries last season.

Two of Madrid's new permanent physical trainers employed this summer, Javier Arnaiz and Ismael Fernandez, also favour new techniques such as coordinating muscle training based on the body's temperature. New analysis of performance data is being used to better analyse the risk of future injuries.

Madrid now plan to continue training at Valdebebas until they travel to Innsbruck, Austria, for a friendly match against top-flight side WSG Tirol next Tuesday (at 7pm local time). According to staff sources — who, like all those cited here, asked to speak anonymously as they did not have permission to comment — arranging the match was not suggested by the coaching team. Madrid do not plan to stay in Austria for a training camp.

It would not have been surprising — and, in fact, a club source mentioned it as a possibility for this summer — for Madrid to face local teams such as Getafe or Leganes behind closed doors in other games that might have been held at Valdebebas instead, as has happened in recent years. However, the Tirol game is expected to be their only preparation match before their first fixture of the new season.

Madrid have mixed feelings about the Club World Cup.

One source from the coaching staff points out that conditions in the United States did not help preparation for various reasons — including the number of minutes accumulated, weather conditions described as “adverse” due to humidity and heat, poor pitches, time differences and the staging of the tournament at the end of a full season.

But another source involved in the day-to-day at Valdebebas described the Club World Cup as “very useful” because it served to achieve the main objective, which was “to change the team's dynamic” from last season. Alonso and his collaborators wanted to implement a method in which the players showed more intensity in training. Videos were more present and more individualised, and other aspects such as punctuality were taken care of.

“We're happy, but now we have to start again,” the source added.

Another topic of comment between Alonso and his staff is the need for signings, an idea that came up before the tournament in the United States and still remains. A source close to the coach suggested that two more signings would be necessary. They pointed to how domestic rivals Atletico Madrid and European challengers Liverpool have strengthened this summer.

However, club sources believe Alonso has a good squad and point out that there are 24 players already registered, with the 25th (La Liga's maximum) probably going to academy product Gonzalo Garcia.

In other words, if no one leaves, and nobody has shown signs of wanting to, they cannot bring new faces in.

                                        Morocco, which will host the 2030 football World Cup, has denied accusations by animal welfare groups that it is systematically culling stray dogs ahead of the event. Authorities maintain that they have been neutering and vaccinating stray dogs before releasing them back onto the street.                

Issued on: 07/08/2025 - 04:15Modified: 07/08/2025 - 05:35

Animal welfare groups have accused Morocco of culling stray dogs as it prepares to host football's 2030 World Cup, but the kingdom denies the accusations, vowing to protect the canines.

Advocates have charged that Morocco was indiscriminately ridding its streets of strays ahead of the global sporting event it will jointly host with Portugal and Spain.

Authorities in the North African country, however, insist they had endorsed a non-lethal method known as TNVR – to trap, neuter, vaccinate, and then release the dogs – aimed at reducing public health risks while controlling the stray population.

And a bill aimed at protecting street animals was adopted earlier this month, still pending parliament review.

It would set fines of up to $1,500 or jail terms of up to three months for harming stray dogs, according to a copy of the bill seen by AFP.

Yet the culling accusations persist as online videos show dogs being shot or poisoned with strychnine, a toxic alkaloid which is sometimes used as a pesticide.

In the videos from across the country, some of the dogs appear to already have marks on their ears indicating they had been sterilised and vaccinated.

Mohammed, a resident of Tangiers in Morocco's north who refused to give his last name for fear of retribution, said he witnessed a dog he had often seen in the neighbourhood where he works get poisoned and killed.

""I heard her cry before I saw her die,"" he recalled. That dog, too, had its ear tagged, he said.

An online petition launched by the International Animal Coalition to end the ""violent killing of dogs on the streets and beaches of Morocco"" has gathered nearly 75,000 signatures.

In June, an activist interrupted a FIFA Club World Cup match, invading the pitch with a sign that read: ""Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats"".

France's Brigitte Bardot Foundation, created by the movie star in 1986 to promote animal protection, has called on FIFA to block Morocco from hosting the 2030 tournament.

Moroccan Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit has decried ""media attacks"" against the government with ""wrong and out-of-context information"".

Advocates say Morocco has around three million stray dogs, but no official figures exist.

Each year, there are about 100,000 stray dog bites nationwide, according to official data. In 2024, authorities said 33 people died from rabies, which is often transmitted by unvaccinated animals.

""Local officials still see dogs on the streets as presenting a bad image,"" said Salima Kadaoui, 52, who launched the Hayat project, using the TNVR method to help control the stray dog population in Tangiers and aiming at eradicating rabies.

Kadaoui commended government efforts to protect animals, saying she was ""fully available"" to work with authorities and build up on the success of Hayat – meaning ""life"" in Arabic – which has treated more than 4,600 dogs in Tangiers alone since 2016.

She said it was ""essential"" not to kill TNVR-tagged dogs and to return them to the same place.

""They're like police against rabies. If a rabid dog shows up, they drive it away and protect the community.""

The government has invested more than $24 million in creating clinics capable of implementing TNVR en masse, said Mohammed Roudani, head of hygiene and green spaces at the interior ministry.

One clinic is already active in Al Arjat, near the capital Rabat, where veterinarian Youssef Lhor said more than 500 dogs had been treated this year and nearly half of them released back to the areas where they had been captured.

A young female dog, tagged ""636"", was recovering at the clinic after being sterilised, and will soon be released.

""Sometimes people tell us: 'You took the dogs away, why are you bringing them back?'"" said Lhor, highlighting the need for public awareness on the issue.

Moroccan authorities have developed a mobile app explaining what these clinics do, and allowing users to report sightings of stray dogs.

Kadaoui said it was important to educate people on proper behaviour around strays and to warn against myths, like the idea that spitting on a dog bite could heal the injury.

Raul Asensio is no longer in Xabi Alonso's plans for next season. Real Madrid have decided to put the Spanish centre-back up for sale, excluding him from the new coach's new project.

According to Defensa Central, Alonso does not see Asensio as part of his defense, where names like Rudiger, Militao and Huijsen are in the foreground.

Although Asencio gained minutes under Carlo Ancelotti, he has already fallen down the pecking order.

Last season gave him the opportunity to play, especially in Militao's absence. But with the Brazilian's return and new approaches in defense, the space for him has narrowed significantly.



Mistakes in the Club World Cup have had consequences. The naive penalty against Al Hilal, the sending off against Pachuca and the uncertainty against PSG have negatively affected the club's assessment of him.

Xabi Alonso, while known for his support of young players, demands security and consistency, and Asencio has not provided that at crucial moments. He is seen more as a temporary solution than a permanent part of the team.

The Madrid club is open to offers for the 21-year-old defender, seeing his departure as an opportunity to free up space and invest in more significant reinforcements.

Los Blancos would allow the defender to leave if an offer of around 35 million euros came in. /Telegraph/

Herculez Gomez reacts to Johnny Cardoso's move to Atletico Madrid after the USMNT midfielder completes the transfer for a reported fee of €30M (1:40)

Perhaps you've heard: The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and as such, the roster for the United States men's national team is taking shape. Mind you, there have been times when the outline of said roster has looked more like a funhouse mirror than a perfectly rendered image.

The recently concluded Gold Cup featured absences that reached into the double figures, which enabled several players to get on the field who otherwise wouldn't have. Some seized their opportunity and will get further looks, while others will have little to no shot at making the 26-player roster next summer.

But U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to cope with the hand he's been dealt, and -- knock on wood -- the American player pool is at least beginning to heal up, likely giving him more options going forward. With that in mind, here is latest look at a projected roster for 2026, with some room at the end for those on the outside looking in.

Turner's return to MLS from Europe looks like a retreat, but moving back to New England should give him something been lacking ever since he left the Revs in 2022: steady playing time. And if he does get regular minutes, one would presume that he'll be the starter next summer.

It's worth remembering that Turner has one item on his résumé that his competitors don't: World Cup experience. But Pochettino has made it clear that performances matter, and Turner will need to deliver at club level if he's to reclaim his starting spot with the USMNT.

Freese boosted his stock with some solid performances at the Gold Cup, which included outdueling Costa Rica legend Keylor Navas in a penalty shootout. There were mistakes, including a giveaway that led to a goal against Haiti, and that is something he'll need to clean up. Suffice to say, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open, and now that Turner is back in MLS, Freese's performances will be compared on a weekly basis.

Steffen looked poised to get some playing time at the Gold Cup, only for a knee injury to scuttle his opportunity. Staying healthy is the single biggest issue holding Steffen back. He had a muscle injury earlier this season, and another knee injury in 2023 hastened his return to MLS from Europe. The good news is that when Steffen has seen field this season, he has played well. He ranks third in the league with 5.99 goals prevented in just 14 matches and also impressed with the Americans in January, meaning Pochettino has already seen up close what Steffen is capable of.

Richards was the United States' best player at the Gold Cup, going from ""possible starter"" before the tournament to ""first name on the team sheet"" after. He's as close to a lock as you can get for the World Cup roster.

Ream was solid at the Gold Cup, with his leadership and experience doing plenty to lead the U.S. into the final, but for how long can Pochettino rely on the 37-year-old? It's one thing to deliver at the Gold Cup; the competition at the World Cup will be several notches higher. This is no fault of Ream's, of course. It's up to another player to push him out of the lineup, and so far, that hasn't happened.

The New York City native had a successful first season in Ligue 1 with Toulouse, but he has yet to translate that into consistency with the Americans. McKenzie looked to have earned Pochettino's trust following the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal round against Jamaica, but subsequent performances against Canada, Turkey and Switzerland saw him fall out of favor.

Given the pedigree of his league, McKenzie is among the prime candidates to supplant Ream, but he'll need to raise his game in order to make that happen.

Few defenders in the United States pool provide as imposing of a physical presence as Carter-Vickers, but he needs a refined passer beside him. The Celtic center back showed well in limited minutes at the World Cup when he partnered with Ream in the 1-0 win over Iran. Since then, there have been shaky outings in the Copa America and Nations League. He's a player Pochettino knows well given their brief overlap at Tottenham Hotspur. Can CCV make more of an impression in the time that's left?

Robinson was a hard-luck omission in 2022, when a torn Achilles prevented from making the U.S. squad that went to Qatar. He hasn't quite gotten back to that pre-injury level and had just a few cameos at the Gold Cup, but he has been solid for FCC, and his ability to cover space behind the defense remains a strong suit.

The most welcome sight of the week was Dest scoring the winner for PSV in the Dutch Super Cup against Go Ahead Eagles. The U.S. has missed the right back immensely since he last played for the U.S., in March 2024, given his ability to create the unexpected going forward.

Robinson is another mainstay who appears to be on his way back after having knee surgery earlier this summer. His delivery from wide positions is a weapon Pochettino will be keen to exploit when Robinson returns to the U.S. team.

Scally was one of the players conspicuous by his absence at the Gold Cup, but his experience -- he has made more than 120 Bundesliga appearances -- is difficult to overlook. That said, his lack of impact going forward means he could find himself under pressure from any one of the young crew of full backs who have suited up for the Americans in the past year.

Wiley wasn't included in the Gold Cup, but his numbers last year on loan with Watford showed marked improvement on the defensive side of the ball with both his duel and aerial percentage over 60%. While Wiley was impactful in the attacking third during his days with Atlanta United, that hasn't been in the case with Watford, albeit in a small sample size of 10 games. His second season with the Hornets will give him an opportunity to show off more of his ability in that area.

Adams looked a bit off his game at the Gold Cup, particularly in the final, although it's unclear how much the foot injury that kept him on the bench early in the tournament was bothering him. That said, Adams remains one of the key U.S. players and if healthy -- no guarantee given his injury history -- he'll be on the roster next summer.

The Juventus man looked well short of his best at the Nations League in March, and with the Club World Cup occupying him for the summer, he didn't get a chance to take part at the Gold Cup. When he's at top form, though, McKennie is a two-way force who is also a threat on set pieces. One would expect him to be on the roster next summer, but Pochettino has let it be known that reputations will count for little, and McKennie will need to prove once again that he deserves to be in the starting XI.

Cardoso remains an enigma. At club level, he's proved to be a player that can knit the game together from a deep-lying position, so much so that Atlético manager Diego Simeone made it a priority to bring Cardoso to his side this summer. But with the U.S., the midfielder continues to confound. Injury prevented Cardoso from having any kind of impact at the Gold Cup and he remains a solid squad pick for now, but at some point, he'll need to start producing for the U.S.

De la Torre made the most of his chance at the Gold Cup, although he looked to have worn down physically by the end of the tournament. The San Diego midfielder's ability to keep possession on a team that at times struggles in that regard is a valuable trait to have. His spot seems a bit vulnerable, however, and he'll need to keep excelling at club level.

Tessmann was another head-scratching omission earlier this summer, given that he seemed to have won Pochettino over during the early days of his tenure. After getting acclimated to Ligue 1 last season, Tessmann's size and skill give him the tools to excel. This season he'll need to take the next step forward in his career, the better to convince Pochettino that he deserves to be with the full team.

The only question surrounding Pulisic is the extent to which his relationship with Pochettino needs to be mended after he publicly backed the U.S. manager into a corner over his offer to play in two friendlies last summer. The reality is there's too much at stake for a rapprochement not to happen.

Weah provides the USMNT with pace, a trait lacking in much of the rest of the roster. A change in clubs ahead of a World Cup is always a risky proposition, but assuming Weah has a chance to take on a bigger role with a club that usually finds itself near the top of the Ligue 1 table, the move represents an opportunity to grow his game.

Tillman was another player who benefited from an extended run at the Gold Cup, even as he became a target for physical play by opponents. Now he's taking a big step up at club level, moving to German powerhouse Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven. Tillman still has a tendency to hang his head during times of struggle, but his attacking talent is undeniable. That said, there are still a few players to move past in order to make the starting XI when the full team is together.

Luna has become a Pochettino favorite given his creativity, toughness and ability to play out of tight spaces. He popped up for some vital goals too, including two in the Gold Cup semifinal triumph over Guatemala. He isn't resting on his laurels, having already matched the eight goals he scored last season with Real Salt Lake. A difficult Gold Cup final against Mexico showed there's still room for growth.

An injury-riddled campaign that included shoulder surgery meant that Balogun hasn't suited up for the USMNT at all in 2025, but with no other U.S. forward stepping up to claim the starting spot, Balogun is still -- marginally -- the front-runner. The U.S. will need to do a better job of exploiting Balogun's ability to get in behind defenses.

Pepi is another U.S. forward who was felled by injury during the last club season, with knee surgery ending his season prematurely. With longtime club foil Luuk de Jong know having left PSV for FC Porto, there should be more of an opportunity for Pepi to get playing time with the Dutch giants. That could be enough for a player who just missed out on the 2022 World Cup to become mainstay with the USMNT.

Ricardo Pepi looks back on his five-month injury absence as he prepares to return to PSV in time for the new season.

It's a familiar tale with these forwards: Sargent's club form also hasn't yet translated to international level. His last goal for the U.S. was in 2019, and he has made 16 appearances without netting since the start of 2020. After turning down a move to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, Sargent looks set to spend another season in the English Championship, where he's had success in the past, but is Pochettino willing to give Sargent another chance?

Agyemang showed flashes of ability in the Gold Cup, but there are also parts of his game -- primarily his touch -- that look raw. Now he's headed over to England where his game will be held to an even higher standard. Pochettino likes Agyemang's size, and the U.S. will need a physically imposing striker on the roster.

Wright is another player set to spend time in the English Championship, and he'll be looking to improve on the 12 goals he scored last season. His versatility in being able to play on the wing could be what cements his place on the '26 roster.

An untimely injury forced Schulte off the Gold Cup roster, otherwise it might have been him getting time in the tournament instead of Freese. With other keepers such as Steffen getting back into form, the window of opportunity looks to be closing for Schulte.

Trusty is one of those players where you wonder why he hasn't been given more of a chance with the U.S., given that he has both Premier League and UEFA Champions League experience. To be clear, not all of those experiences were positive, and includes a relegation with Sheffield United, but Trusty was a steady contributor during Celtic's double-winning campaign in 2024-25, and at age 26, he's entering his prime years. He'll need to dazzle in the Champions League if he's to really catch Pochettino's eye.

Arfsten was something of a project for Pochettino at the Gold Cup, being asked to play left back when he had been a wingback with Columbus with a remit to get forward. As such, Arfsten struggled defensively early in the tournament, but got better with each game. He even tallied his first U.S. goal against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. If he can continue his defensive improvement, he may yet get on the final roster.

At age 20, Freeman has a high upside, and held up well at the Gold Cup. He faces a bit of a logjam at right back behind Dest and Scally, but his steady defensive play as well as his ability to get forward could see him make a late challenge for the final roster. If not, he figures to get chances later in his career.

How the mighty have fallen. Once part of the vaunted ""MMA"" midfield with McKennie and Adams, Musah has seen his stock fall for both club and country. Last season Musah fell out of favor at Milan, and his appearances under Pochettino saw him deployed as a wingback rather than his usual spot in the center of midfield. Musah asked out of the Gold Cup for personal reasons. A settled club situation will aid Musah's way back, with Napoli and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested, but new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has experimented with Musah in multiple positions. His time at San Siro might not be over yet.

Zendejas' omission is puzzling given his form for América, for whom he scored seven goals in 19 league and playoff appearances during last spring's Clausura. At this stage, Zendejas looks very much on the outside of the roster, although an injury or two in the right part of the field could change his circumstances.

Reyna's descent from supernova prospect to nearly forgotten man is well documented. It's wild to think that just 17 months ago he was the MVP of the Concacaf Nations League. But for Reyna, his path to a 2026 World Cup roster spot is all about his club situation. If he can get out of Dortmund and land in a spot where he can get playing time, then there's hope. Otherwise, next summer's World Cup will pass him by.

Berhalter had his ups and downs at the Gold Cup, but showed improvement over the course of the tournament, and was especially effective on set pieces. That said, he's another performer who has a lot of players to climb over if he's going to get into the full roster. It seems a step too far at the moment, but given the progress he's made in the past year, he can't be written off completely.

Downs is another forward who offers up impressive size and strength. Those traits will be put to good use in the English Championship with Southampton. Downs would seem to be in direct competition with Agyemang, and with the latter player now with Derby (not to mention Sargent at Norwich) there will be direct comparisons in terms of their performances.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The Kansas City Police Department is creating a “strong security posture” for the FIFA World Cup 26, deploying thousands of law enforcement officers as it prepares for 650,000 international visitors descending during a hot Midwestern summer and imbibing through 23-hour-a-day alcohol sales.

Working for the past year and a half, KCPD is building “scalable plans,” for use on crowd sizes at different games, the cultural considerations brought by international fans, and hosting ticket-holders who will be made up mostly of men ages 18-39, the largest group of FIFA's fan base.

KCPD officers will be barred from taking vacation time, reserves will be on duty, police and sheriffs' deputies from Missouri and Kansas are being called up, and the National Guard will be activated for the event, from June 11 to July 19. 

Mounted patrols will be brought in from other police agencies, the Missouri State Highway Patrol will provide helicopters, and a new program using drones as first responders will be implemented, KCPD Major Abigail Martinez said.

During a public meeting at the North Kansas City Patrol headquarters Tuesday night, Martinez said the department sees the World Cup tournament as an “unprecedented challenge” on a scale of hosting the Olympic games, and drawing probably the largest crowds the city has ever seen.

The department is building a “strong security posture” for the monthlong event, KCPD Capt. Shawn Campbell said.



“We're doing a lot of work to make this as safe as possible,” Martinez said. “It is heavy on our hearts to make this as safe as possible.”

Yet police are also promising to keep the usual presence in the city during the games. Martinez said they want to keep the same patrols in place for all the events they normally cover, like Royals baseball games, KC Current soccer games or downtown concerts.

“We want to continue to police our city,” Martinez said. “We are not going to be strapped for resources for what our city needs.”

Martinez has traveled to Europe to visit other cities where FIFA games have been played to get advice, among other law enforcement conferences. And the department has consulted with officials in Atlanta, where the city hosts summer events, as they are considered experts in handling heat emergencies.

Throwing another wrinkle into plans is Gov. Mike Kehoe's signing into law a temporary extension of liquor sales, so bars and restaurants can serve alcohol from 6 a.m. to 5 a.m. during the month the city hosts the tournament. Open containers will be allowed at the FIFA Fan Festival at the National WW1 Museum grounds, and in the entertainment districts where it is already OK, like at Power & Light and Westport, Martinez said.

Still to be determined is how to grapple with the issue of young fans from Europe who are allowed to drink in public venues at home, some as early as 16 or 18 years old.

“We are used to 21 and over, others (countries) are not,” said Major Michelle Hon, commander of the North Patrol Division. “That's all stuff we have to navigate.”

Those attending games at Arrowhead Stadium and the fan fest will have to go through security, much like the one implemented at the NFL Draft held here in 2023. That's a change from some of the city's larger outdoors events, like the 2024 Super Bowl parade and rally, where one woman was killed and 23 injured, and the city has been sued for what the lawsuit alleges was a lack of proper precautions.

Although police have staffed events at Arrowhead for years, they are changing their plans for the games there, as soccer has a different culture, with fans bringing flags, drums and other things into the stadium, Martinez said. Rivalries between teams are legendary in soccer, and brawls have broken out at some World Cup games in the past, including in 2023 in Rio de Janeiro.

“It's going to be a whole different look,” Martinez said of security at Arrowhead.

Shuttles will be running to Arrowhead and to practices at Children's Mercy Park and CPKC Stadium, home of the KC Current, among other venues, Martinez said. The city has leased 200 coach buses to be able to ferry fans to stadiums, the fan fest, and other entertainment and shopping areas, like Zona Rosa in north Kansas City, she said.

Other concerns for the department include the city's troubled 911 system, which has often been under-staffed and had long wait times, and the lack of a new jail, a long-term issue the city and Jackson County have failed to settle. In May, city council began the process of building a temporary facility, which would be completed before the World Cup.

Plans are also being made to possibly create a temporary designated camping site for those fans who come to town without booking hotels or making other arrangements, Campbell said.

                                        Morocco, which will host the 2030 football World Cup, has denied accusations by animal welfare groups that it is systematically culling stray dogs ahead of the event. Authorities maintain that they have been neutering and vaccinating stray dogs before releasing them back onto the street.                

Issued on: 07/08/2025 - 04:15Modified: 07/08/2025 - 05:35

Animal welfare groups have accused Morocco of culling stray dogs as it prepares to host football's 2030 World Cup, but the kingdom denies the accusations, vowing to protect the canines.

Advocates have charged that Morocco was indiscriminately ridding its streets of strays ahead of the global sporting event it will jointly host with Portugal and Spain.

Authorities in the North African country, however, insist they had endorsed a non-lethal method known as TNVR – to trap, neuter, vaccinate, and then release the dogs – aimed at reducing public health risks while controlling the stray population.

And a bill aimed at protecting street animals was adopted earlier this month, still pending parliament review.

It would set fines of up to $1,500 or jail terms of up to three months for harming stray dogs, according to a copy of the bill seen by AFP.

Yet the culling accusations persist as online videos show dogs being shot or poisoned with strychnine, a toxic alkaloid which is sometimes used as a pesticide.

In the videos from across the country, some of the dogs appear to already have marks on their ears indicating they had been sterilised and vaccinated.

Mohammed, a resident of Tangiers in Morocco's north who refused to give his last name for fear of retribution, said he witnessed a dog he had often seen in the neighbourhood where he works get poisoned and killed.

""I heard her cry before I saw her die,"" he recalled. That dog, too, had its ear tagged, he said.

An online petition launched by the International Animal Coalition to end the ""violent killing of dogs on the streets and beaches of Morocco"" has gathered nearly 75,000 signatures.

In June, an activist interrupted a FIFA Club World Cup match, invading the pitch with a sign that read: ""Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats"".

France's Brigitte Bardot Foundation, created by the movie star in 1986 to promote animal protection, has called on FIFA to block Morocco from hosting the 2030 tournament.

Moroccan Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit has decried ""media attacks"" against the government with ""wrong and out-of-context information"".

Advocates say Morocco has around three million stray dogs, but no official figures exist.

Each year, there are about 100,000 stray dog bites nationwide, according to official data. In 2024, authorities said 33 people died from rabies, which is often transmitted by unvaccinated animals.

""Local officials still see dogs on the streets as presenting a bad image,"" said Salima Kadaoui, 52, who launched the Hayat project, using the TNVR method to help control the stray dog population in Tangiers and aiming at eradicating rabies.

Kadaoui commended government efforts to protect animals, saying she was ""fully available"" to work with authorities and build up on the success of Hayat – meaning ""life"" in Arabic – which has treated more than 4,600 dogs in Tangiers alone since 2016.

She said it was ""essential"" not to kill TNVR-tagged dogs and to return them to the same place.

""They're like police against rabies. If a rabid dog shows up, they drive it away and protect the community.""

The government has invested more than $24 million in creating clinics capable of implementing TNVR en masse, said Mohammed Roudani, head of hygiene and green spaces at the interior ministry.

One clinic is already active in Al Arjat, near the capital Rabat, where veterinarian Youssef Lhor said more than 500 dogs had been treated this year and nearly half of them released back to the areas where they had been captured.

A young female dog, tagged ""636"", was recovering at the clinic after being sterilised, and will soon be released.

""Sometimes people tell us: 'You took the dogs away, why are you bringing them back?'"" said Lhor, highlighting the need for public awareness on the issue.

Moroccan authorities have developed a mobile app explaining what these clinics do, and allowing users to report sightings of stray dogs.

Kadaoui said it was important to educate people on proper behaviour around strays and to warn against myths, like the idea that spitting on a dog bite could heal the injury.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The now-iconic shuttlecocks that adorn the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art's lawn weren't always beloved, but they will be looking their best for a global audience next summer.

“In 1994, they may have caused a little bit of consternation — people raised some eyebrows, ‘Was this art?'"" said Stephanie Fox Knappe, the museum's Sanders Sosland senior curator. 

Few cityscapes are more distinctly associated with Kansas City today than Coosje van Bruggen and Claes Oldenburg's shuttlecocks, which were commissioned by the Sosland Foundation.

“The importance of the shuttlecocks to the Nelson-Atkins and Kansas City can't be underestimated,” Fox Knappe said. “They (van Bruggen and Oldenburg) had free rein. They could make anything they wanted for the lawn of the Nelson-Atkins. So they looked at this museum, this formidable neoclassical facade and the great 22-acre lawn, and thought, ‘Wow, this would be an amazing place to create the effect of a badminton match that was interrupted with the birdies left all over the lawn.'”

Oldenburg and van Bruggen's instructions for the installation included a note that the shuttlecocks should be restored regularly to keep them looking fresh from the box, according to Fox Knappe.

It takes a herculean effort to keep the oversized shuttlecocks — each stands more than 19 feet tall with a diameter of nearly 16 feet — pristine.

The one closest to Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard on the museum's south lawn was removed in October 2024, repainted and reinstalled last winter.

“The process to de-install the shuttlecocks is pretty incredible,” Fox Knappe said. “It takes major heavy equipment; it takes cranes. Every 500-pound feather needs to be taken off, then they roll off the lawn to an industrial painting company here in the Kansas City area. They'll be cleaned and painted, then the process happens in reverse to reinstall them at the end.”

Next month, it'll be the shuttlecock on the north lawn's turn to be removed and whisked away by Belger Cartage Service for restoration, with plans to get the other two on the south lawn refurbished before the FIFA World Cup 2026, which will stage six games in Kansas City next summer.

The region's climate — rainy springs, scorching summers, wind-swept falls and icy winters — takes a toll on outdoor artwork, so chipping, cracked and weathered paint is to be expected.

“I believe this is the second time that the shuttlecocks will be de-installed from the lawn of the museum and taken away to be painted and then reinstalled,” Fox Knappe said. “The process takes about two months, and we're really grateful to the Richard J. Stern Foundation (for the Arts) and the Sosland family for helping to fund this restoration.”

It's quite a departure from their controversial beginnings.

“Now, they've become a symbol, not only of the Nelson-Atkins treasures, but also Kansas City,"" Fox Knappe said.

Visitors like Alexis Colosky, who stopped in Kansas City on a road trip from Colorado to Ohio, flock to the museum's lawn daily for photo ops with the nearly 20-foot-tall shuttlecocks.

“We're on a special vacation, seeing a bunch of cool things,” Colosky said. “This was on one of the stops to see a few of the state's largest stuff. ... This is one of the Kansas City stops that I'm going to remember.”

Tosh and Colson Demsey also visited the museum Wednesday to see the shuttlecocks. The father and son are making their way from Fresno, California, to mid-Missouri for a youth writing retreat.

“It looks pretty cool,” Tosh said. “I'd never heard about it before, but we played badminton quite a bit during COVID in our backyard, so I thought it would be fun to see.”

Tosh, a high school math teacher, took pictures of Colson next to the fully restored shuttlecock and laughed at the idea of sending them home to students who play on his school's badminton team.

“The photo on Google made it look big,” he said. “But when you see it in person, it's a lot bigger than it looked in the photo.”

Colosky agreed: “It definitely feels a little crazy being right next to it and realizing, holy crap, this thing is a really tall thing. It's actually pretty amazing.”

For better or worse, the shuttlecocks have become woven into Kansas City's DNA, one of the stock images nonresidents have of the city.

“I think now we'd be more surprised if a major event happening in Kansas City didn't feature the shuttlecocks here at the Nelson-Atkins,” Fox Knappe said. “They really have become a beloved icon.”

Next year, they'll look fresh for the World Cup's worldwide audience.

“Certainly, with the World Cup on the horizon here in Kansas City — so proud to be a host site — we definitely want everything at the museum to be looking great,” Fox Knappe said.

This is the second time the shuttlecocks are being fully restored since their installation 31 years ago.

The King Fahd Sports City Stadium has stood on the outskirts of Riyadh since 1987 and remains one of the region's most iconic sports venues. With a roof spanning 47,000 square meters, the structure, supported by 24 towering pylons, mimics the shape of a traditional Bedouin tent. 

As hosts of the 2034 FIFA World Cup final, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Sport were aiming to renovate the stadium to boost its capacity from around 60,000 to 80,000 seats, while also modernising its traditional design. However, the only existing architectural records were hand-drawn plans from the 1980s – insufficient for today's era of digital construction. To support the transformation, the entire stadium had to be precisely scanned and digitally documented.

Tasked with bringing the stadium into the digital age, BIM solutions provider Inisys, created a highly accurate 3D model of the stadium. Despite numerous challenges along the way, the final model met the tight specifications set by the engineering and architectural teams, demonstrating the importance of high-quality surveying work and reliable data in complex renovations.

Surveying a structure as vast and multifaceted as the King Fahd Stadium presented unique challenges. With outdated drawings as the only official reference, the survey team had to work from a limited understanding of the stadium's evolving layout, which complicated early planning.

Both the architects and the engineers required extremely tight tolerances for dimensional data from Inisys. To meet these demands, the BIM model had to comply with ISO 19650 standards and deliver exceptional accuracy.

For example, all the anchor points for the canopy had to be precisely geolocated, and many of them from a long distance: the structural joints had to be modeled within a 6 millimeter tolerance, while the architectural elements had to be modeled within a 25 millimeter tolerance. The team couldn't use a drone due to restrictions from the neighboring air force base. This forced the team to use terrestrial scanners, which had the range and accuracy necessary to complete the job to the required levels of precision.

The stadium's interior proved to be just as complex, including five levels of offices, with underground VIP suites, densely packed MEP, gymnasiums, and changing rooms. With operations and maintenance staff living in many of the rooms, accessing these spaces was its own challenge. 

Besides the complexity of scanning the structure itself, the project had to be planned and managed around events like football matches, which often resulted in site closures for several days. So, besides constant collaboration with architects and engineers, the project also required close coordination with the facility manager.

To meet the demands of the project, the surveying team carried out 4,700 laser scans over five weeks using a combination of Leica ScanStation P20 and Leica RTC360 3D laser scanners. A total Station was also used to geolocate over 200 control points.



Laser scanners captured various survey points at the edge of the main mast, as well as the pylons supporting the stadium's tent-like roof.

The Leica P20 was used to acquire high-resolution scans at distances over 50 metres to capture details at the top of the roof from ground level, since the team couldn't use drones. 

Halfway through the project, the scope expanded to include detailed scans of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. So, the team had to capture HVAC ducting, fire hydrants, and cable trays hidden in ceiling spaces. This involved using portable scaffolding to access roof areas, removing ceiling panels, and then placing the RTC360 inside tight spaces.

Once the interior scanning was complete, the team moved to creating a topography scan of the area surrounding the stadium, including parking facilities and vegetation.

“We managed to scan the entire exterior in just five days. The laser scanners meant we could move fast without sacrificing accuracy, which had a big impact on both our timeline and the overall project budget,” said Bill Rice, Managing Director at Inisys International. “Even the surveyors at one of the contractors were amazed by how quickly we were able to scan everything outside and build the model.”

To ensure accuracy and alignment in the point cloud, the team relied on a suite of advanced software. On-site data was captured and registered in the field, with further processing and point cloud registration completed back in the office. The outputs were exported to BIM-ready formats. To then unify the data, point cloud processing software was used to align the survey coordinates with the correct georeferenced coordinates from the surveyors on site, ensuring spatial accuracy from the outset. 

“We also utilise the reporting tool within the registration software as a part of our quality management process,” said Rice. “The combination of these tools helped us deliver a BIM model that met the tight tolerances and high standards required.”

A BIM model fit for FIFA

The result was a detailed BIM model that is now actively used by the project's architectural and engineering team, helping them design and implement the stadium's upcoming renovation. The model provided a live platform where stakeholders could track progress, review updates, and download deliverables as needed. This enabled transparent and real-time decision-making throughout the entire design process.

Beyond serving the architects, the model proved invaluable to the wider engineering team. “The engineers were honestly shocked we could deliver a BIM model with that level of detail,” said Rice. “They were actually able to run stress calculations directly from the model, saving them days and days of additional work. The impact went well beyond just the design phase. Everyone had access to the model and could compare it against their own inputs from day one, maintaining consistency and quality across the full workflow.”

The BIM model stands as a benchmark for how precise data, shared platforms, and expert execution can come together to transform stadium redevelopment across the region. The success of the project has already led to new opportunities for Inisys, including follow-on work at the Prince Mohammed bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, Saudi Arabia. 

“We had to work around some big challenges: outdated drawings, tight timelines, and the need for really high-resolution detail in certain areas,”  Rice pointed out. “We were able to deliver accurate, accessible data that fed into everything – from stress analysis to design coordination. It really shows how quality capture and strong collaboration can simplify everyone's work downstream.""

The Paris Saint-Germain winger and two of his treble-winning team-mates have been inexplicably left off the shortlist for the men's prize

The Ballon d'Or never fails to create controversy. Rather amusingly, Real Madrid even refused to turn up for last year's ceremony after being upset by the just decision to give the prize to Rodri over Vinicius Jr. 

The award is, by its very nature, contradictory, in that it champions individualism in a team sport, while the inherently subjective nature of the voting is always bound to provoke a backlash. Ballon d'Or recognition has become a very important marketing tool in the modern game, though, so whenever a player is the victim of a perceived snub, it generates a lot of headlines.

There are several contenders for the Golden Ball, but it's Paris Saint-Germain's main man who should take home the prize this year

It is the year 2025, and the frontrunner to win the Ballon d'Or is Ousmane Dembele, forward for Paris Saint-Germain and the France national team. The road to this point has been far from smooth, but this is the end point nonetheless.

PSG are the undisputed and unquestionable kings of Europe, winning the European Cup in any format for the first time in their history - a significant feat not just for a team only founded in 1970, but one for the Qatari Sports Investment project which has been hell-bent on continental domination since their takeover in 2011. Luis Enrique's side will be remembered for years to come for their tiki taka-lite style based on fluidity and slick possession football, and at the forefront of their success has been Dembele.

Tennis

TORONTO — Under the moonlight at Sobeys Stadium in Toronto, Ben Shelton produced one of the most illuminating performances of his career. Big serve, quick movement, and variety of shot and thought were all on display as the world No. 7 defeated compatriot Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 6-3, in one hour and 18 minutes Wednesday night to advance to the Canadian Open final.

No delay to begin the match was going to stop Shelton, 22, from reaching his first ATP Masters 1,000 final, another milestone in his blossoming career.

“The Masters were the one level of tournaments that I've been struggling with, and my next step is being able to excel in these tournaments,” Shelton said. “So taking that first step and getting my first deep run under my belt is exciting.”

There was great anticipation for this contest. The two friends hadn't met since 2023 at Indian Wells, where Fritz won a close three-setter in the second round en route to capturing the tournament. Shelton was a rookie on tour then. The stage doesn't feel too big for the American youngster two years later, on the cusp of his biggest tournament win.

To add to the drama, the match began with a 15-minute delay. A technical issue with the electronic line system forced the players to leave the court. The stoppage was brief, and soon their showdown would begin in front of the Toronto crowd.

There were tense moments for Shelton to start the match. In his first service game, Shelton faced two break points. He delivered a 118 mph unreturnable serve. Then, after a 15-shot rally on the second break point, Fritz sent a forehand long. Shelton held and was never broken for the rest of the set.

At 4-4, Shelton was dictating the pace of the points, forcing Fritz to defend behind the baseline. Like his previous round win against Alex de Minaur, it was Shelton owning the long rallies with deep groundstrokes and punitive slices. Fritz committed back-to-back errors, leading to break point. Shelton connected on a forehand winner that went behind Fritz, giving him the first break of the match. After two winners on the subsequent service game, Shelton claimed the one-set advantage.

“I think for me it was about keeping him moving, keeping him off balance,” Shelton said on his game plan tonight. “Mixing up the way that I play, but playing within my limits, and being really solid. My execution was really, really good tonight.”

The dominant Fritz serve, broken just three times in four matches, was in trouble. Shelton was not afraid to be aggressive and control the points when needed, and he returned with consistency, something that he does not always find easy. At 2-2, Shelton won points of 16 and 14 shots to get the second break of the match. The break point was notable as Shelton brought Fritz forward and punished him with a lob. The crowd cheered before Shelton motioned for them to get louder. He sensed the finish line was near.

On match point, Fritz tossed his third double fault, getting broken for a third time before breaking his racquet in half. After congratulatory remarks at the net, Shelton smiled to his team and waved to the crowd. Cheers of “Let's go, Ben” rang throughout the stadium, supporting the American after this emphatic victory. He is the youngest Masters 1,000 finalist since fellow American Andy Roddick in 2004.

Shelton's opponent in the final is Karen Khachanov. The Russian outlasted top seed Alexander Zverev, saving a match point before winning 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(4) in two hours and 52 minutes. Khachanov is attempting to win his second ATP Masters 1,000 title, after being victorious at the Paris Masters in 2018.

“It's a tough match,” Shelton said. “He's a rock-solid baseliner, serves really well, and a great competitor.”

As Shelton served for the first set, a fan yelled, “This is your time!” He rises to No. 5 in the live rankings following Wednesday's win. In less than 24 hours, the time could be Shelton's to capture his maiden Masters 1000 trophy, the potential beginning of a successful North American summer.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The new and improved ATP Cincinnati Open is upon us with the venue doubling in size compared to last year. The tournament also lasts 12 days now with almost all top-half first-round matches coming up on Thursday. 18-year-old star Joao Fonseca is looking to bounce back from a disappointing Toronto performance and will face Bu Yunchaokete. Who do you think will come out on top?

Head-to-head: Safiullin 1-0

It's been a messy season for Alejandro Tabilo, and that's not entirely his fault with fitness issues troubling him left and right. He will play for the first time since making the semifinals of the Prostejov Challenger in early June and is 2-5 on hard courts this year with a win each at Indian Wells and Miami. Considering that you probably should be treating Roman Safiullin as the favorite here, even if the Russian is not doing all that hot either. But at least he got a couple of matches under his belt in Toronto.
Prediction: Safiullin in 3

Head-to-head: Mannarino 5-4

This has been a fun rivalry over the years, especially their grass ATP 250 classics in ‘s-Hertogenbosch (three times) and Newport (twice). It seems like now things have changed from where they were at the end of last season when Jordan Thompson defeated Adrian Mannarino at the ATP 1000 in Paris. The Australian has been struggling with injuries and hasn't played since Wimbledon, while Mannarino is suddenly in vintage form again. He looked strong in qualifying and might extend his head-to-head lead here.
Prediction: Mannarino in 3

Head-to-head: Fonseca 1-0

Joao Fonseca continues to develop at a very strong pace, but that doesn't mean he won't be experiencing setbacks. That opening round loss to Tristan Schoolkate in Toronto was a clear example of that and the Brazilian's returning on a quick hard court was a bit of an abomination. That will have to be fixed in the near future, especially when he adds a solid block return to his skillset. Cincinnati conditions won't be that good for Fonseca either, but Bu Yunchaokete probably won't blow him off the court like Tristan Schoolkate did.
Prediction: Fonseca in 2

MASON, OH − The Cincinnati Open has grown into a two-week affair with an expanded 96-player field.

After two days of qualifying rounds, the main draw is slated to begin Aug. 7 from the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Wednesday features a schedule-stuffing 27 matches from the opening rounds of ATP and WTA main draw play.

On Center Court, 45-year-old Venus Williams, a 7-time Grand Slam champion, will face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. In the night session, Mason native Peyton Stearns will bid for her first main draw victory at her hometown tournament when she faces Yafan Wang.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time first-round updates from both tours.

Joao Fonseca's stellar summer continues after rallying for a three-set win, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, over Yunchaokete Bu on Center Court.

Fonseca started the year ranked outside the top 100 but entered Mason as the World No. 49 after a pair of Grand Slam Round of 32 runs at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

World No. 64 Arthur Rinderknech, making his Cincinnati debut, just advanced to the Round of 64 with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Nuno Borges.

Maya Joint, a 19-year-old from Australia, is the first player to punch their ticket to the Round of 64. Joint took out Greet Minnen in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.

It's Joint's second 1000-level event win of the year after a win in the Mutua Madrid Open in April.

The first round of the Cincinnati Open is underway from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

For the ATP, it's the 57th edition of the tournament in the Open Era, which began in 1969.

Joao Fonseca and Yunchaokete Bu kick things off on Center Court.

John Isner is an American former ATP player who is also one of the co-hosts of the Nothing Major podcast. He is a trusted voice in tennis media and has done work for the Tennis Channel and Barstool Sports among others.

However, his Thursday afternoon comment to his 275,000 Twitter followers created more attention than he probably either wanted or expected.

Isner posted: “Can the Russian tennis players get their flag back? Bit ridiculous now.”

When a few posters agreed with him, he added that the whole thing was “lame.”

Others commented about ending the lack of postmatch handshakes also between the Ukranian and Russian/Belarusian players.

One also talked about showing up at a tennis tournament with a white square flag to represent the currently flagless ones, and another joked that the players should be able to pick a flag (for television purposes) and suggested that Rublev pick a pirate one.

There was plenty of banter about keeping politics out of tennis until the Ukranian Tennis BTU got involved.

As this policy of not showing the Russia and Belarus flags stems from the ongoing Ukranian war, it is not surprising that Isner received an emotional response from the Ukranian Tennis BTU.

It read as follows:

“Absolutely disgraceful to wake up after a horrific night of attacks – with your child trembling in fear in the bathroom while Russian drones explode near your home – and see a tweet about the “importance” of returning flags to Russian tennis players. John, come spend a few nights in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, or Odesa – then post your tweet about flags. Even after four years of Russia killing innocent Ukrainians and destroying our country, there are still people who think the priority is to give them back their flags… not to stop the killing.”

When others challenged the Ukranian BTU about the players involvement in this brutal war, a follow-on post was shared.

It said:

“It's truly strange that we even have to explain the obvious: a flag under which a brutal and devastating war is being waged has no place at peaceful sporting events. The fact that this needs to be said is shocking — and only shows how disconnected from reality some people are when they're far away from the war.”

As you can imagine, Isner's one sentence comment sent Tennis Twitter blazing for hours. Dan Wolken of the USA Today tried to gain consensus and reframe the chat.

He said: “John, if you want to argue removing the flag in international sports is meaningless and ineffective as a response to war, you can reasonably do that. But it was removed because their country invaded a sovereign nation. It would be more ridiculous to restore it while the war is still ongoing.”

To which, John Isner posted that he would argue that it was a meaningless response.

It is obvious that this is a hot button issue that has no resolution in sight until the war ends, but in the meantime, we will see if any current or former players join Isner on the Tennis Twitter debate.

We've got a surprise final in Toronto as Ben Shelton will take on Karen Khachanov after a semi-final Wednesday that saw two of the tournament's biggest names fall short when it mattered most.

First up, Karen Khachanov pulled off a gutsy upset over top seed Alexander Zverev, saving a match point and recovering from 3/1 down in the third-set tiebreak to book his second career Masters 1000 final.

It was a classic baseline grind and far from pretty, with 78 combined unforced errors, but Khachanov hung tough and played the bigger points better, extending Zverev's Masters title drought in a year where he really should be capitalising with Alcaraz and Sinner missing.

Later in the day, Ben Shelton produced one of the best performances of his young career, dismantling fellow American Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 in under 90 minutes. Fritz looked flat, and Shelton was ruthless, piling up 22 unreturned serves, staying rock solid from the baseline, and delivering clutch returning throughout.

Here's how both semi-finals unfolded at the National Bank Open.

Karen Khachanov stunned top seed Alexander Zverev 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(4) to reach his second ATP Masters 1000 final at the National Bank Open in Toronto.

The 11th seed, trailing 3/1 in the third-set tiebreak, having earlier saved a match point, reeled off five straight points to notch his third career win over a Top 3 player.

In a two-hour, 53-minute slugfest, both players struggled with consistency, combining for 78 unforced errors. Khachanov's 18 forehand errors were outdone by Zverev's 22 backhand miscues and seven double faults. 

This one isn't a fun match-up, as both guys' styles only ever result in a baseline slug, and I think it's a disappointing result for Zverev as he needs to be picking up titles like this when Sinner and Alcaraz are both absent.

I had to dig deep and lift my level. It was a very demanding, very mental, very physical match. So I'm very happy to get the win after losing some easy ones to him in recent years. Today was a real close one. I was match point down, if the ball touches the net and drops over we wouldn't be talking now. Khachanov on his win.

I thought I was very brave in the tie-break, I just missed. That's one thing that I wanted to change, it's one thing I wanted to work on… I missed some balls that I wish I wouldn't have missed, but that's the way it is. Generally I wasn't feeling the ball well, so it's normal that you miss a little bit more than usual in these kind of situations. But that's okay, I mean, we move on. I have another chance in a few days time in Cincinnati. Zverev on his loss.



Ben Shelton powered into his first ATP Masters 1000 final, outclassing Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 in a dominant all-American semi-final.

After a delayed start due to the electronic line calling being out of action, the World No. 7, improving to 26-1 in 2025 after winning the first set, overwhelmed Fritz with 22 unreturned serves and a surprising baseline assault.

Shelton broke in the ninth game of the opener with a blistering forehand winner and sealed the second set with a clever drop shot/lob combo in the fifth game.

He limited Fritz to 68% first-serve points won and converted two of 10 break points. It was a poor day at the office for Fritz, and he's yet to win a big title since he bagged Indian Wells back in 2022, despite his game improving a fair bit over the last two years.

I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week, that's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning. There are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two Top 10 guys back to back is huge for me. When he's standing in one corner, he's one of the best in the world at being behind the ball and hitting it harder and harder every time. I knew I had to keep him moving, and I did a great job of that… I felt like I had the ball on a string. I'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in… Shelton on his win.

Thanks for the review!!! when will the final be played?

Today. 7.30 pm local.

2.30 am so I doubt I will watch.

Wow…7 hrs…had no idea.  Think UK is 5 and France is 6…where are you located…?  Thanks for the write-up, et al.  I was glad for Khach…just had an inkling he might prevail, plus Zverev too-often falls under pressure it seems, even if several 1000 wins in the past.  I still say Zverev should consider bobbing that bun and breaking off all that bling around his neck for a better focus on his tennis.  That said, think Shelton takes Khach in the final for his first 1000 win…maybe his first tour win, also…?

Thanks Jonathan, for photos and igniting telling. Might be a bit interesting how those 2'll get on i the fight. A bit sad that Fritz was flat, I would like him to have the chance.

World no. 4 Taylor Fritz ended his Canada Masters campaign in Toronto with the semi-final defeat to his compatriot, Ben Shelton, in straight sets. Taylor did not play well, facing too many break points and giving serve away three times.

While missing the title clash, the 27-year-old wrote American tennis history. By reaching the last eight, Fritz became the first American player with the quarter-final at all nine Masters 1000 events.

Twenty-two players have achieved the feat since 1990, and Taylor is the first to complete it for the greatest tennis nation. His first Masters 1000 quarter-final came only at 23 in Indian Wells four years ago.

One by one, Fritz collected quarter-finals at more tournaments and needed Canada to complete the collection. The American debuted in Canada in 2016. He had to wait until 2022 to secure his first win at the prestigious event. 

Taylor reached the last 16 in 2022 and 2023, missing that final step and accomplishing it this week. World no. 4 faced Roberto Carballes Baena in the second round and prevailed 7-5, 7-6 after over two hours.

The favorite got broken two times and provided three breaks to emerge at the top and avoid a decider. Fritz played better against Gabriel Diallo, ousting the Canadian 6-4, 6-2 in under 80 minutes.

Taylor served well and delivered three breaks to emerge at the top and reach the last 16. He had to dig deep against Jiri Lehecka in a 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 triumph in two hours and 56 minutes.

They were separated by two points. The two rivals denied all 14 break points and went down to the wire in the most thrilling match of the tournament. The American saved six break points in the opener. 

He served well in the tie break and secured two mini-breaks for 7-4. Lehecka saved a late break point in the second set and clinched the tie break 7-5 to force a decider and extend a thriller.

They embraced another tie break in the final set and stood locked at 5-5. The American stepped in and clinched the final two points, moving over the top and writing American tennis history. 

Taylor went a step further after beating Andrey Rublev before falling in straight sets to his compatriot, Ben Shelton.

Editor's note: This story has been updated during Victoria Mboko's run to the final of the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal.

Ripping a backhand past a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist to clinch a first Grand Slam win on the opening day of the French Open is a pretty good way to make tennis fans stand up and take notice.

Or maybe Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old, American-born, Canadian-raised daughter of Congolese parents, has been announcing herself for months now. Maybe folks just weren't listening closely enough.

Everyone is now, as she backs up her run to the French Open third round with a final at the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam.

As her Roland-Garros debut approached, Mboko played the same brain game she has been playing through a startling climb up the tennis biosphere. She tells herself that what is happening isn't actually happening.

“Kind of just play it down,” she said during an interview after her 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Lulu Sun of New Zealand on a Sunday May. Three days later, she knocked out rising German Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4, to move into the third round at her first major. Her run ended there in a defeat to Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, but Mboko had shown everyone who had missed her rise that they should have been paying more attention.

“Pretend like you're playing somewhere else, that you're not at a Grand Slam,” she said of her strategy there.

It's another clay-court tournament. That way, I don't put as much pressure on myself and the points. I let loose and I kind of go for my shots a little bit more,” she said.

If playing make-believe before walking onto the biggest stages in tennis could lead to Mboko taking a spot next to Bianca Andreescu, Leylah Fernandez, Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Milos Raonic and others in the Canadian tennis firmament, then Mboko probably ought to keep doing it.

Her performance in Paris, and then in Montreal, where she has knocked out two-time major champion Coco Gauff and surged into the top 50 of the WTA rankings, showed every bit of what has generated all the buzz about Mboko becoming the latest in a string of Canadians from immigrant families who have made it to the top of the sport.

“We know Canada is a very multicultural country and we are very accepting of everyone,” Andreescu, who has become a mentor to Mboko, said during an interview in Rome.

“I think it's a beautiful thing that we're all from different different cultures, different backgrounds, but at the end of the day Tennis Canada really has built this program in the acceptance of everybody, no matter who you are.”

The youngest by seven years of four tennis-playing siblings, Mboko has been winning more than just about anyone in professional women's tennis since the start of the year. She finished last year ranked 350th, with her coaches believing fully in her potential but also wanting her to take it slow, given her struggles with knee injuries in recent years.

Now they have another problem on their hands. Mboko has won so many matches that she has already played more than she has ever played before. She started the year winning 22 in a row on the ITF World Tennis Tour, two rungs below the WTA Tour. She lost one, then won another five, this time at a WTA 125 event, the next rung up, in Porto. She has won matches in Rome, Ga. and Rome, Italy at the Italian Open. Her record on the year is 50-9, after beating 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in Montreal to reach her first WTA 1,000 final.

“I have been doing exactly the same thing I've been doing every other day. I like to keep the same routine when I'm in a tournament,” she said after her win over Gauff, who had beaten her in three sets at the Italian Open.

“I think I'm a little bit superstitious in that way, in that sense, but I just like to keep everything super simple. I like to do the exact same thing every day in a tournament.”

“That's a lot,” Marko Strillic, one of three coaches she works with at the Canadian Tennis Federation, said during an interview at the Italian Open.

“If she keeps winning, you have to figure out a way to manage the schedule so that she doesn't get hurt. This is for the long term.”

That was before Mboko cruised through French Open qualifying to earn her main draw debut, and then knocked through Sun as though she knew she would all along. Mboko was all business again against Lys, but for a couple of service breaks she quickly recovered from.

Her brother Kevin, 27 and a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, said that from the moment she woke up, she set her mind on only one thing: winning.

“She looked at us and said, ‘I got to win today,'” he said in an interview after she did just that. “We were trying to bring her down a little bit, telling her that it's all right, to just go out there and have fun, enjoy the experience.

“She was like ‘No, I got to win.”

That's how she was during her hit before walking onto the court, and it's how she was through the 79-minute match. Rain, wind, muddy balls, nothing really budged her off her game.

“It's been really calm between the days,” she said. “That's how my coach wanted it to be.”

She woke at a quarter to seven ahead of her match against Lys, ready to roll. There was quick breakfast, a ride to Roland Garros, a physical warm-up and then a 30-minute hit at 9:30 a.m.

“Then I just chilled in the locker room until my match,” she said.

All week, all month, really, there has been a ‘no big deal' sensibility to Mboko. She credited the presence of her sister and brother for that.

“There is so much happening even behind the scenes,” she said. “I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I have just been enjoying the moment. I have been enjoying time with my sister and my brother. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.”

At some point, this is going to get complicated, but for Kevin and everyone else closest to Mboko, this rocket ride both is and is not surprising.

Her oldest sister Gracia, 28, who has been courtside all event, played tennis for the University of Denver. She said that she and her brothers always knew that their baby sister had something they did not. Gracia recalled a local women's tournament at their home club in Burlington, a city in the Greater Toronto area of Ontario, that she played in when she was 17.

At the last minute, another slot opened up, and a pro at the club asked Victoria, who was just 9 and had come to watch, if she wanted to play. Victoria jumped at the opportunity and eventually faced her sister. Gracia won, 6-0, 6-0, but the way Victoria behaved, it was as though she had expected the results to go the other way.

“It's that belief in yourself that the very top of the one percent have,” Gracia, a consultant in private equity, said Sunday after watching her sister win. “It's: ‘not only should I win this match, I'm going to go do it.' And then she does it.”

At least she does now. For the past couple of years, a knee injury caused by both rapid growth and a bad fall on a tennis court has made that difficult. She spent much of last year based in Belgium at the academy of Justine Henin, the former world No. 1 and four-time French Open champion. She played little for the first six months of the year. Getting healthy was the priority.

Even then, she ended the year losing more than she won, dropping three of her last four matches.

“Last year ended very poorly,” said Kevin. “I didn't see any of this coming. No one did.”

Their father, Cyprien, a retired mechanical engineer who worked nights in part so that he could drive his children to their tennis obligations, was there too. Victoria's mother, Godée, an accountant, was back home, dealing with a heavy end-of-the-month workload, as was her other brother, David, a 25-year-old data scientist.

The Mbokos moved from the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly three decades ago, to escape the First and Second Congo Wars of the mid-1990s. Visa issues kept the family separated, with Godée in Montreal and Cyprien in North Carolina. Godée then moved to N.C., where the family lived for several years and where Victoria was born, before all moving to Toronto when she was still a baby.

Victoria didn't let the losses in the final months of 2024 get to her.

“I just thought new year, new me,” she said during an interview in Rome.

She decided to play like the version of herself that she has long believed in: an aggressive, athletic player who likes to take control of points and dictate the action. In Miami, she beat Camila Osorio, a 23-year-old tour mainstay, and pushed Paula Badosa, the No. 10 seed at Roland-Garros, to a third-set tiebreak.

Mboko has also showed off a precocious variety, mixing in drop shots and slices, including a hard, slicing forehand. Her coach is Nathalie Tauziat, who got to No. 3 in the world with a game molded around variety. But Mboko can also crack her serve at 120 mph. Not surprisingly, she grew up worshipping Serena Williams.

In Rome, she cruised through the first set in her second-round match against  Gauff, lacing backhands and forehands through the court on the Campo Centrale like a seasoned veteran. Gauff turned the match into one of her long-distance track races, getting so many balls back that Mboko was huffing and puffing between every point. But the world No. 2 came away seriously impressed. She “felt like playing myself,” Gauff said in a huddle after the match, especially with how well Mboko covered the court.

“On the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that,” Gauff, probably the best mover in the sport, said.

Gracia Mboko said her sister came away from that loss both devastated and determined.

“She told me she was so out of steam, that she couldn't believe how Coco was getting every ball back,” she said Sunday.

“She kept saying, ‘I got to get in shape.' It motivated her.”

It certainly did. When she faced a double-fault-stricken version of Gauff in Montreal, she kept her foot on the accelerator after winning the first set 6-1. She knew that Gauff would raise her level, try to make her nervous, try to impose her experience on the match. Mboko didn't let her. She stayed even until 5-4, then broke Gauff to win the second set and the match.

Against Rybakina, in a match that ebbed and flowed, she looked out of the contest at the end of the first and third sets. But she refused to give in, breaking Rybakina twice as she served for the match.

Mboko had learned plenty from that first loss to Gauff. She knew she had let the world No. 2's grit frustrate her, thinking about the last point when she was supposed to be thinking about the next one. Her coaches are onto this.

“They'll start to snap me right back into it,” she said. “They'll actually say: ‘stay present, stay focused, or close it right here.'”

With 50 wins on the year, Mboko isn't exactly unfamiliar with closing it. Now she is doing it on the biggest stage in the sport.

Goran Ivanisevic has found plenty of success in his coaching career so far, which began in 2013 when he took Marin Cilic under his wing. 

Ivanisevic helped his Croatian compatriot Cilic secure his first and only Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2014, and afterwards enjoyed brief player-coach relationships with Tomas Berdych and Milos Raonic.

In 2019, he was appointed by Novak Djokovic, whom he guided to nine major titles and seven ATP Masters 1000 crowns. 

Despite unsuccessful stints in recent times, including Ivanisevic's short-lived spell with Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 53-year-old has done more than enough to cement himself as a top coach.

His new career came just under a decade after calling it a day on his playing career in 2004, which he has been reflecting on after parting ways with Tsitsipas.

Ivanisevic enjoyed many triumphs during his days on the ATP Tour and made multiple deep runs at Grand Slam events. 

He reached his first major final at Wimbledon in 1992, but lost to Andre Agassi over five sets, in what marked the American's first title at the All England Club. 

In 1994, Ivanisevic advanced to the final again in SW19, this time falling to Pete Sampras, losing to the American in straight sets on Centre Court.

Four years later, he returned to the championship match at Wimbledon for the third time, where he suffered defeat to Sampras once more. 

Despite finally winning the tournament in 2001, Ivanisevic told Sportal that losing to the 14-time Grand Slam champion at the last hurdle twice was incredibly tough to take. 

He said: “That man destroyed a lot of my life, dreams, sleep, nerves. I can't forgive him for that.”

After a fourth-round finish in 1999 and a first-round exit in 2000, many would have thought Ivanisevic's chances of winning Wimbledon were gone, but in 2001, he did the unthinkable. 

The 29-year-old finally hoisted the famous trophy that year, becoming the first unseeded player to win the championship since Boris Becker in 1985, and the first and only wildcard to lift a men's singles major title.

After victories over Carlos Moya, Andy Roddick, and Tim Henman, he beat Patrick Rafter in the final to win it all. 

Following the triumph, his ranking improved by 109 places, going from world number 125 to 16. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz is back in Cincinnati, preparing to play in his first tournament since Wimbledon.

Alcaraz, who did not play at the Canadian Open, will be hoping to bounce back after losing the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner.

Heading into the final, Alcaraz was the two-time defending champion. However, he struggled to match Jannik Sinner's aggressive serving display, eventually losing the contest in four sets.

Sinner, who also missed the tournament in Canada, is the number one seed in Cincinnati, meaning another mouthwatering clash could potentially transpire.

Ahead of his first match, Alcaraz spoke to the media about the Wimbledon final, and how long it took him to recover from the loss.

Speaking to reporters during the Cincinnati Open Media Day, Alcaraz described his immediate feelings after losing the Wimbledon final to his great rival, Jannik Sinner.

The Italian gained revenge on the Spaniard at SW19, after losing the French Open final in excruciating circumstances.

As per Punto de Break, Alcaraz said:  “Losing a Grand Slam final was a new situation for me, but one must be prepared for that. 

“Obviously, I didn't want it to happen ever, but I left the court proud and happy, smiling at the thought that at some point it had to happen because it has happened to all the tennis players in history. 

“It took me a few hours to overcome the defeat, knowing that I have many things to improve. 

“I could only feel grateful for having lived a Wimbledon final; I left proud of what I did.”

In July, Alcaraz told Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport that his main goal for the rest of the year was to reclaim the world number one spot.

During the Media Day in Cincinnati, Alcaraz reaffirmed his goal to catch Jannik Sinner in the ATP rankings.

Alcaraz said: “I feel very satisfied with how I'm doing things and want to continue this way. 

“There are various improvements I would like to implement in my tennis, but right now the key is to maintain joy on the court and be happy off it, enjoying in the most important tournaments in the world.”

Alcaraz added: “My goal from now until the end of the season is to reclaim the world number one spot.”

Sinner will face either qualifier Diego Galan or Czechia's Vit Kopriva in his second round match, while Alcaraz will play against either Mattia Bellucci or Damir Dzumhur. Both players have received a first-round bye due to their seeded positions in the draw.

World no. 1 Jannik Sinner is preparing for the title defense at the Cincinnati Masters. The Italian heads to Cincinnati following a historic triumph at Wimbledon, becoming the first player from his country with a trophy at the All England Club. 

Sinner is preparing for the North American hard-court swing with renewed motivation, hoping to defend the ATP throne from Carlos Alcaraz. As was expected, the 23-year-old enjoyed his break from tennis after conquering Wimbledon. 

The world's best player spoke about the emotional high of the final against Alcaraz and acknowledged that the experience felt very different to his other Major finals.

Five weeks earlier, Jannik squandered three match points against Carlos in that epic Roland Garros final, suffering a heartbreaking 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 defeat in five hours and 29 minutes.  

The Italian recovered and made a fresh start at the All England Club. He survived a major scare in the fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov and entered the last four with a win over Ben Shelton.

Sinner outplayed the seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets and arranged his first Wimbledon title clash against Alcaraz. The Spaniard took the opener, but the Italian kept his composure and provided a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory in three hours and four minutes.

Jannik experienced different sensations from his previous Major finals, especially after what happened in Paris. The four-time Major winner revealed he was surprised with the level he produced, especially against his greatest rivals in the latter stages.

The first-time Wimbledon champion took a couple of days off the court, spending quality time with family and friends. Sinner then returned to Monte Carlo and started his preparations for Cincinnati and the US Open. 

The Italian has to defend both titles and 3000 ATP points. The pressure is there, but Jannik looks recharged and eager to build on his incredible season and add more silverware to his growing collection. 

Will anyone stop him? Only time will tell in the next five weeks.

""The final at Wimbledon provided a different sensation because of what happened a month earlier at Roland Garros. Bouncing back in London and performing at that level surprised me, too.

I was thrilled to spend some time off the court after London and see my family and friends. After spending time with important people around me, I returned to the practice court and gave my best to prepare for the US swing, an important part of the season.

Winning Wimbledon felt very special,"" Jannik Sinner said.

The qualifying rounds of any significant WTA tournament can often make or break a player's career.

They provide a stumbling block for many players, or rather an opportunity to prove their worth in the upper echelons of the sport.

Some, like Victoria Mboko, have qualified for Grand Slam events before eventually making a name for themselves in the main draw.

One player, who shocked Jessica Pegula in the first round of Wimbledon, looked set to move onwards and upwards following an excellent period of form.

However, she has stumbled at the first hurdle in Cincinnati Open qualifying.

Unseeded Elisabetta Cocciaretto was not expected to instigate much drama heading into Wimbledon this year.

However, she demolished third seed Jessica Pegula in the first round, winning 6-2 6-3.

The Italian continued to impress in the second round, defeating America's Katy Volynets 6-0 6-4. She then lost to eventual semi-finalist Belinda Bencic, 4-6 6-3 6-7.

The Italian, now ranked 77 in the world, had impressed at SW19 and will have hoped to carry the same form into the tournaments succeeding Wimbledon.

Initially, she did. The 24-year-old won the Nordea Open in Sweden, securing her first WTA title.

She also performed admirably at the Prague Open, winning her opening match before succumbing to first seed Linda Noskova.

However, her form has taken a hit in Cincinnati. Despite being seeded fourth in qualifying, Cocciaretto was knocked out in the first round.

The Italian was defeated by Australia's Priscilla Hon, losing 4-6 4-6.

While this was a disappointing loss for Cocciaretto, it should not be over-scrutinised. The Italian has enjoyed an excellent couple of months on the WTA Tour, and being shocked by a lower-ranked player is an experience every competitor will go through at some stage in their career.

Speaking to reporters after their clash at Wimbledon, Pegula claimed that the Italian had produced an ‘insane' level of tennis.

Pegula said: “She [Cocciaretto] played absolutely incredible tennis.

“Do I think I played the best match ever? No, but I definitely don't think I was playing bad. It wasn't like I was playing that bad. 

“She just was hitting her shots and going for it, serving big, serving high percentage, going big second serves, redirecting the ball.

“I do feel like she played kind of insane. Hats off to her. Kudos to her for playing at a high level that I couldn't match it today.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","US Open will offer the largest purse in tennis history at $90 million","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/sport/tennis-us-open-prize-purse-record-intl","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 09:12:00 GMT","


            The champions of this year's US Open are set to enjoy the biggest payday in tennis history.
    


            Tournament organizers announced on Wednesday that the men's and women's singles champions will each earn $5 million at this year's tournament, a 39% increase on the $3.6 million awarded in 2024.
    


            Overall, the tournament's prize purse will top $90 million – the largest in tennis history and a 20% increase on last year, which stood at $75 million.
    


            There will also be sizeable increases in pay for those who progress to the latter stages of the competition, with singles finalists earning $2.5 million (a 26% increase), semifinalists $1.26 million (a 26% increase), and quarterfinalists $660,000 (a 25% increase).
    


            For the first time at the tournament, winning teams in the men's, women's and mixed doubles will receive $1 million in prize money.
    


            The increase in prize money comes after some of the world's top players reportedly sent a letter to organizers of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open requesting a “substantial increase” in prize money.
    


            “The US Open has made a deliberate and concerted effort to ensure double-digit percentage increases from 2024 in all rounds of all events for all players, while at the same time significantly increasing the percentage of prize money for athletes playing deep into the singles draws,” said a press release on the US Open website.
    


            Organizers have also set aside $5 million to put towards player expenses, including a $1,000 travel stipend for each player and two hotel rooms at the official player hotel (or $600 per day for staying at alternative accommodation).
    


            Qualifying for this year's US Open begins on August 18, with the main singles draws getting underway on August 24 and concluding on September 7.
    


            Sweeping – and controversial – changes have been made to the mixed doubles competition this year, which will now be staged on August 19 and 20 and include some of the biggest names in the sport.
    


Mixed doubles change at US Open branded a ‘profound injustice' by defending champions



            Among some of the all-star pairings will be Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, Casper Ruud and Iga Świątek, and Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov.
    


            The rationale is that top players will then be available to appear in the mixed doubles, attracting more fans and allowing broadcasters to spotlight the competition before main draw singles play begins.
    


            However, defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori called the format change a “pseudo-exhibition” and “profound injustice” which “disrespect(s) an entire category of players.”
    


            Eight pairs of the 16-team field have been selected based on their combined singles ranking, while eight are wild-card entries.
    


            The US Tennis Association told CNN Sports that the new format will “elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and provide a greater opportunity to inspire more people to play and grow the sport.”
    


            It also said in a press release that “the world's best players will have the opportunity to compete for this title and the multi-million dollar purse without having to juggle mixed doubles with their singles and doubles commitments.”

Canadian teenage sensation Victoria Mboko clinched a stunning comeback win over ninth seed Elena Rybakina to reach the final of the National Bank Open in Montreal, where she will face four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.

The 18-year-old Mboko rallied from a set down, in which she was dominated 6-1, to not only take Rybakina into a decider, but then save a match point and break the 2022 Wimbledon champion twice to force a final tie-breaker.

Mboko, who upset top seed Coco Gauff 6-1 6-4 earlier in the tournament and also beat Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets in their quarter-final clash, ultimately prevailed 1-6 7-5 7-6 (7-4) to book her spot in the final.

Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Congolese parents, Victoria Mboko grew up in Toronto.

Mboko began 2025 by winning four consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour events in January and February before claiming a fifth title in March. She remains in second place on the ITF World Tennis Tour for most women's singles titles won this year.

Mboko showed promise as a junior. She won her first professional singles title at the ITF W25 tournament in Saskatoon in 2022, a title she successfully defended in 2023.

Mboko began 2025 ranked at No 333 and has since risen 248 places to No 85. She will be ranked inside the Top 50 for the first time on Monday regardless of the result in Montreal.

She then qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the French Open, where she reached the third round, before stunning 25th-seeded Magdalena Frech in the first round at Wimbledon.

Mboko is coached by former world No 3, 1998 Wimbledon finalist and 1997 Billie Jean King Cup champion Nathalie Tauziat.

""Incredible match, thank you to everyone for supporting me,"" Mboko told the crowd in French. ""It was really difficult, but anything can happen.

""Playing in front of the home crowd, obviously, has its advantages. You always have everyone pumping you up as much as they can. It really pulls me through in the tough moments where I'm maybe not as positive. Really blessed to have that kind of support.""

Mboko overcame 11 double-faults and battled through a wrist injury after stumbling awkwardly to the ground in the second game of the third set.

Mboko, who will move up to at least 34th in the world after starting the year outside the top 300, said afterwards that her wrist felt ""a lot better"".

Rybakina was unhappy with the way the home crowd cheered her mistakes, saying: ""Yeah, that wasn't nice, of course. I played in a lot of situations where the crowd was supporting the player, but I would say that here it was pretty tough from the very beginning.

""I already felt it from the first game we played, and especially when it's in between the serves. It is what it is. This is something I was kind of expecting, and definitely it didn't depend anyhow on my serve or in the mistakes I did or wrong choices. It was obvious that the crowd is going to cheer for their player.""

Ranked 85th in the world, Mboko is seeking her first WTA Tour title and trying to join Faye Urban (1969) and Bianca Andreescu (2019) as the only Canadians to win their home event in the open era.

Two unseeded players (Naomi Osaka and Victoria Mboko) will face each other at the Canadian Open's final for the third time in the Open Era, after Marsikova-Kruger (1977) and Du Pont-Cuypers (1979)

In the final on Thursday night, she will face former world No 1 Osaka, who overcame 16th seed Clara Tauson 6-2 7-6 (9-7) in the other semi-final.

Osaka continued her best performance in a WTA 1000 tournament since reaching the Miami final in 2022. She stepped away from the game for 15 months towards the end of that season and had daughter Shai in July 2023.

Mboko had previously said that Osaka was her idol and the Japanese star, who has been working with coach Tomasz Wiktorowski after splitting with Patrick Mouratoglou, said: ""I don't think that's ever happened. I'm shook [laughing]. It's really cute. I guess I have to have a really good attitude tomorrow. I can't let her not like me anymore.

""I don't know, it's funny because I see her on the TV, and I was low-key. That's my little twin, because we both have our blue dresses and our buns and everything. I'm really honoured. I always said that I would love to play someone that looked up to me in a way, so it's happening way sooner than I thought it would.""

Fourth seed Ben Shelton beat second-seeded Taylor Fritz 6-4 6-3 in their all-American semi-final match at the National Bank Open in Toronto.

Shelton will face 11th seed Karen Khachanov in the final after he overcame top-seeded Alexander Zverev 6-3 4-6 7-6 (7-4) in the other semi-final, surviving a Zverev match point in the process.

""I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week, that's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning,"" said Shelton, who become the youngest American to reach an ATP Masters 1000 final since Andy Roddick in Toronto in 2004.

""There are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two top-10 guys back-to-back [Alex de Minaur and Fritz] is huge for me.""

The 22-year-old Shelton is seeking his third career ATP Tour title. He won in Tokyo on hard courts in 2023 and Houston last year on clay.

""I'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in,"" Shelton said.

Coco Gauff and 2024 U.S. Open champions Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner, and 20 or so other players sent a letter to the heads of Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian open in March asking for more say in “decisions that directly impact” the players, as well as an increase in the prize draw. 

It seems like their pitch has had an effect. For the upcoming US Open tournament, starting in just a few weeks on Sunday, Aug 24, a record $5 million will be awarded each to the women's and men's singles champions. In addition, player compensation overall has increased 20% to $90 million, the most in tennis history, reports AP News.

According to the US Open Tournament, ""The US Open has made a deliberate and concerted effort to ensure double-digit percentage increases from 2024 in all rounds of all events for all players, while at the same time significantly increasing the percentage of prize money for athletes playing deep into the singles draws.""

The 2025 prize draw of $5 million is a 39% increase from last year's $3.6 million. The increase will also affect single players who make it to the finals with a $2.5 million payout each. Semifinalists will receive a 26% hike, making their take-home pay $1.26 million.

Many impactful players continue to be in discussions with the heads of each of the four major tournaments in a bid to receive a higher percentage of revenues.

Wimbledon's prize money went up about 7% to about $73 million, taking the exchange rate into consideration at the time that the English major announced player payments. Wimbledon's singles champions were paid roughly $4 million.

For women's and men's doubles each winner will receive $1 million, a new high for the U.S. Open doubles champions where total prizes for qualifying are going up to $8 million, a 10% increase.

The US Open will take place from AUGUST 18 - SEPTEMBER 7, 2025, at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, NY.

Emma Raducanu hopes her new coaching set up, adding Rafael Nadal's former coach Francis Roig to her team, will help her improve ""against the very top"" in the game.

The 2021 US Open champion has worked with British coach Mark Petchey on an informal basis since March, enjoying a positive run of results.

However, Petchey's TV commitments meant he was always unable to become Raducanu's full-time coach and after a trial with Roig following Wimbledon, the 22-year-old has begun working with him in an official capacity - contracted until the end of 2025 - ahead of this week's Cincinnati Open.

""It's going really well,"" Raducanu said of the new partnership. ""It's my second day with him here, but I did a few days in London before I came out here.

""He's obviously got a bank of experience; I'm very excited to continue working with him and to have him on my side.""

Raducanu has enjoyed a strong 2024 so far, reaching the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in March, the round of 16 at the Italian Open and last eight at Queen's Club.

World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka proved too strong in round three at Wimbledon, but this was backed up by a semi-final at the Citi Open in Washington to see Raducanu back as British No 1 and move up to 33rd in the WTA rankings.

Spanish coach Roig worked alongside Nadal's uncle Toni for the majority of the 22-time Grand Slam champion's career.

On any specific targets she has with Roig, Raducanu added: ""I'm working on the quality of my shots and to be better. Against the very top, that's what it needs. It needs to improve.

""I'm going to try and be pretty patient but I'm hoping with time that will improve.""

Raducanu, who has a first-round bye, could potentially face fellow Brit and friend Katie Boulter in her opening match of the Cincinnati Open, provided Boulter comes through her first-round game with Olga Danilovic.

Both players are using the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati as a key warm-up for the US Open, the final Grand Slam of the season live on Sky Sports from August 24.

""I'm very happy to be here in Cincy and feeling good about everything overall,"" Raducanu said.

""Last year I didn't play so much after Wimbledon, but I have a few points to defend in Seoul. It's great to have this much of the year left and not much to defend.

""I think the goal for the rest of this season is to be seeded for Australia [in January] and, honestly, results aside, it's just to improve the feeling I have on the court - to feel I have less holes, and to feel like I can step on court and match pretty much anyone.

""That's the goal, but I think it's going to take a lot more time to do that.""

MONTREAL (AP) — Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko rallied to reach the National Bank Open final, beating ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4) on Wednesday night.

The 18-year-old Mboko dropped to the court after Rybakina's shot sailed long on match point as the crowd — lined with “Allez Vicky” — erupted. Mboko saved a match point in the third set and broke Rybakina twice to force the tiebreaker.

Karen Khachanov saved a match point in a nervy and error-strewn 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(4) victory over top seed Alexander Zverev Wednesday night in Toronto to reach the final of the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. 

The former World No. 8 won five straight points from 1/3 in the third-set tie-break to set up his third win in 24 career meetings against a Top 3 player, the first of which came against Novak Djokovic in the 2018 Rolex Paris Masters title match when he was just 22. That was the last time Khachanov appeared in a Masters 1000 final.



Playing his first tournament since falling to Taylor Fritz in the Wimbledon quarter-finals, Khachanov will play American Ben Shelton in Thursday's final, not before 7:30 p.m. ET. 

“I had to dig deep and lift my level. It was a very demanding, very mental, very physical match. So I'm very happy to get the win after losing some easy ones to him in recent years,” said Khachanov, referring to three consecutive losses to Zverev in which he won a total of 14 games. 

“Today was a real close one. I was match point down, if the ball touches the net and drops over we wouldn't be talking now.”

Khachanov and Zverev both littered the stats sheet in the two hour, 53 minute battle, with a combined 78 unforced errors, according to Infosys ATP Stats. A Canada semi-finalist twice before in 2018 and '19, Khachanov made 17 unforced forehand errors while Zverev made 22 on his normally rock-solid backhand. The German also threw in seven double faults, after also serving up seven against Alexei Popyrin in the quarter-finals.

Zverev's most costly error came on his lone match point. Serving to force a tie-break, Khachanov offered up a juicy second serve on the ad court into the wheelhouse of Zverev's backhand, but the 2017 Toronto champion dumped it into the top of the net.

“I thought I was very brave in the tie-break, I just missed,” Zverev said. “That's one thing that I wanted to change, it's one thing I wanted to work on… I missed some balls that I wish I wouldn't have missed, but that's the way it is. Generally I wasn't feeling the ball well, so it's normal that you miss a little bit more than usual in these kind of situations. But that's okay, I mean, we move on. I have another chance in a few days time in Cincinnati.”

Khachanov, who went 5-7 on hard court through the first three months of the season, has surged 10 places this week to 12th in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin as he pushes his claim to qualify for the eight-man Nitto ATP Finals in Turin from 9-16 November.

Ben Shelton upstaged higher-ranked countryman Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 Wednesday night in Toronto to muscle his way into his first ATP Masters 1000 final at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.

Improving to 26-1 this season after winning the first set, the World No. 7 combined an expected service masterclass with a surprising baseline assault on return to declaw Fritz, who had dropped serve just once in his previous three matches heading into the semi-finals.



""Even more uncharted territory. Humble and Hungry,"" Shelton wrote on the TV camera as he celebrated the breakthrough win.

“I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week, that's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning,” Shelton said. “There are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two Top 10 guys back to back is huge for me.”

The win also lifted Shelton to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin as he hopes to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. Should he win the title, Shelton will move to fourth, ahead of Novak Djokovic.

In the first all-American ATP Masters 1000 semi-final since 2010, Shelton earned six break points across three Fritz service games in the opening set, eventually breaking through in the ninth game with a thunderous down-the-line forehand winner.

Emerging as one of the best front-runners in the game, the 22-year-old showed no letup in the second set, claiming the decisive break in the fifth game with a drop shot/lob combo that left Fritz floundering at net. The lefty secured back-to-back Top 10 victories for the first time, following his quarter-final win over recent Washington ATP 500 champion Alex de Minaur.

Shelton claimed his 100th tour-level win earlier in the tournament and will move to a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings ahead of Djokovic if he defeats Karen Khachanov in Thursday's final, which begins at 7 p.m. ET.

Shelton hit 22 unreturned serves to Fritz's 10, according to Infosys ATP Stats and five backhand winners to Fritz's none.  He earned 10 break point opportunities and limited Fritz to 68 per cent of first-serve points won and 39 per cent of second-serve points won.

“When he's standing in one corner, he's one of the best in the world at being behind the ball and hitting it harder and harder every time. I knew I had to keep him moving and I did a great job of that… I felt like I had the ball on a string,"" Shelton said.

 “I'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in…”

Shelton improved to 31-16 on the year according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

After nearly two weeks of improbable wins, Victoria Mboko meets four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka in the Montreal final (6 p.m. ET). Here's why both players can win.

Most of the statistics -- not to mention any kind of rational thinking -- favored No. 3 seed Elena Rybakina against an 18-year-old in her first-career WTA Tour semifinal. The former Wimbledon champion had won their first meeting two weeks ago in Washington D.C., and most of her matches against teenagers and wild cards in the course of her career.

But backed by a rabidly partisan crowd at the Omnium Banque Nationale in Montreal, Canadian Victoria Mboko improbably won her sixth match of the tournament to advance to Thursday's 6 p.m. ET final against four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.

Not surprisingly, the two unseeded players have never met.

Overcoming what looked like a potentially nasty wrist injury, Mboko prevailed over Rybakina 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4) in a match that lasted 2 hours and 46 minutes. Not only did she save a match point in the process, but she has now beaten three former Grand Slam champions, including No. 1 seed Coco Gauff.

And now there is the possibility of a fourth in Osaka.

Montreal: Draws | Scores | Order of play

“Tres difficile,” Mboko said in her on-court interview in French of the final step.

And immediately added in English, “Anything can happen.”

Mboko spoke with authority -- because in a remarkable dozen days, it already has.

We make the case for each of the finalists:

She's utterly fearless.

While it's nice to have the crowd behind you, it can also add to the pressure. Time and again against Rybakina, Mboko dug out of deep holes. After getting blasted in the first set, she ran out to a 5-3 lead in the second, but lost the next two games -- before winning the last two and executing a credible two-handed Rafaesque fist pump.

Mboko weathered 11 double faults (Rybakina had one), including one in that deciding tiebreak. At 4-all she smoked a forehand winner down the line, then watched as Rybakina missed a backhand wide and yet another forehand long.

Mboko landed 73 percent of her first serves, far better than Rybakina's 55 percent.

“She served really well in these important moments,” Rybakina said afterward.

Wild cards are mostly an attempt by the home tournament to take care of its own and, true to form, seven of eight at the Canadian Open went to Canadians. Three of them lost first-round matches and three fell in the second round. Mboko is 6-0 and only the third wild card to reach the final here. The others were named Seles (1995) and Halep (2015).

Mboko, who had tremendous success earlier this year in ITF events, has now compiled a 52-9 across all levels. At this point, it's clear she expects to win. Why should the final be any different?

“Since the beginning of the year, she win so many matches,” her coach Nathalie Tauziat said. “So it give you a lot of confidence. It's not because you are one break down that you have to be in panic.”

Let the record show that Mboko has now progressed one round further than Tauziat in Canada; she lost in the 1990 semifinals to Steffi Graf.

After losing her first four career meetings against Top 20 opponents, Mboko's now beaten two of them -- Top 10 seeds Gauff and Rybakina.

History says she has a fighting chance. Mboko (18 years 336 days) is the fourth youngest finalist at the Canadian Open since 2000, older only than Belinda Bencic (2015), Ana Ivanovic (2006) and Serena Williams (2000).

The first two won the title.

It's happening.

For the better part of two seasons after returning from childbirth, Osaka has grown increasingly frustrated with her inability to find the championship form that brought her four Grand Slam titles.

Coming into Montreal, her comeback record was 37-28. Fine by most standards -- but Osaka isn't most players.

The wait seems to be over.

With a 6-2, 7-6 (7) win over No. 16 seed Clara Tauson in Wednesday night's semifinal, Osaka looked a lot like her vintage self.

She has now won six consecutive matches for the first time since reaching the 2022 Miami Open final. It's ironic -- or is it merely a coincidence -- that she lost that match to Iga Swiatek whose then-coach Tomasz Wiktorowski is now employed by Osaka.

Naomi didn't come to play 😤@naomiosaka puts on a clinical showing to secure her spot in the Montreal final, defeating Tauson 6-2, 7-6(7)!#OBN25 pic.twitter.com/GMIq5FRjub

This is only Osaka's second final in the three years since. The first came in Auckland when she retired with an abdominal injury -- after losing the first set to Tauson.

This time, she finished the job and looked good doing it. Osaka has a bounce in her step and is moving better than she was earlier this year. Against Tauson, there were a number of her signature acutely angled winners. Where there was once passivity there is now passion -- and more than a few “Come ons!”

Osaka served well against Tauson, winning 31 of 41 first-serve points and, more importantly, 20 of 37 second serves. She saved seven of nine break points and converted four of five.

Just a reminder: Only Venus Williams (seven) and Swiatek (six) have more major titles among active players. Osaka seems to be rounding into major form.

The top-two ranked Americans on the ATP Tour will square off for a place in the Toronto final come Wednesday evening at the National Bank Open.Ben Shelton booked a showdown with Taylor Fritz in reaching his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semifinal. The left-hander halted Washington, D.C. champion Alex de Minaur, 6-3, 6-4, to close out Tuesday's action for his first Top 10 win of the season.The runner-up here two years ago, De Minaur came in on a seven-match win streak and leading all ATP players with 24 hard-court victories this year. In a game where he had chances to keep pace, the Australian was the first to crack at 2-3 after catching consecutive shots late—a forehand volley and backhand up the line. Shelton was the more effective hitter with 13 winners (to 14 unforced errors) in seizing control of the scoreboard.

Though the two-time major semifinalist couldn't consolidate an early break in the second set, Shelton immediately recovered. The No. 4 seed outlasted his opponent in a grueling baseline exchange at deuce, which De Minaur followed up with a double fault to hand over the re-break. Shelton ran with the lead from there to become the youngest U.S. man to reach the last four of a 1000-level event since Andy Roddick at 2005 Indian Wells.""I think versatility on the return is really important, and every guy's different. Each of the guys that I played this tournament I had to have a very different return style and plan of attack,"" Shelton told press afterwards. ""And I executed really well tonight, I took away the things that I needed to take away, I played the odds, and I was solid.""

Oh, Canada, indeed! Eighteen-year-old Victoria Mboko advanced to the final of the Omnium Banque National with perhaps the most impressive win of her stunning at the WTA 1000 event in Montreal so far: a match-point saving win over No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina in a third-set tiebreak.Mboko's 1-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) comeback against Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, was her third win over a Grand Slam champion in the last nine days: a first for a Canadian player at one tournament.Aditionally, though she is the fourth home player to reach the final of Canada's signature event in the Open Era, she is the first to do it in Montreal. She is also the third wild card to reach the final at the tournament since 1968, and seeks to be the third to win it. Monica Seles did so in 1995, and Simona Halep followed in 2015.But both were more established players than Mboko, who started the year ranked outside the Top 300 and played just six tour-level main draws previously

Mboko, who beat 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin and No. 1 seed Coco Gauff earlier in the tournament, was blitzed in the first set by Rybakina's first-strike tennis. The Kazakh, seeking her first WTA 1000-level final in more than a year, broke Mboko all three times she served in the opener. She largely wasn't challenged on serve after being broken in her first service game, despite only landing 41% of first serves.But the plot shifted seismically to start the second, as Mboko dug in physically and mentally. After letting leads of 3-0 and 5-3 go, the teenager won back-to-back games to steal the middle set, and shook off a potentially scary moment at the start of the third. Chasing down a ball to start the second game, she went over on her ankle, and landed hard on her wrist.She took a medical timeout at the set's first changeover, and played the rest of the match with some taping on that wrist.

The Cooldown Room - Quiz of the season so far with Victor Martins

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

It was a tough Hungarian Grand Prix weekend for Lewis Hamilton, who dropped out in Q2 and failed to score points.

Lewis Hamilton has insisted that he is still in love with Formula 1, despite the seven-time World Champion's particularly painful weekend last time out in Hungary.

Hamilton described a “big struggle” after Friday's practice sessions at the Hungaroring and dramatically dropped out in the second Qualifying phase, while Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc went on to claim pole position.

Afterwards, Hamilton's comments made headlines around the world when he described himself as “absolutely useless” and suggested Ferrari “probably need to change driver” as a result.

On race day, the Briton started and finished 12th, leading to another brief round of interviews with broadcasters, during which he said he is “looking forward to going away” over the summer break.

In his post-race conversation with Sky Sports F1, Hamilton was asked to expand on that driver change comment and whether he could help viewers understand the remarks.

“Not particularly,” came his response. “When you have a feeling, you have a feeling. There's a lot going on in the background that is not great.”

When pushed in a follow-up question if he had lost his love for the sport, Hamilton stated: “No, I still love racing.”

Despite his recent struggles, Hamilton has contributed to Ferrari sitting second in the Teams' Championship after 14 of 24 rounds, with the Scuderia holding 260 points to third-placed Mercedes' haul of 236. In the Drivers' battle, Hamilton sits sixth overall on 109 points, with Leclerc occupying fifth on a haul of 151.

Over the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend, Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicalli also voiced his opinion in support of the Ferrari driver.

“First of all, Lewis is a jewel, he is an incredible athlete, so no matter if it is a difficult moment, he will react, and I'm pretty sure he will show the reason why he is here,” he told Sky Sports F1.

“He wants to achieve his eighth title, and he will triumph again. So, stay with Lewis and he will do a great race, and be very, very strong after the summer [break].”

Franco Colapinto suffered a crash on the second morning of Pirelli's post-Hungarian Grand Prix test, Alpine have confirmed.

Alpine, McLaren, Ferrari and Racing Bulls are all taking part in the two-day test at the Hungaroring, which is being used for 2026 tyre development work.

However, after taking over driving duties from test and reserve driver Paul Aron on Wednesday, Colapinto had an off at Turn 11 that halted his running.

Alpine, who are also fielding Pierre Gasly at the test, described Colapinto as “okay” following medical checks.

“During Day 2 of Pirelli Tyre Testing at the Hungaroring this morning, Franco Colapinto had an incident at Turn 11,” read a brief statement from Alpine.

“Franco was assessed on site at the Medical Centre and is okay.”

Other drivers who have been in action at the test are last weekend's race winner Lando Norris for McLaren, Liam Lawson for Racing Bulls and Charles Leclerc for Ferrari.

Pirelli's test is aimed at evaluating 2026 tyre constructions (which need to be homologated by September 1) and prototype compounds (which need to be homologated by December 15).

After this week's outing at the Hungaroring, six more days of 2026 testing have been planned: two each at Italian tracks Monza and Mugello, and two in Mexico City.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

It was another intriguing weekend at the Hungaroring from a technical perspective, as Mark Hughes explains and Giorgio Piola illustrates.

The Hungaroring presents a potentially tricky combination of demands, given that it's a track which heavily rewards raw downforce but which can have very high cooling demands.

The combination of a Budapest summer with the relative lack of straight-line running, plus long corners where the front wheels are on lock for a long time, diverting airflow away from the radiator inlets, means that the bodywork will have to be opened up extensively.

This extracts a high cost aerodynamically. So, the conflict in demands and the jeopardy involved in trying to maximise performance, is quite explicit.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

Belgium's most successful F1 driver is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Jacky Ickx didn't grow up wanting to be a racing driver, so how did he become Belgium's most successful Formula 1 driver and one of the most versatile racers in the history of motorsport?

Competing in all types of cars and competitions, not only did Ickx win eight F1 races and finish runner-up in the Drivers' Standings twice, but he was also a serial winner in Le Mans, the World Endurance Championship and even the Paris-Dakar rally.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, Ickx tells the remarkable story of how he made his F1 debut in a Formula 2 car at the 1966 German Grand Prix. At that time, F2 cars were allowed to race alongside F1 machinery because of how long the iconic Nürburgring Nordschleife track was.

Ickx reveals how his impressive performances in the F2 car led to him joining Ferrari in 1968, why he left the team after just one season, only to return a year later, and what his relationship with Enzo Ferrari was like.

Ickx also remembers how he felt finishing runner-up in 1970 to Jochen Rindt, the only driver to be crowned World Champion posthumously, and you'll hear the story of his inspirational one-man protest on track that changed the safety of Le Mans forever.

The Cooldown Room - Quiz of the season so far with Victor Martins

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

Lewis Hamilton is experiencing a difficult phase at Ferrari, but his former boss Toto Wolff has spoken out in support.

Toto Wolff has given his take on Lewis Hamilton's recent self-criticism, arguing that the Briton remains “the greatest of all time” and should stay in the sport “for many more years”.

Hamilton made headlines over the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend when he reacted to a surprise Q2 exit by describing himself as “absolutely useless” and suggesting Ferrari “probably need to change driver”.

After starting and finishing 12th in the race, Hamilton added that he was “looking forward to going away” for the summer break, with “a lot going on in the background that is not great”.

Asked for his reaction to Hamilton's comments following last weekend's action at the Hungaroring, Mercedes boss Wolff said: “That is Lewis wearing his heart on his sleeve.

“It's what he thought very much when he was asked after the session. It was very raw. He was doubting himself.

“We had it in the past when he felt that he underperformed his own expectations. He's been that emotionally transparent since he was a young boy or a young adult. So, he's going to beat himself up.

“He's the GOAT and he will always be the GOAT, and nobody is going to take that away. For sure, no single weekend or race season that hasn't gone to plan. That's something he needs to always remember – he's the greatest of all time.”

Wolff and Hamilton worked together at Mercedes from 2013 to 2024, a period that yielded six of the 40-year-old's seven world titles – the other achieved with McLaren back in 2008.

Hamilton came close to adding an eighth crown in a fiercely contested 2021 season, which saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen triumph in dramatic circumstances at the Abu Dhabi finale.

“Lewis has unfinished business in F1,” Wolff continued, as he pondered Hamilton's future.

“In the same way that Mercedes underperformed over this latest set of regulations since 2022 and kind of never got happy with ground effect cars… in the same way it beats him.

“Maybe it's linked to driving style. He shouldn't go anywhere next year. Brand new cars, completely different to drive, new power units that need an intelligent way of managing the energy.

“That's absolutely on for Lewis and I hope he stays on for many more years. Certainly, next year is going to be an important one.”

Pressed on whether he believes Hamilton can still win an eighth title, Wolff commented: “I think if he has a car underneath him that he has confidence in, that does what he wants, then yes.

“If he has a car that's not giving him the feedback that he wants, and that was the Mercedes of the past few years, and that seems to be the Ferrari and even worse, then not.

“But you ask me whether he has it… he definitely has it.”

Directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans and Netflix film boss Dan Lin weigh in on how a unique concept and authenticity propelled the animated feature into long-term success. 


							By 

	Nicole Fell


Assistant Editor


	“It could have gone totally off the rails and gotten weird in a bad way,” KPop Demon Hunters co-director Maggie Kang jokes to The Hollywood Reporter.


	The animated feature has officially shot to the No. 4 spot on Netflix's most popular English-language films list with 158.8 million views, according to data released Tuesday. The project — which chronicles the adventures of Huntrix, a girl group comprised of three members who just happen to also fight monsters from the underworld — has been a surprise hit for the streamer, and its soundtrack has spent several weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 chart.

Demon Hunters has done surprisingly well considering the fact it is original IP, something of a rarity in successful animation in recent years. Going into the film, Netflix execs say they knew they had an audience who would tune in, but the scope of Demon Hunter's reach has grown far past that initial target demographic.

	“We knew younger female audiences and K-pop [and] anime fans would love this film, but it's been incredibly gratifying to see it embraced by an even broader audience and become a favorite film for both adults and kids,” Dan Lin, chairman of Netflix, film tells THR. “Adults are watching the movie with their friends or other family members, kids are watching with their friends and siblings.”

	











	The film has inspired TikTok trends — real K-pop groups, like Zerobaseone, has recreated the film's fictional boy group Saja Boys — along with a dedicated fanbase online. “It's also so fun to see the KPDH music covers, cosplay, dance reels and fan art online, made by everyday fans all the way to BTS,” Lin says. BTS' youngest member Jungkook even broke down in detail his thoughts on the movie for his fans on a livestream, leading the streamer's social media page to change its bio to, “Jungkook watched KPop Demon Hunters.”


	Kang worked on the project for seven years, even before her co-director Chris Appelhans got involved. Kang notes that during those seven years the film went through many different phases, which is process she admits could be grueling.


	“It's really hard to stay motivated, but you kind of have to be proactive really and push through and really prove yourself … prove to the studio that you can direct a movie,” she says. “I feel like at every stage we've had to do that.”


	The film, which is rooted in Korean shamanism, really took shape when Kang and Appelhans started digging into the mythology. “It opened up the possibilities of being able to show old-time Korea and made it a lot more historic and really legitimized it more into the culture,” Kang says, adding that the culturally specific elements make it clear that the film isn't just about K-pop. “This is very culturally Korean, on a deeper level.”


	Lin says Netflix is always “looking for powerful new stories, refreshing new voices and daring new approaches” in their films. “KPDH is a perfect example of this approach,” he says, adding that he and Netflix's head of animation, Hannah Minghella, are “thrilled to be supporting Maggie and Chris as filmmakers and Kristine Belson and her team at Sony Animation” as their studio partner.

	











	“Netflix allows our films to build their audience organically and over time,” says Lin. “As word of mouth spread and social media caught on, we saw viewing really take off and the movie became a cultural phenomenon — it's one of the only animated films to grow its audiences in its fifth and six weeks of release.”


	Kang and Appelhans say that the fact that Demon Hunters was original IP makes the project a bit more personal, but it wasn't something they thought about until they started doing press for the film. “It needs to come from a personal place. There needs to be some artistic personal vision to it,” Appelhans says.


	“I remember when I sat down with Maggie that what occurred to me as she was talking, what a cool idea. But also here's this talented person who's been working in the animation industry. She has collected things that mean something to her [and] that she wants to see in a film and it hasn't happened yet,” he explains.


	“She's now [saying] I want to do it. I want to make a thing like this,” Appelhans continues, adding that his wife, an author, has always urged him to make his female characters more real. This is something Kang was championing — badass characters who also veg out on the couch without makeup on.


	Kang and Appelhans say they and their crew never took themselves too seriously, something they think helped take this unique premise to the next level. “We joked through the entire production that this idea is completely wackadoo and kind of stupid. It's very random,” Kang says. “I know that having put it together, and we all know it. Every time we talk about it, we're like, this is such a dumb idea. This is so stupid, and it could go very weird.”

	











	But Kang says the team embraced the outlandish nature of the project and aimed to prove that they weren't just capitalizing off the popularity of K-pop. “I think we just all wanted to prove everybody wrong, but everybody that came on board just really believed in it,” she says. “We found the heart of the movie really quickly.”


	Given the success of Demon Hunters, the suggestion of sequels or continuations have, of course, been top of mind for fans and creatives alike. Despite previous reports that a live-action version of the film is forthcoming, sources tell THR that Netflix has no plans for a live-action film at this time.


	“I think it's going to be part of our lives for a bit. I don't see the fandom slowing down. We hit an all time high in viewership in week five, which is absolutely insane,” Kang says of the directors' future with the project. 


	Lin notes that Netflix is proud of Demon Hunter's success and “are excited to explore what could be the next adventure for Huntrix.” 


	Says Lin: “KPDH‘s success comes from its original, fresh story so if we do embark on a sequel, we would want to take our time to make sure that any future stories we tell with our favorite demon hunters retains the flair and uniqueness of the first film.”

A letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders on Thursday said that 'Superman' director Gunn is working on 'Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow,' 'Clayface', and the next 'Wonder Woman'.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Robert Pattinson‘s diary continues to fill up as Matt Reeves‘ The Batman sequel is preparing to shoot in the spring, according to Warner Bros. Discovery.


The Batman Part II will finally begin filming next year, the company said in a letter to shareholders Thursday, aiming for an Oct. 1, 2027 theatrical release. Reeves completed the script in June.




	His first DC film premiered to huge success in 2022, grossing over $770 million worldwide. Pattinson starred in the titular role and will return to Gotham in part two. He's been busy so far this year, shooting other tentpole features such as Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey and Denis Villeneuve's Dune 3.

	Elsewhere, “James Gunn is already preparing to write the next installment in the Super family,” David Zaslav also confirmed, with the letter detailing that Gunn is working on Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (2026), Clayface (2026), and the next Wonder Woman.




			Popular on THR		







	Gunn's Superman hit with David Corenswet at the forefront has surpassed $500 million at the global box office. Warner Bros. continued: “DC Studio's universe of characters represents not only one of Warner Bros. Discovery's most valuable pieces of intellectual property, but one of the most valuable assets in entertainment.”


	Gunn came to Reeves' defense last year on social media when fans were criticizing the five-year gap between The Batman and The Batman Part II. “To be fair, a 5 year gap or more is fairly common in sequels,” the DC Studios co-CEO said. “7 years between Alien and Aliens. 14 years between Incredibles. 7 years between the first two Terminators. 13 years between Avatars. 36 years between Top Guns. And, of course, 6 years between Guardians Vol 2 and Vol 3.”

	











	“People should get off Matt's nuts because it's like, let the guy write the screenplay in the amount of time he needs to write it,” he continued. “That's just the way it is. He doesn't owe you something because you like his movie. I mean, you like his movie because of Matt. So let Matt do things the way he does.”


	The letter also said: “The 10-year vision for the DC universe also includes an exciting array of television projects, including The Penguin, which recently garnered 24 Emmy nominations and was watched by nearly 20 million HBO Max subscribers, the upcoming new season of Peacemaker, and the debut of Lanterns in 2026.”


	“In a precise and measured way, the DC franchise will increasingly overlay across the studio's broader efforts: from film and TV to consumer products, games, experiences and social.”

THR's TV Producer of the Year offers an Rx for what's ailing the industry and candidly examines the high highs (‘The West Wing') and bizarre lows (racist ‘E.R.' notes) of his own spectacularly prolific career.


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


	Since he got his start in Hollywood nearly 40 years ago, John Wells has averaged more successes per decade than most creatives accumulate over an entire career.


	The prolific writer, director, producer and filmmaker's latest feat is The Pitt, a real-time medical drama that spans one 12-hour emergency room shift in a 15-episode season. Reuniting Wells with former ER collaborators R. Scott Gemmill and Noah Wyle, the HBO Max procedural launched unexpectedly into the zeitgeist with its January premiere ­­— thanks in part to weekly drops (how novel!) that saw the audience quickly pass 10 million per episode. This is hardly Wells' first time scrubbing in for TV. He cut his teeth writing on China Beach, then developed ER with the late Michael Crichton and co-created Third Watch. Along the way, he also made the U.S. version of Shameless, directed four films (including the celebrated adaptation of August: Osage County) and ran a little series called The West Wing.

	Riding high on The Pitt‘s 13 Emmy nominations and the summer dominance of the Eric Bana Netflix breakout Untamed (already renewed), the power producer and two-time WGA West president sat down at his Hollywood office in July to talk about the future of his latest hit, his concerns for the industry and the wildest exchanges he's had with the standards and practices department.


The Pitt, as a format, is a bit of an experiment. What did you learn in season one that you're applying to season two?


	The first year of the show, you've introduced the characters — which takes up a lot of screen time. What propels the show now is the immediacy, the urgency of being in this setting with what's happening in American health care right now. And that's only getting more dramatic because these Medicaid reductions are going to directly hit the urban and rural hospitals delivering primary care. It's just going to get worse.

	











As for the characters you've introduced, you made a bit of news with the departure of Tracy Ifeachor. What went into that decision?


	Look, the show is set at a teaching hospital. And if you're a fourth-year resident in a teaching hospital, your time there is done at the end of that year. Not to scare any of the other castmembers, but people don't stay at these hospitals forever. They're going to roll off, and that will be part of the evolution of the show. We're not committed to doing a year every season as we go on, but we can't say that we're going to be true to the medicine and teaching hospitals and maintain the same cast for the entire time.


So you're planning large time jumps between seasons?


	Because we're only doing one day over the course of a season, we could do the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the same week. But we're not. We're going to be jumping. From the fall in the first season to the Fourth of July for the second. The beginning of the residency year usually starts on July 1, so everybody will have moved up and there'll be new people coming in.


What is lost and what is gained in telling a story this way? You and Noah obviously worked on ER together, where you could get slow-burn relationship drama like you had with George Clooney and Julianna Margulies.


	One of the advantages is we are not able to play medical melodrama in the sense of long-term relationship issues. You're dropping in on people at a specific day and time, so you may discover that somebody's been having a relationship. And it may be a crisis point in that relationship on that particular day. Having written or been involved in the writing or writing 70-ish episodes of China Beach, 332 episodes of ER and another 170 episodes of Third Watch, we've written a lot of medical melodrama. Part of my first conversation with Scott and Noah was that we don't really want to tell those stories anymore. This is not where you're going to get your romantic Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway story, and it's a bit liberating.

	











China Beach has never been on streaming hasn't it?


	We are trying still to get China Beach going! I was a writer on that show, it was Bill Broyles and John Young who created it. The problem is that it was filled with Motown music, and the cost for getting that is high. There are a number of shows from that time period caught in that same issue. Warner Brothers has tried and gotten closer, but it really should be steaming.


Last time we spoke, you said that the most troubling recent conversation you've had with an executive was about shooting outside of L.A. What else worries you?


	The lack of big swings. It's a very dangerous moment in the industry. So many people have been let go. So many executives are no longer executives. So many people are out in the marketplace looking for work. And that has had a chilling effect on taking risks, especially since shows have gotten more and more expensive. People are frightened in the executive ranks. It takes tremendous courage to say to somebody, “Go make this show, here's $60 million for 15 episodes or $80 million for eight episodes.”


So what can someone in your position do about it? 


	We have to be aware of how much these shows are going to cost while we're writing them. You have to be thinking how you're going to produce the show before you even sell it. Otherwise, somebody is going tell you to make it in Budapest.

	











When did that become part of the job?


	When everything exploded, and we were making so many shows with not a lot of concern about how much those shows were costing. It was out of control. A lot of people made a lot of money. And that's great. But we're on the other side now, and [studios] went from wanting it to be under $10 million an episode to under $8 million to $6 million.


How would you define a big swing in this marketplace? Is it Donald Glover shooting Mr. & Mrs. Smith all over Europe or adapting big IP?


	I don't necessarily mean a big financial swing. And is that actually what the audience is watching? I have kids in their 20s, and they want to know how many episodes there are going to be if they get involved with something. They don't want six or seven episodes. They're like, “Are there 100 episodes of this?”


One thing I don't think gets enough attention is how harmful the delays between seasons can be to audience relationships with the material. Is it important for you to get The Pitt back on the air as soon as possible? 


	I completely agree. How am I supposed to keep a fandom with something when I can't even remember what happened two and a half years later? We're essentially returning the exact same day that we premiered. It will be the eighth of January — 365 days later. And with all due respect to all of my friends who make TV, there is no reason these shows can't be on every year. These delays are becoming even more conspicuous now that the series load is diminishing. It was so crowded that you could almost use that as an excuse.

	











In this trepidatious if not fearful marketplace, what are buyers looking for right now? What are you hearing that people want? 


	I keep hearing that people want The Pitt. (Laughs.) People want shows that can come back on a regular basis with a strong cast and at a number that makes sense for the studio and platform that's doing it. That's nothing new, but it seems like we're having to rediscover it again as if we hadn't all known this for a long time.


What other trends have you noticed? 


	Netflix is trying to build this huge library because they don't have one. And everybody is suspicious now that everybody else is selling stuff to them again. Animal Kingdom was the No. 3 show on Netflix the other day. That was a good show. We had a good time making it, but it's also been available on Amazon ever since we were on the air. Shameless was on Showtime for years. Then Warners sold [the library] to Netflix in our year five or six. It turned into a huge hit on Netflix. We had been winding down and ended up doing five more years because of that. Ask somebody who made Shameless and they'll probably tell you Netflix.


Speaking of Shameless, you cast Jeremy Allen White in his breakthrough role. He's kind of a big thing now.


	He was 18, just out of high school. He showed up, did a fantastic job and then stayed the entire 11 years. I couldn't be happier for him. A similar thing happened with George Clooney. We cast him, and that first year he's “the sexiest man alive.” But he stuck around for his entire five-year contract, and he never asked for a raise. I've been very fortunate to work with a lot of people like that. Noah, of course. Regina King on Southland. Watching her success has been fantastic.

	











Who are the executives you've had the best experiences with?


	There have been a lot of great creative partners. It sounds funny now, but the three executives on ER were David Nevins, John Landgraf and Kevin Reilly. Jinny Howe worked as my assistant before she ran television here. Now she's head of drama at Netflix. But TV exec is a really, really hard job. Warren Littlefield was at NBC when we were making those shows, and I watched him just get beat to hell. Pounded over and over for having good taste. When I was at ABC, Brandon Stoddard literally lost his job for putting Twin Peaks, China Beach and thirtysomething on the air. They fired him for being too elite.


What's some bullshit that you had to deal with back then that you'd never have to deal with now? Not because of your stature but because of how things work.


	Liz Meriwether was surprised that I still get notes, and I want to dissuade anyone from thinking that having had success means that the job itself changes substantially. It gives you more credibility in responding to notes, but it does not change the amount coming in. But I really appreciate not dealing with standards and practices on a daily basis anymore. It's fear-based and doesn't respect the audience's intelligence and sophistication.


What are some of the more infuriating ones? 












	I had huge discussions during the ER days about racial storylines. “Could this Black character actually kiss this white character?” This in 1998! I was like, “Guys, what are we even talking about?” A big storyline we did in the third season of ER was Gloria Reuben's character being HIV positive. There were real conversations where they said, “So, she's going to survive? Should she survive?” It's HIV. It's terrifying. But there were already many, many people in the world dealing with it. And to suggest that anybody who becomes infected dies, that's not the message that we wanted moving through the world.


You've been coy on this, but there must be a line you're not willing to cross on The Pitt in terms of the graphic medical stuff. 


	We want nothing to be gratuitous, and it's only what the doctors would really see. We don't want to do emergency medicine porn, where we're just daring the audience to watch.


Do you have any squeamish people on staff?


	I'm squeamish about eyes. I just shot the first episode of season two, and there's an eye thing. I said, “Do I have to do the eye one?”


With distance from it now, how do you look back on the experience of Aaron Sorkin quitting The West Wing in season five and leaving you on the hook to keep it going?


	That was not what I was planning to do that year. (Laughs.) Professionally, as a writer, that was the hardest thing. It's not like we didn't still have a great staff in place, but at that point it was widely considered to be the best show on television — though there's certainly people who'd argue for The Sopranos. And I might argue that for some of the episodes, for sure. But it was pressure. We went back in the writers room, looked at each other, and I said, “Aaron doesn't have any idea about where the story goes, so we're just going to do the best that we can and hope that the audience would come along.” And they did. I would never argue that I wrote an episode as good as Aaron or rose to those same heights, but I was proud that we maintained that show.

	











Many actors, and even Aaron, occasionally tease reviving that show. Do you think there's a way to do it?


	Aaron and I have talked about it a number of times. My worry — and never say never — has always been that when the show existed, it was not perceived as one-sided. It was clearly liberal, but it wasn't progressive. It was actually very centrist. What's happening now, that's not the world in which it was written, so I'd be worried that it would be perceived as a statement. What the show was trying to do is highlight the sacrifice in public service, that these people are really good, well-meaning people, and I don't think anybody would let us do that in this polarized climate.


You've launched many shows over the years. You've made a lot of movies. What's a misfire that you think should have done better?


	Ten years ago, I did a pilot at Fox with Krista Vernoff. While we were casting, I was in London, where I'd been asked to watch this small film for some other reason. But there was this young woman in it, and I thought, “Oh, she'd be perfect for our show.” It was Florence Pugh! She was only 18 years old, and we brought her over to shoot this pilot. She was incredible. It was the biggest shock when they didn't pick it up.


What about something that made it to air? 


	We did a show called Smith [in 2006] with Ray Liotta and Virginia Madsen for CBS. Great cast. I really loved it, but no one showed up. They only aired three episodes. I don't want to say “ahead of its time,” but it was very violent for a broadcast network at the time. And it was a show about the bad guys.

	











That show was dark. CBS might not have been the place for it. 


	Les Moonves later told me that it definitely was not. (Laughs.)

The Grammy winner released a video for ""I'm Goin' In Till October"" that pokes fun at the controversy. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Lizzo is calling out Sydney Sweeney‘s controversial American Eagle jeans ad in a new song.


	On Wednesday, the four-time Grammy winner released two clips from a track on social media that  name-dropped Sweeney and referenced the viral ad.




	In one video snippet for “I'm Goin' In Till October” (below), Lizzo is clad in torn denim while hosing down a Porsche and raps, “No kizzy, he ain't got no business being with me. Fat ass pretty face with the titties. Bitch, I got good jeans like I'm Sydney.” (Or perhaps that should be “genes”?).

	In the second video, Lizzo opens with a clip of a cable news pundit doing a celebratory rant about the Sweeney ad, declaring, “We're over this woke agenda. We are over the Lizzos, we are over the Dylan Mulvaneys. If this were a 300-pound non-binary person they would be applauding her.” Then the video cuts to Lizzo lounging in head-to-toe denim, similar to the Sweeney ad. Lizzo commented on the video, “Lizzo's got good jeans.” 


	The messaging could be seen as a push-back on the Sweeney ad. But it could also be taken as a positive for the American Eagle campaign. The company tried to make the point in a statement on the controversy last week that the marketing effort was meant to be inclusive, and Lizzo adopting the “great jeans” tag for herself could be seen as a co-sign of it's intended message. As company put it in its statement, “We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.”

	











	The campaign has been been perhaps the most controversial and talked-about marketing effort since — on the other side of the culture-war spectrum — trans activist Mulvaney did a brand endorsement for Bud Light in 2023. The Mulvaney deal was just an influencer partnership that went viral, however, while the Sweeney deal is a major ad campaign. Also, Bud Light's sales tanked in the wake of the ad, while it's not yet clear which direction American Eagle's sales may have shifted. Sweeney's other recent brand deals include Armani Beauty, Miu Miu, Laneige, HeyDude, Bai, Baskin Robbins and Ford.


	The Lizzo song follows up on Trump swooning over the news that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida last year, telling reporters earlier this week, “Now I love her ad! … If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.” 

You're cute jeans 😌

Lizzo's got Good Jeans™️


	At the center of the controversy has been a clip that finds Sweeney saying, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The line inspired a heated debate with many online critics insisting the ad was a dog whistle promoting white supremacy.


	Sweeney has not responded to the uproar. She next stars in the crime thriller Americana being released this month and in December's highly anticipated adaption of the Freida McFadden bestseller The Housemaid.

The singer shared that she needs ""to be fully present"" for her children.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


Kelly Clarkson is postponing the remaining August dates of her Las Vegas residency to take care of her family.


	The singer made the announcement late Wednesday night on Instagram, writing in part, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”




	Clarkson's last Vegas show was on Saturday, Aug. 2 and she was set to resume her Studio Sessions performances on Friday, Aug. 8 as the first of four more shows in August at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. The residency is set to resume in November.

	The move comes after Clarkson delayed the start of her residency by a week, announcing that postponement shortly before the shows were set to kick off on July 4. That delay, Clarkson said, was due to vocal issues.

	“We have been working 24/7 to make Studio Sessions the most intimate and extraordinary experience with and for my incredible fans,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “I am beyond grateful that you always show up for me and I am devastated to have to postpone tonight and tomorrow's opening at Caesars. The prep and rehearsals have taken a toll on my voice.” 


	She added, “I want the shows to be perfect for y'all and I need to protect myself from doing serious damage so I am taking this weekend and next week to rest up so that we can deliver what you all deserve. The show is truly incredible. The musicians and singers are outstanding, and I want us all to start out strong.”

	











	The singer was also absent from a number of episodes of her eponymous NBC daytime talk show earlier this year, prompting concern from fans as guest hosts filled in.


	Clarkson and ex-husband Brandon Blackstock, with whom she shares two children, were married from 2013 to 2020 before divorcing.


	Clarkson, who announced her Studio Sessions Vegas residency in February, recently sold a stake in her catalog to HarbourView Equity Partners, with the company saying the deal includes a portion of her biggest hits including “Since U Been Gone,” “Because of You,” “Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),” “Behind These Hazel Eyes,” and “Underneath the Tree.”


	The size of the stake, how much was paid and what type of rights weren't revealed.

The ‘Outer Banks' creators tapped William Lipton, Axel Ellis, Jeremy Yun, Zendé Murdock and Jesse Golliher to form a teenage rock band, and then let the cameras roll.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Outer Banks creators Jonas and Josh Pate tapped real-life musicians to form a teenage rock band that features in the official trailer for Prime Video's The Runarounds, which dropped on Thursday.


	Rockers William Lipton, Axel Ellis, Jeremy Yun, Zendé Murdock and Jesse Golliher became the actors behind the teenage rock band The Runarounds at the center of the musical coming-of-age drama set to bow on Sept. 1 on the streaming platform worldwide.




	Along with fellow cast members Lilah Pate, Maximo Salas, Kelley Pereira, Marley Aliah, Mark Wystrach, Brooklyn Decker, Hayes MacArthur and Shea Pritchard, the band members after high school graduation chase rock fame and success in Wilmington, North Carolina, while falling in love and partying as they pursue their dreams.

	“When you see them on stage, I love passion like that,” Outer Banks star Lilah Pate, who plays Sophia Kinney in The Runarounds, says at one point in the trailer. The rock band had time to gel in front of the cameras.




			Related Video		







	The Runarounds was formed as a band in 2021, when Jonas Pate issued a casting call for a group to appear on Outer Banks. The group first performed together when they played for Pate ahead of appearing in season three after being selected from more than 5,000 musicians who responded to the casting call.

	











	At the time, Pate had already begun writing what ultimately became The Runarounds, and the group filmed the pilot with Pate in 2022 and has since recorded an EP and gone out on tour.  


	A synopsis from the producers reads: “Over the course of one unforgettable summer, they throw themselves into the pursuit of their big break — falling in love, getting into trouble and building the kind of bonds that feel like family along the way. With original music, romantic entanglements and the raw highs and lows of coming-of-age, The Runarounds captures the rush of risking everything at the edge of adulthood to chase your dreams.” 


The Runarounds, which like Outer Banks was shot in North Carolina, is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Skydance Television. The executive producer credits are shared by Jonas Pate, Joon Yun, David Wilcox, Josh Pate, Shannon Burke, Scott Lambert, Lisa Mae Fincannon, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Matt Thunell.

In this week's The Contenders, it's a three-way battle for the No. 1 spot.  


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 16, we look at whether Chappell Roan's new single will be able to get into the mix with KPop Demon Hunters and Alex Warren in the fight atop the Hot 100.

Chappell Roan, “The Subway” (KRA/Amusement/Island/Republic): Like New Yorkers anxious to get to work on time, Chappell Roan's fans had been waiting for “The Subway” far longer than they'd initially expected. Roan had debuted the song at a couple live dates in summer 2024, but for the next year, there was no indication of an imminent studio release. Then finally, last month, reports of Chappell filming a new music video in New York began to circulate, followed by an official announcement weeks later that the song would finally arrive on the evening of Thursday, July 31, with an official video to follow Friday morning.

	Fans were certainly ready for the dreamy new song, which debuted atop the Spotify Daily Top Songs USA chart — with over 3.9 million streams in its first full day of release, a high for 2025 — while also briefly topping the iTunes real-time chart, and shooting to the top of YouTube's Trending chart for music once its video was released the next morning. (The song's impact on the Apple Music real-time charts has been somewhat less, as it has thus far peaked at No. 6.) The song's daily numbers have perhaps inevitably receded from that first-day boom, but remain robust, with “Subway” reigning for most of the week on the Spotify daily chart. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Will it be enough for “The Subway” to pull in atop the Hot 100? That might be a challenge, as it will not be getting any help from physical sales — the vinyl single of the song sold on Roan's website is currently scheduled to ship “on or before Halloween” — and not much support yet from radio, though the song has early boosters in SiriusXM's Hits 1, iHeartMedia's WIHT Washington, D.C., and Cox Media Group's WBLI Long Island, N.Y., with far more stations still playing her enduring hit “Pink Pony Club” (No. 11 on Radio Songs this week).  


	But if the new song can gain a little extra momentum on streaming late in the week, and maybe find a small extra boost or two — like Roan's Island labelmate Sabrina Carpenter did on her way to a No. 1 debut for “Manchild” a couple months ago — it's not impossible that “Subway” could find its way to the top. And regardless, a debut in the top three seems very likely, which would make the song the highest-charting of Roan's career, passing the shared No. 4 peaks of current signature hits “Good Luck, Babe!” and the aforementioned “Pink Pony Club.”  


HUNTR/X, EJAE, Audrey Nuna & Rei Ami, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): It's six weeks now into the pop culture takeover of KPop Demon Hunters, and against all odds, the soundtrack is still growing. The Netflix soundtrack currently claims the No. 2 spots on both the Billboard 200 (with the full film soundtrack) and the Hot 100 (with HUNTR/X's “Golden”), with the gaps shrinking every week between it and Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem and Alex Warren's “Ordinary” on the two charts, respectively. 


	It's a little closer to clearing that final hurdle on the Hot 100, with “Golden” having long lapped “Ordinary” on DSPs — it's now led Streaming Songs for two weeks — and also sitting right behind it on the Digital Song Sales chart this week (Nos. 4 and 5, respectively). The question of radio remains, but “Golden” is also starting to really make its presence felt there: the song is up 73% in plays Aug. 1-4 over the same period the week before, according to Luminate, and approaching the top 25 on Pop Airplay next week.  

	











	If “Golden” continues to surge, this could be the week it has its moment atop the Hot 100. 


Alex Warren, “Ordinary” (Atlantic): Don't count out “Ordinary” just yet: After finally starting to slip in radio airplay last week, the nine-week Hot 100 No. 1 has rebounded slightly this week, and the song should secure an eighth week atop the Radio Songs chart. This is happening while his subsequent single “On My Mind” with ROSÉ is also gaining in airplay and his brand-new “Eternity” is also drawing some early radio attention. And like “Golden,” “Ordinary” has been discounted to 69 cents on iTunes for this tracking week — and is benefiting from buzz over his and Luke Combs' Lollapalooza performance of the song – meaning Warren and his team are still hoping to secure that benchmark 10th week atop the Hot 100 before potentially falling to Roan or HUNTR/X.

It didn't take long before Dionne Warwick called him out.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Piers Morgan has caused a stir online with a recent string of posts about Beyoncé, whom the British TV personality jokingly accused of “cultural appropriation” in a Marilyn Monroe-esque Levi's photo shoot.  


	It all started with a Wednesday (Aug. 6) post on X, in which Morgan shared a photo of the pop superstar modeling Levi's denim and sporting bouncy blonde curls. “Very disappointed to see Beyoncé culturally appropriate Marilyn Monroe in her new Levi's ad,” the media personality wrote.

	











	It wasn't long before people came to Bey's defense in the replies, lambasting Morgan for dissing the 35-time Grammy winner and misusing the term “cultural appropriation,” as the late actress was a person and not a culture. Morgan, however, continued stirring the pot, sharing an old photo of himself with Bey and writing, “I would say I can't believe anyone took my obvious Beyoncé joke post seriously … but I forgot the woke brigade have zero sense of humour.” 


	And in response to one commenter who said that the Destiny's Child alum is “hotter” than the late Hollywood icon, Morgan said, “I don't disagree.”


Billboard has reached out to Bey's rep for comment.


	This is far from the first time Morgan has sparked discourse by making inflammatory remarks on his social media accounts, or on his show Uncensored. He's also not the only person who's had something to say about Bey's campaign with Levi's, with Megyn Kelly recently dissing it as “artificial, fake, enhanced [and] trying too hard” while praising Sydney Sweeney's widely criticized American Eagle jeans commercials.

	











	But while Kelly was being totally serious with her comments, Morgan has asserted that he was just joking in his post about Bey. In response to iconic singer Dionne Warwick commenting that he was “getting involved in women's business again,” he wrote, “Oh not you too, Dionne… it was a JOKE!”


	That said, Morgan did double down on a controversial take. “I think the whole concept of ‘cultural appropriation' is bulls–t,” he added on Wednesday. “What's wrong with celebrating another country's fashion, food etc?”


	The back-and-forth comes about 10 months after the last notable time Morgan got himself in trouble with the BeyHive. In October, the British contrarian invited singer-songwriter Jaguar Wright onto Uncensored and aired her claims that Bey and Jay-Z were “monsters” with “hundreds of victims,” shortly after which the famous couple's lawyers denied the allegations and demanded that Morgan remove them from the episode. 


	The show host obliged, telling viewers at the time, “There are legal limits on us, too … We apologize to Jay-Z and Beyoncé.”


	Beyoncé has not commented on any of the drama surrounding her Levi's campaign, which has been ongoing since last year. She and the fashion brand recently released a new commercial showcasing the star trading in her horse for a motorcycle, something many fans believe was a hint that her next LP will be a rock album.

	As Metallica announce one of their most intimate gigs to date, the group have addressed rumors their celebrated live show will be heading to the Las Vegas Sphere.


	While metal icons Metallica are currently gearing up to embark upon the home stretch of their 2025 touring plans with shows in Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the group have announced a special one-off show in New York later this month.

	Taking place on Aug. 28 at Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett on Long Island, the 250-capacity venue makes the show one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers' most intimate to date. 


	Presented by SiriusXM to celebrate the launch of the Maximum Metallica channel the following day, tickets are being distributed via contests by both the band and Sirius XM.


	Per Brooklyn Vegan, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich spoke to Howard Stern on Wednesday (Aug. 6) to discuss the upcoming gig, where the co-founding percussionist also addressed current rumors that the band may be bringing their show to Las Vegas venue Sphere as one of its famed residencies.


	According to a recent report by Vital Vegas, unnamed sources have pointed towards a potential residency from Metallica at the Sphere in fall 2026. However, Ulrich stated he was unable to confirm these rumors due to there being “nothing to confirm.”

	











	“But I'm not going to deny it, because we're all such fans of this venue,” he explained. “All of our managers and our production people have been there and looked at it. It's something that we're considering, [but] nothing is etched in stone or green-lit. It's something that we're looking at at some point when the 2026 tour is done.”


	Officially known as Sphere at the Venetian Resort, the immersive venue officially opened its doors in September 2023, with U2 launching a 40-date run of shows at the venue. Since then, the likes of Phish, Dead & Company, the Eagles, and Kenny Chesney have all performed residencies, with the Zac Brown Band set to appear following the completion of the Backstreet Boys' current run of shows.


	“I was there seeing U2 the first night, when they took that stage, I wanted to see it for myself before I saw it on YouTube or read about it,” Ulrich told Stern. “I was there, like everybody else that was there that night, I was completely blown away, and felt that was the beginning of another chapter in live performances.”


	“I'm not going to bulls–t you, I would f–king love to do it, let there be no question about it. It's not signed, sealed and delivered, but speaking to me and asking my opinion I would f–king love to do it.”


	Metallica will wrap their 2025 touring plans with tours of Australia and New Zealand in November, followed by dates in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Their current M72 World Tour will wrap in July 2026 following dates in Europe and the U.K..

Palmieri revolutionized Latin jazz and salsa over a career that spanned more than seven decades.


													By
												

	Sigal Ratner-Arias


Deputy Editor, Billboard Español


Eddie Palmieri, the Grammy Award-winning pianist, bandleader, musician, and composer of Puerto Rican ancestry who revolutionized Latin jazz and salsa over a more than seven decades career, has died at 88. He passed away Wednesday (August 6) in his New Jersey home, according to a statement posted on his official Instagram account. 

	











	One of the most influential figures in Latin music history, Palmieri was born Dec. 15, 1936 in Spanish Harlem to Puerto Rican parents and was greatly influenced by his older brother, the pioneering Latin pianist Charlie Palmieri. “Together, the Palmieri brothers helped define the sound of Latin music in New York City and beyond, each leaving a distinct legacy,” reads the post.


	Known for pioneering progressive salsa and Latin jazz, blending American jazz with Afro-Caribbean rhythms, Palmieri founded in 1961 La Perfecta, a band that redefined salsa with its use of trombones in place of trumpets, introducing a new sound that became Palmieri's musical signature. His 1965 classic “Azúcar Pa' Ti” has been recognized for its cultural significance – in 2009, it was inducted into the Library of Congress of the United States. He also blended Latin music with funk, soul, and socially conscious messaging in his innovative 1971 album Harlem River Drive.

	











	In 1976, he won the first Grammy Award ever given in a Latin category —then called Best Latin Recording —for his iconic album The Sun of Latin Music.


	On the Billboard charts, Palmieri had seven entries on the Jazz Albums ranking – from Palmas (1994) to Listen Here! (2005) -– and eight entries on Top Tropical Albums, including three top 10s: Obra Maestra: Mastepiece (2000) with Tito Puente, Ritmo Caliente (2003), both of which reached No. 5, and Eddie Palmieri Is Doin' It In The Park: The EP (Soundtrack), which peaked at No. 7. He also had presence on Traditional Jazz Albums (nine entries, two of them in the top 10), Top Latin Albums (one entry at No. 7) and Tropical Airplay (one entry).


	Winner of the NEA Jazz Masters Award as well as multiple Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, Palmieri received in 2013 a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Latin Recording Academy. 


	“It is with deep sorrow that we mourn the passing of maestro Eddie Palmieri, a pioneer of salsa, a visionary of Latin jazz, and an eternal revolutionary of rhythm,” the Latin Recording Academy said on a statement. “His talent broke barriers, merging tradition with innovation and leaving an indelible mark on generations of musicians and music lovers. […] He always had a deep commitment to culture, and his invaluable contributions cemented him as one of the great pillars of the Latin sound worldwide.”


	Eddie Palmieri's wife for almost six decades, Iraida Palmieri, whom he lovingly called “Mi Luz Mayor,” passed away in 2014. He is survived by their five children – daughters Gabriela, Renee, Eydie and Ileana, and son Edward Palmieri II – and four grandchildren.

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is back out looking for a director for Fast and Loose, after Michael Bay and Will Smith were unable to bridge creative differences and Bay shook loose of the film Wednesday.


Fast and Loose will star Smith as a man who wakes up in Tijuana with no memories. As he pieces together his past, he learns he's been living two lives: one as a crime kingpin and the other as an undercover CIA agent. The script by Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, Chris Bremner and Eric Pearson. The film has action as well as comic moments, but Deadline hears Bay wanted more emphasis on the former while Smith wanted to lean into the latter. 

	











	They are looking to shoot in October, and Netflix will lock in a new filmmaker to keep things on track. Bay has plenty else to do. He is discussing with Paramount a return to the Transformers fold with a new version of that tentpole, and he's also percolating at Universal OutRun, an adaptation of the video game that is a star vehicle for Sydney Sweeney. Jayson Rothwell is scripting with Bay and Brad Fuller producing with Sweeney. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	A reunion between Bay and Smith was significant because their stars launched together with 1995's Bad Boys. That film was Bay's film directing debut, and it was the vehicle that provided first glimpse of how well Smith would fare as a charismatic action star.   


Fast and Loose is being produced by Smith's Westbrook Studios and Kelly McCormick and David Leitch for 87North.

Will. If you want to direct it. Just go ahead and direct it.

Consider Matthew Vaughn, perhaps ?

I'd probably trust Bay's instincts at this point, Will.

This is actually kind of a shame considering they both made each others' first movie, & are quite literally each responsible for helping launch the other to their respective successes.

People who've known each other & go back to what would feel to each like the Hollywood equivalent of days on the grade school playground together are bound to butt heads but they owe it to themselves, audiences & each other to compromise here. Egos aside guys. Yes Bay shoots action well & yes Will does comedy well so the nature of the creative differences aren't a shocker, but life is short, they made each other, Bay should go back if that's still an option & they both should compromise. 

Wouldn't even care if there wasn't a unique history there but becuz there is, these 2 should hug it out.  They made each other famous for God sake.

So now instead of mindless explosions we might get an actual movie

			By Armando Tinoco, Anthony D'Alessandro 


	A letter to Warner Bros. Discovery's shareholders this AM has confirmed that Matt Reeves‘ The Batman Part II will finally start filming in the spring.  This is for an Oct. 1, 2027 theatrical release. 


	The note praised the recent success of James Gunn's Superman which has already grossed $560M worldwide. In addition, WBD CEO David Zaslav has other news. 


	“James Gunn is already preparing to write the next installment in the Super family,” he confirmed. 


	“In film, James Gunn is busy preparing the next installments of the DC super family, including Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (2026), Clayface (2026) and the next Wonder Woman. In addition, The Batman II (2027) is preparing to begin shooting next spring, among several other projects in development. The 10-year vision for the DC universe also includes an exciting array of television projects, including The Penguin, the upcoming new season of ‘Peacemaker,' and the debut of ‘Lanterns' in 2026. In a precise and measured way, the DC franchise will increasingly overlay across the studio's broader efforts: from film and TV to consumer products, games, experiences and social.” reads the shareholder note.

	Separately, according to Production List, the Robert Pattinson-starring The Batman II has “officially” entered the pre-production stage.

	Pattinson is set to reprise his role as the Dark Knight, with Reeves confirming that Colin Farrell would also return as The Penguin, giving continuity to the HBO series.

	Part II was initially slated to open in 2025, but has suffered several delays along the way. Earlier this year, Reeves confirmed he was continuing his work on the script and was expected to begin filming by the end of the year.


DC Studios co-head James Gunn defended the delays, noting that it was “fairly common.”


	“To be fair, a 5 year gap or more is fairly common in sequels,” he wrote on Threads last year. “7 years between Alien and Aliens. 14 years between Incredibles. 7 years between the first two Terminators. 13 years between Avatars. 36 years between Top Guns. And, of course, 6 years between Guardians Vol 2 and Vol 3.”

	











	Gunn confirmed that delaying the release until 2027 was due to the writing, saying, “There isn't a full script,” and adding, “Once there is a finished script, there is around two years for pre-production, shooting, and post-production on big films.”

	In July of this year, Gunn confirmed he had Reeves' The Batman Part II script and it was “great.”

Superhero crap is destroying what little was left of original creativity in American movies. Please make one last film in which all of them die in a final apocalypse leaving nothing but an eternally toxic, never revivable pile of ashes.

I see. So, the ultimate hope is that TV is not its own profitable stream of revenue, rather, it will make up for the lack of income from theatrical releases.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


Paramount Global and Skydance Media have finally reached the end of their long and winding merger road, announcing the close of their $8.4 billion combination and opening a new chapter for Hollywood.


	The newly combined company is officially known as “Paramount, A Skydance Corporation,” according to a press release. Its stock will begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq, under the ticker symbol PSKY.


	“Today marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount's legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,” Chairman and CEO David Ellison said in the release. “My vision is to honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content to support the world's top creative talent, enhance experiences for audiences worldwide, and create sustainable value for our shareholders.”

	Skydance's two-step merger with Paramount, which involved first taking over its controlling shareholder, National Amusements, was backed by private equity firm RedBird Capital.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Our investment in Paramount and long-term partnership with the Ellison family reflects our deep conviction in the value of world-class intellectual property and the potential to unlock substantial growth as these businesses navigate technological disintermediation and evolving consumer preferences,” RedBird Founder and Managing Partner Gerry Cardinale said. “We've been collaborating with David Ellison for the last 15 years and made our first investment in Skydance in 2019. Over this period, we've seen the power of an owner-operator model that integrates technological sophistication with a talent-friendly passion for producing great original content.”

	











	Thursday's formal announcement came as Ellison, Cardinale and other executives gathered in New York for a press conference. It will be the first chance for the media to hear directly from the new management team, which has had to stay largely out of view as the regulatory process unfolded. 


	Skydance announced its merger proposal in July 2024, prevailing over multiple suitors, in part because of its long relationship with Paramount as a co-finance partner. At the end of last yeat, it appeared that the tie-up would get the stamp of approval early in 2025. Instead, the process dragged on for months amid a surprising level of scrutiny from the ostensibly pro-business Trump Administration. Looking to make an example of CBS News as part of his broader attack against the media, Trump sued the division over a 60 Minutes segment, extracting a $16 million settlement despite the unanimous view of legal experts that the suit had no merit. Meanwhile, Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr held up the deal over a “news distortion” complaint brought against CBS, which remains pending.


	In the days since the FCC finally blessed the deal, Skydance has finalized the executive roster for the new company. Beyond the mere question of whether the transaction would ever close, many questions are looming over the newly minted entity. Among the biggest are the outlook for Paramount's many cable networks given the moves across the sector to spin off or separate linear TV from streaming and other assets. Also top of mind is the potential extent of additional layoffs. Paramount had already cut 15% of its domestic workforce in 2024, adding additional layoffs earlier this year. While Ellison and RedBird have emphasized their passion for theatrical moviegoing and goal of preserving Paramount's studio lot and heritage, it's clear that more changes are coming.


	Ellison called it “truly an honor and a privilege to help lead this iconic brand into its next chapter.” He added, “My experience at Skydance and across all levels of production has shown me what it takes to bring great stories to life – and just how powerful it is when visionary creators are supported by strong leadership and a clear mission. With a deep understanding of the industry and a strategic approach to growth, we will stay grounded in creative excellence, embrace cutting-edge innovation, and continue delivering the entertainment, news, and sports experiences that connect with audiences worldwide. Together, we have the opportunity not only to shape Paramount's future, but also to play a meaningful role in where our industry is headed – and we can't wait to get started.”

Hideous name. Why not just “Paramount Skydance”?

Time to buy WB now. Save Them from Zaslav.

Finally. And all it cost them was Colbert's Late Show, 60 Minutes reputation, a $16 million presidential bribe, and any remaining shreds of morality, dignity, integrity, or self-respect.

Small price to pay these days.

Congrats!

The only way this will be successful is if they manage to break out of the LA bubble and explore actual pop culture like WB did with Minecraft.

It's the online/creator communities who are making and driving the trends now, not the legacy establishment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","South Park doubles down on its dog-blasting troll war with the White House","https://www.avclub.com/south-park-got-a-nut-dog-shooting-kristi-noem","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 06:15:00 GMT","

Like it or not, South Park has taken on a weirdly heavy role in our culture at the moment, one in which the actual residents of the actual White House both attack, and try to co-opt, the show's messaging, massively elevating the series' profile, and its function as a cultural barometer. Said meter, meanwhile, continues to point straight at a full-on war with not just Donald Trump, but his whole administration, as the show continues to basically dare Trump and his associates to make it important. “Got A Nut,” the second episode of the show's 27th season, doubled down on that scorched earth approach tonight, building on the swings taken by the show's micropenis-festooned season premiere. That included aggressive attacks on ICE, Charlie Kirk, and most especially Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, depicted as merciless attention seeker whose obsessive desire to shoot dogs didn't stop with the one she actually copped to killing in her 2024 autobiography.

South Park‘s decision to stop fucking around with surrogate characters like Mr. Garrison and just say “Kristi Noem loves shooting dogs, up to and including Krypto from Superman” reveals a show all-but-begging for another confrontation with Trump and his associates—see also JD Vance being depicted as the sexually servile Tattoo to Trump's Mr. Roarke, because there's nothing 16-year-old South Park fans love like a good Fantasy Island reference. As ever, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem content to swing haphazardly between puerile jokes about “masterdebaters” and Noem's face falling apart with more pointed material about how so many of the people propping up the current administration are just looking to “make their nut,” whether it's by stoking online anger, or helping ICE literally invade heaven to deport brown people. It's classic troll tactics: Throw everything you can at the target, because something is going to get the blood pressure to rise.

South Park has always occupied what feels like an outsized role in American culture: It makes more money, and garners more attention, than any number of shows that might approach cultural material in less bombastic or more thoughtful fashion, simply by dint of being willing to take the biggest, loudest swings. It's an approach that pays off best when reality feels at its dumbest, and now that the show's fully committed to focusing its ire on Trump, the question simply becomes whether the White House will continue to play along—or if the Very Normal Personalities currently occupying it will be able to resist letting themselves be trolled.

The first full trailer for Peacock's <i>The Paper</i>—the new spin-off set in the same universe as NBC's massively successful American remake of The Office—wastes very little time in establishing its ties to the original show: We're told, right up top, that this is the new pulp-adjacent project from the same documentary crew that spent so many years filming the Dunder-Mifflin hordes. It's similarly efficient in letting viewers know who, say, their new Jim is going to be, with Domhnall Gleeson's Ned quickly introducing himself as the straight-laced normie having to wrangle a staff of oddballs, while cracking jokes and smiles with a similarly sane female co-worker (Chelsea Frei).



Said oddballs, meanwhile, include Tim Key, The White Lotus‘ Sabrina Impacciatore, American Vandal‘s Melvin Gregg, Ramona Young, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, and Eric Rahill, who round out the staff of a local Ohio  newspaper that seems to have  recruited its staff entirely from a roster of extremely quirky sitcom character archetypes. (Is it worth noting here that all the non-Michael, non-Dwight characters on The Office started out kind of normal, and then got crazy as we get to know them? Probably overkill, since this thing is going to be fending off comparisons to the original series every second of its existence.)

The trailer saves its biggest connection for its end, which reveals that poor Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nuñez) is apparently doomed to have these documentarians intrude into his life no matter where he goes. (His determination to render any footage of him unusable makes up the trailer's one genuine laugh-out-loud moment.)

The Paper debuts its first four episodes on Peacock on Thursday, September 4; it'll roll out two new episodes every week after until September 25.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Cult Of Criterion: A Confucian Confusion","https://www.avclub.com/cult-of-criterion-a-confucian-confusion","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 16:01:32 GMT","

In Cult Of Criterion, The A.V. Club highlights a new release from The Criterion Collection each month, examining the films entering an increasingly accessible film canon.

Though best known for his vast and sneakily profound dramas A Brighter Summer Day and Yi Yi, Taiwanese New Wave staple Edward Yang's first comedy is as sharp and urban as the rest of his brief filmography, with a snarky, vicious cynicism aimed at a group of flailing yuppies. A Confucian Confusion so deeply digs at its vapid corporate ensemble, sexually ping-ponging between one another in pursuit of vague ambitions, material acquisitions, and cultural obligations, that it could be called Taiwanese Psycho. But these chaotic collisions of socially cutthroat Patrick Batemen still possess Yang's underlying hope, or maybe even expectation, that something sweeter lies beneath all the modern posturing.

Yang's 1994 film takes place over two days and nights in Taipei, only a few years after the Wild Lily student movement in Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square protests in China, during a time of democratization and the final days of the Four Tigers' economic boom period. A Confucian Confusion captures this fragile moment, both rapidly changing and dangerously complacent, in a shotgun spread of capitalistic caricatures all shot at Yang's typical remove.

There's Molly (Shu-Chun Ni)—vassalized to run a media company by her rich-kid boyfriend Akeem (Bosen Wang)—who employees her sister (Li-Mei Chen) to host a woo-woo talk show and her friend Qiqi (Shiang-chyi Chen) as an assistant. Molly's company works with skeevy sellout playwright Birdy (Ye-Ming Wang), who's plagiarizing Molly's brother-in-law (Hung Hung), an author concerned with his own vacuous popularity. Also in the mix are Akeem's scheming pal Larry (Danny Deng), new hire Feng (Richie Li), and Qiqi's bureaucrat boyfriend Ming (Weiming Wang). 

There are a ton of characters amid this Confusion, and you won't be blamed for not following everything. But it's all in service of something simple: Everyone is sleeping with each other, or suspects that everyone around them is, while employment and sex are conflated to such an extent that the relationships linking the sprawling cast all boil down to primal questions of trust and security. Love? Who's got the time?

The film's black-hearted humor, and nose-thumbing ties to tradition, can be summed up in two pithy lines plucked from Yang's oceanic script: “Hurt no one, but always cover your back. Haven't you heard this old teaching from Confucius?” The speaker, numbercruncher Larry, is the least sympathetic and most conniving of the cast, one whose manipulations are truly empty of emotion. These link to the empty, often funny maxims that serve as chapter headings, and to the deflated egos of the film's hollowed-out movers and shakers (especially Bosen Wang's Akeem and Ye-Ming Wang's Birdy), who serve as the loudmouthed clowns of the film's circus.

But it's not a film fully bought into the corruption of modernity. Yang navigates the rest of his characters' snappy '90s quarter-life crises—weathering Reality Bites-like industry commentary and cross-strait political allegory alike—through these choppy, self-serving waters and out the other side. Art and business, East and West, may eddy and mix on screen, captured in ads and brands and NBA games, but Yang's lasting images are built on stark togetherness set apart from this globalized blur.

Briefly bonded in bed, or caught on the asphalt in rapturous headlights, or backlit by the cityscape, mere shadows lurking under businesses and buildings, Yang's pairings become sublime even as they nip and tear at each other. Transactional relationships blossom into more, or fall away when one party sees the light. The depressed author of a misanthropic book titled A Confucian Confusion (perhaps a bit of directorial self-insert on Yang's part) finds purpose in life, while the film's final shot lingers on a couple's immediate, heartfelt reconnection outside an elevator. Even in the high-rises, bars, and cabs that form the city's labyrinth and comprise the labyrinthine plot's settings, it's not impossible to find an exit to something greater.

Entering a rarefied strata previously occupied only by films like Gotti, Problem Child, and Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol, Ice Cube's new sci-fi movie/Amazon commercial War Of The Worlds has achieved that rarest of things: Consensus. Specifically, the bad kind, as the new “screenlife” film has just achieved a rare 0 percent fresh rating on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

﻿

Now, admittedly, the new movie—directed by music video guy Rich Lee, and starring an extremely sleepy-seeming Ice Cube as a Homeland Security officer who tries to stop an alien invasion from the comfort of his laptop—is only rolling with 20 reviews tallied at this point. (That puts it well below other “0 percent” luminaries like Adam Sandler's The Ridiculous 6—36 reviews—or the all-time record holder, Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever, which brought together an incredible 118 critics in a shared chorus of hate back in 2002.) But it does seem like War has potential to grow, especially as social media has been having a field day mocking the film lately, partially for how much of it seems to be occupied by Ice Cube looking quizzically into a webcam, and most especially for its brand integration with producer Amazon: It took artistic bravery, we'd argue, to have the fate of the world hinge on an Amazon drone delivery (complete with showing Cube's character type the retail juggernaut's name into his search bar), and then extra-special super bravery to have the characters bribe a houseless guy to risk his life to help them with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.

Interestingly, just about every review surveyed by RT acknowledges that the film could, hypothetically be good, were it not burdened by lousy acting, a largely incoherent script, and the looming feeling of Jeff Bezos breathing down its neck. There have, after all, been several very good movies that have used the “screenlife” concept for both thrills and alternative storytelling; this just isn't one of them—and you very much don't have to take our word for it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Universal adds ""don't feed this to AI"" warnings to all its recent movies","https://www.avclub.com/universal-adds-ai-warning-to-end-credits","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 02:30:00 GMT","

It's one of the weirder knock-on effects of the Rise Of Marvel that way more moviegoers are likely to see a film's full credits roll than they used to; god help you, after all, if you walk out early and miss some cute little throwback clip to the old cartoon.. That might explain why people have been fairly quick to notice that Universal recently mixed up its final credit sequences, in a decidedly litigious way: Specifically, by adding a line of text, way at the end of the credits, that states that the film “may not be used to train AI.” Per THR, the new language has appeared in several Universal releases since June, including How To Train Your Dragon, Jurassic World Rebirth, and The Bad Guys 2.

THR notes that the language—which also states “This motion picture is protected under the laws of the United States and other countries” and “Unauthorized duplication, distribution or exhibition may result in civil liability and criminal prosecution”— differs a bit between countries, including citing, in relevant areas, a European Union law that specifically allows copyright holders to opt their work out of being used in “scientific research.” But the gist is pretty clear, as are the motives for including it: Universal is hunting for more ammo in its ongoing battles against AI companies like Midjourney, the “bottomless pit of plagiarism” it's currently co-suing with Disney.

That suit is still pending (although other AI companies have recently won suits against book authors brought on similar grounds), so it's a bit difficult to see how adding additional warnings now isn't a bit like closing the barn door after the horse-with-a-distractingly-incorrect-number-of-legs has already bolted. Still, it's hard to fault Universal for wanting to bulk up its legal arguments, given how existential these suits are going to be for creators trying to fend off the copying machines; adding a couple of sentences to the end of the movie feels like a pretty classic “no harm in trying” idea.

“Taken” star Liam Neeson, who has been all over the news recently for appearing to start a red-hot romance with his “Naked Gun” costar Pamela Anderson, listed his luxurious New York City penthouse for sale back in March 2025. Now, the actor has just sold it for $10.3 million, per a New York Post report.

The report says Neeson shared the home with his late wife Natasha Richardson, who died in 2009, and raised the pair's two boys there.

Neeson previously spoke on British talk show “Lorraine” about being a New Yorker. He said in a 2016 appearance that despite living in the city for around 22 years, he doesn't think he will ever feel like a New Yorker. He went on, “I love being a universal citizen of New York,” and emphasized how he enjoys the ability to blend in. “Certainly nobody cares if you're in movies,” he said. 

Realtor.com says the comfortable crib is located in the heart of Lincoln Square. It boasts huge windows with panoramic views and tall ceilings.

The outlet lists a chef's kitchen complete with marble countertop, and a great room with custom millwork and a view of Central Park among the residence's standout features.

A post shared by Luxury Real Estate (@billionairehouse)

Neeson slashed the price twice, originally listing the dwelling for $12.75 million in 2014, before relisting it for $10.8 million in the spring of 2025. It ultimately sold for $500,000 less, but the “Cold Pursuit” star still turned a large profit. He purchased the home for just under $4 million back in 1999.

Pamela Anderson has left Hollywood for the serenity of her native Canada. Back in October 2024, she spoke exclusively to Women's Wear Daily about her decision. “I start each day when I'm home in my rose garden,” she revealed, before calling the move a “homecoming” that helped her “look at my life and remember who I was.”

She also told the outlet, “I didn't want anything that had happened to me define me. I wanted what I do to define me… all these realizations came to me in the rose garden.”

Western Living calls Anderson's Ladysmith, Vancouver Island home a “whimsical, ‘funky grandma' dream come true,” saying the property has been in the “Baywatch” star's family for years, and was left untouched for 25 of those before the actress transformed it.

Designer Francesca Albertazzi was key in giving the space its cozy, rustic charm.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Who is Kelly Clarkson's Ex, Brandon Blackstock? His Connections to Reba McEntire, Blake Shelton & More","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/brandon-blackstock-ex-husband-kelly-clarkson/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 05:45:56 GMT","

Music legend and “The Voice” coach Kelly Clarkson made the heartbreaking announcement on August 6, 2025, that she was postponing the remaining shows of her Las Vegas residency, revealing that the reason was due to a family emergency involving her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock. 

Clarkson wrote in a social media statement, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” added Clarkson. “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”

Brandon, 48, is the son of Elisa Gayle Ritter and talent agent Narvel Blackstock, who married in 1973, per IMDb. The couple had three kids, including Brandon, before they divorced in 1988. 

Narvel Blackstock then married country legend and fellow “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire in 1989, while managing her career. The two had a son, Shelby, but divorced in 2015. 

Brandon followed in his dad's footsteps, managing music artists through their Nashville firm, Starstruck Management, which still represents Blake Shelton, Carly Pearce, and several other country artists. 

In 2006, Brandon met Clarkson — just four years after she skyrocketed to fame on “American Idol” — at the Academy of Country Music Awards, according to Us Weekly. At the time, his dad was managing Clarkson's career, and Brandon was still married to his first wife, Melissa Ashworth, with whom he had two kids — Savannah and Seth. 

Brandon's divorce from Ashworth was finalized in 2012, the same year that he proposed to Clarkson, per IMDb. He and Clarkson married in 2013, which meant McEntire was Clarkson's mother-in-law for two years — and the couple had two kids, daughter River Rose, now 11, and son Remington, now 9. 

Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020, according to E! News, beginning a nearly three-year battle over assets and alleged mishandling of her talent fees. She was managed by Starstruck's team from 2007 to 2020, per E! News. 

Their divorce was eventually finalized in 2022, and the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement ordered Brandon to return $2,641,374 of paid commissions from when he was Clarkson's manager. 

Blackstock left music management in the midst of their divorce, according to Us Weekly, and focused on becoming a rodeo manager in Montana, where the two shared a ranch. A judge ruled in 2021 that Clarkson would get to keep the ranch, per USA Today. 

In December 2024, the U.S. Sun reported that Blackston founded Valley View Rodeo, which he's been running with Clarkson's former assistant, Brittany Jones. They also run Headwater Livestock Auction in Three Forks, Montana.

Before you can even say “trick or treat,” Hallmark Channel's 2025 Countdown to Christmas will be underway, with round-the-clock holiday fare and all-new movies and series to celebrate the season. The programming stunt typically kicks off in October and runs right up until Christmas. 

While Hallmark hasn't announced its full line-up yet, we do know about quite a few projects coming your way. Here's a preview of everything we know is on the way for the 16th annual Countdown to Christmas…

Hallmark Channel has already begun promoting Countdown to Christmas with a preview that showed glimpses of what's to come, “with more joy than ever before.” Quick glimpses of upcoming movies show stars like Jonathan Bennett and Janel Parrish are in new movies. But here's what we know for sure is in the works…

The Brenner brothers are back for a third movie in the popular franchise, following up 2022's smash hit “Three Wise Men and a Baby” and 2024's “Three Wiser Men and a Boy.” Walker told EntertainmentNow the movie starts filming in mid-August with tons of familiar faces, including Kimberley Sustad, Margaret Colin, Matt Hamilton, and Miles Marthaller as his son. 

Fans have been asking for a reunion of Hynes and Erin Krakow ever since their 2021 hit “It Was Always You.” They'll finally get it with “Christmas Above the Clouds.” They won't be playing the same characters though, since it's a modern version of “A Christmas Carol.” According to the synopsis, Krakow plays a workaholic CEO who tries to skip Christmas by flying to Australia on her own and is visited by “three quirky spirits” and a surprise run-in with her ex, played by Hynes. 

This follow-up to 2024's “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story” is set in Buffalo with an all-star cast that includes Holland Roden playing pediatric doctor Morgan Quinn and Matthew Daddario as a longtime friend who's the Bills' VP of Stadium Development Gabe DeLuca. The cast also features Tracy Pollan, Steve Schirripa, Patti Murin, Joe Pantoliano, Caroline Aaron, Bills Head Coach Sean McDermott, and numerous players. 

Filmed in New England in the spring of 2025, the time-travel movie “A Newport Christmas” stars Ginna Claire Mason as Ella, “a charitable and spirited Newport socialite in 1905 who dreams of using her wealth to start a foundation to help others in town. After learning her father intends for her to become engaged to a man she's never met at the upcoming Christmas Eve ball, Ella goes for a nighttime sail in her schooner to clear her head. Upon seeing a comet shoot across the sky, she wistfully wishes for a different life. Ella is shocked to suddenly find Nick, played by Wes Brown, a sailor and local Newport historian, aboard her schooner and accuses him of being a stowaway.”

Andrew Walker and Lacey Chabert reunite onscreen for the first time since 2018's “My Secret Valentine.” According to the movie's logline, “When Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes (Chabert) is assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie Duncan, she expects a routine case. But things get complicated when Isabel unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan (Walker), and begins to question the rigid rules of her job. As Christmas approaches, Isabel must choose between following the holiday algorithm or following her heart.”

Based on a popular Audible podcast that launched in 2022, the “Mistletoe Murders” cast — including leads Sarah Drew and Peter Mooney — filmed season two of the cozy mystery series in Toronto in the spring.

Filmed in Utah this spring, none of the season two contestants' faces were shown in the new trailer. But in late May, Bennett told the Laughing Place that the second season will include a “surprise element we didn't have before” as well as “bigger challenges, bigger personalities,” and a “chaotic scene.” 

This new reality competition, “Baked With Love: Holiday,” sees 10 pairs of “home bakers” competing in a bake-off using family recipes, with the winners receiving a $50,000 prize.

“Twelve Dates ‘Til Christmas,” first announced in March, is a six-episode, limited series starring “Parenthood” alum Mae Whitman, Emmy winner Jane Seymour, and two-time Oscar nominee Mary McDonnell. Based on the “Twelve Dates of Christmas” novel by Jenny Bayliss, the series was filmed in and around Dublin, Ireland, in the spring of 2025, according to Deadline, even though the storyline takes place near London.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Janel Parrish Vulnerably Updates Fans on Her Endometriosis Battle","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/janel-parrish-endometriosis-update-community/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 03:44:40 GMT","

One year after having surgery to remove painful endometriosis, actress Janel Parrish updated fans about her ongoing struggles with what she called a “horrible, isolating disease.”

The Hallmark star and “Pretty Little Liars” alum opened up in a TikTok video on August 2, 2025, and shared it to her Instagram Stories, hoping to build community and hear from others who've been through it. 

For my #endosisters #endometriosis sound off in the comments, tell your stories. We are not alone and we are strong 🤍

Sitting on a couch at home, Parrish began her video by saying, “Hi my loves. I hope this finds the right audience. I'm speaking directly to my endo sisters. Endo sisters, if you're here — stay if you want to talk about this horrible, isolating disease.”

The condition, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine, occurs when endometrial tissue, which lines the uterus, grows outside the uterus and builds up, causing “inflammation, scarring and painful cysts.”

Hoping to build community and hear from others who've battled the condition, Parrish said, “I just feel like there is so much misinformation out there, and I'm really frustrated, and I'm trying to educate myself more on this disease and learn more about it, and I feel like the more that we can shed light on it and find a community and talk about it together, the less scary and isolating it is.” 

“So about a year ago, I had my first surgery to remove endometriosis cysts,” she continued. “I had ablation as well, and then my gyno put me on Orilissa for about six horrible months. A year after my surgery, we've got the news that the endo is growing back.”

“And now I've found that it's time to educate myself more on this disease,” Parrish said, “not just trust what my gyno is saying, and seek out other opinions, specifically from endometriosis specialists. And I'm learning so much more than I mean. It's blowing my mind what I've learned, and I'm curious to also hear all of your stories … and how you've found treatment.” 

Parrish said that she was frustrated that her gynecologist had been telling her to “just get pregnant” as a solution because “there's no better treatment.” The “Return to Office” star said she'd “been trying” and that it “hasn't happened,” and that she wonders if the endometriosis is actually why she hasn't been able to get pregnant. 

“Also, like, I'm reading a lot of things now that are saying that's not necessarily the case,” Parrish continued. “Pregnancy isn't necessarily a treatment for endometriosis. So I'm just trying to educate myself. I'm trying to stay calm. I'm trying to tell my story in the hopes that it will help some of you out there who are getting misinformation as well and are feeling alone, and maybe we can just find each other and talk about these things and help each other.”

Parrish first opened up about her endometriosis in June 2024, when she shared a photo in her Instagram Stories, taken from her hospital bed, of the medical bracelet around her wrist as she held hands with her husband, Chris Long, whom she married in 2018, per People.

“After months of excruciating pain and not knowing why,” Parrish wrote at the time, “I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and underwent surgery to remove cysts and scar tissue as a result of the disease.”

Her August 2025 update on TikTok has generated robust discussion in her comment section, just as she'd hoped, with thousands of women who've been struggling with the disease sharing their stories.  Parrish has shared encouraging words with many of them. 

When one woman wrote, “Omg finally someone who talks about endometriosis … i was diagnosed one year ago and been on hormonal pills since then,” Parrish replied, “I feel you. 🥺”

Another woman shared, “I think what doesn't get talked about enough is that the specialists who use the proper technique don't take insurance, as insurance doesn't see it as a necessary surgery. It's so difficult for women to get the proper care.” Parrish replied, “You're right this is an excellent and very sad point 😔🤍”

Filmmaker Kayci Lacob knew she wanted to capture everything about growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley during the early-2000s tech boom for her directorial debut. She also knew that her first film deserved to be in theaters, and so Lacob did what most established auteurs are still hesitant to do (other than Francis Ford Coppola with “Megalopolis”): She is self-distributing her debut “Everything to Me” for a theatrical run and “betting” on audiences to buy tickets.

“Everything to Me” isn't without star power. “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Ponyboi,” and “You” actress Victoria Pedretti leads the film as Claudia, a woman reflecting on her career trajectory and life choices years after aspiring to be the next Steve Jobs as a Stanford freshman (Abigail Donaghy plays a younger version of the character). But this isn't an Elizabeth Holmes story gone awry: “Everything to Me” is more “Lady Bird” than “The Dropout.”

 








Related Stories Hideo Kojima on ‘Death Stranding 2,' the Sequel's Big Changes and Improvements Post-Pandemic, and How He Hoped to Cast David Lynch in a Game Charlie Kaufman's New Short Film Is Coming to a Public Library Near You 

The synopsis reads: “Set in early-2000s Silicon Valley, ‘Everything to Me' follows a precocious teen determined to become the next Steve Jobs. But once she makes it to Stanford, she discovers that real life is more complicated than any product launch. As adulthood sets in, she's forced to reconsider what success really means — and maybe even laugh at her younger self along the way.” 

 










Indie icon Judy Greer co-stars, along with Lola Flanery, Utkarsh Ambudkar, and Rich Sommer. The feature was previously titled “The Book of Jobs.”

Writer/director Lacob counts fellow Northern California native and “Lady Bird” helmer Greta Gerwig among her filmmaking “heroes.” And while Gerwig's “Barbie” proved that women are a massive theater-going audience, female directors have still scrambled in the indie space to find funding, let alone theatrical distribution. Lacob is redefining — and to use Silicon Valley tech speak, disrupting — the path for first-time filmmakers by self-distributing the theatrical release of “Everything to Me.”

“We decided to self-distribute this movie through Concourse Media for a theatrical run by betting on our audience,” Lacob told IndieWire. “We are running a grassroots marketing campaign to try to get the word out to teens and millennial women, and hope that this leads to a sale to a studio or streamer.” 

Lacob added that, after witnessing the reception to the feature on the festival circuit at Mill Valley, Sarasota, and more, she knew she could leverage the fandom to secure a buyer later — and even believe in herself more along the way.

“Each and every screening made it clearer that teen girls and young women loved this film,” Lacob said. “But getting noticed by buyers is a whole other ballgame. We decided to leverage this fandom, this love and momentum by girls, and ride it. Have them help carry us to buyers.”

 










The Gerwig (and all of the Coppolas, from Francis to Sofia to “Palo Alto” helmer Gia) comparisons don't stop there. Lacob is ready to be synonymous with Bay Area Gen-Zers and millennials: “My goal is to be my generation's storyteller of Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area,” she said.

As young Gen-Z women are funding the reopening of almost century-old theaters and bypassing large studios to ensure theatrical debuts, it seems as though the next generation of female filmmakers are dedicated to preserving the future of theatergoing more than anyone.

Below, director Lacob unpacks her critically acclaimed “Everything to Me” and shares with IndieWire why she was determined to release the film in theaters without waiting for a studio. 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: As a fellow Bay Area native, what inspired the story of “Everything to Me”? And what went into the decision to have it set in the early 2000s?Kayci Lacob: Despite being the backdrop for movies such as “Dirty Harry,” “The Rock,” “Zodiac,” “The Game,” and several other action/adventure thrillers, we've never seen a film about what it's like to actually grow up here, especially from a female perspective. There were two huge influences bearing down on me, outside of my family, that led to this film. One was the Bay Area itself, which I view almost as its own character in my upbringing. This place has soul and is a part of who I am; it really shaped my view on the world. Part of this is because I grew up in a really special time, right at the change of the millennium.  The other was Steve Jobs. There have been many eccentric and prolific innovators in Silicon Valley who have changed the world, but Steve was an entity all his own. It seemed as though he was creating technology, movies, music, and stores just for me. Being surrounded by all of this created both significant challenges and beautiful opportunities for those of us who grew up there. Plus, it was also fun! Before the millennial minimalism aesthetic took over, our world was colorful and changing constantly. We were living in a cautionary tale, but we were also there for the dawn of the digital age. I wanted a movie that captured all of these emotions, partially because I wasn't even aware of it all while it was happening. It was just life. When did you realize this story was what you wanted to make as your debut feature?As a young hopeful filmmaker, I turned to my heroes: Greta Gerwig, Tina Fey, Sofia Coppola, Richard Linklater, the list goes on. They all began their careers with a coming-of-age story that set the stage for their point-of-view, how they see the world. I knew that I wanted to follow in their footsteps. The problem was, in my mid-twenties, I was still having a lot of trouble identifying what my perspective was and how I wanted to be seen. Much like our adult Claudia in the film, I had to turn back and look at my life, my experiences, and where I'm from to try to answer the questions, “Who am I and what do I want to say?” It was through this exploration that Claudia's story started to take shape.We can all look back at a slate of movies by a single filmmaker and think that their journey was deliberate, that they knew exactly who they were and what they wanted to say about the world from the get-go. For some of them, that very well may be the case, but some of us learn our voice and our view of the world as we go, and then connect the dots in hindsight. 

 










How long was the film in development? This film was in development for about two-and-a-half years before we had everyone assembled on set and a real movie was underway. But if you asked me more philosophically, I'd say this was in development for 26 years, from the time I was born until the first word was written on the page. Every experience I had, every time I doubted myself, reinvented my personality, changed my goals and got closer to the truth of who I am, I was writing a piece of this story. And if I'm being honest, I don't think I'm even halfway there! The difference now is, I'm finally OK with that.The “Everything to Me” cast is a who's-who of indie icons. How did you land your rising stars and also connect with Victoria Pedretti and Judy Greer?I'm still in awe that my name shows up next to theirs on this film. I am so fortunate to have worked with these legends, especially on my debut. We knew from the beginning that we wanted to discover the new “It” group of young actors to shine in this film alongside some real heavyweights who could connect with audiences of all ages. Victoria brings a wisdom and intensity to every role she plays, which was absolutely how we wanted our adult Claudia to present. Victoria is a real artist. 

To have a true queen of the screen like Judy Greer on board was nothing short of a dream come true. That was the most sensitive role to cast for me personally, and once we spoke to Judy and her warmth and strength emanated so organically, I felt that the part was in capable hands.Finding our “teens” was a fun part of the whole process, and they made it easy for us. We knew once we saw them. The only real challenge was casting four actresses to play the same role at different life stages (a difficult task I wouldn't recommend to a future first-time filmmaker!). But the Donaghy sisters came into our lives and made it all possible. All of our “teens” were such a joy and brought endless energy and passion to set every day. It was a fairly quick shoot (22 days), but they all bonded so quickly. It really felt like I was a high school teacher corralling my students who were all already best friends. 

What advice would you give to first-time directors, especially young women?
 










I'm going to borrow the advice that my producer, Tom Nunan, gave to me before we started filming: Vulnerability is our greatest superpower. Don't pretend you know everything. I was always fearful of being treated like a wallflower or worse, that people would think I had no right to be there. There's this pressure as a young woman to assert yourself so that you're taken seriously. But there's a difference between confidence and total control. You need to be confident in your vision while being completely open and honest about what you don't know. The worst thing you can do is get to set and pretend you know everything so that you appear like a strong leader. Always ask for help when you need it. Good people will want to help. I remember on our very first day shooting, right before our first take of our first scene. I was sweating and shaking, wondering when everyone was going to figure out that I was a fraud, or if they already knew. I came across a meme of a foal wearing a flower crown with the words, “This actually is my first rodeo, and I'm very scared.” I showed it to Tom, and he loved it. He said to own that. As long as I knew what I wanted, that's what mattered.One more piece of advice that I can't emphasize enough for a young filmmaker, especially a young woman, is to surround yourself with the best talent possible. This is advice for life, not just film. You should never be the smartest person in the room. Find people who are experts at what they do, and who share your vision. For me, that was Tom Nunan (producer), Shasta Spahn (director of photography), O'Shay Brooks (production designer), Lily Trotter (casting director), Stephanie Economou (composer), Matt McBrayer (editor), and Randy Wayne and Talia Bella (executive producers). Nothing great is made by a single person. 

What is the path for distribution as an indie filmmaker? Why did you decide on the festival circuit, and are you hoping for a theatrical run as opposed to streaming? The indie path isn't for the faint of heart. It's tough out there, and made even tougher by the fact that there's no clear single route to success. For us, it was a lot of trial and error, and re-strategizing. We did a full festival circuit last fall and spring. We were celebrated at a number of lovely festivals and won a couple of them. But it's difficult to stand out. We had this insane cast, a visionary DP, incredible score and music, a relentless sales agent, you name it. Better yet, each and every screening made it clearer that teen girls and young women loved this film. But getting noticed by buyers is a whole other ballgame. We decided to leverage this fandom, this love and momentum by girls, and ride it. Have them help carry us to buyers.We decided to self-distribute this movie through Concourse Media for a theatrical run by betting on our audience.

Plus, it is every filmmaker's dream to see their movie on the big screen in theaters. Much like Claudia, I decided not to wait around for somebody to offer this. We're going out and making it happen ourselves!What do you hope audiences take away from “Everything to Me”?

This movie is about the drive for excellence and the fear of being ordinary, and finding your own voice amidst all that. I love obsessive characters, and I hope audiences connect with a piece of that in this story. I've had grown men come up to me after watching this movie and tell me how much they resonated with Claudia. I was like, “Really? You, a man in your fifties, connected to a 15-year-old girl growing up in Silicon Valley?” But that's the thing about movies. Those details don't really matter as long as it feels authentic. People connect with the truth. 

Concourse Media is distributing “Everything to Me” in theaters on Friday, September 5. Check out the trailer below.

Greg Daniels must really have missed cubicles: “The Office” creator is back with a documentary-style sitcom spinoff series, titled “The Paper,” that reunites him with a slew of “Office” alums. Daniels and “Nathan For You” co-creator Michael Koman are the co-creators, co-showrunner, writers, and executive producers of the highly-anticipated Peacock series.

Much like “The Office,” “The Paper” revolves around an ensemble cast including Domhnall Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei, Melvin Gregg, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, Ramona Young, Tim Key, and “The Office” alum Oscar Nuñez. Original (AKA British) “The Office” stars and co-creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant executive produce “The Paper” along with Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, and Banijay Americas (formerly Reveille).

“The Office” was originally created for BBC by Gervais and Merchant, where it ran from 2001 to 2003 before Daniels adapted it for American television in 2005. The U.S. version ran for nine seasons and earned 42 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including five wins. “The Paper” follows the same fictional documentary crew that “immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch in the Emmy Award-winning series ‘The Office' as they find a new subject when they discover a historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it,” the synopsis reads. Tracy Letts, Eric Rahill, Molly Ephraim, Mo Welch, Allan Havey, Duane Shepard Sr., Nate Jackson, and Nancy Lenehan guest star. 

 










Daniels directs the pilot episode, with Ken Kwapis, Yana Gorskaya, Paul Lieberstein, Tazbah Chavez, Jason Woliner, Jennifer Celotta, Matt Sohn, Dave Rogers, and Jeff Blitz helming the rest of the 10-episode season. “The Paper” is a Universal Television series from the division of Universal Studio Group. 

Daniels, meanwhile, has seemed to keep the door open to a possible “The Office” reboot. The director said in 2021 that a revival is “not impossible, for sure,” but he would have to be part of it. “I would want to be involved, and I've got two other shows I'm working on right now,” Daniels told Collider. (Daniels served as the showrunner for the first four seasons of “The Office” before departing to co-create NBCUniversal's similarly-beloved “Parks and Recreation.” Daniels resumed showrunner duties for the ninth and final season of “The Office,” which concluded in 2013.) 

“The Paper” premieres on Peacock with four episodes September 4, followed by two new episodes every Thursday through September 25. Check out the trailer below.

Charlie Kaufman is preparing to take his new short film “How to Shoot a Ghost” to the Venice International Film Festival next month, but it won't be long before cinephiles with public library cards get a chance to watch it. IndieWire can exclusively reveal that Kanopy — the ad-free streaming service free for many library cardholders to use — has signed on as a producer and the exclusive library and educational distributor of the film.

“How to Shoot a Ghost” is directed by Kaufman and written by the poet Eva H.D., who previously wrote Kaufman's 2023 short “Jackals & Fireflies.” Per an official synopsis, the film “follows two newly deceased young people who meet in the streets of Athens, amid the pulsing cityscape and the ghosts of its history. One is a translator, the other a photographer; they were outsiders in life, and in death, they struggle with the residue of their longings and mistakes. They wander the city together, finding consolation in the rugged beauty of existence and its aftermath.” Josef Akiki and Jessie Buckley star.

The collaboration with Kaufman marks the latest ambitious expansion for Kanopy. The service, which launched in 2008 and is now available to over 50 percent of library cardholders in the United States, released its first original feature film, the book-banning documentary “Banned Together,” in April 2025.

 










“Given the crisis of education in this country, it remains as important as ever for citizens to continue to have barrier-free access to the wealth of free resources that libraries have always offered,” Kaufman said in a statement. “Kanopy's partnership with universities and public libraries ensures that a rich digital archive of cinematic work from all over the world — from the newest documentaries to the collected adventures of Buster Keaton — will be available to a new generation of cinephiles.”

“Kanopy is proud to continue our work of supporting impactful artists with ‘How to Shoot a Ghost,'” Kanopy GM Jason Tyrell added. “We are thrilled to join this incredible producing team and help bring an exciting new cinematic vision to Kanopy audiences via our extensive streaming platform. Charlie's love of film craft and singular storytelling sensibilities, coupled with Eva's elegant poetry, weave together into a richly historical and literary work that deserves to be platformed. We are eager to share this project with Kanopy's patrons and educators.”

Kaufman's last feature directorial effort was the acclaimed 2020 Netflix film “I'm Thinking of Ending Things,” starring Buckley. He is currently attached to direct Eddie Redmayne and Tessa Thompson in a film adaptation of Iddo Geffen's short story “Later the War.”

James Gunn is continuing to fly high. Earlier this summer, the co-head of DC Studios celebrated the release of his first standalone “Superman” feature (which he wrote and directed), and will soon see the release of “Peacemaker” Season 2. And that's in addition to his work running the studio alongside Peter Safran (the pair were appointed co-CEOs in 2022).

Now, Gunn is pulling the trigger on yet another project: writing and directing “the next installment in the Super-Family,” as Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said during the company's earnings call, as Variety reported.

 










While it's not set yet whether this will be a sequel to “Superman,” it has been confirmed that David Corenswet's titular character will star in it. Before that, Craig Gillespie's “Supergirl” will be released in 2026, with Milly Alcock's role having been teased in “Superman.”

Gunn and Safran previously unveiled a 10-year plan for the DCU, including a “Wonder Woman” reboot and 2026 releases “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” the latter of which Gunn said will be a “totally different thing” tonally. “Although it's in the same universe, it's a complete horror film, and that's one of the things we want to do,” Gunn told CBS Mornings of “Clayface,” adding, “There's not a company style. It's not like every movie is gonna be like ‘Superman.' The artists and the directors and the writers that create each one will bring their own sense to it. We don't want people being bored.” 

 










Gunn already teased to Entertainment Weekly that “Peacemaker” Season 2 is “very much connected to ‘Superman' and it's very much connected to what comes after.”

That “after” part has yet to be seen… However, it makes sense that Gunn will be writing and directing the franchise installment. Gunn's “Superman,” which he also wrote and directed, earned $315 million in the U.S. and $550 million globally. Gunn admitted to Rolling Stone that he was surprised by how well the feature did at the international box office.

“Superman is not a known commodity in some places. He is not a big known superhero in some places like Batman is. That affects things,” Gunn said. “And it also affects things that we have a certain amount of anti-American sentiment around the world right now. It isn't really helping us. So I think it's just a matter of letting something grow. But again, for us, everything's been a total win. Having the movie come out and be something that has been embraced by people everywhere — this is just the seed of the tree that Peter [Safran] and I have been watering for the past three years. So to be able to have it start off so positively has been incredibly overwhelming.”

A full year after Paramount‘s board approved a deal for Paramount to merge with Skydance, that deal has finally closed, and the $8 billion merger is officially complete.

The deal had been delayed for months amid a standoff with the Trump administration, which sued “60 Minutes” and network CBS, accusing them of favorably editing an interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount chairman Shari Redstone ultimately settled with the president for $16 million, shortly after paving the way for the FCC to approve the merger.

It means one of the oldest studios in Hollywood has exciting new owners in Skydance and David Ellison, who will become the new CEO and chairman of Paramount Global. Ellison has vowed to marry Paramount — which owns Paramount Pictures, CBS, Paramount+, Pluto TV, and cable channels like Nickelodeon, MTV, and BET — with Skydance's financial resources and tech advances.

Under Skydance, Paramount will be restructured into three divisions: studios, direct-to-consumer, and TV media.

 










Upon the deal's close on Thursday morning, Ellison, who will serve as Paramount chairman and CEO, released an open letter about the merger and what to expect in the coming days, weeks, and months. The letter opens: “Today marks Day One of a new Paramount. With the close of the transaction, we unite more than a century of iconic storytelling with the ingenuity and drive of a 15‑year-old studio born in the digital era. I am thrilled and honored to write to you as the Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, as — together with our Board, our new executive leadership team, and our colleagues around the world — we embark on the exciting next chapter of this legendary company.”

Ellison goes on to lay out a forward-thinking plan, noting that “the years ahead will undoubtedly bring formidable challenges, but they will also usher in extraordinary opportunities. We stand at the threshold of a remarkable moment — and our strong conviction is that this company is poised to make the most of the possibilities ahead. Because when creative excellence, cutting‑edge technology, and disciplined stewardship meet, great things happen — on the screen and on the balance sheet.”

As of today, the new Paramount senior leadership team is as follows (via Variety), with Ellison serving as CEO of Paramount and Jeff Shell (former CEO of NBCUniversal) on as president:

 










Andy Gordon, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Operating OfficerGeorge Cheeks, Chair of TV MediaDana Goldberg, Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Chair of Paramount TelevisionJosh Greenstein, Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chair of PlatformsCindy Holland, Chair of Direct-to-ConsumerStephanie Kyoko McKinnon, General Counsel and Acting Chief Legal OfficerJim Sterner, Chief People OfficerMelissa Zukerman, Chief Communications OfficerAndrew Warren will continue as Interim CFO.Don Granger, President, Motion Picture GroupKevin MacLellan, President, International and Global Content DistributionRebecca Mall, President, Cross Company Initiatives, Franchise, and Corporate MarketingMatt Thunell, President, Paramount Television StudiosKevin Creighton, EVP, Corporate Finance & Investor RelationsTony Driscoll, EVP, Head of Corporate Strategy & DevelopmentEfrain Miron, EVP, Head of Content Strategy & Licensing, DTCJose Turkienicz, EVP, Head of Global OperationsLaura Watson, EVP, Corporate and Executive CommunicationsJane Wiseman, EVP, Head of Originals, DTC

Skydance and Paramount collaborated on “Top Gun: Maverick” and the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and Skydance brings with it an animation department led by former Pixar head John Lasseter, a gaming division, and its own deal with the NFL to pair with CBS's sports rights. While Skydance always seemed like the best option for creators, it could still lead to a lot of changes. The fate of Paramount+ remains the biggest question, as well as Paramount's legacy cable channels that have previously been up for sale.

 










Today's deal closure brings to an end the longest, most protracted, and hectic example of M&A activity in recent Hollywood memory. Skydance at one point pulled out of an acquisition before coming back in, other bidders emerged during a “go-shop” period, as did lawsuits saying that Paramount did not fairly consider other offers. The Trump lawsuit was the biggest and last remaining hurdle, and though the lawsuit was deemed frivolous by many legal experts, it remained in limbo as the standoff continued until Redstone relented. And with the merger dragging out as long as it did, it threatened to be canceled entirely — forcing Redstone to pay a kill fee to Skydance — if a deal wasn't closed by October.

Hayden Anhedönia wanted to make films. But like so many girls from small-town America, her ambitions outpaced her means. Instead, she wrote music: atmospheric, genre-blurring, and (crucially) low-budget songs that could soundtrack a séance. Ethel Cain, a character in her imagined cinematic universe, became her musical alter ego and the protagonist of Preacher's Daughter, her 2022 debut. Anhedönia didn't need Hollywood backing to style herself as an auteur: She wrote, performed, and produced her songs largely alone, while cultivating a camera-ready tradwife-meets-trucker aesthetic. Unguarded about the scope of her dreams, she echoed one of her most obvious forebearers when, in 2021, she said that she wanted hers to be the “next great American record.”

Preacher's Daughter was billed as the first installment of a trilogy following three generations of women—Ethel Cain being the youngest—in a Southern evangelical setting with evident parallels to Anhedönia's own upbringing in the Florida panhandle. The story, a grisly travelogue, is pocked by familial trauma, perverse sex, even cannibalism. Its somewhat tamer new prequel, Willoughby Tucker, I'll Always Love You, has a younger Cain ensnared in a teenage love triangle with the title character and death. Sprawling as it is, the project, so far, coheres around its defining theme of fragility—of life, of love, and of the American dream.

You'd be forgiven for not getting all of that just from listening. While loaded with backstory, these records subsist more on ambiance than on plot. Anhedönia, often classified as a pop artist, gravitates equally—and on Willoughby Tucker, increasingly—to sludgy slowcore and dusty, sepia-toned folk; to sounds that are laggy and distorted, like dinged-up records played at the wrong speed. (For a more extreme application of this interest, see Perverts, the ambient album she released in January.) Her characters are illuminated in lightning bolts of imagery rather than in continuous tracking shots: The love interest on “Dust Bowl” is a beautiful and tortured “natural blood-stained blond” who takes her to see slasher flicks at the drive-in; elsewhere, Cain languishes in a stale, mildewy bedroom and in pallid hospital light. In the darkness between these flashes, Anhedönia smears drones and lap steel and tape crackle and cardiac monitor beeps into murky abstraction.

And then there's “Fuck Me Eyes,” Willoughby Tucker's second single. A tender, colorful character study of a teenaged town harlot, the song features some of Anhedönia's sharpest writing (“Three years undefeated as Miss Holiday Inn”) and most maximal production—all twinkly '80 synths and booming percussion—as it probes the gap between desire and acceptance. Sonically, it's a headfake, a play she's run before: “American Teenager,” the arena-ready single from Preacher's Daughter, is similarly at odds with its context. On its own, “Fuck Me Eyes” is captivating. In situ, it has the feeling of a box ticked—the legible pop song that exists to justify the unmarketable creative choices surrounding it.

This would sound like an overly cynical read had Anhedönia not spoken candidly about how much business shapes her work. “This is my livelihood… I do have to find the compromise of, we put out an album, I tour it, I make a pop song or two,” she said in a recent interview with The New York Times. In her music, there's a related and ongoing negotiation between her desire to connect with listeners and her desire to challenge them. For all its conceptual scaffolding, the story of Ethel Cain is a fundamentally human and accessible one, about navigating love and betrayal; actually hearing it out, though, can feel like an endurance exercise, or a test of faith. Songs on Willoughby Tucker routinely stretch past six minutes. One (“Waco, Texas”) runs to 15, without a discernible chorus or other structural signposts. The pace is glacial; the palette funereal.

There is no pleasure without pain; as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you. The uneasy coexistence of beauty and torment defines Willoughby Tucker: “To love me is to suffer me,” Anhedönia sings in her gorgeous, breathy murmur on “Nettles,” a slice of pastoral folk. In the song, Tucker has sustained a critical injury from an industrial accident, and Cain imagines their future together in a moment of fleeting fantasy before reality sets in. With its lush imagery and sweet delusion, it reminds me of John Everett Millais' painting of Ophelia drifting downstream before drowning. Drowning, fittingly, describes the impression of “Willoughby's Interlude,” the stormy instrumental that immediately follows—an extended mash-up of drones and what sounds like someone breathing heavily in an adjacent room.

But perhaps the most interesting frictions in the Ethel Cain universe play out not in the music but in the relationships between Ethel Cain, the character; Hayden Anhedönia, her author; and their shared audience. With growing celebrity comes growing scrutiny, as Anhedönia recently learned firsthand when offensive old posts of hers circulated online. The incident challenged an expectation, common among a subset of pop fans, that singers be beacons of moral clarity. Anhedönia can't—and shouldn't—be expected to lead us into the light. Still, I want more from her than darkness. There's something a bit too obvious about the way the coastal media class has embraced her grim, sweeping visions of rural America. It's simpler, I guess, to peer at the red heart of the country in spooky diorama form—validating our assumptions about the bleakness of life there—than to, say, talk to a Republican.

I thought about this while listening to the album's closer, “Waco, Texas.” (This is the 15-minute one; the mind wanders.) The title is loaded, but Waco turns out to be more signifier than subject—a kind of shorthand for the themes of religious zealotry and violent demise that recur in Cain's catalogue. (Early demos of this song circulated online in 2022, before Donald Trump held his first 2024 presidential campaign rally in the city.) Anhedönia seems to be reaching for a grandiose concluding statement, but it's a modest couplet that really sticks out: “I've been picking names for our children/You've been wondering how you're gonna feed them.” An economic marvel, it's packed with more hope and dread and disaffection than the whole quarter-hour of material surrounding it. You don't need to shoot the big-budget film, it turns out, when a home movie will do.

Listening to the cool, glassy No Rain, No Flowers, you'd never suspect that the Black Keys are on a mission to rebound from their annus horribilis, the kind of year that gives rock bands nightmares.

It wasn't supposed to be that way. The Black Keys set up their 2024 to be triumphant, releasing the glitzed-out Ohio Players with plans to tour North American arenas through the summer. They launched the album by saturating SXSW 2024: giving a keynote, holding multiple showcases, and premiering Jeff Dupre's documentary, This Is a Film About the Black Keys. But then, nothing went right. Ohio Players made a lackluster debut on the Billboard 200—landing at No. 26, it was their weakest showing for a full-length since their 2006 album peaked at No. 95. The band cancelled its arena shows within a month of their announcement, reportedly due to soft ticket sales. And within weeks, they had also fired a management team spearheaded by industry legend (and Eagles manager) Irving Azoff. Drummer Patrick Carney vented on the site formerly known as Twitter: “We got fucked. I'll let you all know how so it doesn't happen to you.”

Carney never delved into the details, later telling Rolling Stone, “You got to take it on the chin sometimes to move forward, and that's kind of what the last year was for us.” In that same interview, guitarist Dan Auerbach explained that the title No Rain, No Flowers derived from “an expression that I'd heard … that seemed to sum up how we envisioned ourselves getting over the situation that we'd just been through.” Carney hammered that point home: “We got a little bit complacent with the business shit because we've been so busy with the creative shit,” he said; it was a reminder “to pay attention to both things.”

From a certain angle, No Rain, No Flowers does find the Black Keys shaking off complacency and venturing into new territory, leaving their gnarled blues-punk back in the garage. A key component in that expansion is the band's decision to invite a host of outside musicians into the studio. They did this on Ohio Players, too, working with like-minded crate diggers including Beck, Dan the Automator, and Noel Gallagher. But the pedigree of the collaborators here is decidedly pop: Daniel Tashian, best known for his work on Kacey Musgraves' Grammy-winning Golden Hour; veteran songwriter Rick Nowels, who has written with with everyone from Stevie Nicks to Lana Del Rey; and Scott Storch, a hip-hop producer whose commercial heyday is nearly 20 years gone.

No strangers to hip-hop—they took a busman's holiday as BlakRoc in 2009—or studio experimentation, the Black Keys historically have used those modes to chase psychedelic dreams. That's not the case here, though. Instead, they deploy electronic effects as mere texture, lending cheerful melodies a supple, diffident sense of style. The cool assurance of the production pushes the album's sound squarely into the middle of the road. Aside from the grinding guitar riff that keeps “Man on a Mission” afloat, there's barely a hint of the big, bloozy stomp of El Camino; the Black Keys have traded blues-rock for blues-infused pop.

Since they're veterans playing with seasoned pros, the Black Keys execute their transition to adult-alternative pop with precision. No Rain, No Flowers glides along amiably, sliding from the overcaffeinated “The Night Before” to the stiff funk of “Babygirl” with ease. Echoes of beloved oldies reverberate through the record: “Make You Mine”—co-written with Desmond Child, Bon Jovi's song doctor in the 1980s—hums to the slow swirl of Philly soul; “On Repeat” and “Kiss It” float along to hooks that feel excavated from the golden age of AM radio; and “All My Life” beats to a disco pulse. It's all exceedingly pleasant, which is a bit of a curse. They're songs with ingratiating hooks—tracks that would benefit from the ambient exposure of a grocery store or a doctor's office, where they'd worm their way into the subconscious leaving no trace of entry. It's so comfortable, in fact, that it hardly feels creative. But at least it sounds reassuring—the kind of music you make when the future is uncertain and you want to keep the end at bay for as long as you can.

When she's not making indie-folk with Florist, Emily A. Sprague records ambient albums, and she has a new one on the way. Cloud Time is out October 10 (via Rvng Intl.). Below, watch the video for the new album's opening track, “Tokyo 1.”

Sprague recorded her new album while she was on tour in Japan last year. “When I began preparing for the tour, I couldn't shake a sense that the invitation to Japan was more about opening myself up to this new place instead of bringing something into it tightly under my control,” Sprague reflected. “Improvisation has always been such a pillar in my music practice, and I really wanted to meet the country, spaces, and people through that process.”

Cloud Time is a distillation of more than eight hours of material that Sprague recorded. For the album, Sprague was inspired by the Japanese environmental music philosophy kankyō ongaku.

Cloud Time is Sprague's first solo album since 2020's Hill, Flower, Fog. She and her bandmates in Florist released the album Jellywish earlier this year.

Eddie Palmieri, the pianist, composer, and bandleader who was instrumental in the creation and ongoing reinvention of salsa, died on Wednesday, August 6, at his home in Hackensack, New Jersey. The news was shared in an Instagram post. His youngest daughter, Gabriela Palmieri, told The New York Times that her father's death followed “an extended illness.” He was 88 years old.

Eduardo “Eddie” Palmieri was born to Puerto Rican parents in New York's Spanish Harlem. His older brother, Charlie Palmieri, also a pioneering pianist, led the way for his younger sibling, who wavered between piano and timpani but finally abandoned his role as a “frustrated percussionist” to “take it out on the piano,” as he once put it. The eight-piece he formed in 1961, La Perfecta, steered the mambo scene towards the more complex Afro-Cuban rhythms of salsa, but was so inventive and bloody-minded that it seemed to instantaneously explode out of the genre it was forming. As saccharine salsa romántica became a pop phenomenon, Palmieri skewed toward economical composition and sonic bombardment, his penchant for trombone-heavy setups sparking a movement of its own within salsa. His monumental 1969 album, Justicia, combined elements of funk, soul, and psychedelic rock with Cuban dance rhythms and lyrics rallying against racism and colonialism.

Though the genre bears his unmistakeable imprint, Palmieri was always unhappy with the term “salsa” and referred to his music as “Afro-Cuban,” part of a continuum mixing African rhythms with an expanding range of diasporic influences. Going forward, he preferred to play in smaller bands, favoring a conjunto format more in keeping with his combustible sensibility. That sensibility translated to his business dealings—he was nicknamed “the Madman of Salsa” for his confrontations with everyone from mob-backed industry executives to the Inland Revenue Service—even as he embedded in the working musician lifestyle, becoming a regular of the mythic Monday night bills at New York club Village Gate.

Palmieri's proud status as a working-class insurgent in the music industry never stopped him winning establishment respect, almost in spite of himself. In 1976, he became the first Latin person to win a Grammy—taking the inaugural Best Latin Recording award for the album Sun of Latin Music—and went on to win seven more, including the following year's in the same category, this time for Unfinished Masterpiece. His prestige allowed him to push for the creation, in 1995, of the Best Latin Jazz Album category, which he successfully campaigned to reinstate after its deletion in 2012. His final solo studio album, Listen Here!, won the category's 2006 award, and he continued to release collaborative records and tour well into his eighties. In 2013, the National Endowment for the Arts named him a Jazz Master and the Latin Grammys gave him a Lifetime Achievement Award.

7.3

Genre:

Experimental / Pop/R&B

Label:

Zubberdust Media

Reviewed:

August 7, 2025

Ali Sethi's debut album, Love Language, begins with a song you're not allowed to hear. The delicate keys and candlelit croon of “O Balama (Censored Love Song)” are intermittently interrupted by squalls of radio-jamming static before being buried under a dystopian barrage—whirring helicopter blades, distant screams, bass that explodes like artillery. It's a poignant opening that lays out the album's stakes with cinematic clarity: a voice shaped by centuries of syncretic South Asian musical traditions, straining to be heard over the white noise of nationalism, identity politics and state-sanctioned erasure.

This isn't just a metaphorical struggle. In May this year, following four days of military clashes between India and Pakistan, the Indian government ordered streaming platforms to stop hosting content originating from Pakistan. Sethi—a U.S. citizen who lives in New York, but was born and raised in Lahore—suddenly found himself cut off from his biggest market. His Instagram account was blocked in India and much of his catalog disappeared from major streaming platforms, including his 2022 breakthrough hit, “Pasoori.” Apparently, the song's central message—of love as an antidote to the divisions imposed upon us—posed too much of a risk to “national security.”

Censorship is just one of the threats dramatized by “O Balama”'s martial cacophony. In Pakistan, Sethi's queer identity has made him a target of the religious right. In 2023, in response to false rumors that he had married his partner, Pakistani-American painter Salman Toor, he was subjected to a wave of homophobic trolling, including calls for his execution. In the United States, Trump's return to the White House has coincided with a surge in anti-immigrant rhetoric and Islamophobic hate crime. All over the world, it seems like the ways of being that Sethi champions—borderless, pluralistic, grounded in a sense of shared humanity—are on the retreat, fighting a desperate rearguard action against bigotry and intolerance.

On Love Language, Sethi goes on the counterattack, crafting effervescent, playfully subversive pop songs that don't merely challenge the binaries that bind us, but dissolve them altogether. Punjabi folk collides with blown-out hyperpop; Hindustani classical ragas and flamenco guitar dance an intricate waltz; Sufi devotional meditations are draped in lo-fi, banjo-flecked Americana. East and West, the sacred and the sensual—it all blurs into one phantasmagorical fever dream.

On the Bollywood-meets-bossa-nova track “Hanera,” Sethi sings of forbidden love in innuendo-laced Punjabi as tabla flourishes ripple over club-ready bass and metronomic, four-to-the-floor percussion. The warp-speed tabla rhythms of raga-meets-reggaeton cut “Hymn 4 Him” swing in dizzying spirals; Sethi sings of waving “our flags in the enemy's face,” conjuring images of whirling dervishes at a Pride march. Standout track “Lovely Bukhaar” hovers somewhere between campy striptease and sex-drunk meltdown. Sethi's blown-out vocals—grainy with digital compression and feverish desire—duet with a heavily vocoded sarangi over finger-snap percussion as he sings of love as an illness, an obsession, an addiction so powerful that it overwhelms both body and mind.

Despite its weighty themes, Love Language never strays into polemic. These are still love songs, after all. But Sethi deploys the love song as a Trojan horse—embedding radical critiques of ethno-nationalism and heteronormativity in declarations of longing and pleasure. He draws not just from the best traditions of Western pop, but also the ghazals and Sufi poetry he was raised on. In these poetic forms, gender is often fluid—male poets pining for male murshids, lovers shifting shape mid-verse—and the lines between romantic love, spiritual devotion, and quiet rebellion are deliberately blurred.

Like the Sufi mystics before him, Sethi uses the language of desire—and the subtle shadings of his powerful, emotive voice—to gesture at subtextual undercurrents of resistance and solidarity. On the indie-folk charmer “Bridegroom,” he cosplays as a coy bride who claps back at those who question her to-be husband's manhood. It's a tongue-in-cheek celebration of queer love, and a winking rebuke to the homophobic troll campaign he endured a couple of years ago. “Rocket Launcher”—featuring Lahori musician Maanu—layers flute trills and autotuned yearning over a jittery drill beat as Sethi gently lampoons Punjabi hypermasculinity while also subverting stereotypical associations of Muslim men with lethal weaponry.

Elsewhere, the hyperpop cabaret of “Villain” reimagines the 1970s trope of the Bollywood vamp—glamorous, campy, and promiscuous, in contrast to the chaste heroine—as a queer antihero, cocking a licentious snook at the gatekeepers of love, identity, and morality. Scooped-out dhol rhythms and cheesy '80s disco riffs lead into a crescendo of glitchy bleeps and jagged industrial synths as Sethi's voice alternates between breathy whisper and kittenish croon.

Love Language loses a little steam in its final stretch, trading anarchic, liberatory joy for more sedate, formulaic fare. “Tere Sitam” is a technically accomplished ballad, but it lacks the exuberant inventiveness that makes Sethi's music so thrilling. The folk-pop of “Kaava” sounds too indebted to the melancholic melodrama of sappy late-'90s Bollywood, despite Sethi's attempts to update that sound for Berlin clubland.

Still, even in its quieter, less adventurous moments, Love Language never loses sight of its central proposition: that love—in its myriad forms—can be a site of resistance as much as retreat. In Sethi's capable hands, romance becomes a radical act, gender a performance, and tradition a canvas to scribble all over. The result is a record that insists, tenderly and flamboyantly, on the right to love and be loved, across every kind of border.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Erika de Casier Is a Student of the Game","https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/erika-de-casier-interview-off-the-dome/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Erika de Casier songs sound familiar and distant at the same time, and part of the fun is connecting the dots. Whenever one of her hushed, new-old R&B joints really hit me, I'll have six or seven new phone tabs open by the time it finishes. Sometimes, it's because, with her delicate melodies, she drops in a casual hangout detail so specific that I'll remember someone or a situation that I haven't thought about in forever. Her late-night club adventures on “Do My Thing,” have even made me dig up an old college Facebook photo album once or twice. Other times, it's because tiny instrumental effects send me down wormholes of genres I'm both up on and getting hip to, from the R&B girl groups of the 2000s to vintage UK garage.

Depending on what catches my attention—the dazed riff on “Space” that sounds like the sample on Biggie's “One More Chance” remix; the droning opening notes of “December” that feel out of OVO's R&B canon—the songs feel a little different every time I listen to them. I think of “Intimate,” the first de Casier song I ever heard, off her debut album, Essentials, which when I focus on her soft vocals reminds me of the funky singles on the only Groove Theory album. But then, when I pay more attention to the synths and her dirty romantic fantasies, I think of it more as a sensual take on Tha Dogg Pound's “Let's Play House.” Or, “You Got It!,” one of the moody standouts from her self-produced new album, Lifetime, where in the heavy bounce you can hear the trip-hop influence she's referenced in the past, but, also, in my ears, I hear a spin on the Hitmen beats circa Mary J. Blige's My Life.

Since the beginning, her writing has been intimate and personal, emblematic of a storyteller who can pinpoint a fleeting emotion and describe scenes fit for a rom-com. But, on Lifetime, a lot of the talking is done by her sample-heavy beats. Personal favorites are the balmy groove of “Miss,” which establishes the album's daydreaming spirit, and “The Chase,” where faint breaths and phone sounds punctuate the loneliness and drama as she exhales, “Hit midnight/Not even a text to hold me warm.”

Raised, in part, in Ribe, a small town in Denmark, Erika de Casier stitched together much of her familiarity with pop, alternative rock, R&B, and hip-hop by watching MTV and borrowing CDs from the library. In her music, you can sense a soundtrack of her life subtly being formed. Lifetime, the first album she produced entirely on her own, made me want to dig deeper into de Casier's work as a beatmaker, so I hopped on a video call with her while she was on a writer's retreat and vacation with some friends on an island off the coast of Denmark called Fanø, about four hours from her home in Copenhagen. As her cat roamed around, de Casier spoke carefully and intentionally, wary of the attention her words get as she becomes more popular, as we chatted about her beats, hip-hop origins, and new album. A lightly edited version of our conversation follows.

Erika de Casier: I like both. I work on my own, then I miss working with people for a while. And then I work with people and miss working on my own. I feel like I'm in a cycle of being an introvert, extrovert.

I was talking to my friend about this thought that now sounds kind of awful, that I thought life would stop somewhere around 30, and, early on, I felt like I was in a hurry to do so much before I got there. And, I guess, I found out it doesn't stop. I can just keep going and there's not a rush. It's given me the space to just do all kinds of projects I wanted to do.

Yes, because I'm not thinking about the outcome so much. I don't want to treat everything like it's my life's work; I don't want to go into a record thinking I have to show all sides of me. Sometimes I can just stay in one realm, which is what this album is. I remember when I was younger I admired the artists with big discographies. The ones who made a shit record, then this amazing record, then with maybe only one or two tracks I like. But what you really remember is the material that you really connect with personally. I admired that they weren't afraid to try things and this being my fourth record I feel like proved what I already needed to prove and now it's time to stop counting.

That's something I'm trying to work toward. For example, I used to work on one project at a time and then I needed a big break because I was so drained. Now, I'm workin' on a little bit on multiple projects and it helps me keep my sanity. But if I did release a mixtape I don't think it could be like Lifetime. Performing everything myself would be draining; I would need people around me.

Prince and Madonna. There's so much Dolly Parton.

I have an older brother and he introduced me to 2Pac when I was younger. One day, he called me into his room and he was playing, “First off… and the clique you claim/Westside, we ride….”

“Hit 'Em Up”! At this time I was really into writing down the lyrics of songs I liked. So I think my brother noticed that and tried to find the hardest and fastest song for me; I think I was maybe 10 years old. He ended up finding the lyrics and told me to rap along, but, of course, I couldn't. But I just remember being blown away by the attitude and energy. That's a core memory.

It wasn't often. I just remember him liking Tupac so much that he told me I wasn't allowed to listen to Biggie [laughs]. But he did fuel my love for hip-hop and R&B, which grew when I watched MTV and went to the library for CDs.

I remember finding Erykah Badu. I couldn't say her name at first, and then I found out it was pronounced just like my name. And I was like, “Erykah! That's me!” So I brought it home. But the library had a lot of stuff like Radiohead, Portishead, Craig David, and a lot of indie Danish acts. In my small town a lot of my friends loved alternative rock music, so that was really big. I remember one friend was obsessed with Björk. I remember I was writing to one friend recently 'cause he just had a baby and pointed out to me that I was always curious about music because I was the first one to have an iPod and I was always begging my mom to take me to concerts in Copenhagen. That surprised me because I never really thought about how I was interested in music that early; I kind of just assumed that was what everyone was doing.

Yeah, because I remember when I was a kid you had to have the artists you were a fan of and nobody else was allowed to make that their favorite. My friend had Blink-182 as her top.

N.E.R.D. and Pharrell. I used to have N.E.R.D., Neptunes, everything. The posters were all over my room; I claimed them.

It was really experimental. I hadn't heard hip-hop and rock be merged in that way before. I felt so seen. I was in a small-town rock environment, but also loved the rap I was seeing on MTV. I felt like I had to choose. But that was the moment where I was like I can have both.

I downloaded Kelis' “Milkshake” illegally off Napster. I remember that so clearly because I had it and then it came to Denmark, like, six months later.

I didn't even know that at the time. All I knew was I liked the one that went, “I hate you so much right now,” and so I typed her name in. But back then, I just assumed artists did everything without even thinking about it all that much, but it made so much sense when I found out.

I saw this meme of how artists talk about how they made records, and how they're always like, “It was so random, I found this synthesizer on the street and this cool sound came out” [laughs]. But it does feel like that sometimes, one thing leading to another over years, collecting so much inspiration from life and listening to music. And, with this one, I just had so many old sample CDs, so I started playing around with downbeat lounge samples and really heavy hip-hop beats. I think I was making a collage of what I liked, a record I would put on myself and chill to.

The base of that beat is these robotic sounding voices, I don't know if you can even really hear it until the end, that I sampled from another song I made that I didn't use but chopped up. I kind of used the rhythm and added another beat to it if that makes sense.

There's so many songs that I've discarded and I go back to them and I just really like one part. I try to really kill my darlings. Take one bassline or element that's sick and get rid of the rest.

That would be amazing. I've never really been asked until Lifetime, even though I've always co-produced my other stuff. Maybe it's because I'm a female producer so when there's other names attached everyone is like, “What did you really do?” But I would be nervous, I wouldn't want to ruin anyone's sound.

Dr. Dre's 2001 (Instrumental). I can listen to that forever. I listen to the instrumental album all the time, probably because I listened to it with the lyrics so much that I just started listening to the beats. I notice things about the beats now that I didn't notice before.

It's so spacious, each sound gets room. It's confident, has a mood, and all the choices feel natural. Nothing is forced. It's harsh but still slow and vibey.

You need it for a groove to work. When I make a beat I layer, layer, layer, and then, I remove, remove, remove. If I remove something and don't notice it, it's disposable. But the second I remove something that I notice, I put it back and the beat is done. But I want to prioritize space; I don't know if that's something people can notice about my music or if it's just in my head.

Ones that [are] like a little story or movie. Do you know Modjo's “Lady”? There's a handheld camera and, like, three people on a summer adventure; it's quite magical. Or like Destiny's Child, “Bills, Bills, Bills,” where they're walking around the hair dresser, or “Independent Women, Pt. 1,” that is like them as Charlie's Angels. I like a mood.

They don't have the same weight as they did once. But I still like when an artist takes a chance to make them, even if there's not one channel that everybody's watching and you really only see it if you're already following that person or it gets suggested to you by an ad.

I have Spotify blindness; I don't know. I like 21 Savage; I walk around and listen to that “Sneaky” track. John Glacier, Dean Blunt, Florence Sinclair. I listen to a lot of Future. I want to say Drake.

That makes sense actually, because I do really, really love PartyNextDoor. I think it all comes from me loving all the mixed emotions on 808s & Heartbreak.

A lot of the music I listened to growing up had all these phone sounds—Usher's Confessions, the Ginuwine and Aaliyah song that went like, “Your telephone's awful busy,” [“Final Warning”]—and I always liked how the music videos were so fixated on them. But there's something so intimate about a phone call, just two people having some sort of connection that nobody else is supposed to hear.

No, because I feel like it happens naturally. I'm in awe of great rappers, so I'm not trying to be one of the best. Like, I know I can't freestyle.

I think it's just about feeling connected to the person finding the best way they can to express their feelings and not trying to prove some sort of skill to you. It's authentic.

They're all quite personal, but probably “You Can't Always Get What You Want” and “Lifetime” because that's where I felt most vulnerable. Those are the tracks I wanted to remove.

I'm afraid of oversharing. It's one of those things when you say it out loud it feels silly because when my friends who make music say they can't say something, I'm like “Why?” But it's a thing I have with myself, maybe it's a Danish thing, we like to keep to ourselves.

A little. And it's kind of messed up that I just have songs out there about personal relationships that people can just, like, listen to [laughs]. But I'm aware of all that; people can listen and say this sounds honest, or this doesn't. It's just my personality, I'm not the kind of person that when you first meet me I'm going to open up.

I know that more than half of my music doesn't come out anyway, so I don't worry at first about if something can be misinterpreted or not. It's not until the song is finished that I feel like taking stuff out, but if I do, that could ruin the song. So I have to figure out a compromise, either just leave the whole song or don't release it. I'll play it for my friends and ask them, “Am I being too much?” and they always say, “No, when you think you're over the line, you're not even close to the line.”

Yes, very.

It's never bad, but I'm also never like I did it. I can hear every little sound in the production that's a little off, every little breath I didn't mean to make, every mistake. I liked that about other people's music and had to learn to live with that about mine. It's never perfect, but also that's a good thing, I guess. But as long as it's a nice vibe I can stand behind it. Or else I would never release anything and just hide.

Lizzo poked fun at the whole Sydney Sweeney and American Eagle ad controversy in a snippet for her new song, reportedly titled “I'm Goin' In Till October.”


	In the clip, which Lizzo posted on TikTok, the rapper is seen washing a Porsche while wearing a denim top. On the verse she previewed, Lizzo raps, “No kizzy, he ain't got no business being with me. Fat ass pretty face with the titties. Bitch, I got good jeans like I'm Sydney.”

You're cute jeans 😌


	In another TikTok video, Lizzo mocked the right-wing response to the controversial ad campaign with a clip of a Fox News pundit saying, “We're over this woke agenda. We are over the Lizzos, we are over the Dylan Mulvaneys. If this were a 300-pound non-binary person, they would be applauding her.”


	That clip then shifts to Lizzo doing her own version of the Trump-loved Sweeney American Eagle ad. “Lizzo's got good jeans,” the rapper added in the caption, a play on the campaign's slogan.

	Lizzo previously made note of the American Eagle campaign in late July when she posted a photo of herself in an all-denim get-up alongside the caption “My jeans are black.”

	American Eagle's decision to pair Sweeney — who has blonde hair and blue eyes — with a tagline like “has great jeans/genes” has prompted some on the left to accuse the campaign of subtly dog-whistling white supremacy and eugenics in Trump's America. Meanwhile, the right has celebrated the campaign for allegedly doing just that, with even Trump praising the ad (while misspelling Sweeney's first name). 

	











	Last week, American Eagle issued a statement in response to the controversy. “We continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way,” the company said. “Great jeans look good on everyone.”

T
he hotel room is cold, antiseptic, the only sound the gentle whisper of central air. I can't go outside, my fixer tells me, or I might be kidnapped. 


	From my window high up in the most expensive hotel in town, I look down at a baseball field and a new luxury condominium complex under construction. I am in the center of Culiacán, and here, things feel safe, like I'm in an American suburb. It is quiet, almost eerily so. Because as soon as the sun goes down, the killing will begin. 


	A few days ago, they found a body stuffed in a white sack stained with blood, dropped off in front of a funeral home. Sometimes, the bodies are surrounded by pizza boxes. And sometimes they are surrounded by black ball caps. And everyone who lives in Culiacán knows what both of those things mean. They are insults to El Chapo and El Mayo, the two men who once ran the Sinaloa Cartel, and who are now incarcerated in the United States.


	Since last September the city has been at war. On one side are the boys of El Chapo — Los Chapitos — and on the other, factions aligned with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. When a military convoy rumbles past, no one seems to notice. When the wail of a siren pierces the air, they all — the deliveryman on the motorcycle, the priest with the Coke-bottle glasses, the mother shielding her child's eyes — glance at the crumpled body on the street and hurriedly walk on, wary of the invisible lines drawn by a war that's reshaping the most powerful drug cartel in the world. And it's only been made worse by the second Trump administration. 

	











	When Trump threatened to impose tariffs, the Mexican government made the concession of not just sending troops to the border and to cities like Culiacán, but of also allowing the U.S. military to fly in Mexican airspace. At dusk, if you look up, you'll see drones, rumored to be American, all over the city, collecting intelligence. 

	











	And that's why I can't go outside. The city is crawling with DEA agents, and my fixer, who is from Culiacán, says I look like one. I have no idea if any of this is true. But I have no choice except to wait in this room that smells of jasmine and sandalwood, in this hotel that serves octopus in bone marrow for breakfast, and to hear the reports he brings me of a city teetering on the brink.

	His name is Miguel Ángel Vega. He's spent more than a decade as a journalist and a fixer, working with reporters and documentary filmmakers from around the world, helping them stay safe in one of the most violent cities in the world. Kids he played soccer with are now connected to cartel bosses or have become sicarios. Many of his childhood friends are dead. For a fee, he can take me to cooks at fentanyl labs, to the mountains where they grow poppies, and to high-level members of the Sinaloa Cartel. What he offers is the ability to tell the story of the war for control of Culiacán from the inside. 


	I've been reporting on drug trafficking on both sides of the U.S. border for more than two decades. And yet, every time I step into this world, I feel like I understand it less, not more. Which is why I've always wanted to go to Culiacán, the cradle of the Mexican drug trade. Maybe here, with Miguel as my guide, I can get closer to the truth of how this business works, if such a truth even exists.

“What is the price of your life? That's what you're paying me for. Not just for the story, but that you will get out alive.” 


	MIGUEL IS TALL and lanky and has a craggy face and a strong, square jaw. It is a face made for Hollywood. In another life, he was an actor, and then a film director. He lived and worked in Los Angeles, made a hit movie about a bank robbery, and then worked in Mexico City, this country's hub for film and TV. His second movie bombed, and that led him back to journalism, and eventually to this work. He has a drawer full of screenplays and an unfinished novel. If he can save up, he hopes to make those movies, but for now, this is his livelihood, earning between $400 and $600 a day for his services. Sometimes film crews balk at this amount, say it's too much. He retorts: “What is the price of your life? Because that's what you're paying me for. Not just the story, but that you will get out alive.” 


	Miguel grew up in Colonia Morelos, a working-class neighborhood in Culiacán. Back then, in the early 1980s, the drug trade was different, not as professionalized. The men who worked in the trade were known as gomeros, which means gum, because they grew poppy in the mountains and fields that surround the city, cooked it into heroin, and then moved it across the border. The violence of the narcos — the killings and kidnappings and disappearances — was remote from Miguel, as were the men celebrated in the narco corridos. Still, he quickly learned the line between his world and theirs, and what it offered. “Money, power, fancy cars, and beautiful women,” he remembers.

	While many of his friends were drawn to that life, Miguel never was. He always liked books, and could sit reading for hours, lost in his imagination as his friends played baseball between the cars parked on his street. His favorite book was The Little Prince, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which tells the story of a pilot crash-landing in the Sahara Desert, where he meets a prince who grew up on an asteroid. “One sees clearly with the heart,” a fox tells the prince. “Anything essential is invisible to the eye.”

	











	This lesson would stay with Miguel in his chosen professions, but it held particular resonance with him as a boy, because he often spent time with his grandmother, who was blind. “I was her eyes,” he says. “Like I used to describe things that I saw on the streets or things in the house to her.” He realized that his skills at observation and his ability to write could become a career, which led him to screenwriting and journalism. His beat was crime.


	In those early years, he listened to the police scanner and learned that when the frequencies filled with chatter, something was happening. He memorized the codes police use: The number 41 meant murder. His life became hanging out with cops, hopping in his car and driving to a crime scene, sometimes arriving even before the police. “I learned firsthand what is death,” Miguel remembers. He is a deliberate speaker, his voice a low murmur. “And death, it's something that I got to know very well.”


	And then one day, in 2008, a documentary film crew from Los Angeles called. They heard he spoke English and wondered if he could take them around Culiacán, introduce them to some narcos, maybe take them to a crime scene or to see the shrine of Jesús Malverde, the patron saint of narco traffickers. It was the sort of itinerary that would become a cliché in coming years. He was shocked when they paid him $1,000 for four days of work. A few months later, word had spread about him, and another crew called for another documentary. One day while shooting, he looked at the call sheet, which lists production details — the name of the director, shooting locations, the daily schedule — and noticed his name on the crew list. Beside it was the word “fixer.” 


	“I go, like, ‘Oh, so this is what I am,' ” Miguel recalls thinking. Other journalists looked down on this type of work. In fact, his editor at the paper in Culiacán, Ríodoce, asked him why he was wasting time taking gringos around. Whether from France or Italy or the U.S., they often got things wrong, or perpetuated negative stereotypes, either out of laziness or racism, or a combination of both, arriving so unprepared they were surprised Culiacán had ATM machines. 


	They could also be insulting, asking Miguel if he knew what B-roll was, or asking him to go to dangerous places, strapping on bulletproof vests and expecting him to go without one. 

	











	The cartels asked him for favors, too — could he run a load from Phoenix to New York? (He says he never has and never will.) Or tried to accommodate him with favors he didn't want. Once, for example, when a cartel operative heard a French film crew was in town, Miguel was asked if they wanted to film an execution. Arrangements could be made. Miguel was so horrified he didn't even pass along the request, on the off chance the crew would actually want to do it.


	He didn't love the work, but he couldn't find anything that paid better, and if someone was going to help the world understand his hometown, it might as well be him. To his friends, he described his job as part driver, part translator, but also guide and location manager and bodyguard and security consultant.


	Over time, he realized something: He was perfectly suited for the work. He didn't just speak both English and Spanish, he knew the slang only locals use in Culiacán, so people immediately saw him as one of their own, someone they could trust. And while Culiacán is a decent-size city, with a Costco and car dealerships and gated communities of McMansions, it can also feel like a small town, or a rancho, where everyone knows everyone. 


	“I'm two degrees removed from anyone,” Miguel tells me. “If you want to see a crystal-meth lab, a poppy field, a marijuana field, I'm the one who can take you there. If you want to meet a sicario, or you want to see guns, I can open those doors.”


	As a fixer, Miguel has arranged interviews with El Mayo's inner circle. He's sat at the dinner table with El Chapo's mom. He's talked his way out of hostage situations and brokered deals to keep his colleagues alive. He's been in a shootout where two sicarios were killed. He barely made it out with his life.


	“I'm the one who faces all the threats, but most of that happens before the crew arrives. I meet with people I don't know in a dodgy bar. I explain the project. They ask who it's for and then they research everyone. Then they come back and say, ‘These people seem to be legit. But if this is a setup, if these people are not journalists, if they are DEA or undercover, you're the first one who is gone.' ”


	By gone, he means dead. When the shoot is over, or the reporters from The New York Times or National Geographic have their story, they go home; but Miguel stays here in Mexico, with his wife and children, where most of the narcos and the cops know his name and can easily find out where he lives. When he returns home to his apartment in Mexico City, he tries to slip back into his normal routine — meeting friends for drinks, taking his kids to the park, going to the movies with his wife — but no matter how hard he tries, his mind is never far from Culiacán, and where he might go next.


	“It sounds insane what I do,” he says, “but basically my job is to open access and also to make sure everyone on the team will get in and out unscathed.”

	











	He stays alive by remaining committed to a set of principles he's established in his 15 years as a fixer: He is fundamentally neutral. He never takes sides among the warring cartels. He is transparent and upfront. When asking permission to do a story, or when brokering an interview, he lays out the objective of the reporters or film crew, and what the reporting will entail, including whether the crew will interview members of rival groups, the government, or the police. He holds nothing back. 

“I meet with people I don't know in a dodgy bar. I explain the project. They say, ‘If this is a setup, you're the first one gone.' ”


	And most important, he takes great pains to honor every promise he makes — especially when it comes to protecting sources' identities. 


	While other fixers prefer to operate in the shadows and keep as low a profile as possible, Miguel believes his visibility, even his celebrity, acts as a sort of cloak of protection. He is known in Sinaloa as “the fixer,” meaning he doesn't have to be vetted. He's even written a Spanish-language memoir about his work, titled, appropriately, El Fixer. The cartels know who he is and what he does. “They know I'm a man of my word.” 


	The true danger, he says, lies not in being on camera or writing a book, but in making one wrong move — taking sides, exposing a source, or accidentally bringing in someone undercover. That's why he vets every member of a visiting crew and will shut down a production or reporting the minute the cartel asks him to, no matter how upset it may make those who have hired him. “My life is on the line every single day,” he says. “So I have to be extra careful, every time.”


	I HAVE BEEN TOLD the ground rules. We will not go out at night. This is Miguel's most basic rule when things are tense, when the cartels are at war, as they are now. Every time he breaks this rule, he regrets it.


	When we arrive at a location, we will not linger by our car. We will get out, head to the interview, get back in the car, go back to the hotel. We will keep a low profile.


	If something goes wrong, we will not panic. We will not resist if a gunman sticks us up. We will give our wallets. If we are kidnapped, if we don't check back in at the hotel, calls will be made: to the press, to the military, to the police, to powerful people in Mexico City, to the U.S. Consulate. No one wants to kill a gringo journalist. It will only bring more heat. 


	Regardless, he will get us out, as he has done before. And no matter what happens, we will stay together and stay calm. There is nowhere to run, after all. The cartel clocked me from the moment I touched down at the airport, Miguel reminds me, and their hawks, or halcones, have been watching me ever since. They may work at the hotel, or behind the bar, mixing my mojito, or at the stoplight, washing the windshield while we wait for the light to change green.


	And if something goes really, really wrong, Miguel and I will head directly to the airport and take the next flight out. 

	











	It is morning, and we are on the highway headed out of town in a convoy of military and police vehicles. We are traveling with a group of mothers in a white van ahead of us. They are looking for their sons, who have disappeared, and have arranged for a police escort because the cartel doesn't want us going where we're going. 


	The escort might as well be for show, though. If it provides any security at all, it is a false sense of security. “The cartel brought the military to its knees,” Miguel says. He's talking about 2019, when the military swept in to Culiacán to arrest El Chapo's son Ovidio. Once they had him in custody, the Chapitos blocked streets, set buses on fire, took hostages, and began shooting cops and soldiers. They radioed to the commanders of the operation that they were outside Sinaloa's military base and would begin killing soldiers if they didn't release Ovidio and retreat. And after that, they would start killing the wives and children of the soldiers. The standoff lasted for hours, but eventually, at the request of then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the military released Ovidio and left town.


	Miguel looks out the window. “If they can kill soldiers, they own this city.”


	Today he is dressed in all black, with a gray baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. It is the hat of the hometown team, Los Tomateros. Other than drugs, and baseball, Culiacán is known for its tomatoes. At one point, it produced more of them than any other city in Mexico. 


	Not far from a city landfill, the convoy pulls off the highway and enters a rutted dirt road, hidden from view by the branches of weeping willows. Vultures circle above in big loops. I tell Miguel I can see why this could be a perfect place to dump a body.


	“Anywhere is a dumping ground,” he explains, as if to say, there is nothing special about this place.


	We are here because one of the mothers in our convoy got a tip, Miguel says. The tip may have been delivered in a note, and the note may have gone something like this: “If you go to La Pitahayita, you're gonna find a road, an open road to your left, and then like 100 meters down that road there is a dump where you can search for bodies. We left dead bodies there.”

	











	Sinaloa sits on the Pacific Ocean, and just two and a half hours away is Mazatlán, where the cartels launder their money in gaudy hotels and nightclubs. But here, the landscape is dry, austere, spectral. The trees have no leaves. If I were to drop a match, the ground would catch fire, and fire would consume everything in this field of dead leaves and weeds. Once, a farmer grazed cattle here, or grew corn, but now the fields are barren and lifeless.


	I look up and see the plastic head of a doll perched atop a fence post, blackened by soot. The mothers, who have come with shovels and pick axes, think this may be a sign and begin digging. 


	I ask Miguel how often they come out to killing fields like this one, searching for their sons.


	“Maybe three times a week?” he says. He isn't sure. 


	Their sons, they know, are most likely dead. To say they are “disappeared” is to hold on to some kind of hope. It is the same reason they are wearing T-shirts with photos of their sons screen-printed on the front, as if their boys are simply missing, and not gone forever.


	They were probably connected, Miguel says, meaning they worked for the cartel, or a faction of it, the Chapitos or the Mayitos or some other cell no one has ever heard of. Maybe they were sicarios or drug mules. Maybe they ran loads across the border. And then they made a mistake. They said something they shouldn't have said. They didn't pay a debt. They lost a load. Or maybe they didn't make a mistake at all. They killed someone on orders and then were killed on orders from someone else. These are young men in their late teens and early twenties, from neighborhoods like the one Miguel grew up in. These are the casualties of the war for Culiacán. 


	The mothers work dutifully, spending no more than a few minutes at each spot, hacking away at the hard desert soil. They look for some sign, a piece of clothing, a flip-flop, a charred bit of trash. I ask Miguel why they don't dig deeper if they think there's something there. He shrugs. If a body is here, whoever buried it didn't bother digging deep, because there's no fear of getting caught.


	They find the burned body of an animal, and Miguel explains that animals are often burned to cover the stench of death. It is a good clue, but after a few minutes the mothers stop digging and move to another spot. 


	I stop one of them. She asks me not to use her name because she is afraid of the cartels. The other mothers have covered their faces to not be identified. She tells me she has been leading trips like this for four years. She has found more than 100 bodies. But she still has not found the body of her son. 

	











	I look at my notes later. Did she say 100 bodies, or 500? The numbers are incomprehensible. I ask Miguel. He doesn't know. Who can keep track of all the killing, all the bodies? Nearly 2,000 disappeared since last September just in Sinaloa, according to the official tally.


	I later ask how he makes sense of all of this. How does he distinguish between the official numbers given by the government and the things he learns out here, where bodies are found and the killing is done?


	“To me, they're almost the same. One of them is official, and the other, it's the criminal. But they both have agendas,” he says. 


	For example, before El Chapo's capture in 2016, both the Mexican government and the DEA called El Chapo the head of the Sinaloa Cartel. But Miguel says they knew this wasn't true. The Sinaloa Cartel has never been that regimented. It has always existed as a conglomeration of interlocking cells.


	The DEA and the Mexican government knew that El Mayo Zambada ran his own faction and didn't answer to El Chapo, Miguel explains, but no one said this. The narrative of one man in charge was cleaner.


	“The truth is, in Culiacán, we have, like, 20 El Chapos,” Miguel says. “Very powerful people with a lot of money. And they are untouchable. No one ever mentions them or talks about them. They are white-collar people.”


	When he asked sicarios who they worked for, they wouldn't say El Mayo or El Chapo, they would simply say the Sinaloa Cartel, to protect their bosses. It became a global trademark and offered protection for everyone to obscure who they work for, where the money comes from, and who is really in charge.


	“A lot of times, with criminal sources, there is no way to verify what they are telling you,” Miguel says. “The problem is the government does the same thing.”


	I ask him who he fears more. He doesn't hesitate.


	“The government,” he says.

	











	He looks out at the field, where the mothers continue digging in the dirt. Today, they won't find any of their sons.


	IN THE YEARS WHEN El Chapo and El Mayo ruled the Sinaloa Cartel, peace reigned in Culiacán. Miguel's job was much easier then. He could take camera crews to the shrine of Jesús Malverde. He could set up interviews with sicarios without a problem, meet with drug mules, visit a fentanyl lab. 


	But last August, everything changed. El Mayo arrived at a meeting that one of El Chapo's sons, Joaquín Guzmán López, had brokered with Sinaloa politicians, including the former mayor of Culiacán and the governor of Sinaloa. Far less flashy than El Chapo, El Mayo had long been considered the Sinaloa Cartel's best strategist and negotiator — essentially the brains behind the operation. He was also the suspected architect of sprawling networks of corruption that had infiltrated nearly every level of government in Mexico.


	El Mayo, who was 76 at the time, was led into a room and knocked down. A hood was placed over his head, according to a letter he later wrote from prison. He was then put in the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip, where he was forced onto a private jet headed for the United States. He had been double-crossed by Guzmán López, who was also on the plane and had been arranging his surrender for some time.


	To this day, no one is quite sure what Guzmán López's end game was, but the speculation is that by delivering El Mayo he could leverage a better sentence for himself. 


	Regardless of Guzmán López's motives, the capture of El Mayo set off a war in Culiacán. Suddenly, the rules of engagement that had long imposed order on the city were no more. Under El Chapo and El Mayo, those not involved in the drug game were off-limits, but now, the only rule was mayhem: carjackings, kidnappings, schoolchildren gunned down in the crossfire between the Chapitos and the Mayitos.


	The city was carved up like a Risk board: Downtown and most of the city belonged to the Chapitos. A small sliver and the outskirts on the southern end of town belonged to the Mayitos. The most dangerous areas were the spaces in between. 


	Then came Donald Trump and his threats of tariffs. In response, the new Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, sent 10,000 Mexican National Guard troops to the border and roughly 13,000 soldiers to Sinaloa. 


	That may be a precursor for what's next. Trump has long yearned to unleash the U.S. military on the cartels, and he seemingly took a first step in February, when he declared the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations. 


	Doing so gives him legal pretext to invade Mexico, an idea that would've sounded insane during any previous administration, but under Trump, anything seems possible. As Rolling Stone has previously reported, Trump administration officials have considered everything from sending in special-ops soldiers to assassinate cartel leaders to using drones or other military aircraft to conduct air strikes on cartel infrastructure and drug labs. 

	











	This heightened tension had made Miguel's sources in the underworld even more jumpy than usual. “The cartels are freaking out,” he tells me. 


	This evening, we're set to meet with two low-level sicarios, who can provide us some up-to-date intel on the status of the war for the city. Miguel's mood has darkened, though, as the day has gone on, and he seems increasingly reluctant to bring me along. 


	They first agreed to meet at a gas station, then a restaurant. And now they want to meet at a safe house in a sketchy part of the city. It is late afternoon, and Miguel isn't sure if the meeting is going to happen. If it does, he will go alone first to meet them, and then if it is safe, come back and get me.


	He leaves me at the hotel and disappears, out into the city, to work his contacts, to try to broker a meeting that may be falling apart. 


	I sit in the restaurant of the hotel, a gathering place for what seems like every meal of the city's rich and powerful. A Catholic priest in a scarlet-colored shirt sits across from a broad-shouldered man wearing a cowboy hat. A woman heavily enhanced by plastic surgery is seated across the room. She carries a Chanel purse. Her boyfriend, or husband, or lover sits across from her, holding her hand, whispering something in her ear that makes her grin wickedly. 


	All of these people are narcos, somehow connected to the drug world. That's what I've heard, anyway. Somehow the money touches everyone here, and everything. But I also wonder if this is actually true. Couldn't they also be connected to a family with a large tomato plantation? Generational wealth passes through legitimate streams here, too. 


	It's dark when Miguel calls. The meeting with the sicarios will not happen. It's too dangerous, he explains. He sounds disappointed, like he has failed somehow. 


	I look out at the glittering lights of the city. The condo complex across the street is dark. The baseball field is covered in shadows. Everything is quiet, almost eerily so. In the morning, Miguel will call me and tell me they found another body. 


	ON MY LAST DAY in Culiacán, I go downstairs for breakfast and find Miguel in a quiet corner of the restaurant, typing furiously on his laptop. His notepad is sprawled open before him, with pages full of scribbles scattered across the table. I sit down and ask the waiter for coffee. Miguel does not look up or even acknowledge me. He is on deadline for his weekly column on narco violence in Ríodoce, where he's now been working as a staff writer for a dozen years. 

	











	When he is finished, he looks up, a bit startled, as if he is just now realizing I am there. I ask him how much longer he thinks this war between the Chapitos and the Mayitos will last. 


	“At least six months, maybe more,” he says. 


	There are some in Sinaloa, and Mexico more broadly, who like what Trump is doing, he will later tell me, and other security consultants will confirm as much: There was a broad perception that López Obrador did little to confront the cartels. “He had this attitude that the drug war was all the fault of the U.S.,” says Victoria Dittmar, a Mexico City-based analyst with InSight Crime, a think tank and publication focused on organized crime. “But we have to acknowledge that Mexico has a role to play as well in stopping the flow of drugs.”


	The unpredictability of Trump, the thinking goes, has put pressure on the Mexican government to crack down on cartels. 


	Miguel doesn't necessarily think this is a bad thing, but in the long run, he's not sure what it will accomplish, either. The presence of the military in Culiacán has done nothing to quell the violence; if anything, it's made the city more dangerous. People try to avoid going out after dark, and in a city where everything is touched by narco dollars, the economy is collapsing. 


	There is also a fear that the recent uptick in collaboration between the Mexican and U.S. militaries to share intel could backfire, especially if the U.S. military actually invades Mexico. “There's a growing anti-American sentiment in Latin America due to the Trump administration,” Dittmar tells me. “If the U.S. actually violates Mexican sovereignty and invades, it will take a generation or more to regain trust, and then that flow of information stops.”


	Regardless, the Sinaloa Cartel has never been weaker, and there is speculation that it will never be the same. What the Sinaloa Cartel offered at its apex was certainty and protection. That required massive amounts of money for transportation networks, for weapons, for hit men, and above all, for bribes — to cops and politicians and soldiers and border agents. 


	Without one umbrella cartel to pay a tax in exchange for protection, there are more cells, and the barrier for entry is lower, which means the lesser crimes El Chapo and El Mayo forbade in Culiacán — kidnappings, extortions — are here to stay until someone else rises up and restores order. Miguel is betting that someone won't be the military.

	











	But he doesn't believe the stories of the demise of the Sinaloa Cartel, either, or that it is even in decline. It is simply reorganizing. 


	I came to Sinaloa hoping to get closer to the truth of how the drug business works, and hoping Miguel could take me there. But I realize now, sitting with him in this cafe, that the longer he's been helping people like me chase the truth, the more elusive it has become. The official story told by official sources, the story we've been trained to trust, is often a distortion, or a downright fabrication. And the stereotypes that form our understanding of the drug trade in Mexico — corrupt cops, narcos who keep tigers as pets, sicarios who kill for fun — often fall apart under closer examination. Most narcos aren't rich. Most of them don't like killing. Very few, if any, own tigers. Mostly they are desperate people, simply trying to make a living, wishing there were some other way. Just like Miguel. 


	He suddenly gets up, shakes my hand, and tells me he has to go. A film crew from Italy has just arrived in Culiacán.

	Dean Cain, who played Superman on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman from 1993 to 1997, has announced his latest career pivot: becoming an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.


	“I will be sworn in as an ICE agent A.S.A.P.,” he said during an appearance on Fox News' Jesse Watters Primetime. Cain was sworn in as a reserve police officer in Idaho in 2018, then again as a reserve deputy sheriff in Virginia in 2022. “We have a broken immigration system. Congress needs to fix it, but in the interim, President Trump ran on this. He is delivering on this. This is what people voted for. It's what I voted for and he's going to see it through, and I'll do my part and help make sure it happens.”


	Cain's decision comes after he shared an ICE recruitment video on Instagram earlier this week. At the time, he hadn't taken steps to become an agent. “I wasn't part of ICE, but once I put that out there and you put a little blurb on your show, it went crazy,” Cain told Watters. “So now I've spoken with some officials over at ICE.” 

	











	In the Instagram video, Cain echoed the selling points ICE has deployed as it launches a nationwide recruitment effort in hopes of intensifying already brutal crackdowns on undocumented immigration. “Since President Trump took office, ICE has arrested hundreds of thousands of criminals, including terrorists, rapists, murderers, pedophiles,” he said as the Superman theme song blared in the background. Cain boasted about a $50,000 signing bonus and “legal” student loan repayments. He also made sure to specify that “you also don't need an undergraduate degree, you can get to work right away,” a recent change to the application requirements. 

	











	Throughout the year, videos of ICE arrests in which agents have been captured smashing the window of a car with a pregnant woman inside, vigorously beating a man who is curled up on the asphalt, and tossing tear gas canisters near a toddler and a baby have gone viral. The chaotic arrest tactics have, in some instances, led to the detainment of U.S. citizens.

	The Department of Homeland Security has started to forcibly reassign Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees to ICE, threatening them with termination if they do not agree. Last month, DHS reallocated $608 million in FEMA funds to different states to fund the construction and expansion of migrant detention centers. 


	Trump previously said that his new Florida immigrant detention facility, which he dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” would hold “some of the most vicious people on the planet,” using similar language that Cain echoed in his video. But records obtained by The Miami Herald showed that only one-third of the approximately 900 immigrants detained at the Florida facility have been convicted of a crime. Another 250 detainees only have immigration violations on their records, but no criminal convictions or pending charges.

	“It's being portrayed as a real negative thing that we want people to follow our immigration laws, which is insane to me,” Cain said in July, while complaining about Hollywood making Superman — a character who doesn't have the greatest history of getting along with the U.S. government — too “woke.” “I feel we are in a bad situation here now because it's being stoked by politicians and by NGOs that have a political agenda. And I think bringing Superman into it, I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it's an immigrant thing, and I think it's going to hurt the numbers on the movie.”


	James Gunn, who directed the latest Superman film, said, “Superman is the story of America. An immigrant who came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	When Ozzy Osbourne was honored with a funeral procession that snaked through his hometown of Birmingham, fans covered the Black Sabbath bridge and bench with flowers, artwork, personal messages, merchandise, and more. “Ozzy forever,” posters around the locations read. “Birmingham will always love you.” The Central Birmingham Business Improvement District is making sure this won't be forgotten as it works to preserve the thousands of items left in tribute.


	The Central BID team has transported the offerings and started the process of “sorting through them at a secret location, large enough to accommodate the thousands of poignant messages, flowers and gifts,” according to their official website. “They are ensuring they are preserved in the best possible condition, ready to be sent to the Osbourne family.”


	A digital record will be created for all of the tributes, which is being “laid out and catalogued with care” to ensure long-term preservation. Fans left behind “guitars, mini amplifiers, angels, candles, plus lots and lots of toy bats,” the Central BID shared. Black Sabbath shirts, plaques, and albums also appear in the collection.

	











	The Central BID shared images from the location, where the items have been sorted by type. In one image, a note signed by a fan named Angie reads, “Ozzy, your music has made my life so much better. You will always be missed.” Another adds, “To Ozzy, Thank you for bringing the world metal. You are a legend. Rest easy, Prince of Darkness.” Ozzy died of a heart attack on July 22 at the age of 76.

	Flowers from the memorial have also been collected. “The bouquets are set to be close to Ozzy going forward, as they are being mulched and bagged. This confetti compost will be used at Ozzy's final resting place,” the Central BID shared. This includes the purple flowers wrapped in black tissue and ribbon that Sharon Osbourne and their children left at the Black Sabbath bench. “At the wishes of the family, these will also be mulched into the special compost.”


	Birmingham's honorary lord mayor, Zafar Iqbal, shared a statement following Osbourne's death, saying the musician was “more than a music legend — he was a son of Birmingham.” He added: “[I]t was important to the city that we support a fitting, dignified tribute ahead of a private family funeral. We know how much this moment will mean to his fans. We're proud to host it here with his loving family in the place where it all began, and we are grateful that they have generously offered to pay to enable this to happen and support the city is giving him the farewell he deserves.”

Stephen Colbert is not impressed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cut $500 million in funding for vaccines. On the latest episode of The Late Show, Colbert took aim at the Health and Human Services secretary over the decision, which former Surgeon General Jerome Adams said “is going to cost lives.” 


	“Now, we have 10 more months of this show and I want to give a measured, nonpartisan response here,” Colbert said. He then raised a middle finger to the camera and declared, “Fuck you, you roid-addled nepo-carnie!” 


	Colbert recounted how Kennedy is “nixing” 22 projects that use mRNA technology. “But that's the latest vaccine technology,” Colbert replied. “That's like saying, ‘Kids, I'm turning off the GPS. We're going to make our way to Six Flags by using the stars! Hand Daddy the sextant.'”


	In response to Kennedy claiming that mRNA technology, which uses synthetic gene sequences to teach cells how to create antibodies without needing to introduce viral particles, doesn't “perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,” Colbert got straight to the point. 

	











	“Counterpoint: Fuck you, you roadkill-munching, luddite, human Slim Jim,” Colbert said, flipping off the camera again. “You're gonna kill people. Why would you say mRNA vaccines don't perform well against upper respiratory infections? The National Institute of Health said they prevented an estimated 14.4 million deaths. Why on Earth is RFK Jr. so anxious to fill our streets with dead bodies?”

	Kennedy's recent claims are misleading the public about the science behind vaccines. A 2023 study published by the National Institute of Health on the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Covid found that “despite certain drawbacks such as strong immunogenicity and the potential for triggering irrelevant immune responses, the authorized mRNA vaccines are considered highly effective and safe.” 


	The secretary has waged a full-fledged war against the nation's vaccination infrastructure since his confirmation to Trump's Cabinet. He downplayed the severity of a deadly measles outbreak in Texas — a disease that had almost been eliminated by robust public vaccination programs. In June, he fired an entire panel of vaccine experts tasked with helping shape seasonal vaccine recommendations, replacing them with loyalists and ideologues.

	In her nearly 50-year career, Jamie Lee Curtis says she's only improvised one single line: “Make good choices.” These are the words her character, Dr. Tess Coleman, yelled out the car window to her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) in the 2003 body-swap comedy Freaky Friday. That beloved, heavily-memed quote is brought back for the new sequel, Freakier Friday, which reunites Curtis and Lohan. Only now, things are a little different: Anna is the one shouting “Make good choices!” and consequently mortifying her own teenage daughter, Harper (Julia Butters). Tess sits behind the wheel, rolling her eyes. “You are so lame,” she tells her. 


	It's a humorous twist for anyone who's seen the first film, but it hits harder for millennials who grew up with Lohan onscreen. Twenty-two years after the original Freaky Friday's debut, the long-awaited sequel we thought might never get made is here — and against all odds, it's actually kind of great. Freakier Friday, directed by Nisha Ganatra, is a charming love letter to Lohan and her generation, and marks the actress' official comeback. So get in, loser. We're going to the Lohanaissance. 

	











	First things first: Anna is far from lame. She's not even a regular mom — she's a cool mom. She abandoned her rock-star dreams and her band, Pink Slip, to raise Harper on her own, though she still writes songs privately. She's also the manager of emerging pop star Ella (played by Never Have I Ever star Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), who's grappling with a very public breakup. Anna is constantly putting out fires, particularly when she gets called in to Harper's high school to discuss her daughter's fight with her British nemesis, Lily (Sophia Hammons). It's there that she meets Lily's dad, Eric (the excellent Manny Jacinto, who goes full Swayze with a Dirty Dancing scene). It's love at first sight, much to the chagrin of their rival daughters.

	Six months in, Anna and Eric are engaged, and deciding whether to stay in California or move their families to England. A consultation with a kooky psychic (who later reveals she's actually a Starbucks barista) played by Vanessa Bayer brings on the body switch. Only it's not just two bodies switching: It's four, with Anna and Harper swapping while Tess and Lily pair off. Quadruple body-swapping is ambitious, and we'll admit we had low expectations, but each actress pulls it off (Hammons as Tess, diving into ice cream: “I haven't had dairy since Bush was president!”). Butters in particular kills it, going from surfer chick to worrying mom clutching a glass of crisp white wine, frantically trying to save her engagement while stuck inside the body of a teenager. (As with Sydney Sweeney, Margaret Qualley, Mikey Madison, and others, Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood helped kick off Butters' career. What the hell was in the water on that set?) 


	We veer into Parent Trap territory as Harper and Lily, now inside the bodies of Lohan and Curtis, respectively, conspire to break off their parents' engagement. But Ganatra takes things a step further with a Meredith Blake cameo, as Elaine Hendrix plays a Rolling Stone editor at Ella's photoshoot; we can neither confirm nor deny that Rolling Stone asks musicians to dress up as strawberry shortcakes. It wouldn't have been shocking to see other Parent Trap Easter eggs: Hendrix sipping an Evian water bottle, Chessy entering with a plate of chocolate chip pancakes, and where on earth is tie-dye girl? Lohan has been playing along with all the nostalgia, though she swears the Oct. 3 wedding date for Anna and Eric, a.k.a. Mean Girls Day, was an accident. Sure, Jan.


	Meanwhile, pre-switch, Curtis is “Gram,” the heartwarming kind who bakes cookies for her granddaughter at 4 a.m. and takes too long deciding when it's turn at a four-way stop. She's still a therapist, and despite crowd-surfing at her last talk-show interview, she's continued to write successful books. If some of the jokes in this film don't work, rest easy knowing none of them are Curtis cracks. After her intense dramatic role in The Bear, it's refreshing to see her in a lighter, funnier role; she totally owns scenes involving the donning of lip plumper for passport photos, or accidentally winning a pickleball match against Grace and Frankie's June Diane Raphael.

	Curtis' best scene, though, is when she (as Lily) and Lohan (as Harper) visit Jake, played by Chad Michael Murray, reprising his role. He's moved on from his barista days and is now the owner of a record store, the classic hot-guy career trajectory. He's clutching a stack of Pink Slip records for Anna to sign for charity, but Harper makes a complete fool of herself in a variety of ways that aren't even a little bit funny. Meanwhile, Tess is hiding behind records, writhing on the ground, directing Anna with sexy cues. When Jake finally spots Tess/Lily in between the aisles, he starts to pine for her and their “Baby One More Time” days. It's all a little High Fidelity — did Jake listen to music because he was miserable, or was he miserable because he listened to music?

	Other characters return, including Mark Harmon as Ryan (who has about two lines), and Anna's brother, Harry (Ryan Malgarini, who has even fewer). Pei-Pei and her mom (Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong, respectively), the Chinese restaurant owners who caused the 2003 body swap, make a cameo at Anna's bachelorette party. Sadly, Harold Gould, who played the earthquake-fearing grandpa in the original, died in 2010, and Willie Garson, who played Tess' neurotic patient Evan, died in 2021. But at least we get some scenes with our favorite substitute teacher, Elton Bates (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is once again running detention, this time forcing his Gen Z students to pick up trash off the ground. 


	And thank god for Pink Slip. Anna reunites with her old bandmates (Christina Vidal and Haley Hudson) onstage at the Wiltern, and they perform “Baby,” her tender ode to Harper. Then they dial it up for a scorching “Take Me Away,” and it's euphoric to see Lohan shredding the guitar after all these years. It's a feel-good Disney moment in a film full of them, complete with fashion montages, wacky science lab experiments, and food fights. And Lohan is dynamite as Anna, whether she's rocking her blazer around Capitol Records, riding around in Jake's red Camaro, or surfing in a badass Blue Crush scene. She's returning at exactly the right time, when millennials are nostalgic for their youth, and younger generations are bringing back shoulder bags and low-rise jeans. That's not to say the film doesn't make fun of millennials — there are some hilarious jabs, like how Facebook is “a database of old people” and Coldplay and John Mayer suck. But if you feel like catching up with the Colemans and revisiting some early-aughts magic, Freakier Friday is a good choice.

Three star-like objects which appeared and disappeared in 1952.

A newly published study by Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) researchers has looked at mysterious ""transient events"".

Since 2017, the Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project has attempted to look for stars and other sources of light that have appeared and disappeared from view or have dimmed unusually over the 20th and 21st centuries, known as ""transient events"". The team has previously found that around 100 stars have disappeared from view without an explanation (though other teams have suggestions as to where they went).

""These short-lived transients (lasting less than one exposure time of 50 minutes) are absent in images taken shortly before the transients appear and in all images from subsequent surveys,"" the team explained in a recent pre-print paper. ""In some cases, multiple transients appear in a single image, exhibiting characteristics not easily accounted for by prosaic explanations (e.g., gravitational lensing, gamma ray bursts, fragmenting asteroids, plate defects).""

In the latest study from the group, they focused on transient star-like objects observed in the pre-Sputnik era, or before any satellites had been launched into orbit by humans. The team identified transients captured by the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I), which scanned the skies from November 19, 1949, to April 28, 1957. By focusing on this timeframe, they could eliminate any transient events that are due to reflections from human-made satellites, a common source of bright objects in the night sky.

The team is motivated directly to study UAP phenomena – a topic which scientists have generally steered well clear of. The general consensus is that while alien life is possible, or even probable according to some, there is no real scientific evidence of alien life coming anywhere near Earth. Nevertheless, transients are real phenomena that warrant investigation in their own right, and the team attempted to narrow down their source.

""Given the unusual nature of these events and their potential implications, it is important to further test the hypothesis that some transients may originate from reflective artificial objects in Earth orbit,"" the team explains of their motivation in the new paper. ""Searches for extraterrestrial probes were proposed as early as the 1960s, but to date only a few searches for NTAs have been attempted or proposed.""

The latest paper identified a number of interesting transient events for which they could not provide an explanation, including a bright but short-lived transient event on July 19, 1952, in which three stars vanished within 50 minutes.

""Notably, this particular event coincides in time with one of the most extensively documented aerial anomalies in historical records: the Washington D.C. 'UFO flap' of July 1952, which unfolded over two consecutive weekends (July 18–19 and 26–27),"" the team writes. ""While this may be a coincidence, the temporal proximity invites further scrutiny — especially given the rarity of both phenomena.""

 

While this is all pretty speculative and unlikely to be resolved due to the event taking place over 70 years ago, the team offers up an intriguing statistical analysis that might warrant further attention, potentially showing that these might not be something as simple as photographic plate defects.

""One of the most revealing tests involves Earth's shadow. No matter how asymmetric or irregular the distributions of plate defects may be, they have no plausible reason to avoid the Earth's shadow. In contrast, transients associated with solar reflections would,"" the team explains. 

In short, if the transients were just plate defects, then we would see them no matter where the astronomical equipment was pointed. But according to their analysis, there were far fewer transients detected in Earth's shadow compared to the rest of the sky.

""At 80,000 km altitude, we expect N = 339 transients in shadow out of 106,339 total, corresponding to a fraction of fexp = 0.00319 ± 0.00017. However, we find only N = 79 transients in shadow, yielding fobs = 0.00074 ± 0.000084,"" the team explains. ""The difference in these observed fractions is also highly significant, with a significance level of 12.7σ, computed by combining the Poisson uncertainties in quadrature.""

According to the team, this makes it more likely that the transient events are caused by light reflecting off a source. Which is somewhat odd, given that the period studied was pre-satellite. That's not to say that the transient events are some sort of alien probe. In fact, given a lack of evidence for such a phenomenon, you can place a pretty solid bet that it is caused by something else. A separate paper by the team, for instance, found that they were associated with nuclear weapons tests. But it is certainly intriguing, and may offer clues to scientists looking to study these odd, transient phenomena. 

""Our results motivate continued investigation of historical sky surveys and the application of similar alignment-based detection methods to modern deep-sky imaging,"" the team concludes. ""Whether or not these events ultimately point to the existence of NTAs [non-terrestrial artifacts], the identification of statistically improbable, spatially aligned transients in pre-satellite data represents a novel observational anomaly deserving of further scientific attention. Future work may help clarify whether these transients constitute a new class of astronomical phenomena—or represent the first hints of artificial activity near our planet.""

The study is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

·

Maven Capital Partners (“Maven”), one of the UK's leading private equity firms, has completed the sale of UAP Limited (“UAP”), a leading designer and supplier of high performance door and window hardware, following a period of significant investment and impressive revenue growth.

Bury-based UAP, which has designed, manufactured and distributed advanced door and window hardware since 1996, has been acquired by global security and access company Allegion plc, through one of its subsidiaries.

While the financial terms of the transaction remain undisclosed, the exit has delivered a strong return for both Maven Investor Partners and Maven's institutional buyout fund.

Maven first backed UAP, CEO David Jennings and the wider team in September 2018, leading the £20 million management buyout of the business to support its ambitious organic growth and buy-and-build strategy. Over the period of Maven's involvement, UAP has completed five acquisitions, consolidating its position as a market leader, while investing heavily in technology, R&D and a new state-of-the-art facility on the outskirts of Manchester.

The company has developed a portfolio of proprietary, IP-rich product designs with a strong emphasis on high security and advanced fire rated solutions for both B2B and B2C markets. With a focus on innovation and compliance, UAP's products are rigorously tested to meet standards including Certifire, Secured by Design and BSI Kitemark, providing trusted hardware for manufacturers, installers and end users.

Tom Purkis, Partner at Maven, said: “We are proud to have supported UAP's journey in establishing itself as a leading independent player in the UK market. The buy-and-build strategy delivered the successful integration of five complementary businesses that have broadened the product and service range, enhanced innovation and expanded into new markets. This transaction delivers an excellent return for our investors and provides UAP with a strong platform to accelerate its next phase of growth with Allegion. We would like to thank David Jennings and the full UAP team for all their hard work and achievements”

David Jennings, CEO at UAP, added: “UAP have been proud to be supported by Maven Capital Partners both financially and with practical tangible advice throughout our partnership. Since 2018 we have made five significant acquisitions as a part of our buy-and-build strategy, we have also had a major relocation and investment into state-of-the-art headquarters in Bury and we have grown organically. We were always confident that if we needed support that Maven would be there, standing shoulder to shoulder with us. We would like to thank the Maven team and especially Tom Purkis, Andrew Ferguson and Mike Collis for their continued support and encouragement.”

When staff members were frightened by unexplained paranormal activity, the royal family attempted to rid their estate of any lingering spirits

Georges De Keerle/Getty

 Did Queen Elizabeth and her mother really hold an exorcism at one of their royal residences?


 The rumor about the supernatural event can be traced back to royal biographer Kenneth Rose, who wrote in his journal about a ceremony reportedly held at Sandringham House in 2000.


 After reports from staff about strange and frightening phenomena in the bedroom where Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, died in 1952, the Queen Mother reportedly decided to stage a ""religious cleansing ritual"" to rid the room of any possible ominous spirits.


Bettmann Archive/Getty

 ""It wasn't a conventional exorcism,"" historian and royal biographer Robert Hardman explained in a recent episode of his podcast, Queens, Kings and Dastardly Things. ""There was no dramatic casting out of demons, like you see in films. It was said that the room contained a troubled spirit and that the parson was supposed to bless the space.""


 Rose claimed that Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and her lady-in-waiting, Prue Penn, took part in the ceremony, which consisted of taking Holy Communion and saying special prayers, with the goal of ridding the space of its seeming ""restlessness.""


 ""No one was quite sure who the ghost was supposed to be, despite it appearing in the room where George VI had died,"" Hardman noted. ""Rose speculated whether it might be the ghost of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, who had died a few years before.""


Bettmann Archive/Getty

 It's unclear if any of the royal attendees actually believed in the paranormal; however, Hardman thinks their attendance — especially that of the ever-pragmatic Queen Elizabeth — may have been more as a show of support and action towards their frightened staff.


 ""The late Queen had a strong faith, but she was not superstitious,"" Hardman said. ""She did not have time for these wilder theories – but she did have a strong sense of the spiritual, as does King Charles.""


 The King himself is said to have had at least one paranormal experience at Sandringham. In his book, Britain's Ghostly Heritage, author John West claims that the then-Prince of Wales had a frightening encounter in a library on the estate, which left him and a staff member bolting from the room.

 The beloved Norfolk estate is where the royal family typically spends Christmas and New Year's. The tradition was started by Queen Elizabeth in 1988, meaning all of her grandchildren grew up holidaying at the beloved home.


Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty

 These days, the family's holiday traditions are being passed on to a new generation. On Christmas Eve, they gather for a formal, black-tie dinner and to exchange gifts. In his 2023 memoir, Spare, Prince Harry recalled how the royal gift exchange might differ from the average family.


 “We were at Sandringham in a big room with a long table covered with white cloth and white name cards. By custom, at the start of the night, each of us located our place, stood before our mound of presents,"" he wrote. ""Then suddenly, everyone began opening at the same time. A free-for-all, with scores of family members talking at once and pulling at bows and tearing at wrapping paper.”


 On Christmas morning, the family walks together to St. Mary Magdalene Church, a 16th-century parish located on the Sandringham Estate, greeting locals, fans and members of the press along the way. After the service, they walk back to Sandringham House to enjoy the day together.

Astronomers have first identified a super-Earth in the habitable zone of a distant sun-like star using a revolutionary observation method. This discovery greatly expands the search for planets that may support life.

This information was published by the SciTechDaily portal.

One of the main goals of researchers is to identify Earth-like planets in so-called habitable zones — regions around stars where the existence of liquid water is possible. A planet like this was recently detected by an international team led by astronomers from China.

The researchers discovered the planet Kepler-725c using the transit timing variations (TTV) method. This planet has a mass about 10 times greater than that of Earth and orbits the star Kepler-725, which is similar to the Sun. This is the first discovery of a planet with such characteristics using the TTV method.

Kepler-725c has an orbital period of 207.5 days and is located at a distance of 0.674 astronomical units from the star. The planet receives about 1.4 times more radiation than Earth, and part of its orbit falls within the habitable zone. This makes Kepler-725c a promising candidate for further studies.

A German resident has admitted to running a massive psychic mail fraud scheme that targeted elderly and vulnerable victims to the tune of over $10 million.

58-year-old Georg Ingenbleek was indicted in 2020 and had been a fugitive. He was apprehended in Bolzano, Italy, last year and extradited this past May to face an indictment charging him with two counts of mail fraud, to which he pleaded guilty earlier this week.

Federal authorities in New Jersey said from 2011 through 2016, Ingenbleek created numerous direct mail solicitations supposedly from world-renowned psychics that falsely and fraudulently claimed to offer, among other things, great fortune.

Many of the letters falsely promised that the psychic services being offered were free; however, Ingenbleek directed his co-conspirators to send fraudulent billing notices to those customers who claimed they owed money for those services.

The fraudulent billing notices included threats of legal action if the bills, usually in the $20 to $50 range, weren't paid.

According to officials, this psychic scheme brought in over $10 million.

The mail fraud charges each carry up to 20 years in prison and fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sentencing is scheduled for December 17th.

Comedian Matt Rife may have landed himself in supernatural trouble after acquiring what is believed to be the world's most haunted doll, Annabelle. His plans to exhibit the doll to the public have raised alarm, especially within the paranormal community. The news came after the death of Dan Rivera, who passed away while on the US tour with the doll. However, no foul play was detected in his death, and he died of “natural causes”. 

Psychic medium Matt Fraser has now issued a chilling warning as he told the Daily Mail that Rife's move could unleash “dark, aggressive energy.”

Fraser told the Daily Mail, “Because of all the hype surrounding the Annabelle doll, from naming her to interacting with her and now putting her on display, people are unintentionally breathing life into something that should never be awakened.” 

The TV personality known for Meet The Frasers explained, “The energy builds with every mention, every photo, and every attempt to provoke a reaction. This is not just an old doll, it is a vessel tied to dark, earthbound energy.” He continued, “Dolls do not just become possessed on their own. A spirit must be invited in, often through dark rituals or intentional acts of black magic."" 

He warned that Rife's plans to welcome the public to Ed and Lorraine's home and their well-known museum, filled with what are claimed to be haunted artefacts, and which was closed in 2019, can endanger him and others. 

Fraser shared, “That is how the soul became attached in the first place,' Fraser warned. 'Spirits that have not crossed over feed off attention, and the more fascination there is, the more active and aggressive the energy becomes.” He continued, “It is like dealing with a bully. You can yell, push back and try to assert control, but in the end you are left drained while the bully feels stronger. That is exactly how dark energy works. It pulls from your strength, your peace of mind, and your spiritual protection.”

Fraser added, “The more it is acknowledged, the more power it gains. This is exactly why Ed and Lorraine Warren never wanted the Annabelle doll to be glorified or used for entertainment.” He also believed that the late couple truly “understood the danger” that possessed Annabelle. 

Fraser said that “People think they are just observing something creepy, but what they are really doing is inviting chaos.” He described the possessed items as “spiritually active” and said that these are “tied to dark, earthbound souls that never crossed over.”

In a shocking move, Rife revealed last month that he purchased the Warrens' home and Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. Thus, he became the owner of Annabelle. The infamous haunted doll's disturbing behaviour dates back to the 1970s. 

However, when Ed and Lorraine took ownership of the doll, they locked it in a glass case, which was placed in their museum. The special glass case was to ensure that the ""evil evil-spirited entity"" was contained and warned that she should never be moved.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue.

When Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri won a reversal from the U.S. Department of Justice, allowing HPE's $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks to go ahead, he could have been forgiven for thinking his troubles were behind him.

Instead, HPE has been dragged into one of those weird MAGA conspiracy theories that orbit President Trump's White House. Even Laura Loomer, the vituperous online Trump activist, somehow got involved.





Given that the DOJ dropped its opposition to the merger (it previously complained it would reduce market competition), Neri could reasonably have expected the federal judge overseeing the litigation to waive the deal through.





But because the DOJ's sudden reversal got the gears whirring inside the brains of multiple online sleuths, resulting in an objection letter from Senator Elizabeth Warren, it is suddenly more likely—perhaps not probable, but plausible—that Judge P. Casey Pitts will hold a “Tunney review” that may overturn the deal.





A “Tunney review” is a judicial proceeding that asks whether a proposed merger is in the public interest. The Tunney Act was created in in the 1970s in reaction to President Nixon's meddling in the M&A market.




A negative Tunney review would be a defeat for Neri, who is fending off activist Elliott Management, which bought a $1.5 billion stake in the company and demanded seats on the board in part because it believes HPE stock is being held down by execution errors on Neri's watch. Neri could lose his job if things do not go his way, sources have told Fortune.





For its part, HPE believes it has done nothing wrong, and that it has simply prevailed in a routine judicial process.





“HPE is confident our acquisition of Juniper Networks is in the public interest and will promote further competition in the enterprise WLAN market,” the company told Fortune. “The transaction was appropriately approved with certain remedies by the U.S. Department of Justice, and it was unconditionally approved by 13 other antitrust regulators around the world.  We respect the role our regulators play in maintaining competitive markets and appreciate the professional and constructive way in which the DOJ engaged with us in approving the deal.”





But several online corporate dirt diggers, including Matt Stoller, Francine McKenna, Lever News and Capitol Forum, drew attention to personnel changes at the DOJ immediately prior to its approval of the deal. Two DOJ lawyers on the case appear to have been removed from it, according to Semafor. Now HPE is on the front page of the Wall Street Journal as Exhibit 1 in the narrative that lobbyists are undercutting the MAGA antitrust agenda by making off-the record promises about new jobs in the U.S. (HPE denied that, too.)





In a filing on the federal court docket, HPE listed its advisors on the deal. They included what Sen. Warren's letter described as “MAGA-aligned antitrust thought leader Mike Davis.”




It is this person that Stoller and his online colleagues believe is a lobbyist responsible for changing the minds of Attorney General Pam Bondi and her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, and thus reversing their opposition to the deal.





Following that, Loomer used X to insist that HPE had paid consultants allied to President Trump $1 million each to engage in “influence peddling.” Loomer later deleted the post. Sources previously told Fortune they didn't understand why Loomer was paying attention to the deal.





The Lever published a claim that “In a last-minute effort to save face … intelligence authorities intervened to rubber-stamp the deal because of national security reasons, a claim that never appeared in any of the DOJ and HP's legal briefs.” In fact, HPE did cite national security in its July 7 certification of the proposed judgment approving the deal. (You can see it here on page 2.) The national-security angle is that by combining HPE and Juniper it creates a larger market share for a U.S. company in places where the alternative might be Huawei, which many Western governments regard as a Chinese Communist Party asset. (Huawei has repeatedly denied that allegation.)





The next step is up to Judge Pitts. It is not clear cut that Pitts will rubber-stamp the DOJ's decision. Pitts is a Biden appointee who previously worked at a public interest law firm—and he may therefore be sceptical that Trump's DOJ went from fierce opposition to “whatever” so quickly.





His ruling is likely months away. 




The DOJ told Fortune: “The Department has consistently reiterated that resolution of this merger was based only on the merits of the transaction,” according to spokesman Gates McGavick. 





Meanwhile, HPE stock has not reacted well to all the gossip. It remains down 5.7% year to date compared to the S&P 500 which is up 8%. Elliott's stake is a long position—meaning they want shares to rise. And they are more than willing to replace the CEO if they do not get what they want. Hence the pressure on Neri.

Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost

When it comes to falling down a rabbit hole with conspiracy theories ― QAnon, the “Plandemic” conspiracy theory ― it's young people, not older demographics, who are more prone to buy into such beliefs. 

Age is the most significant predictor of conspiracy beliefs among all other factors, according to a study that was recently published in the journal Political Psychology. And it's people under 35 who are consistently more likely to endorse conspiratorial ideas than any other age group.

“From age 35 on, susceptibility to conspiracy theories decreases relatively steadily across older age groups,” said Jean-Nicolas Bordeleau, a research Fellow at the Jeff Bleich Centre for Democracy and Disruptive Technologies, at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. 

Political conspiracy theories are pushing more and more family relationships to the breaking point. It's not uncommon to hear about siblings who are estranged over extremist political views or people who “lost” their family members to QAnon, a conspiracy theory that posits that a satanic cabal of elites and pedophiles is working behind the scenes to orchestrate global events and enslave children. 

Conspiracy theories increasingly affect our elections, too; QAnon believers came out heavily for President Trump in recent elections; to them, Trump is a white-knight figure destined to bring down the aforementioned cabal. (That's what's made his current handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files such a divisive issue for many.)

And voter fraud conspiracy theories drove thousands to violently storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, an act of domestic terrorism that threatened the nation's peaceful transfer of power. 

Given the growing impact of conspiracy theories in our political and personal lives, Bordeleau and Daniel Stockemer, a political studies professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada, thought it was high time to find out what factors most influence people buying in.

“We were really curious to understand why some people adhere to some really unbelievable narratives like the flat Earth theory and QAnon,” Bordeleau told HuffPost. “Our results don't imply that all young people are attracted to all conspiracy theories, but what we can demonstrate is that younger people are more likely to believe various conspiracy theories than older individuals.

If you assumed it might be Boomers who most frequently fall into conspiracy theory traps ― there are countless depressing stories in online forums of grown children detailing how their Fox News-watching parents fell into a QAnon rabbit hole after “doing research” ― you're not alone. Bordeleau figured that would be the case, too. 

Younger citizens being more conspiratorial as a whole “definitely goes against the typical stereotype of the older uncle at the Christmas table exposing the latest conspiracy theories,” Bordeleau said. “Initially, we were quite surprised to see that younger people were most likely to believe in conspiracies.” 

To find all this out, the researchers conducted a meta analysis ― a kind of “study of studies” ― which synthesized the results of 191 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024.

This huge dataset, which included over 374,000 participants, suggested a “robust” association between young age and belief in conspiracies, Bordeleau said. 

“To confirm that, we ran our own original multinational survey of more than 6,000 people across six diverse countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the U.S. and South Africa,” he explained. 

Regardless of the country, the results were the same: Age was the most potent predictor of conspiratorial belief systems, more than a person's gender, level of education or income. 

So why are younger generations more intrigued by conspiracy theories? Bordeleau and Stockemer think there are three interconnected reasons.

“First, the fact that younger people have a deep sense of political disaffection and alienation,” Bordeleau said. “Second, there's a tendency for younger people to adopt an activist style of political participation and be exposed to more radical environments, where conspiracy theories thrive.” (QAnon originated on the dark web first, with various ideas circulating on 4chan and 8chan as early as 2017.)

Lastly, there's the self-confidence factor, or lack thereof. Self-esteem fluctuates throughout our lives, but studies show that adolescence tends to be a period of heightened lower self-esteem, particularly for young girls. 

“Low self-esteem can partly explain why younger people are attracted to conspiracy theories,” Bordeleau said. “It becomes a way to cope with feelings of powerlessness.” 

Bordeleau said he'd love to further research the socialization component of conspiracy beliefs: how young people are exposed to these narratives, for instance, and whether or not social pressures play a part.

On a wider social level, he hopes that more time and resources are put into looking for ways to help young people become more media literate.

In this article

Firefly Aerospace jumped more than 50% in its Nasdaq debut on Thursday after pricing shares above its expected range.

Shares started trading at $70 each under the ticker symbol FLY. The initial price values the company at close to $10 billion. The shares ticked lower after the open.

Space technology has gained momentum in recent years as companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX amass more funding and government contracts. Firefly is the third space company to go public this year after Voyager Technology and Karman Holdings.

The rocket and lunar lander maker priced shares late Wednesday at $45, above its expected range of $41 to $43, raising $868 million. Earlier this week, Firefly had hiked its range up from the $35 to $39 it initially expected.

Firefly's customers have included a growing list of key defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and L3Harris, and the company recently received a $50 million from Northrop Grumman. Last month, Firefly also won a $177 million contract with NASA.

""It's all about execution,"" CEO Jason Kim told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. ""We're focused on rating up our alpha rockets because there's so much demand for the response of dedicated one-ton launches from national security, commercial, as well as hypersonic missile testing.""

Earlier this year, Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon in a mission funded by NASA. Firefly is also widely known for its Alpha rocket and has said in its IPO filing that its backlog totaled about $1.1 billion at the end of March.

In its IPO filing, Firefly said revenue in the latest quarter jumped sixfold to $55.9 million from $8.3 million. However, the company reported a net loss of about $60.1 million, up from $52.8 million in the year-ago period.

Beyond just space, the tech IPO market has started to heat up this year after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Figma, Circle and CoreWeave have all debuted in 2025 and seen their stocks pop.

Defense and aerospace private equity firm AE Industrial Partners owns a more than 41% stake in Firefly and controls the company, according to the prospectus. Of Firefly's nine board members, five currently work at the firm. AE has $6.4 billion assets under management, according to its website.

After months of policy pivots, delays and negotiations from President Donald Trump, dozens of key U.S. trading partners were hit Thursday with ""reciprocal"" tariffs on their exports to the country.

""IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"" Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

But even as the duties, which were updated just last week, kick in, much uncertainty remains.

Below is a list of the latest tariffs, with the U.S administration stating that all other countries face a blanket 10% tariff rate:

Various countries — such as Switzerland — are still vying for a deal with the U.S. to lower the levies on their goods. It comes after countries and regions, including the U.K., the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, managed to strike trade frameworks.

Others, though, are dealing with significant duties on top of Trump's reciprocal rate.

This includes Brazil, which is facing a much higher total rate after Trump declared that Brazilian government policies were a threat to the U.S. India, also, has been hit with increased levies over its Russian oil purchases.

Both countries are now facing 50% tariffs on their goods. India, however, still has some time before the full rate kicks in, with tariffs currently at 25%.

Elsewhere, duties on U.S. neighbours Mexico and Canada were in play long before the reciprocal tariff announcement. They are currently facing levies of 25% and 35% respectively, with Mexico in limbo as Trump paused hiking tariffs on the country to allow for negotiations.

China is another outlier. After trade tensions between the country and the U.S. escalated sharply and drove tariffs into triple-digits, the trading partners now appear to have achieved détente. Both sides agreed to reduced tariffs in May, with the truce due to last until Aug. 12. In the meantime, China is facing 30% tariffs.

OpenAI on Thursday announced GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large-scale artificial intelligence model.

The company is making GPT-5 available to everyone, including its free users. OpenAI said the model is smarter, faster and ""a lot more useful,"" particularly across domains like writing, coding and health care.

""I tried going back to GPT-4, and it was quite miserable,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a briefing with reporters.

Since launching its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has rocketed into the mainstream. The company said it expects to hit 700 million weekly active users on ChatGPT this week, and it is in talks with investors about a potential stock sale at a valuation of roughly $500 billion, as CNBC previously reported.

OpenAI said GPT-5's hallucination rate is lower, which means the model fabricates answers less frequently. The company said it also carried out extensive safety evaluations while developing GPT-5, including 5,000 hours of testing. 

Instead of outright refusing to answer users' questions if they are potentially risky, GPT-5 will use ""safe completions,"" OpenAI said. This means the model will give high-level responses within safety constraints that can't be used to cause harm. 

""GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models,"" said Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead at OpenAI.

During the briefing, OpenAI demonstrated how GPT-5 can be used for ""vibe coding,"" which is a term for when users generate software with AI based on a simple written prompt. 

The company asked GPT-5 to create a web app that could help an English speaker learn French. The app had to have an engaging theme and include activities like flash cards and quizzes as well as a way to track daily progress. OpenAI submitted the same prompt into two GPT-5 windows, and it generated two different apps within seconds. 

The apps had ""some rough edges,"" an OpenAI lead said, but users can make additional tweaks to the AI-generated software, like changing the background or adding additional tabs, as they see fit.

GPT-5 is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Plus, Pro and Team users on Thursday. This launch will be the first time that Free users have access to a reasoning model, which is a type of model that ""thinks,"" or carries out an internal chain of thought, before responding. If Free users hit their usage cap, they'll have access to GPT-5 mini.

OpenAI's Plus users have higher usage limits, and Pro users have unlimited access to GPT-5 as well as access to GPT-5 Pro. ChatGPT Edu and ChatGPT Enterprise users will get access to GPT-5 roughly a week from Thursday.

""It's hard to believe it's only been two and a half years since @sama joined us in Redmond to show the world GPT-4 for the first time in Bing, and it's incredible to see how far we've come since that moment,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a Thursday X post, referring to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's appearance at Microsoft headquarters in Washington in February 2023.

The new model is coming quickly to Microsoft products, according to a company blog post. Microsoft 365 Copilot is getting GPT-5, as well as the Copilot for consumers and the Azure AI Foundry that developers can use to incorporate AI models into third-party applications.

Box, a company that helps enterprises manage their computer files, has been testing GPT-5 across a wide variety of data sets in recent weeks.  

Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, said previous AI models have failed many of the company's most advanced tests because they struggle to make sense of complex math or logic within long documents. But Levie said GPT-5 is a ""complete breakthrough."" 

""The model is able to retain way more of the information that it's looking at, and then use a much higher level of reasoning and logic capabilities to be able to make decisions,"" Levie told CNBC in an interview. 

OpenAI is releasing three different versions of the model for developers through its application programming interface, or API. Those versions, gpt-5, gpt-5-mini and gpt-5-nano, are designed for different cost and latency needs. 

Earlier this week, OpenAI released two open-weight language models for the first time since it rolled out GPT-2 in 2019. Those models were built to serve as lower-cost options that developers, researchers and companies can easily run and customize.

But with GPT-5, OpenAI also has a broader consumer audience in mind. The company said interacting with the model feels natural and ""more human."" 

Altman said GPT-5 is like having a team of Ph.D.-level experts on hand at any time. 

""People are limited by ideas, but not really the ability to execute, in many new ways,"" he said.

China has criticized the US over its decision to impose “unsustainable” tariffs on Brazil.

The punitive measure was introduced by US President Donald Trump as a response to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and the country's continued cooperation within the BRICS economic group.

In a statement on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing “firmly supports Brazil in safeguarding its national sovereignty and national dignity,” and “opposes unwarranted external interference in Brazil's internal affairs.”

He added that China backs Brazil in “resisting the bullying imposition of tariff measures” and intensifying cooperation among Global South countries, particularly through the BRICS framework.

Wang also held a phone call with Celso Amorim, a senior adviser to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, telling him that “using tariffs as a weapon to suppress other countries violates the UN Charter, undermines WTO rules, and is both unpopular and unsustainable.”

In late July, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, citing what he called a threat to “the national security” of the US. The US leader has voiced particular concern over the prosecution of former right-wing Brazilian President Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over allegedly plotting a coup following his 2022 election defeat.

Trump has also been a frequent critic of BRICS, accusing it of seeking to undermine the global power of the dollar. The group has no common currency, but most of the transactions between its members are done in national currencies.

Lula fired back at Trump, telling him that he is not “the emperor of the world,” later proposing a BRICS meeting to come up with a joint response to the US.

Brazil was not the only country that came under pressure from Trump. On Wednesday, the US leader did not rule out that it could impose tariffs on China that would be similar to the 25% increase in duties for India. Trump earlier slammed both countries for importing Russian oil amid the Ukraine conflict.

Moscow has rebuffed Trump's threats, saying that any sovereign country is free to choose its trading partners.

A US soldier has been arrested on suspicion of sharing secrets about an American tank in exchange for Russian citizenship.

Taylor Adam Lee, 22, was arrested and charged with espionage on Wednesday for sharing classified information about the army's M1A2 Abrams with Moscow.

Mr Lee, an active duty soldier stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas, was charged under the Espionage Act with attempted transmission of national defence information to a foreign adversary, as well as the Arms Export Control Act, federal prosecutors said.

According to the justice department, Mr Lee “attempted to provide classified military information on US tank vulnerabilities” online in “exchange for Russian citizenship”.

Starting in May this year, the soldier is said to have begun trying to send US military information to Russia's ministry of defence.

Mr Lee, who held a top secret security clearance, wrote online in June that “the USA is not happy with me for trying to expose their weaknesses”, adding: “At this point I'd even volunteer to assist the Russian federation when I'm there in any way,” according to the department of justice (DoJ).

At an in-person meeting in July with someone he believed to be a Russian government representative, Mr Lee allegedly passed on an SD memory card and provided a detailed explanation of the sensitive information it contained.

This included documents on the M1A2 Abrams – America's main battle tank – as well as another armoured fighting vehicle and combat operations.

Mr Lee also allegedly discussed providing the Russian government with a specific piece of hardware from inside the M1A2 Abrams tank, which he appeared to deliver to a storage unit in El Paso, Texas on July 31.

Upon delivery, he sent a message to his contact, stating, “mission accomplished”, according to the DoJ.

After a warrant for Mr Lee's arrest was filed in El Paso federal court on Tuesday, he made his initial court appearance the following day.

Investigators accused Mr Lee of “betraying” the US and have used his arrest to send a warning to anyone else considering leaking military intelligence.

Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's counter-intelligence division, said: “Today's arrest is a message to anyone thinking about betraying the US – especially service members who have sworn to protect our homeland.”

The incident comes as the military struggles with foreign agents targeting US servicemen to give up sensitive information.

Earlier this year, Chinese intelligence targeted a navy officer online and bribed him thousands of dollars to extract information about military exercises and radar technology.

Meanwhile, former national guardsman Jack Teixeira was sentenced to 15 years in prison last year for leaking classified information about the war in Ukraine on the messaging app Discord.

“This arrest is an alarming reminder of the serious threat facing our US Army,” said Brigadier General Sean F Stinchon, the commanding general of army counter-intelligence command.

“Soldiers who violate their oath and become insider threats will absolutely be caught and brought to justice.”

ROBERT A. PAPE is Professor of Political Science and Director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats. He is the author of Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War.

 Robert A. Pape

After nearly 700 days of war, the death toll in Gaza has risen to extraordinary levels. Amid heavy bombardment that has turned the territory into a wasteland of rubble and stringent blockades that have led to mass hunger and even starvation, over 61,000 Palestinians have died and over 145,000 have been seriously wounded, according to Gaza's Hamas-affiliated health authorities, which do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters.

But the true number of the war's casualties may far outstrip those figures, which do not include the thousands of bodies that remain under the rubble, the large number of dead that could not arrive at morgues, and the excess deaths from the destruction of infrastructure and the ensuing disease, famine, and lack of medical care. In February, the medical journal The Lancet published an extensive analysis based on a wide variety of sources (including obituaries) and estimated that the official death toll underreported the direct war deaths in Gaza by at least 41 percent and perhaps by as much as 107 percent, while not accounting at all for nontrauma-related deaths resulting from the impact of Israeli military operations on Gaza's health services, food and water supplies, and sanitation.

In sum, the authors of the study suggested that Israel's campaign has caused at least an additional 26,000 Palestinian deaths and perhaps as many as over 120,000 additional deaths, with the true death toll possibly upward of 186,000. Taking that into account, as of late July 2025, Israel's war in Gaza has led to the deaths of between five to ten percent of the prewar population of about 2.2 million. This represents an unprecedented slaughter. Israel's campaign in Gaza is the most lethal case of a Western democracy using the punishment of civilians as a tactic of war.

Leaders and scholars have long assumed that democracy offered a solution to the worst pathologies of authoritarian states, especially the willingness of a government to subject populations to coercion, cruelty, and violence. Indeed, the United States and other Western democracies, including Israel, have insisted that democracy is crucial for the promotion of fundamental human rights, individual prosperity, and a more peaceful world. For Israel, a country that has long touted its democratic bona fides, to violate core democratic norms in such dramatic fashion cheapens the value of democratic government itself.

Israel's defenders may insist that civilian deaths are inevitable in a conflict against a burrowed-in terrorist enemy. But it has been clear from Israeli actions—including the targeting of children by snipers, the relentless bombing of civilian infrastructure and residences, and the blockade and starvation of the civilian population—as well as the rhetoric of numerous Israeli officials that Israel's war is not simply against Hamas but aimed at all the residents of Gaza. That is also the conclusion of numerous international institutions and human rights groups. Indeed, the notion that Hamas can be eradicated via military means is a “fantasy,” as former Shin Bet director Yoram Cohen said this week. As civilians continue to suffer in Gaza, Israel has squandered the moral high ground for no good strategic purpose.

Israel's critics may demand that, based on its treatment of the Palestinians, the country should not be considered a democracy. That understates the full dimensions of Israel's behavior in Gaza. Even now, Israel retains the political institutions built on majority rule and the high levels of citizen participation in free elections that are the hallmarks of representative government and that have long characterized Western democracy. Independent experts, such as Freedom House, still recognize Israel as a democracy. What is truly shocking about events in Gaza is both the scale of the devastation and that the government of Israel can genuinely say that its policies reflect the will of most Israelis. The carnage in Gaza is not the work of authoritarians or demagogues but bears the imprimatur of democracy. Israel's campaign thus has profound implications both for the long-term security of the country and the value of democracy around the world.

In my 1996 book, Bombing to Win, I studied every campaign in the twentieth century that employed airpower with the intention of inflicting harm on civilians: 40 campaigns in all, including the Spanish Civil War, the Vietnam War, and the 1991 Gulf War. Only five of the 40 involved civilian deaths greater than one percent of the civilian population. These included four campaigns in and around World War II—Japan's invasion of China from 1937 to 1945, Germany's invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945, the Allied bombing and invasion of Germany from 1939 to 1945, and the U.S. bombing and conquest of Japan from 1942 to 1945—and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1988. In proportional terms, Nazi Germany's attack on Poland ranks as the deadliest of these campaigns, killing upward of 20 percent of the prewar population over six years. That figure was enlarged, of course, by the Holocaust and the slaughter in ghettos and concentration camps of millions of Polish Jews.

Until Gaza, the worst civilian punishment campaign by a Western democracy was the bombing and ground invasion of Germany in World War II, which killed approximately two to four percent of the population, outpacing even the U.S. nuclear attacks and fire-bombing raids on Japan, which killed about one percent of the population. Those estimates from Germany account for deaths caused by both Soviet and Western forces, as well as direct and indirect deaths (as in The Lancet's study on Gaza).

Whether it is called a “genocide” or not, no sensible observer could look at Israel's war in Gaza and miss the stunning levels of devastation that Palestinians have endured. Beyond the mass death and suffering, the level of physical devastation is remarkable: satellite analysis by credible independent media outlets, such as The Economist and the Financial Times, reveals that at least 60 percent of all the buildings and 90 percent of homes in Gaza have either been severely damaged or completely destroyed. All 12 of Gaza's universities, 80 percent of its schools and mosques, and numerous churches, museums, and libraries have also been demolished. No hospital in Gaza is fully functioning, and only 20 out of 36 hospitals are partially functioning.

And yet despite this mammoth destructive enterprise, Israel has not come close to fulfilling its stated aim of eliminating Hamas. The group still has significant appeal among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. It may be diminished as a military force, but it can replenish its depleted ranks with new recruits—indeed, by some accounts, it has managed to bring in over 10,000 new fighters since the war began. The extreme brutality Israel has inflicted on the Palestinian people has not produced the strategic gains that Israeli officials promised.

The moral case for harming civilians is always dubious even when such violence serves a strategic purpose. When that strategic purpose does not exist, however, the moral case evaporates altogether. Israel now finds itself in a morally untenable situation. Rather than incur the world's growing wrath, increased economic pressure, and the greater likelihood of future violence, Israel must reverse course and pursue alternatives to its campaign of mass death in Gaza.

Throughout history, states have repeatedly punished civilian populations harshly to try to compel local communities to turn against governments and terrorist groups. But even intense civilian punishment rarely achieves these goals. Instead, it often leads to what I have termed the “Pearl Harbor effect”: growing support among the assailed civilian community for its government or for the local terrorist group.

In June 2024, I argued in Foreign Affairs that at least in one way, Hamas was stronger then than it was before October 7, 2023. To be sure, Israeli attacks had devastated the group's leadership and smashed much of its infrastructure. But according to the most reliable polling information available at that point in time, Palestinian support for Hamas had remained the same or risen in Gaza and the West Bank. Overall, the taproot of Hamas's power—its ability to recruit new fighters to replenish losses—had actually increased. In January 2025, U.S. officials revealed that according to their estimates, Hamas had recruited around 15,000 new fighters since the start of Israel's military operations in 2023, more than making up for the 11,000 to 13,000 losses that U.S. intelligence estimated the group had suffered.



Much has happened since the start of this year: the end of a two-month cease-fire in March, the escalating Israeli siege and the tightened blockade on food and humanitarian goods entering the territory, the humanitarian crisis affecting Gaza's entire population, and Israel's announced intention to conquer at least 75 percent of Gaza—along with the overt consideration by some Israeli leaders that they should expel all Palestinians from the territory. For its part, Hamas seems to be stepping up its guerrilla tactics of ambushes and bombings targeting Israeli soldiers in Gaza, but the group has not been able to meaningfully defend the territory and its population from Israeli attacks.

Media reports in recent months have revealed sporadic demonstrations in Gaza against Hamas, suggesting that some Palestinians are fed up with the group and its actions. But according to recent polling, Hamas remains broadly popular among Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank. The unprecedented scale of Israeli action has not yet exploded the assumptions in my original analysis.

Hamas's relative power cannot simply be measured the same way one would measure the military balance between Israel and its state rivals. In contests between states, the military balance between opponents is of paramount importance. Their militaries usually engage in direct, large-scale battles to take and hold territory, control the skies over territory, or secure access to contested territory. The success of these operations is determined by key indicators, such as the numbers of fighters, stocks of weapons, and levels of economic support. If such factors determined the nature of combat between Hamas and Israel, the war would have been over long ago, since Israel far outpaces the group on all the usual indicators of military strength. That the war has continued for nearly two years and Hamas retains sufficient governing authority in Gaza to hide the remaining Israeli hostages and inflict casualties on the Israeli security forces strongly suggests that the true power of Hamas cannot be found in the traditional metrics of the military balance.

Terrorist groups such as Hamas fight asymmetrically. They rarely seek to seize and hold territory and almost never attempt to win pitched military-to-military battles. Instead, these groups seek to impose losses on their opponents in other ways, mostly through guerrilla operations that pick off enemy military personnel in small numbers and over long stretches of time and through attacks against civilians. Most often, they simply want to maximize harm to vulnerable civilian targets. And since they are always weaker than their state rivals in the usual military indicators, terrorist groups expect to suffer great losses as the conflict persists. As a result, the most telling power of Hamas is its ability to replace the fighters it loses with new ones. Estimates of Hamas's fighting strength bear out this logic. According to the Israeli military, in early 2025, Hamas had as many as 23,000 fighters, a figure roughly the same as an Israeli estimate of the group's size prior to October 7, 2023.

Hamas can recruit new fighters because it still enjoys support. Surveying public opinion is the best way to measure how much support exists among Palestinians for Hamas. The best available surveys conducted among Palestinian populations in Gaza and the West Bank are by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), an independent, nonprofit survey center established in 1993 following the Oslo accords, that collaborates with Israeli scholars and institutions.

My previous June 2024 analysis relied on the PSR surveys from 2023 and 2024. When recent surveys from May 2025 are added to the mix, a striking finding emerges: Hamas has more support among Palestinians today than it did before October 7. Hamas is now, for instance, substantially more popular than its main political rival, the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which dominates the Palestinian Authority. In September 2023, Fatah enjoyed a four-point lead over Hamas (26 to 22 percent). In polling from May 2025, Hamas now enjoys an 11-point lead over Fatah (32 to 21 percent).

The shift toward Hamas is particularly acute in the West Bank, where support for Hamas has more than doubled. There, support for armed attacks on Israeli civilians has risen from 48 percent in June 2023 to 59 percent in May 2025.



In Gaza, support for Hamas has remained flat, despite the enormous suffering brought upon the territory in the wake of Hamas's October 2023 attack. In September 2023, Hamas had a 13-point lead over Fatah in Gaza (38 to 25 percent), and in May 2025, the numbers were almost the same: Hamas held a 12-point edge over Fatah (37 to 25 percent). The one sign that the Israeli campaign may have changed some views in Gaza is the drop in support among Gazans for armed attacks on Israeli civilians, which fell from 67 percent in September 2023 to 37 percent in May 2025.

But the polling suggests that Israel has not succeeded in severing the connection between Gazans and Hamas. Far from dwindling, support for Hamas has grown or remained the same, and the willingness of Palestinians to attack Israeli civilians remains high enough to satisfy Hamas's recruiting needs, despite the most brutal punishment campaign by a Western democracy in history. For Israel's security, the tragic reality is that Hamas likely retains the key asset that could allow it to carry out another major attack down the road: vast numbers of fighters willing to fight and die for the cause.

Hamas's abiding popularity could be a factor in wider violence beyond Gaza. With Israeli forces stepping up raids on Palestinian refugee camps and settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, the region is now a powder keg. The West Bank is home to 2.7 million Palestinians and 670,000 Israeli settlers living in close proximity to one another. Recent Israeli plans to expand settlements in the West Bank and rhetoric from far-right figures calling for the territory's annexation will likely add fuel to this potential fire.

Israel's announced intention to seize control of at least 75 percent of Gaza and then confine Gazans to a small portion of territory won't succeed in divorcing the population from Hamas. As Palestinians are driven into a small corner of the enclave, Hamas will just move with them; this plan is no more likely to defeat Hamas than were the previous population transfers that forced people from area to area inside Gaza. Indeed, such Israeli actions will cause more suffering among civilians—and produce more terrorists. Israel could go further still, expelling Gazans into the Sinai Desert, but such a drastic measure would stoke the possibility of future retributive violence targeting Israelis. And most damaging for long-term Israeli security, throwing Gazans out of the territory would leave Israel open to accusations of engaging in ethnic cleansing, undermining any moral case for supporting the country.

Military operations that, intentionally or not, result in historic levels of civilian deaths are ultimately leading to a more dangerous situation for Israel, making it a less desirable home for Jews and a more likely target for those seeking revenge. Instead, Israel should establish a new security perimeter between Israeli civilian population centers and the Palestinians in Gaza, allowing Gazans enough space to rebuild their lives, letting humanitarian and economic aid to flow into the territory unimpeded, and working with international allies to foster alternative political arrangements to Hamas or Israeli control in Gaza.

Since the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, international support for the country has been based in significant part on the recognition that Jews were the victims of the worst genocide in history. The war in Gaza, however, has seen a swelling tide of condemnation of Israel for committing intentional harm to civilians, mass atrocities, and even genocide. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants that require some 125 countries, including France and the United Kingdom, to detain Israel's prime minister and other members of Israel's cabinet. Even within Israel, prominent voices are calling for a course correction: former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has declared that Israel's actions in Gaza are tantamount to a “war crime,” arguing that “what we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: the indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.” As Israel becomes an international pariah and faces stiffening resistance to its rule in Gaza, the historic scale of its punishment of civilians is only jeopardizing the country's long-term security.

Many Western countries have already begun to make moves to chastise Israel, including by joining much of the rest of the world in formally recognizing a Palestinian state, a step that could lead to large-scale humanitarian intervention in Gaza and economic sanctions on Israel. The United States will likely not follow that path, but U.S. President Donald Trump is mercurial. He has already contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and insisted that the starvation of Gaza must end. Rifts within Trump's base are widening over Israel. U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leading hard-right Republican, declared that Israel is in fact committing genocide in Gaza, borrowing from rhetoric heard more often on the left. A tactical alliance could grow in the United States between elements of the far right and the far left that seek to roll back U.S. support for Israel.

Israel is the most militarily powerful country in the Middle East and has scored numerous victories over its opponents in recent years. But it is also a tiny country surrounded by rivals. And it needs close relations with major Western democracies to ensure the viability of its economy. Those relations could be tested and strained as Israel continues waging the worst campaign of civilian punishment ever performed by a Western democracy, a campaign that has not come close to eliminating Hamas and has given Israel more adversaries and left it more isolated. Israeli leaders must decide whether their ongoing immoral actions in Gaza are really worth the costs to their country's future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Trump demands ‘conflicted' Intel CEO resign","https://www.rt.com/news/622624-trump-intel-ceo-resign/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:52:00 GMT","



US President Donald Trump has demanded that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resigns, following reports of his ties to China. Tan took over the US chipmaker in March as the company struggled to recover from falling sales.

In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump called Tan “conflicted” and said he must step down.

”The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” he wrote, without elaborating.

Trump's demand followed a letter on Wednesday from Republican Senator Tom Cotton to Intel board chair Frank Yeary, who raised concerns about Tan's alleged ties to Beijing. Cotton questioned Tan's integrity and the national security risks posed by his alleged investments in Chinese companies – including some linked to the military – which were reported by Reuters in April.

The senator asked whether the board had required Tan to fully disclose his ties and divest from the companies, given Intel's federal funding under a US defense program. He also flagged Tan's previous role at Cadence Design, a California software firm that recently pleaded guilty to violating US export laws by selling chip designs to China's National University of Defense Technology (NUDT).

”The new CEO of Intel reportedly has deep ties to the Chinese Communists,” Cotton posted on X, linking the letter. “US companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations. The board of Intel owes Congress an explanation.”

Intel and Tan have not responded to media requests for comment. Intel's shares dropped nearly 5% in premarket trading after Trump's post, though they later recovered.

The controversy comes amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. While both nations have long competed in the tech and semiconductor sectors, their rivalry turned into a full-scale trade war after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports earlier this year, accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices. A temporary deal delayed most measures until August 12, but this week Trump threatened additional tariffs over China's energy ties with Russia.

China has slammed Trump's tariff threats as violating international trade rules.

Germany's Labor Ministry has proposed cutting benefits for Ukrainian migrants, citing growing financial strain from the continued influx of newcomers.

Labor Minister Barbel Bas submitted a draft bill to remove Ukrainians from the so-called “citizen's allowance” program – a benefit normally reserved for non-working Germans – and place them under the standard asylum seeker system, German media reported on Wednesday.

Under standard asylum support a person receives €441 ($514), compared to €563 under the citizen's allowance. The new rules would apply only to Ukrainians arriving after April 1, 2025. Those who came earlier would keep their current benefits.

According to the Federal Employment Agency, around 700,000 Ukrainians are currently receiving the allowance. Since April 1, about 21,000 more have arrived who could be affected by the new rules.

The proposal has been sent for approval by other federal departments, and must then pass through the Cabinet and the Bundestag, expected to be adopted by year's end.

Germany spent around €6.3 billion or some 13% of the citizens' allowance budget on Ukrainian migrants in 2024. Officials estimate the reform could save the federal government about €1.3 billion in 2026.

Critics say the plan won't significantly reduce public spending. Head of Bavaria Markus Soder and a number of other officials have called for ending the citizen's allowance for all Ukrainians, regardless of when they arrived.

Of the 1.2 million Ukrainians that Germany has accepted over the past three years, as of May, only 332,000 were employed. Authorities across Germany have increasingly warned that the cost of supporting refugees is putting unsustainable pressure on public finances.

The wider EU is facing similar challenges. As of May 2025, 4.3 million Ukrainians had been granted temporary protection across the bloc, which includes access to housing, education, and work. While the scheme has been extended through March 2027, several EU countries have been reviewing their support programs, citing rising costs and limited resources.

MOSCOW, August 7. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin will host the president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at the Kremlin during his official visit to Russia. The two leaders will hold comprehensive talks.

According to the Kremlin press service, the discussions will focus on strengthening bilateral cooperation and addressing the situation in the Middle East. The Emirati side, in turn, has announced that the talks will explore ways to enhance collaboration in trade, investment, energy and economic sectors.

Ahead of the UAE leader's visit, the Russian government authorized the signing of an agreement on trade in services and investments with the UAE, along with two accompanying documents.

Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Malaysian King Sultan Ibrahim and met with Steven Witkoff, special envoy of US President Donald Trump.

Russia-UAE relations remain strong, with four leader calls in three months, including a June 18 discussion on Middle East tensions and bilateral ties. The UAE has mediated Russia-Ukraine prisoner swaps, and in May, its leader congratulated Putin and Russians on Victory Day's 80th anniversary.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Intel share price drops after US president accuses Lip-Bu Tan of links to Chinese Communist party

Donald Trump has called on Intel's chief executive to resign, alleging Lip-Bu Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock of the US chipmaker falling.

“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”

Shares in Intel dropped more than 3% in early trading. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post.

Trump's comments came a day after he threatened a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips, which could favor Intel as a US-based semiconductor firm.

Trump did exclude Taiwan Semiconductor and Apple, companies that have said they plan to increase their investments in US manufacturing.

Apple chief Tim Cook announced from the White House that the company would invest $100bn in US chip fabrication.

Trump's criticism of Intel, which has lagged chipmakers such as Nvidia in producing graphics-processing chips suitable for AI applications, comes after Arkansas senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to company chairman Frank Yeary expressing concern over Tan's investments and ties to semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the CCP and the People's Liberation Army, the party's military arm.

Cotton, a Republican, asked Intel's board if Tan had divested his interests and questioned if Tan's previous leadership of Cadence Design Systems, a company that last month said it had sold products to China's National University of Defense Technology, a violation of US export controls.

Cotton said Tan controlled dozens of Chinese companies, at least eight of which had ties to the People's Liberation Army.

In a statement, the company said: “Intel and Mr Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the US defense ecosystem. We appreciate Senator Cotton's focus on these shared priorities. We look forward to addressing these matters with the senator.”

Tan, 65, is regarded as an industry veteran in technology and venture capital. He was tapped to lead the once-dominant personal computing and laptop chipmaker in March as part of a turnaround effort. Intel's market valuation is about $89bn, compared with $4.4tn for rival Nvidia.

Tan, 65, has said he wants to sell off Intel assets that are not core to the company's revitalization, cut jobs and to delay or cancel projects to reduce operating expenses. Intel has received about $8bn from the Chips and Science Act for US investments, the Biden-era legislation framed as a national security imperative to reduce US dependence on foreign chip production.

A number of foreign-based chipmakers have recently announced they are boosting US chip production , including Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung.

Beneficiaries of the Chips Act besides Intel include TSMC, Micron Technology, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. But the $1bn grants are dwarfed by more than $400bn in pledged private-sector investments.

The Trump administration wants Congress to scrap the Chips Act, arguing that tariffs are a more effective incentive for companies to build fabrication plants on US soil, pointing to TSMC's decision to expand its chipmaking capacity from three to six plants in Arizona.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Many were baffled when Donald Trump slapped a steep 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland. The Swiss aren't known for flooding the US with cheap goods, but their outsize role in gold refining is distorting trade data.

US President Donald Trump's argument is straightforward: He believes trade partners of the United States benefit from broad access to the US market, while often restricting access to their own, creating persistent trade imbalances.

In the case of Switzerland, Trump balked at the Alpine nation's $48-billion (€41.2-billion) trade deficit, which he said showed Swiss firms were ""taking advantage"" of the US. For that and the country's apparent unwillingness to address the imbalance, he put a much higher tariff on Swiss imports than the European Union's 15%.

At 39%, the tariff rate is the highest among developed countries and may inflict major damage on trade with the US, Switzerland's most important trading partner. Around 18% of Swiss exports crossed the Atlantic last year.

Despite intense talks and a high-stakes visit to Washington by President Karin Keller-Sutter, Switzerland failed to clinch a framework deal like the EU, Japan or United Kingdom. 

Keller-Sutter couldn't even get an appointment with Trump and instead met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who doesn't oversee trade policy, and walked away empty-handed.

The tariff, which took effect on Thursday (August 7, 2025), hits luxury and consumer goods hardest, with watches, skin care and cosmetics products, precision instruments and chocolate expected to face large price rises in the US.

Although gold, along with silver and pharmaceuticals, is currently exempt from Trump's tariff, the Swiss gold refining sector has come into the spotlight because it plays a surprisingly big role in the economy, making the trade imbalance look much larger.

The Trump administration has counted the billions of dollars of gold that passes through Switzerland every year in its tariff calculation.

On the face of it, the Swiss make a fortune from refining gold from Africa, Asia, Australia and South America.

More than 2,000 tons of gold are imported annually, much of it from intermediary banks in London, New York and elsewhere, and later reexported.

Despite being the world's largest gold refining hub, Switzerland's gold sector is tiny, with just five major refiners employing around 1,500 people.

While the value of the precious metal they are processing is huge, Swiss refiners say the profit they make on processing gold into bullion bars, investment-grade coins and precision parts for watchmaking, electronics and jewelry is tiny.

Recent soaring demand for gold globally has also boosted refining in Switzerland, further distorting trade data.

""While gold exports have received attention because they have surged this year, historically, Switzerland has run a trade deficit in gold with the US, so gold is not a key contributor to Switzerland's structural trade surplus with the US,"" Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has argued that gold should be excluded from Washington's tariff calculation since refiners earn just a small fee for processing the metal.

Most of the value comes from the gold itself, not Swiss labor or production, SNB said. 

Although the total value of Switzerland's trade in gold to the US was worth more than $36 billion in the first quarter of this year, the industry is making profits of just a few hundred million dollars per year.

The remaining trade deficit is mostly made up of the exports of pharmaceuticals, watches and precision-engineered goods.

Simon J. Evenett, a professor of geopolitics and strategy at the Lausanne-based IMD Business School, told Bloomberg that ""Gold is special,"" as it ""isn't really manufactured in Switzerland. Processed is a better word.""

Despite a call for gold not to be included in the trade balance data, Washington has yet to show any willingness to change course.

Switzerland's non-gold producers argue they will take the hit from the tariffs, even though they're mostly not to blame for the imbalance.

Business association Economiesuisse has urged the government to continue talks aimed at cutting the tariffs, which are likely to have a severe impact on economic growth.

Hans Gersbach, an economist at the Zurich-based KOF Swiss Economic Institute, estimated that the levies would cut Swiss GDP by 0.3% to 0.6% over the next year, if they remained in place for long.

Swiss products will soon be uncompetitive for US consumers versus similar goods produced in the EU or Britain, which clinched a 10% tariff deal.

The London-based Capital Economics estimated that negotiators will likely bring the 39% tariff rate down, but that Switzerland would have to accept a higher rate than the 27-member EU bloc.

The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, held an emergency meeting on Thursday afternoon following Keller-Sutter's unsuccessful Washington trip.

After the meeting, the council said it is not currently considering tariff countermeasures in response to the 39% tariff.

In a statement, the council said the government would focus on relief measures for export-oriented Swiss businesses and continue talks with Washington to find a solution.

During the most recent talks, a promise to hike investments in the US by $150 billion fell on deaf ears, according to the Reuters news agency.

Keller-Sutter's proposal for a 10% tariff rate was also rejected by US officials, Reuters reported, citing sources in the Trump administration.

To show goodwill against the looming tariff threat, the government in Bern even dropped tariffs on nearly all US imports last year, which gives US producers virtually free access to Swiss markets.

They even floated the idea of importing US liquefied natural gas (LNG), even though Switzerland is a landlocked country, which presents logistical challenges.

Now the voices demanding countermeasures are growing louder. Green Party leader Lisa Mazzone has proposed a 5% export duty on precious metals to counterbalance the effect of Trump's tariffs.

With gold itself spared from Trump's tariff, Switzerland's refining sector can continue operating without disruption.

Ironically, the 39% levy may help the gold demand internationally as more investors seek safe-haven assets during periods of uncertainty.

However, those wider and ongoing trade tensions have raised costs for shipping, insuring, and financing gold transactions, which could move higher still.

Gold is often shipped in small, high-value consignments. Even modest route changes, like during the recent Red Sea attacks, can add thousands in costs per shipment.

These costs won't cripple the gold sector, but will eat into narrow profit margins.

Media conglomerates are pushing to eliminate rules that limit consolidation of local TV stations. 

Media conglomerates are pushing to eliminate rules that limit consolidation of local TV stations.

Critics say Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr is ignoring legal precedent as the FCC moves to eliminate rules that effectively limit the number of local TV stations that corporate media conglomerates can own and operate. The FCC controls local TV and radio licenses, and while the telecom regulator is independent and overseen by Congress, advocates say Carr, who was appointed by Donald Trump, is turning the commission into a political weapon for the president.

Recent moves by the FCC to reconsider broadcast ownership limits would unleash a new wave of media consolidation and threaten local TV newsrooms, critics say, which are already facing headwinds due to budget cuts, consolidation, and digital competition, despite their critical role in keeping voters and the general public informed. However, the media watchdog group Free Press says Carr is also working on behalf of the Trump administration to use the FCC's leverage over broadcast licenses and media mergers “to exert total control over the media,” according to comments the group filed with the FCC on August 3.

“With this proceeding Chairman Carr is placing a for-sale sign on the public airwaves and inviting media companies to monopolize the local news markets as long as they agree to display political fealty to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement,” said S. Derek Turner, the senior economic and policy adviser at Free Press, in a statement.

In 2004, Congress capped the proportion of U.S. households that television stations owned by a single company can collectively reach at 39 percent. This ownership cap limits the size and reach of broadcasting giants such as Fox Corporation, Nexstar, and Sinclair, which already own hundreds of local stations across the country. Broadcasters that take advantage of a certain FCC provision can reach up to 78 percent of the nation without running afoul of the ownership cap, according to the Internet & Television Association (NCTA).

Congress exempted the 39 percent cap from the FCC's quadrennial review of telecom regulations. In 2017, the FCC sought public comment on whether to keep, modify, or eliminate the cap under the first Trump administration, but ultimately never made a change. With Carr, a Republican and Trump appointee, now leading the commission, the FCC in June reopened the docket and invited fresh public comments on the ownership cap, taking the first step toward changing the rules administratively.

In comments filed with the FCC on August 4, Free Press called the latest proceedings on the audience cap a “farce.” The group alleges that Carr long ago made up his mind to dismantle what's left of the FCC's broadcast ownership rules, and is wielding the commission's authority to help Trump intimidate media companies and shape coverage of his administration. If the audience cap is lifted, media conglomerates would be free to gobble up more local TV stations — as long as the FCC approves the broadcast licenses. 

“Media consolidation and deal approvals are now explicitly a way for President Trump to further consolidate his dictatorial power, through explicit loyalty tests and pledges to use the public airwaves as a propaganda tool against the American public,” Free Press wrote to the FCC.

Indeed, the FCC recently approved the $8 billion merger of Paramount and the Hollywood media company Skydance after Paramount subsidiary CBSagreed to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, which Trump claimed was edited in a misleading way. Legal experts panned the lawsuit as meritless under the First Amendment, but instead of mounting a defense in the name of press freedom, CBSagreed to pay $16 million to Trump's presidential library and install an ombudsman to address perceived political bias.

Following the settlement, Paramount also canceled “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” which routinely mocks and criticizes Trump. Paramount has denied accusations by Colbert and others who say the company essentially paid a bribe to complete the merger.

Free speech groups say the settlement sets a dangerous precedent that Trump and Carr are moving to replicate. Armed with a controversial interpretation of the FCC's explicitly narrow authority under a decades-old broadcast “news distortion” policy, which covers local TV and radio stations licensed by the FCC but not cable networks, Carr has launched investigations into complaints of “bias” in news coverage at NBC, ABC, and CBS.

Lifting the 39 percent ownership cap and opening up local broadcast TV to further consolidation could create new opportunities for the administration to leverage license approvals and merger deals to squeeze concessions out of major news networks that anger Trump.

“The price broadcast companies have to pay for consolidating further is bending the knee, and the line starts outside of the FCC chairman's office,” Turner said.

Corporate TV station owners have launched a lobbying campaign to remove the ownership cap. In comments to the FCC, the National Association of Broadcasters said removing the rule is an “emergency for TV broadcasting” that must compete with cable television and online streaming services that are not subject to such restrictions, such as YouTube and Netflix. The internet has transformed the video media market, the group wrote, making the ownership cap obsolete.

“It is time — indeed, past time — for the Commission to expeditiously eliminate the national cap to ensure a more level playing field that allows broadcasters to not only survive, but also to thrive,” the group wrote.

However, Free Press argues TV stations remain profitable, and the ownership cap is needed to mitigate market incentives that push media conglomerates to abandon local journalism. In additional comments to the FCC, the organization joined a coalition of 16 press freedom groups, which said there is no evidence that allowing “massive news- and broadcast-media cartels” would inspire investment in local news.

The groups pointed to an analysis of 35 major media companies that identified a pattern of editorial compromise and capitulation as owners of conglomerates seek to curry favor with political leadership, including the highly transactional Trump administration.

The longstanding ownership cap is still needed to support a diversity of voices on local TV broadcasts, the press freedom coalition argues, which remain an important and popular source of news and information — especially in dozens of communities across the U.S. where traditional newspapers have already collapsed. Research suggests that media consolidation can reduce viewpoint diversity when conglomerates replace local journalism with national programming — a major reason why Congress set the 39 percent ownership cap.

Certain industry groups also support the ownership cap as well. The NCTA, which represents broadband and cable companies, filed comments arguing that only Congress has the authority to change the cap, and consumers would be harmed if TV station owners gain additional leverage and raise the cost of sharing programming. The American Television Alliance, a coalition of consumer groups and cable, satellite, and telecom companies, said these higher “retransmission fees” would push more cable subscribers toward streaming services and reduce incentives for conglomerates to invest in local journalism.

A 2019 study found that consolidation of local media ownership is associated with a substantial increase of national news at the expense of local news, as well as a significant rightward shift in the ideological slant of the coverage. This is perhaps most visible at Sinclair, one of the largest owners of local TV stations and a notorious peddler of right-wing, pro-Trump propaganda.

“Handing even more media control to a handful of capitulating conglomerates and billionaires already so dominant in the broadcast space is a wildly dangerous idea under any administration — but especially this one,” Turner said.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            From anchors aweigh to funnels ashore.
    


            As the historic SS United States gets ready to be converted into the world's largest artificial reef off the coast of Florida, a new plan for an accompanying museum is coming into focus — preserving its iconic massive funnels.
    


            The two six-story-high towering funnels will soon be removed from America's flagship, to be used as a “dramatic centerpiece” of the SS United States Museum and Visitor Experience, according to an announcement this week by the SS United States Conservancy Board.
    


            “By incorporating iconic components from the historic ocean liner into an architecturally stunning land-based museum, the SS United States will continue to excite and inspire future generations,” said Susan Gibbs, president of the conservancy.
    


            The SS United States — nearly as large as the Chrysler Building — is an American maritime icon, which launched in 1951 and set the transatlantic speed record the following year.
    


            But after spending nearly three decades sitting dormant in Philadelphia, the ship was sold to Okaloosa County in Florida, to be sunk and turned into an artificial reef.
    


            While fans and supporters of the “Big U” were hoping for a different outcome, the SS United States Conservancy felt this was the best option to prevent her from being scrapped.
    


            And the eventual sinking came with the promise of a museum to commemorate the American legend.
    


            The conservancy announced on Monday that museum design firm Thinc Design has agreed to take on the project.
    


            “In close collaboration with the Conservancy, we look forward to designing dynamic, interactive exhibits that create an unforgettable experience for all visitors,” said Tom Hennes, founder of Thinc Design.
    


            The future museum — whose conceptual renderings prominently feature the massive funnels and a dock extending into the nearby bay — will also hold “artwork, artifacts, vintage photographs, and film footage” from and of the ship, the announcement said.
    


            Currently, the ocean liner is still in Mobile, Alabama, preparing to be sunk. A representative for the conservancy told CNN that Okaloosa County is estimating the final sink could happen by the end of the year or early 2026.
    


            The museum would be located in Destin/Ft. Walton Beach, about 20 miles north of the ship's resting place.
    


            While longtime fans of the ship are still mourning the loss of the SS United States to the bottom of the ocean, some were happy with the new museum design update.
    


            “I like the idea that both funnels would be used,” commented one fan on the conservancy's Facebook page.
    


            “The gutted hull will give back (to) the ocean it once sailed and much of the interior and top of the ship will be preserved for history.”

Seattle Kraken center John Hayden and their mascot, Buoy, had a close encounter with a brown bear during a promotional video shoot in Alaska in June. 

Hayden and Buoy were on a fly-fishing outing in Katmai National Park when the bear approached them. 

While fishing, Hayden and Buoy were accompanied by a guide, who spotted the bear. The guide had the crew wade through the shallow river.

As they were moving away, the bear, which had been moving closer to them, turned and charged through the water for a few paces before coming to a stop and turning away.

""I want to blame it on Buoy,"" Hayden said on the video afterward. ""They were pretty interested in his look.""

Brown bears commonly feast on salmon in the Brooks River in Katmai National Park, gobbling them as they leap upstream over Brooks Falls to spawn. The park, nearly 300 miles (485 km) southwest of Anchorage and inaccessible by road, is home to the annual ""Fat Bear Week"" contest celebrating the bears as they fatten up for the winter.

""Bears are everywhere at Brooks Falls and, like, this is their territory,"" said Kraken Partnership Marketing Director Melissa O'Brochta, who also recorded the encounter from shore. ""They're also super used to seeing humans. So I wasn't scared.""

Hayden and Buoy were in Alaska as part of an annual trip organized by the Bristol Bay Native Corporation in Anchorage, Alaska, with events that promote youth ice hockey. Alaska does not have its own NHL team; the closest teams are in Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, which has the Vancouver Canucks.

President Donald Trump said he instructed the Department of Commerce to “immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS.”

Trump said it will be “based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” adding, “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

The president's request contradicts the U.S. Census Bureau's schedule mandated by the Constitution. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution requires that a census be conducted every 10 years to apportion the number of seats in the House to each state by population. The census is also used to determine federal funding for states for services such as hospitals, healthcare, and schools.

The census has been conducted every 10 years since 1790. It was last conducted in 2020. A mid-decade census would be unprecedented and have a host of legal challenges.

The census counts all people living in the United States regardless of legal status. This includes U.S. citizens, noncitizen legal residents, noncitizen long-term visitors, and undocumented immigrants.

Noncitizens have never been excluded from the census.

The census is expensive to conduct, amounting to $13.7 billion in 2020. Omitting the constitutional concerns, the Commerce Department likely does not have a plan to secure the funding needed to execute the census as per Trump's current request. A list of questions appearing on the census must also be approved by Congress two years beforehand.

The first Trump administration largely oversaw the last census in 2020. Following it, several Republican-led states, including Florida and Texas, gained congressional representation. However, the release of the census results was delayed until early 2021 under then-President Joe Biden due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trump attempted to exclude some immigrants from the 2020 count, but the administration ultimately quit in its efforts after a Supreme Court loss and the COVID-19 pandemic-related delays pushed back the timing of the count.

A census is scheduled to be conducted again in 2030.

Preparing to conduct the census takes multiple years, and preparations for the next one are already underway. By April 1, or Census Day, all households will have received a census survey. Households are told to count all people living in the home on April 1. Collecting census data takes months.

In the 2020 census, all U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and territories reported that they collected data from more than 99% of U.S. households, with a net 0.35% of households being undercounted, according to the Pew Research Center. It is nearly impossible to conduct a perfect count.

Trump's wish comes as Texas Republicans are looking to vote on a new congressional map that would favor the GOP even more than the current map does.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said without evidence last month that the 2020 census was “flawed.” While Florida gained a congressional seat in 2020, DeSantis said the census undercounted Florida and that the state deserves another seat.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Army estimated the restoration of a Confederate statue in Arlington National Cemetery that was removed in 2023 will cost $10 million, an official said Wednesday.

The official told the Associated Press that the statue, called the Reconciliation Monument, will feature panels of information about its history. However, the statue is plagued by past controversy.

The statue is a depiction of a woman, representing the American South, crowned with olive leaves.

Arlington National Cemetery describes the statue, built by Confederate veteran Moses Jacob Ezekiel and erected in 1914, as “a nostalgic, mythologized vision of the Confederacy, including highly sanitized depictions of slavery.”

It features a Latin inscription, “Victrix causa diis placuit sed victa Caton,” translated “The victorious cause was pleasing to the gods, but the lost cause to Cato,” which bolsters the South's secession as a romanticized “lost cause.”

The official told the AP that the statue is expected to be ready for viewing in 2027, as the base needs replacement and the monument requires refurbishment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings. Unlike the Left, we don't believe in erasing American history — we honor it.”

The order comes after Hegseth restored Confederate mentions in military-related infrastructure across the United States.

A congressional-mandated commission ordered the statue to be taken down or renamed along with other Confederate monuments in 2022. Retired Army Brig. Gen. Ty Seidule, vice chairman of the commission, said the commission found Ezekiel's memorial is “problematic from top to bottom.”

Hegseth has found a unique way to keep Confederate names intact. He ordered Fort Bragg, originally named after Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, to be renamed after Army Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran.

During the critical Battle of the Bulge, the WWII Bragg earned a Silver Star and Purple Heart.

In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which slams attempts to rename historical objects.

The former “fact-checker” for the liberal Washington Post has departed with both barrels blazing, one at President Donald Trump and his “followers,” and the other at his ex-employer, where he dished “Pinocchios” for years.

In an exit interview, Glenn Kessler blamed Trump and social media for the rise of “falsehoods” and ripped the president's supporters, potentially half the nation, for lapping up his “alternative” facts.

Asked by the Columbia Journalism Review why he believes “falsehoods are winning,” Kessler said, “I attribute it to the rise of Donald Trump, combined with the rise of social media. Trump has made it acceptable to lie with impunity. He creates his own reality, his own world, composed of alternative facts. And his followers fall right in line, and their news organizations echo all of that.”

Kessler, who took a Washington Post buyout offer after 27 years with the newspaper, cited Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner as the latest example of the president rejecting facts after the agency offered a stunning revision of past job creation numbers.

“That's living in your own alternative reality. Presidents, for decades, have never questioned the numbers produced by the government workers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I mean, there were bad numbers — they said, ‘Okay, we've got to work harder.' And Trump is just going to say, ‘No, the numbers are great. It's just that these people are manipulating them.' That's a very dangerous situation for this country to be in,” he said.

The Washington Post has never been a fan of Trump since he made politics his career. Its promotion of the Russia collusion hoax, cheerleading for two impeachments of the president during his first term, and other anti-Trump campaigns have driven conservative readers away.

Kessler, who plans to write books and has started a Substack column, had one of the more popular columns on the Washington Post site and was eager to find a replacement after deciding to take the lucrative buyout that several other prominent reporters and editors also took.

But he indicated that the paper wasn't interested. He said that there has been a move away from fact-checking by the high-tech moguls who fund it, even naming Meta's Mark Zuckerberg.

He told CJR that after bankrolling fact-checking, Zuckerberg stopped, and he blamed Trump. “But then, in order to curry favor from Trump — who doesn't like fact-checks and doesn't like the idea that social media platforms are actually rooting out false information — Zuckerberg decided to stop the funding for fact-checkers in the United States, and is probably going to roll it back across the world, [though that may be] more difficult because other countries have higher standards for social media platforms,” he said.

He was also critical of the newspaper's libertarian shift under Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, joining other former insiders who took the buyout.

In his Substack, he wrote, “working at the Post feels like being on the Titanic after it struck an iceberg — drifting aimlessly as it sank, with not enough lifeboats for everyone. The Carpathia (i.e., Bezos) appears too far away and too distracted to help. And the captain is shouting commands that the solution is a different ship.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is “ready to pay a big price” and pledged to back India's farmers amid increased U.S. tariffs on his country.

President Donald Trump doubled U.S. tariffs on India to 50% on Wednesday over the country's purchases of Russian oil.

“I know that I might have to pay a big price for this,” Modi said in New Delhi on Thursday. “But I'm ready for the sake of India's farmers, fishermen, and livestock keepers. Today, India is ready.”

Modi did not mention the new tariffs, which his country recently called “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” On Thursday, Trump celebrated the rollout of his tariffs on more than 50 countries.

Trump's order also places pressure on Russia, which provided 1.75 million barrels of oil to India from January to June of this year. Trump could restrict Russia's trade prospects further if India relents and drops its financial support of the Russian oil industry.

“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,” Trump wrote on social media. “They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA.”

Indian officials have indicated that they will continue to buy Russian oil.

However, the tariffs are making Trump less popular with India, a U.S. ally, and its people. Farmers are a large voting bloc in India, and the tariffs will undoubtedly affect them.

“Trump's 50% tariff is economic blackmail — an attempt to bully India into an unfair trade deal. PM Modi better not let his weakness override the interests of the Indian people,” said Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party.

He hasn't ended the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. His economy looks shaky. And then there's Jeffrey Epstein.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In the annals of the American presidency, Donald Trump has almost certainly complained more about journalists than any of his predecessors have, maybe more than all of them combined. So when Trump deemed a query “the nastiest question” he's ever gotten from a member of the press, it was notable.

The moment came in May, when CNBC's Megan Cassella asked Trump about “TACO,” an acronym for “Trump always chickens out.” The phrase had gained popularity in the financial sector as a derisive shorthand for the president's penchant for backing down from his tariff threats. During an otherwise routine Oval Office event, Trump sputtered angrily at Cassella, claiming that his shifting tariff timelines were “part of negotiations” and admonishing, “Don't ever say what you said.”

Trump's appetite for confrontation is being tested again this week, with the arrival of two of the most important self-imposed deadlines of his second term, related to the tariffs and the conflict in Ukraine. Both present fraught decisions for Trump, and they come at a time when he faces a confluence of crises. A president who, less than a year ago, staged a historic political comeback and moved to quickly conquer Washington and the world now confronts more obstacles than at any point since his inauguration. Some of his central campaign promises—that he would end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and boost the economy—are in peril. And for the first time in his 200 days back in office, the White House has begun to worry about members of the president's own party defying him.

Tomorrow, the clock runs out on the two-week window that Trump gave Russia to reach a cease-fire with Ukraine. The president has been upset by his inability to end the war. Without an agreement, he has said, he will impose sanctions on Russia. But doing so would represent the first time in his decade in politics that he has truly punished President Vladimir Putin. Trump likewise has grown exasperated with Israel's prosecution of the war in the Gaza Strip, a conflict that could soon escalate; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu said today that his military plans to fully occupy the famine-plagued Strip.

Tom Nichols: Putin's still in charge

The other deadline is Trump's latest vow on tariffs, which go into effect today for 60 nations, with rates ranging from 10 to 41 percent. This time, Trump appeared to relish declaring that there would not be another TACO moment, writing on social media last night, “IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!” Since the panic triggered by Trump's “Liberation Day” tariff announcement in April, Wall Street has learned to shrug off Trump's scattershot statements. But the economy has shown new signs of weakness, with stubbornly high prices potentially set to rise again because of the tariffs and, most potently, a recent jobs report poor enough that Trump lashed out against the bureaucrat who compiled it; last week, he fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, claiming, without evidence, that the jobs numbers were bogus. That unprecedented act of petulance risks undermining Wall Street's confidence in the economy and undercutting Trump's campaign pledge to give the United States another economic “golden age.”

Those geopolitical and economic headwinds have been joined by forceful political ones. Since going out on August recess, Republican lawmakers have been heckled at town halls while trying to defend the president's signature legislative accomplishment, the One Big Beautiful Bill. And some of those same Republicans, in a rare act of rebellion, have questioned Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein matter, a scandal that the president, try as he may, simply has been unable to shake.

The mood in the White House has darkened in the past month, as the president's challenges have grown deeper. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has become intensely frustrating for Trump, two White House officials and a close outside adviser told me. The president had truly believed that his relationship with Putin would bring about a quick end to the conflict. But instead, Putin has taken advantage of Trump's deference to him and has openly defied the president—“embarrassed him,” one of the officials told me—by ignoring his calls for a cease-fire and ratcheting up his strikes on Ukrainian cities. Trump has sharply criticized his Russian counterpart in recent weeks as he's mulled what to do.

Yesterday, Trump said that his personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, had a productive meeting with Putin in Moscow, leading the U.S. president to return to his original plan to end the war: a summit. A third White House official told me that Trump has informed European leaders that he wants to meet with Putin as soon as next week in a new effort to get a cease-fire. A Kremlin spokesperson accepted the White House offer but said its details needed to be finalized. Trump also told European leaders that he would potentially have a subsequent meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but the Kremlin did not immediately agree to that.

One of the officials told me that Trump is still considering how and whether to directly punish Putin if Moscow doesn't hit tomorrow's deadline. The U.S. does little trade with Russia, so direct levies would be useless, and the West Wing is divided as to the merits of slapping secondary sanctions on nations that do business with Moscow. Trump signed off on sanctioning India this week because, the official told me, he was already annoyed at the lack of progress on a trade deal with Delhi. But he is far more leery of sanctioning China—another major economic partner of Russia's—for fear of upending ongoing trade negotiations with Beijing.

Witkoff's visit to Moscow came just days after he had been in Gaza to urge Netanyahu to ease a blockade and allow more aid and food to reach Palestinians. Although Israel agreed this week to allow some more food in, the humanitarian crisis has not abated. Trump, who badly wants the conflict to end, believes that Netanyahu is prolonging the war and has told advisers that he is wary of Israel's new push to capture Gaza. Even so, officials told me, Trump is unlikely to break with Netanyahu in any meaningful way.

Any president, of course, can be vexed by events outside his nation's borders. Trump's superpower at home has long been to command intense loyalty from fellow Republicans. Yet that power might be hitting its limit. He was able to pressure the GOP to pass his One Big Beautiful Bill last month, but some Republicans, seeing its shaky poll numbers, have already tried to distance themselves from it; Senator Josh Hawley, for instance, has said he wants to roll back some of the Medicaid cuts that the bill, which he voted for, included. And lawmakers who are trying to defend the bill are facing voter anger. Representative Mike Flood was loudly heckled by a hostile crowd at a town hall in his Nebraska district on Monday. One of the White House officials told me that the West Wing has told House leadership to advise Republican members against holding too many in-person town halls.

Then there is Epstein. Trump has desperately wished the story away. He feels deeply betrayed by his MAGA supporters who believed him when he intimated during the campaign that something was nefarious about the government's handling of the case, and who now have a hard time believing him when he says their suspicions are actually bogus. The president has snapped at reporters asking about Epstein, told House Speaker Mike Johnson to send Congress home early to avoid a vote on whether to release the Epstein files, and sued his on-again, off-again friend Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion after The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had sent Epstein a lewd birthday card in 2003. Murdoch hasn't backed down. Neither have a number of MAGA luminaries and Republican lawmakers who keep demanding to see the files.

Read: Inside the White House's Epstein strategy

Trump's own efforts to manage the story have only fed it. His account of why he and Epstein had a falling-out two decades ago has shifted multiple times. One of the White House officials and the outside ally told me that advisers have told Trump repeatedly to stop saying he has the right to pardon Epstein's former partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and related offenses, to avoid drawing more attention to his previous friendship with Epstein. Despite hopes that the story would dissipate over the August recess, the White House is preparing for Trump to take more heat from Republicans in the weeks ahead.

Some Trump allies still believe that the president, even as a lame duck, will keep Republicans in line. “Having survived Russiagate, Hillary Clinton, two impeachments, four trials designed to put him in jail, and two assassination attempts,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told me, “it's unlikely the current situation will be much of a problem.”

The White House also pushed back against the idea that Trump is in a perilous moment. “Only the media industrial complex and panicans would mischaracterize this as a challenging time. They simply haven't learned anything after covering President Trump for the last 10 years,” the spokesperson Steven Cheung told me in a statement. “The successes of the first 200 days have been unprecedented and exactly what Americans voted for, which is why this country has never been hotter.”

But others in the party sense signs of trouble. “He's spending the political capital he's accumulated for a decade,” Alex Conant, a GOP strategist who worked in President George W. Bush's White House and on then-Senator Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, told me. “Below the surface of the Republican Party, there's an intense battle brewing over what a post-Trump GOP looks like. And that surfaces on issues like Israel, the debt, and Epstein. How Trump navigates that fight over the remainder of his presidency will be a big test.”

There was a time, years ago, when August could be counted as a slow news month in Washington. That's now a distant memory, in no small part because the current president has an insatiable need to be in the news cycle. In August 2017, while Trump was vacationing at his golf club in New Jersey, I asked one of his senior aides why Trump had declared that he would deliver “fire and fury” on North Korea. The aide told me that Trump was looking to intimidate Pyongyang—but that he was also annoyed that he hadn't been the central storyline on cable news. The bellicose rhetoric worked: Suddenly, Trump had changed the news cycle.

Read: The desperation of Donald Trump's posts

In this particular summer of his discontent, Trump is again trying to regain control of the political narrative. But his efforts have been more haphazard and less effective: a threat to strip Rosie O'Donnell of her citizenship, a revival of the “Russia hoax,” an announcement of a new White House ballroom, even a walk on the West Wing roof. None of those things changed the news cycle; instead, they only reinforced that, at least to some extent, he is at the mercy of events outside his control.

Trump has long believed that he can create his own truth, often by telling the same falsehood over and over again. He seems to be trying that tactic again too, especially with the economy. Trump's response to the disastrous July jobs report was to assert, with no evidence, that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had incorrectly reported the statistics to hurt him politically—and then fire the commissioner. That sent a chill through the markets and the business world, which need reliable statistics to function, and sparked fears that Trump will try to bend other government data to his whims.

When it comes to his own political standing, Trump is also trying to create his own reality, seeming to will away the challenges he faces. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, he insisted that he has “the best poll numbers I've ever had,” claiming that his approval was north of 70 percent. But that number represented his approval among Republicans, the interviewer told him. In fact, his overall approval rating is hovering at just about 40 percent. When corrected, all Trump could do was call the whole thing “fake.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

This isn't the first time the BLS commissioner aroused presidential ire. But at least Nixon faced constraints.  

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

“Is it Goldstein again?” Richard Nixon demanded.

In July of 1971, the president was infuriated that an unnamed official at the Bureau of Labor Statistics had seemed to downplay the administration's progress on reducing unemployment while briefing reporters. His suspicions fell on Harold Goldstein, the longtime civil servant and BLS official in charge of the jobs numbers, who had attracted his ire for other comments earlier in the year. Nixon ordered his political counselor, Charles Colson, to investigate. If it had been Goldstein, he said, “he's got to be fired.”

When three hours elapsed without Colson reporting back, the president called Colson twice within the span of two minutes, insisting that Goldstein had to be guilty. “Give Goldstein, the goddamn kike, a polygraph!” he yelled into the phone.

By the next morning, Nixon's animus toward Goldstein had hardened into the conviction that the inconvenient numbers from the BLS reflected a problem much larger than one civil servant. He asked his chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, to conduct a review. “I want a look at any sensitive areas around where Jews are involved, Bob,” he said. “See, the Jews are all through the government, and we have got to get in those areas. We've got to get a man in charge who is not Jewish to control the Jewish. Do you understand?” Haldeman affirmed that he did. “The government is full of Jews,” Nixon continued. “Second, most Jews are disloyal.”

What had started as a fit of pique over jobs numbers was swiftly metastasizing into an extraordinary abuse of presidential power.

Students and survivors of the Nixon era can be excused for feeling a little déjà vu when they heard the news at the end of last week that President Donald Trump had fired Erika McEntarfer, the BLS commissioner. Trump claimed that the bureau's latest jobs report was “a scam” that was “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” As the first federal director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, I quickly thought of the summer of 1971.

James Surowiecki: What's holding Trump back from firing Powell

For most of its history, the BLS has been as professionally obscure as it has been essential. The bureau's economists produce the respected and strictly nonpartisan numbers that the White House, Congress, investors, and American workers rely on to know how the enormous and complex U.S. economy is doing—and how likely their next wage increase, job opportunity, or pink slip might be. For presidents to be unhappy with the numbers they get from the BLS is commonplace. But it's not normal for them to take their disappointment or rage out on the economists who compile them.

In the summer of 1971, Nixon was in the grip of dark conspiratorial thinking. He had been looking forward to positive press from his daughter Tricia's June White House wedding. Instead, The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers—a classified multivolume compendium of national-security materials pulled together for Lyndon B. Johnson's secretary of defense Robert McNamara to explain why the United States had gotten into the quagmire of Vietnam. When the former Johnson-era national-security analyst Daniel Ellsberg announced that he was the papers' leaker, Nixon became convinced that his administration was under assault from smart, well-connected enemies of his Vietnam strategy. So when the BLS official told reporters that a drop in the unemployment rate from 6.2 to 5.6 percent was “a statistical fluke,” Nixon became convinced that Jews within the government were out to sabotage his administration.

Haldeman, although himself an anti-Semite, worried that Nixon's rage could cause chaos across the government. He decided to try to satisfy the president by focusing only on the BLS. He asked a White House staffer named Frederic Malek to determine how many Jews were in the BLS, and to recommend what to do with them. Knowing that White House documents should not reflect what this investigation was really about, Malek and his assistant used the code word ethnics in their memos as they counted Jews. In February, during Nixon's earlier bout of rage, Malek had determined that Goldstein had not acted in a partisan manner. But now, instead of questioning his partisan loyalties, Nixon fixated instead on his faith.

The president didn't get all that he wanted. Although Labor Secretary James Hodgson refused to subject Goldstein to a polygraph test, Nixon didn't fire Hodgson for his defiance. He also didn't immediately force out the head of the BLS, Geoffrey Moore, who worked for Hodgson. When Malek found that there were 19 “ethnics” among the 52 top officials working at the BLS, Nixon respected the civil-service protections that shielded most of them, including Goldstein, from dismissal. Instead, he had a supervisor placed above Goldstein and removed some of his responsibilities. Peter Henle, another Jewish economist in the bureau, was transferred out.

After winning reelection in 1972, Nixon required resignations from all of his political appointees. Nixon ignored most of them, but he accepted Moore's, and the BLS commissioner left a few months shy of the end of his four-year term in 1973. Moore—who wasn't even Jewish—was the only person to lose his job because of Nixon's anti-Semitic paranoia.

Nixon's motives were worse than Trump's. But in most other respects, the events of the past week provide a vivid illustration of how much more dangerous attempts to abuse presidential authority have become.

Unlike Trump, who lashed out publicly against McEntarfer, Nixon was afraid to own his bad behavior. He did not force out his BLS commissioner in 1971, instead waiting for the chance to accept his resignation two years later. Not wanting his hands to be dirty—as defined by the presidential norms of his era—Nixon constrained himself to abuse power only indirectly. He had no desire to risk public disapproval by firing bureaucrats for specious and explosive reasons.

David Frum: Sorry, Richard Nixon

Moreover, the Haldeman system for running the White House that Nixon first authorized and then tolerated sought to control an impulsive president, not fully empower him. Nixon lacked perfect instruments to carry out his desires; his environment wasn't greased for enabling. Although he was clear that he wanted to fire a large number of government workers because of their religious background, he proved unwilling or unable to follow through.

Trump exhibits no such constraints. The loyal voters who give him his grip on Congress don't seem to care what norms he violates. Neither Trump's Cabinet members nor his White House staff are willing to serve as a check on presidential bad behavior. And so last week, Trump did what not even Nixon had dared, becoming the first president ever to fire his BLS commissioner.

When he is seized by his dark passions, our current president doesn't even have a Haldeman.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The president's protectionism answers a riddle at the heart of American fiscal policy.

President Donald Trump's tariffs are slowing economic growth, raising prices, undermining American manufacturing, marginalizing the US geopolitically, and attracting widespread public opposition.

And future presidents may largely preserve them.

This is because Trump's trade agenda is succeeding at one of its purported goals: The president's tariffs are generating a lot of revenue for the US government.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.

So far this year, Uncle Sam collected more than $152 billion from taxes on foreign imports. So far this year, Uncle Sam collected more than $152 billion from taxes on foreign imports. That figure is set to rise, as Trump implemented sweeping new tariffs on almost all foreign nations on Thursday, including a 50 percent duty on all imports from Brazil, a 40 percent rate on those from Myanmar, and a 25 percent on Indian wares.If all of Trump's current tariffs remain in place, they will yield $2.2 trillion of revenue over the coming decade, according to the Yale Budget Lab.

In other words, Trump has effectively enacted the largest tax hike in modern US history — without Congress ever taking a vote.

Should the Supreme Court uphold these actions, they could transform America's approach to fiscal policy. If sweeping taxes on foreign imports do not require congressional approval — while all other forms of taxation do — the US is liable to lean on the former.

Further, low taxes and growing spending on Medicare and Social Security are poised to swell US deficits over the coming decade. Faced with growing pressure to generate new revenues, future presidents may be reluctant to dig an even deeper hole by repealing Trump's tariffs.

None of this means that Trump's trade agenda is certain to survive. But for a policy that is both politically unpopular and economically unsound, it could prove difficult to dislodge.

There is a fundamental tension at the heart of American fiscal policy: Our government's need for revenue is rising, while Congress's appetite for taxation is declining.

As the US population ages, providing public pensions and health insurance to older Americans has become more expensive. But instead of increasing taxes to account for this fact, Congress has enacted multiple sweeping tax cuts since 2000.

Of course, this was primarily the work of Republicans: Under Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, the GOP slashed taxes, to the disproportionate benefit of the wealthy.

Yet once Republicans lowered the bar for tax rates, Democrats repeatedly refused to raise it back to its previous level. In 2013, President Barack Obama made Bush's income tax cuts permanent for households earning below $400,000 (which effectively preserved 82 percent of the Bush tax cuts). Under President Joe Biden, meanwhile, Democrats left the bulk of Trump's first-term tax cuts in place. (Those rate reductions had been set to expire this year, but Kamala Harris vowed to extend them for Americans earning less than $400,000. So even if Democrats had won last November, much of the Trump tax cuts would have survived.)

As a result of all this, federal spending as a percentage of the economy has risen sharply since 2000, while tax revenues have fallen.

Deficits are therefore poised to swell in the coming decades, as the Government Accountability Office illustrated earlier this year, in a chart that does not even account for the impact of Trump's newly passed tax cut bill:

In the wake of that tax cut, Democrats have once again acquiesced to the newly established, lower rates for non-wealthy taxpayers. For example, although Trump's decision to eliminate taxation on tips has no sound economic rationale, congressional Democrats have largely embraced it.

The United States is an economic superpower, which prints the world's reserve currency. We have therefore been able to run large deficits for decades without incurring much tangible economic cost. But that started to change a bit post-Covid, as large deficits helped fuel higher interest rates for both the US government and borrowing public.

And pressure to increase revenue will likely become even more acute by 2035, when Social Security's trust fund will be exhausted, according to government projections. At that point, funding Social Security benefits at current levels will require an additional $414.5 billion a year.

Maintaining Trump's tariffs wouldn't be sufficient to solve America's fiscal challenges. But repealing them would exacerbate those difficulties. Confronted by increasingly burdensome deficits — and a Congress terrified of authorizing substantial tax increases — the next Democratic president may feel that retaining a substantial share of Trump's tariffs are the best of their bad options.

This scenario is especially plausible if Democrats secure full control of the government. A Democratic trifecta would likely be eager to enact new social spending. And it would be difficult for a president to pursue that aim while unilaterally slashing revenue through tariff relief.

This is not to say that Democrats are likely to preserve all of Trump's tariffs. Those most antithetical to rational diplomacy — such as heavy levies on Canada — seem destined for repeal. Likewise, a Democrat would surely lift Trump's zanier sectoral tariffs, such as his proposed 250 percent duty on pharmaceuticals (assuming that ever takes effect). But his universal, baseline tariff could plausibly survive, if perhaps at a lower rate.

In any case, it is conceivable that future Republican presidents might even build on Trump's tariffs. The conservative movement would prefer to answer rising deficits with spending cuts. But they've perennially struggled to find enough legislatively viable cuts to offset their desired income tax reductions (let alone actually reduce the overall deficit).

If Republicans find themselves politically incapable of slashing Medicare and Social Security, then further raising taxes on foreign imports may be an appealing backup plan. Conservatives have long favored taxing consumption over labor income or capital gains. And tariffs are a consumption tax, albeit an inefficient one that's draped in jingoistic garb.

Finally, special interest lobbying could also reinforce Trump's protectionist regime, under a Republican or Democratic president.

Any individual tariff tends to have concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, which can make them politically resilient. For example, America has long imposed tariffs on foreign sugar, a policy that aids domestic sugar producers at the expense of consumers. But the cost to each individual consumer is tiny, so sweet-toothed Americans lack sufficient incentive to form a movement for cheaper pastries. By contrast, the benefits of the tariffs to America's sugar industry are large, which leads it to lobby aggressively for their preservation. As a result, the path of least resistance for elected officials is to keep the sugar duties in place.

This same dynamic applies to many of Trump's tariffs. US exporters would be better off if all of Trump's tariffs were lifted, as those trade restrictions increase their costs of production while slowing economic growth. But many would likely benefit from preserving trade protection for their specific industry. So interest group politics could fortify Trump's trade protectionist regime.

All this said, it isn't hard to envision a world where Trump's tariffs largely expire with his presidency (if not before).

For one thing, the Supreme Court may well deem much of Trump's trade agenda unlawful. Most of Trump's tariffs are premised on a dubious interpretation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which empowers the president to levy duties in response to “unusual and extraordinary” threats amid national emergencies. In the administration's view, this law authorizes them to impose tariffs on more or less any nation, since America's trade deficit constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States. Suffice to say, that is not an opinion shared by many legal scholars or economists.

One court has already ruled Trump's use of the IEEPA illegal, and the case is now before the federal appeals court.

Were the Supreme Court to strike down Trump's use of the IEEPA, he could attempt to reimplement his tariffs under different presidential authorities. But those other mechanisms come with more bureaucratic red tape, which is why Trump has leaned so heavily on emergency powers.

Further, even if the judiciary leaves Trump's tariff regime intact, economic developments could erode its political standing.

There are signs that the president's trade policies are undermining growth and elevating prices. Last month, inflation ticked up while hiring slowed — and both job losses and price increases were concentrated in trade-sensitive sectors. Given that many of Trump's largest tariffs have yet to take effect, it's reasonable to worry that the costs of his trade agenda will continue to mount.

Already, that agenda is incredibly unpopular. In a recent Fox News survey, Americans disapproved of Trump's tariff policies by a 26-percentage-point margin, while just 36 percent approve of his handling of trade in Gallup's polling. If America tips into a recession during Trump's term, these numbers are liable to get even worse. In that scenario, it is difficult to imagine that the Democratic Party's 2028 nominee would not campaign on a promise to reverse most of Trump's trade agenda.

Ironically, Trump's tariffs might be most vulnerable to repeal in a world where Democrats win the White House in 2028, but not full control of Congress. Under those conditions, a Democratic president would face less pressure to generate new revenue, since they would be incapable of enacting ambitious new social programs. Unable to pass partisan legislation, such a Democrat might see lifting tariffs as one of their few tools for both symbolically rebuking Trump's legacy and materially delivering for voters.

Separately, if this hypothetical future president were concerned with repairing American global prestige and influence, they might view relaxing tariffs on US allies as an imperative.

The future trajectory of American trade policy is therefore unknowable. What seems clear is that Trump's tariffs have a better chance of enduring than they rightfully should.

The president's protectionist agenda is a political and substantive disaster. But it also represents a means of massively increasing revenue without anyone in Congress needing to vote for a tax hike.

In an ideal world, the US government would not embrace an economically and geopolitically destructive approach to funding itself, just so its elected representatives could dodge the responsibilities of governance. In our decidedly suboptimal universe, this scenario can't be ruled out.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","OpenAI's GPT-5 just dropped. Sam Altman says it's so good, GPT-4 feels 'miserable.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/gpt5-free-chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-agi-2025-8","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

After weeks of relentless hype, GPT-5 is finally here.

OpenAI officially released the highly anticipated new model on Thursday. It's the latest version of ChatGPT, the company's flagship chatbot, and the most widely used AI model on the market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a ""major upgrade"" and ""a significant step along the path of AGI"" in a conference call with journalists on Wednesday. He said that after using GPT-5, going back to GPT-4 was ""miserable.""

OpenAI says the model will be available for free for everyone and that users will no longer need to switch between previous models for different tasks. GPT-5 will switch automatically, the company said, depending on the kind of request and its complexity. GPT-5 will be available in standard, mini, and nano versions. Paid users will have higher usage limits.

Altman said GPT-5 was also the company's fastest model yet.

""One of the things I had been pushing the team on was like, 'Hey, we need to make it way, way faster,'"" Altman said. ""And I now have this experience of like, 'Are you sure you thought enough?'""

The team said GPT-5 will have improved capabilities for vibe coding, the latest craze in Silicon Valley.

OpenAI has been teasing this next iteration of ChatGPT for over a year, but has ramped up the chatter in the last few days and weeks. On Sunday, Altman shared a screenshot of GPT-5 on X, asking the model to recommend the ""most thought-provoking"" TV show about AI.

In July, Altman said that ""GPT-5 is smarter than us in almost every way."" Speaking to podcaster Theo Von, Altman said he asked GPT-5 a question he ""didn't quite understand"" and it ""answered it perfectly,"" making him feel ""useless relative to the AI.""

The OpenAI CEO also likened GPT-5's development to the Manhattan Project, the US government's effort to build the atomic bomb during World War II, and said that it made him feel nervous.

""There are moments in the history of science, where you have a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, you know: 'What have we done?'"" Altman said.

OpenAI's last notable model launch was GPT-4.5 in February, which Altman described at the time as ""the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person.""

The release of GPT-5 has faced several delays, with the timeline shifting from mid-2024 to mid-2025, to August.

During that time, the number of ChatGPT users has continued to grow. In April, Altman said ChatGPT had 500 million weekly active users. OpenAI said on Thursday that ChatGPT is now on track to hit 700 million weekly active users ""this week.""

Not only does Airbnb want to be the ""everything app"" — where users can book literally everything, from accommodations to experiences and services — it also wants to do the booking for you.

Brian Chesky, cofounder and CEO of Airbnb, laid out his vision for the travel app's AI-powered future during the company's second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. Airbnb beat revenue expectations for quarter two and announced a $6 billion stock buyback, but said it expected slower growth in Q3. The stock was down more than 6% after-hours.

""Over the next couple of years, I think what you're going to see is Airbnb becoming an AI-first application,"" Chesky said on the call with analysts.

He added that currently ""almost none"" of the top 50 apps in the App Store are AI apps, with the notable exception of OpenAI's ChatGPT. But he predicted that soon every one of them will be AI apps, either AI startups or pre-generative AI apps that successfully transform into ""native AI"" apps. That's the transformation that he says is underway at Airbnb.

Chesky said Airbnb's approach to utilizing AI has differed from some other travel companies in that they have not focused on using AI to offer travel planning and inspiration. Instead, the company has rolled out AI in customer service, with a custom agent built on 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations.

As a result of the AI customer service chatbot, he said Airbnb has reduced the number of hosts and guests who need to contact a human agent by 15%.

Chesky said the AI agent is going to become more personalized throughout the next year and that it will be able to take more actions on behalf of the user.

""It will not only tell you how to cancel your reservation, it will know which reservation you want to cancel. It can cancel it for you and it can be agentic as in it can start to search and help you plan and book your next trip,"" he added.

Airbnb declined to provide additional comment when reached by Business Insider.

In February, Chesky said on Airbnb's quarter four earnings call that he thought it was still too early to use AI for trip planning, but that he believed AI would eventually have a ""profound impact on travel.""

Chesky also said in February that he wants to make Airbnb the Amazon of travel, or a one-stop shop for ""all of your traveling and living needs.""

Airbnb in May announced it was relaunching its Experiences business and launching Services, which allows users to book on-site professionals like photographers or massage therapists.

On the call Wednesday, Chesky said he was ""very bullish"" on Experiences and that the feedback so far has been positive.

Axel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","AT&T just made it official: Workplace loyalty is dead","https://www.businessinsider.com/att-ceo-memo-workplace-loyalty-dead-employees-job-security-2025-8","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 08:07:00 GMT","

It's not every day that a CEO's 2,500-word response to an employee engagement survey goes viral. But that's exactly what happened last weekend, after AT&T CEO John Stankey sent a memo to his managers that my colleagues Dominick Reuter and Katherine Li published for the entire internet to see. Upon first reading it, I laughed at just how blunt Stankey was in his admonishment of his staff who apparently complained in the company's survey. Here goes another executive lashing out at frustrated employees, I thought.

But the more times I read it, the more I saw something deeper: perhaps the clearest attempt yet by a major CEO to rewrite the terms of the workplace in contemporary corporate America. Last year, in an essay about the changing relationship between employers and employees, I argued that decades of layoffs, slashed benefits, and hardline management killed off our longheld norms around workplace loyalty. But I had never heard the head of a large corporation actually admit that. Now, here was Stankey — the CEO of a 140-year-old company that once epitomized corporate loyalty — declaring the death of loyalty himself. ""Some of you may have started your tour with this company expecting an 'employment deal' rooted in loyalty,"" he wrote. ""We have consciously shifted away from some of these elements.""

That ""employment deal"" Stankey references is known by another name in organizational psychology: the psychological contract. As I wrote last year, it's the set of things that employers and employees believe they owe each other and are owed in return. Usually, these beliefs go unsaid — they're more inferred by the totality of a company's culture. What's unusual about Stankey's note is that he goes on at length making the implicit explicit, telling employees what they're right to expect from the company and what they aren't. Stankey says his workers deserve a transparent career path, a functional office, and the proper tools to do their jobs. But he says they're wrong to expect promotions based on tenure, the flexibility to work from home, and something about ""conformance"" that I can't decipher for the life of me. Most of all, he says, don't expect loyalty.

If there's one thing Stankey gets right in this memo, it's his attempt to spell out these expectations. This shift from what he calls a ""familial"" culture that takes care of its employees to a ""market-based"" one has been going on since the 1980s: The days of lifetime job security and pensions are long gone. But CEOs have rarely acknowledged the change, because they've gotten a lot of hard work out of their staff who still believe they'll be taken care of in return. At least Stankey is clear: He won't even pretend to be loyal to his workers. The first step to repairing the broken psychological contract in today's workplace is having an open conversation about what those new expectations exactly are.

The problem, though, is that Stankey's memo isn't so much a conversation as it is a rapid-fire dictation of terms. He offers virtually no room for negotiation, dismissing his dissatisfied employees for ""lamenting disruption"" and telling them ""your professional expectations might be misaligned with the strategic direction of this company."" In other words: Get out. It's ironic that he wrote this in response to an engagement survey, which exists for the sole purpose of delivering workers' unvarnished feedback to executives. Stankey clearly has no interest in listening to it.

Even more, there's remarkably little that Stankey offers employees in return for the ""commitment"" he asks from them. The things that he says employees can expect from the company — like a ""functional facility"" to work in, perhaps a reference to the lack of desks when AT&T brought everyone back into the office earlier this year — are so basic they're laughable. You deserve to have a desk to sit at in this office we forced you back into is hardly a rallying cry. ""He's not giving managers any resources to motivate their employees,"" says Denise Rousseau, a professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University who coined the concept of the psychological contract. ""He isn't creating a new psychological contract — he's just ending the old one.""

The only real upside he offers to employees for the commitment he demands is continued employment. In a memo filled with militaristic, drill sergeant language, he cites a quote from an army general that sounds like a veiled threat of unemployment: ""If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more."" He's trying to scare employees into working hard. More and more CEOs are adopting this strategy of management by fear, emboldened by a white-collar recession that leaves disgruntled workers few places to go. And if a few do leave, great: With AI allowing smaller teams to do more work, companies are trying to cull their headcount anyway.

As I've written in a series of stories this year, this hardline approach backfires in all sorts of ways. Even if the vast majority stay, the people who leave are typically the highest performers. Second, if the white-collar job market eventually recovers, AT&T will risk a mass exodus at that point. And most importantly, there's now decades of rigorous research showing how fear is a terrible way to get the best work from your employees. Faster work? Maybe. But it'll be sloppier, less creative, and ultimately less innovative at a time when companies desperately need their teams to stay ahead in the age of AI. Stankey refers to ""management science"" in his memo, but he'd be smart to study up on what the management science actually shows. (If he did, he would also find that there's virtually no empirical evidence to suggest that a fully in-person workplace performs any better than a hybrid one.)

The risk, Rousseau says, is that other companies see Stankey's heavyhanded attempt at rewriting — or ripping up — the psychological contract and feel emboldened to follow suit. CEOs tend to copy each other, and executives from Meta's Mark Zuckerberg to Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi and Shopify's Tobias Lütke have all hinted in recent years that they're done trying to accommodate their employees. What makes Stankey's memo notable is that it could have come from any one of the CEOs atop our largest corporations today. If this is the direction corporate America's headed, that will make work less enjoyable, motivating, and meaningful for the vast majority of us — which will mean our employers will get less inspired work from us.

That would have alarmed the Stankeys of the past. But maybe they think they don't need our inspired work — not when AI's doing more and more of the coding, writing, coordinating, monitoring, and analysis that happens inside their businesses anyway. The employees who were once their most prized asset, the thinking goes, feel more like deadweight now. Which is probably why CEOs seem so comfortable now treating them with so little dignity and empathy.

That's a mistake. In a world where AI makes workforces smaller, the potential impact of each employee expands. And that ends up raising, not lowering, the stakes for attracting and retaining the very best people. It's a paradox the smartest minds in AI already recognize. ""I truly believe we can go super super far without growing more,"" Kian Katanforoosh, the CEO and founder of the software startup Workera, who also teaches Stanford's deep learning class, recently told me. ""But we need to have the world's absolute experts in what we do.""

Meta is doing that by throwing around $250 million pay packages. Most companies can't afford that. Luckily for the non-Metas, there's still a tried-and-true way to inspire great work: Give staff a compelling reason to make the effort.

AT&T once did that by taking care of its employees for life. Stankey was right to call it ""familial"" — it was a literal family for some, like the writer of this 1996 essay in the New York Times I stumbled upon. Not only was this guy a long-time AT&T employee who had risen from the ranks of a software-testing temp, but he was the son of two AT&T employees, whose sisters and brother-in-law also worked for the company. He was a proud AT&T brat. At every turn his father urged him to stick with the company. ""To him, the company wasn't a job,"" he wrote. ""It was a way of life.""

In today's economy, the enticements will probably need to be different from the cradle-to-grave care these businesses once promised. Fixing our fractured world of work starts with figuring out what those enticements will be, so we can forge the psychological contract of this new era. Corporate America can't demand commitment without offering its workers an equal commitment in return. It just doesn't work. Unlike machines, human workers don't perform just because we're told to.

As companies go about this work, a good place to start would be the very employee surveys that inspired Stankey's memo. Stankey looked at the drop in engagement and saw a bunch of complainers. What he missed was the hope buried beneath their discontent. Some 99,000 workers cared enough to respond — and many of them voiced their frustrations because they believed AT&T could once again be a place they'd be thrilled to give their best work to. Underlying that hope is one message: It's not too late.

In this article

Firefly Aerospace jumped more than 34% in its Nasdaq debut on Thursday after pricing shares above its expected range.

The stock closed at $60.35, valuing the company at roughly $8.5 billion. Shares initially opened at $70 under the ticker symbol FLY. 

Space technology has gained momentum in recent years as companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX amass more funding and government contracts. Firefly is the third space company to go public this year after Voyager Technologies and Karman Holdings.

The rocket and lunar lander maker priced shares late Wednesday at $45, above its expected range of $41 to $43, raising $868 million. Earlier this week, Firefly had hiked its range up from the $35 to $39 it initially expected.

Firefly's customers have included a growing list of key defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and L3Harris, and the company recently received a $50 million investment from Northrop Grumman. Last month, Firefly also won a $177 million contract with NASA.

""It's all about execution,"" CEO Jason Kim told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. ""We're focused on rating up our alpha rockets because there's so much demand for the response of dedicated one-ton launches from national security, commercial, as well as hypersonic missile testing.""

Earlier this year, Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon in a mission funded by NASA. Firefly is also widely known for its Alpha rocket and has said in its initial public offering filing that its backlog totaled about $1.1 billion at the end of March.

In its IPO filing, Firefly said revenue in the latest quarter jumped sixfold to $55.9 million from $8.3 million. However, the company reported a net loss of about $60.1 million, up from $52.8 million in the year-ago period.

Beyond just space, the tech IPO market has started to heat up this year after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Figma, Circle and CoreWeave have all debuted in 2025 and seen their stocks pop.

Defense and aerospace private equity firm AE Industrial Partners owns a more than 41% stake in Firefly and controls the company, according to the prospectus. Of Firefly's nine board members, five currently work at the firm. AE has $6.4 billion in assets under management, according to its website.

President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement in the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey.

More troubling for the president, however, could be that the survey shows positive approval of only one of seven key issues, with the public holding negative views on his handling of tariffs, inflation, taxes and federal spending.

There also was a modest rise in the public's preference for the Democrats to control Congress, rising to a 49%-44% advantage from 48%-46% in April. It was the largest lead for Democrats since 2021.

At the same time, favorability of the Democratic Party among registered voters sank to a net -32 percentage points, with 24% positive and 56% negative. The -32 rating appeared to be the lowest rating for either party going back to at least 1996.

The public disapproves of the job Trump is doing as president by a 51%-46% margin, up from 51%-44% in the April survey. The change is within the survey's +/-3.1 percentage point margin of error as is the gap in his approval rating.

The president's economic approval rating remains negative with 45% approving and 53% disapproving, a modest gain from 43%-55% in April. But it's the second time in a row that his economic approval was worse than his overall approval, a reversal from his first term when the president was always stronger on the economy.

""What seemed to be keeping President Trump's overall approval level from really dropping down was the strong economy and the credit that he got from the public,"" said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster. ""He cannot rely on that at this point.""

Overall, the survey of 1,000 people nationwide conducted July 29-Aug. 3 showed a series of conflicting political and economic crosscurrents, with individuals and demographic groups offering sometimes contradictory opinions.

""Trump's approval is stable, but his individual ratings are down on issue after issue, except for tariffs,"" said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which conducted the poll and served as its Republican pollster. ""Economic optimism is higher, but there's been no relief in this data from inflation.""

For example, just 39% of independents approve of the president's handling of the economy, and that drops to 24% on inflation. Even Republicans are 9 points lower on inflation than their economic approval rating.

The president is underwater on inflation by 23 points, with 37% approving and 60% disapproving, unchanged from the last survey. The conflicts could be the result of the public simply having trouble keeping up with the breakneck changes to the economy, immigration, taxation and the political system issuing from the Trump administration.

But Republicans remain solidly behind the president and Democrats solidly against. Half of independents disapprove of the president, with 36% approving.

Roberts added that the survey is ""capturing a country that's in a shifting moment across all of these issues.""

Views on the economy are equally conflicting.

On the current state of the economy, attitudes have improved, with 31% saying it's excellent or good and 68% calling it just fair or poor. Those are the best numbers since the early years of the Biden administration as the nation emerged from the pandemic, and an 11-point improvement from the CNBC survey in April.

The move was driven largely by growing optimism among Republicans, with some improvement among independents. But the outlook for the economy barely budged, with 36% saying it will get better, 17% saying it will stay the same, and 46% expecting it to get worse.

Republicans became a bit less optimistic and independents somewhat less pessimistic.

Views on the stock market also improved with 46% saying it's a good time to invest and 42% saying it's a bad time. The sharp improvement to +4 percentage points from -15 percentage points has come with a surge in stocks that followed the president backing off from sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs and the passage of tax legislation.

Even 36% of those with no investments think it's a good time invest, the highest on record for a group that is typically negative on stocks.

But the survey shows some gathering areas of concern for the president on key issues.

Approval on measures taken to secure the southern border is the only one of seven that is above water with a 53% to 44% positive approval rating. The public is evenly split on deportations 49% to 49%, with sharp divides by party, age, race, gender, geography, income and education.

There are even splits within parties.

For example, 98% of MAGA Republicans, who represent 26% of the party, approve of the deportations, compared with 61% of non-MAGA Republicans. That compares with 97% of liberal Democrats disapproving of Trump's deportations and 78% of moderate Democrats.

There also is unambiguous disapproval of the president's foreign policy (-14 points), federal spending (-19 points), taxes (-13 points) and inflation (-23 points), which is unchanged from April.

In fact, 60% of the public still say their incomes are falling behind the rising cost of living, with women and those with lower incomes saying they are especially hard hit.

Tariffs could be playing a role in the inflation outlook: 49% say tariffs hurt workers compared with only 37% who say they help; 67% say they raise the cost of everyday goods. But by a 47%-37% margin, tariffs are seen helping U.S. companies who produce in the U.S.

Still, almost three-quarters of the public say foreign trade represents an economic opportunity for the U.S., rather than a threat. The public on net disapproves of the president's tariffs by a 51%-45% margin.

After months of policy pivots, delays and negotiations from President Donald Trump, dozens of key U.S. trading partners were hit Thursday with ""reciprocal"" tariffs on their exports to the country.

""IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"" Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

But even as the duties, which were updated just last week, kick in, much uncertainty remains.

Below is a list of the latest tariffs, with the U.S administration stating that all other countries face a blanket 10% tariff rate:

Various countries — such as Switzerland — are still vying for a deal with the U.S. to lower the levies on their goods. It comes after countries and regions, including the U.K., the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia, managed to strike trade frameworks.

Others, though, are dealing with significant duties on top of Trump's reciprocal rate.

This includes Brazil, which is facing a much higher total rate after Trump declared that Brazilian government policies were a threat to the U.S. India, also, has been hit with increased levies over its Russian oil purchases.

Both countries are now facing 50% tariffs on their goods. India, however, still has some time before the full rate kicks in, with tariffs currently at 25%.

Elsewhere, duties on U.S. neighbours Mexico and Canada were in play long before the reciprocal tariff announcement. They are currently facing levies of 25% and 35% respectively, with Mexico in limbo as Trump paused hiking tariffs on the country to allow for negotiations.

China is another outlier. After trade tensions between the country and the U.S. escalated sharply and drove tariffs into triple-digits, the trading partners now appear to have achieved détente. Both sides agreed to reduced tariffs in May, with the truce due to last until Aug. 12. In the meantime, China is facing 30% tariffs.

In this article

Amazon Web Services has agreed to provide U.S. federal agencies with up to $1 billion in discounts for cloud adoption, modernization and training through 2028, an agency overseeing government procurement announced Thursday.

The agreement is expected to speed up migration to the cloud, as well as adoption of artificial intelligence tools, the General Services Administration said.

""AWS's partnership with GSA demonstrates a shared public-private commitment to enhancing America's AI leadership,"" the agency said in a release.

Amazon's cloud boss, Matt Garman, hailed the agreement as a ""significant milestone in the large-scale digital transformation of government services.""

The discounts aggregated across federal agencies include credits to use AWS' cloud infrastructure, modernization programs and training services, as well as incentives for ""direct partnership.""

The GSA announced a similar deal last month with cloud rival Oracle. The agency also reached an agreement with OpenAI on Wednesday that will give federal agencies access to ChatGPT for $1 through the next year.

Key Points

XRP's value has soared, and Bitcoin's price continues ticking higher. However, only one of these cryptos is likely to have long-term staying power.

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies available to investors to buy, but two that have seen consistent price increases recently are Bitcoin (BTC 1.94%) and XRP (Ripple) (XRP 3.00%), which are up 106% and 495% during the past year, respectively (as of Aug. 6.)

Those gains aren't easily ignored, but if you could buy only one of these two cryptocurrencies, which is the better long-term investment? Here are a few key details about Bitcoin and XPP, as well as some drawbacks, to help you make your decision.

Image source: Getty Images.

Bitcoin has a huge advantage over XRP and nearly all other coins because it was the first cryptocurrency. Being the first doesn't always mean you're the best, but in the case of cryptos, having the first-mover advantage has given Bitcoin a level of credibility that most other coins lack.

And it's not just that it's the oldest coin. The fact that there's also a limited supply of coins has made it attractive to institutional investors as well. There can only be 21 million total Bitcoins in circulation, of which about 20 million already exist, and this scarcity has helped drive the value higher.

This helped spur the federal approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year, letting investors buy an ETF on a stock exchange that tracks the coin's value. And the fact that large financial institutions, like BlackRock, have sponsored Bitcoin ETFs has given credibility to the coin that XRP doesn't have.

Two of the most popular ETFs are iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, and it's estimated that all the Bitcoin ETFs have about $150 billion of assets under management. That's a huge amount, especially considering that the first spot Bitcoin ETF launched in 2024. This speaks to the overwhelming popularity of Bitcoin and its consistent ability to attract new investors.

With gains of 495% during  the past year, it's an understatement to say that the coin, created by Ripple Labs, has become a top cryptocurrency. XRP has some real-world functionality as a bridge currency for settling transactions between foreign currencies. It can also process transactions faster and cheaper than traditional financial technologies.

But adoption of XRP for this use case, while growing, is still limited. That hasn't stopped its value from soaring, though, partly because investors anticipate the introduction of XRP ETFs. Some investors are hoping that the funds will give a similar credibility to XRP that they have for Bitcoin.

XRP's value has also jumped because the Trump administration has taken a more hands-off approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. I think it's important to understand this in the context of XRP's rapid price increase because the coin has gained so much in such a short amount of time -- and with little real-world use -- that it's very likely XRP is overvalued now.

Still, some believe XRP could continue its price surge if spot XRP ETFs are approved this year, pushing the value higher as a result.

All cryptocurrencies have a certain amount of speculation baked into them, but XRP is much more speculative than Bitcoin at this point, which is why I think Bitcoin is the better buy.

Bitcoin has been around for about 15 years, has already survived many upswings and sell-offs, and already has widespread acceptance from large financial companies. That doesn't mean it is a foolproof investment, of course, but it does lend the cryptocurrency a certain amount of credibility.

Although XRP is showing no signs of slowing down, investors will likely see more dramatic value swings than with Bitcoin. And because there are already hundreds of billions of dollars invested in Bitcoin through ETFs, the coin has proved that it has widespread acceptance among investors. That's a good sign for Bitcoin's longevity, and something XRP may take many more years to achieve, if it ever does.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin: James Howells gives up on retrieving hard drive from Newport landfill site","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c620jej4kd4o","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:38:48 GMT","

It has lasted 12 years, involving a High Court and Court of Appeal hearing, and a very public row between a computer engineer and a council - but could the Newport tip Bitcoin saga finally be coming to an end? 

James Howells, from Newport, who claimed his ex-girlfriend mistakenly threw away a hard drive containing 8,000 bitcoins in 2013, has given up on retrieving the wallet, currently worth £695m, but has been hit with a £117,000 legal bill from his fight. 

Instead of buying the site to retrieve it, he has now launched his own cryptocurrency - Ceiniog Coin - to try and regain some of his money.

Earlier this year, Newport council said it plans to close the site in the 2025-26 financial year, prompting Mr Howells to offer to buy it to retrieve the wallet. 

But the authority said he owes them just under £117,000 after his attempts to buy the landfill went to court. 

""We will not be spending any more of our officers' time on this issue until that payment is made,"" the council told BBC News. 

It was a move Mr Howells described as ""financial coercion"", to which the council refused to respond. 

Mr Howells has spent significant time and energy trying to access the site and recover the cryptocurrency, once describing it as his ""9 to 5"". 

But in January, Newport council asked a High Court judge to strike out Mr Howells' legal action to access the landfill or get £495m in compensation.

Judge Keyser KC said there were no ""reasonable grounds"" for bringing the claim and ""no realistic prospect"" of succeeding at a full trial.

This led Mr Howells to represent himself at the Court of Appeal in London, using artificial intelligence to support his case, but this was rejected. 

Earlier this year, the council announced that the landfill site is set to close, after which Mr Howells said he intended to buy it.

""In July, I made a multi-million pound offer to Newport City Council. I followed up with the council's legal team and the leader of the council,"" Mr Howells said. 

He said he did not receive a reply or an acknowledgement from the council regarding his offer. 

A spokesperson for the council said that Mr Howells ""currently owes the council just short of £117,000 in legal costs, costs which we occurred defending his claim for £500m submitted last year"". 

It added that the council has a duty to the taxpayer to recover this money and to ensure that council resources are ""used efficiently, and that officers time is not taken up unnecessarily"".

""As such, the council has responded to Mr Howells' correspondence, reiterating that he is required to pay us these costs, and that we will not be spending any more of our officers' time on this issue until that payment is made,"" it added. 

The council said it had not received any payment from Mr Howells and would not be commenting further. 

Responding to the council's comments, Mr Howells said it was ""effectively holding the landfill sale process in an attempt to force a payment"", something he described as ""financial coercion"".

""If they don't wish to sell the site, they should say so clearly. But this tactic of using unrelated debts to shut down a lawful offer - one that's in the public interest - raises serious questions, not just legally but morally,"" he added.

Speaking to BBC News on Thursday, he said he remained ""open to a proper discussion"" with council leaders until 17:00 BST on Friday, ""after which I no longer care what they do, and will move forward with a tokenisation proposal regardless"". 

The council said it would not be commenting further.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.

Bitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit.

Satoshis are named after bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto - believed to be a pseudonym – who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.

Those investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a ""very small"" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.

Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being ""very quickly enamoured with it"", Mr Bambrough said.

Prices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when ""stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely"".

But Mr Howells is not giving up on utilising on his Bitcoin fortune. 

He now intends to ""tokenise"" the full value of the wallet assets into a new Bitcoin-based smart token called Ceiniog Coin (INI), which he intends to launch later this year. 

Mr Howells will use his Bitcoin wallet value as a ""store-of-value or 'vault'"" providing backing for the new token. 

Josh Riddict, a cryptocurrency expert, said there are many coins in crypto ecosystems that have ""value derived from some kind of asset backing or vault"". 

""Since James' wallet is publicly known and the blockchain is there for all to see, its easy evidence that these 8,000 coins do indeed exist. The need to readily access them to 'prove' their existence simply isn't required.

""Ultimately the market will decide how valuable they deem this new coin offering to be,"" he added. 

Police ask people not to speculate following the death of one-year-old Jayla-Jean Mclaren.

Seven men are charged with violent disorder following an incident in Newport.

Residents told councillors traffic clogged rural lanes around Caynton during previous work on the A41.

Gwent Police were called after a group of men were seen fighting on Friday afternoon.

Police were alerted after a one-year-old child was taken to hospital in a serious condition.

Oops, something went wrong

Cathie Wood is known for making bold bets on disruptive technologies. Her latest move is catching attention in the crypto world. Through Ark Invest's flagship funds, she has been buying up shares of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), an under-the-radar company building an Ethereum (ETHUSD) treasury.

BitMine recently shifted its focus to Ethereum and has already built holdings worth more than $2 billion. The company's goal is to acquire 5% of all ETH in circulation. Ark Invest has been adding millions of BitMine shares across its exchange-traded funds including its flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK), showing its confidence in BMNR.

Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.

For investors watching Cathie Wood's next big play, BitMine could be a unique opportunity in the growing Ethereum treasury market.

Based in Las Vegas, BitMine Immersion Technologies is a tiny crypto firm that has suddenly grabbed headlines. The company started as a Bitcoin (BTCUSD) miner and focuses on the accumulation of crypto for long-term investment using mining and capital raises to build its holdings.

In mid-2025, BitMine announced a major pivot: a $250 million private stock placement at $4.50 per share to finance an “Ethereum treasury strategy.” Management says the proceeds will be used to buy Ethereum and make ETH the company's primary treasury reserve asset.

Following the announcement, BitMine's stock went on a meteoric run. In early July, shares briefly spiked over 3,000%, touching $161 at the peak as investors embraced the company's bold Ethereum treasury pivot. Despite the rapid rise and sharp swings, the stock remains up roughly 385% year to date, underscoring the speculative buzz surrounding BitMine's dramatic strategy shift.

Valuation wise, BMNR's looks expensive at the moment. The price-sales ratio is 40.5x, considerably higher than the sector median of 3x, indicating a very expensive stock compared to its peers.

In a recent move, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has been aggressively buying BitMine stock. Over several trading days in late July and early August, ARK funds accumulated hundreds of thousands of BMNR shares. CoinDesk reports that ARK's Innovation and Next Gen Internet ETFs (ARKW) bought about 477,498 shares on July 30 alone, following 529,366 the day before, and then about 540,712 more shares on July 31, roughly $15 million to $17 million each day.

Bitmines' financial performance has been mixed lately. In its latest quarter, BitMine's revenue was roughly $2.05 million, mostly from mining and equipment sales, up 68% year-over-year. Gross margins are thin and expenses are high, driven by depreciation, compensation, and operational costs. The net loss per share was $0.31 per share.

As of early August, BitMine's treasury held 833,000 ETH, valued above $2.9 billion. The company said this officially made it the largest Ethereum treasury in th world.

BitMine recently received a “Strong Buy” rating from the sole Wall Street analyst tracked by Barchart. The analyst has set a mean price target of $60, suggesting the stock could potentially gain 60% from its current level.

Although ARK's interest has drawn attention to this stock, and Wood's firm is known for both big winners and high-risk plays, it doesn't change the fundamentals. BitMine remains a very small company with limited revenue. Its balance sheet is dominated by crypto holdings, which fluctuate in value with Ethereum and Bitcoin prices, and it continues to report ongoing mining expenses.

Overall, it's a risky bet for me, but those with a higher risk appetite might welcome a chance to bet on this one.

Could Ethereum overtake Microsoft's market cap? Well, it's not as far-fetched as it once seemed.

Bitcoin just passed Amazon (AMZN) in market value. Now, crypto fans are wondering if Ethereum could be next in line to challenge a tech giant like Microsoft (MSFT)?





Ethereum is growing fast. It's already the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Some investors believe it could eventually match or even surpass major tech giants like Microsoft in value. That idea may seem far-fetched, but when you look at how Ethereum works and where it could go, the possibility becomes a lot more real.

Today, Microsoft is worth over $3.4 trillion. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a market cap of around $470 billion. That means it would need to grow more than seven times to reach Microsoft's level. This kind of growth wouldn't happen overnight. But if certain things line up, Ethereum could close the gap.

Unlike Bitcoin, which mostly acts as a store of value, Ethereum is a platform. It supports a wide range of digital applications. These include lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, gaming, NFTs, and tools for digital identity. Every time one of these apps is used, Ethereum's network processes the transaction. In this sense, Ethereum is like the operating system of the blockchain world.

This is similar to what Microsoft achieved with Windows. Microsoft's software became the standard for businesses and homes worldwide. Ethereum is trying to do the same in a new digital economy. It wants to become the base layer for financial apps, digital ownership, and programmable money. If it succeeds, the value created on top of Ethereum could be massive.

For Ethereum to catch Microsoft, a lot more money would need to flow into the ecosystem. A major step in that direction happened in 2025 when the US approved spot Ethereum ETFs. These products allow traditional investors to get exposure to Ethereum through regulated stock exchanges. Since then, billions of dollars have entered the space. But it's still just the beginning.

Institutional investors like pension funds and asset managers currently hold a small share of Ethereum-based assets. If that changes, the demand for ETH could rise sharply. These large investors often wait for clearer regulations and more stable infrastructure before making big moves. Ethereum will need to keep improving in those areas to win them over.

Most Ethereum usage still happens within the crypto world. That needs to change if ETH is going to become truly mainstream. Ethereum must find ways to be useful outside of DeFi and crypto trading. For example, it could play a role in processing cross-border payments, issuing digital bonds, or powering loyalty programs.

Tokenization is another big opportunity. Financial institutions are already experimenting with putting real-world assets like stocks and real estate on the blockchain. If this trend continues and Ethereum becomes the preferred platform for these new markets, it could unlock trillions in value.

Ethereum must also stay ahead of technical challenges. Competing platforms like Solana, Avalanche, and others are fighting for market share by offering faster and cheaper services. Ethereum's recent upgrades have helped, but it must keep innovating to hold its lead.

Government policy is always a bit uncertain. Clear and favorable regulations would give investors more confidence in Ethereum. In 2025, new laws like the Clarity Act helped lay out some basic rules for digital assets. These kinds of steps help reduce uncertainty and open the door for more serious capital to enter the space.

Still, regulators will keep watching Ethereum closely. It hosts thousands of apps, some of which could be seen as financial services. That means compliance will be an ongoing challenge. The more Ethereum can prove it's safe, stable, and legally sound, the better its chances of mass adoption.

To match Microsoft's market cap, Ethereum would need to be widely used in everyday life. It would need to support a range of industries beyond crypto, attract massive institutional investment, and become a trusted foundation for digital finance. It would also need to keep its edge as the leading smart contract platform, which means constantly improving the user experience and developer tools.

The gap today is large, but Ethereum is still young. Microsoft took decades to become the tech powerhouse it is today. Ethereum could be on a similar path, just in a different type of economy.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is sitting at $3,819.32.

In its July 2025 crypto monthly recap report, global investment management firm VanEck suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could emerge as a superior store of value compared to Bitcoin (BTC). The report pointed to ETH's lower inflation rate in recent months relative to BTC, alongside its growing utility within decentralized finance (DeFi).

In recent years, a growing number of companies have diversified their treasuries by allocating capital to digital assets – most notably Bitcoin. However, emerging trends show that corporations are also beginning to accumulate Ethereum, recognizing its potential as both a yield-generating and deflationary asset.

VanEck's report emphasizes that while Bitcoin's finite supply and predictable issuance policies make it a strong candidate for a store of value, Ethereum provides greater financial flexibility. In particular, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, collect network revenue, and participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield.

The report also highlights key differences in the monetary policies of both networks. Ethereum's initial issuance rate at launch was 14.4%, compared to Bitcoin's 9.3%. However, two major policy changes have since dramatically reduced ETH's inflation rate – bringing it below Bitcoin's.

The first was Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), implemented in August 2021, which introduced a mechanism to “burn” a portion of transaction fees. This effectively created deflationary pressure during periods of high network activity, reducing the total supply of ETH.

The second transformative event was “The Merge” in September 2022, when Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This change drastically reduced issuance – from approximately 13,000 ETH/day to around 1,700 ETH/day – by eliminating the need to pay miners.

Following these changes, ETH's inflation rate fell below Bitcoin's for the first time in March 2023. Since then, ETH's supply has grown by only 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin's 3%. The report states:

Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%).

Over the past month, several companies have unveiled Ethereum-focused treasury strategies. For instance, cryptocurrency firm Bit Digital recently crossed 120,000 ETH in total holdings. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed that its ETH holdings had surged past 833,000 tokens, making it the largest known corporate holder of the digital asset. At press time, ETH trades at $3,643, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Bitcoin dominates crypto markets, but altcoins like Dogecoin, Sui, and Pudgy Penguins show rising traction amid fragmented altcoin season.

- Dogecoin ($0.21) benefits from $1.6B daily volume and social media buzz, while Sui ($3.67) gains 25% on protocol upgrades and stable growth.

- Pudgy Penguins ($0.035) expands into physical merchandise and Web3 licensing, sustaining community engagement despite token price declines.

- Altcoin season index remains below 40, but traders favor assets with fundamentals, liquidity, or unique value propositions over pure meme speculation.

Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but signs of a shift toward select altcoins are becoming evident. Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui (SUI), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are among the tokens gaining traction amid a fragmented altcoin season. These assets showcase varying strengths, from liquidity and developer support to brand-driven community engagement [1].

Dogecoin remains a focal point with a price of approximately $0.21 and daily trading volume exceeding $1.6 billion. The coin has maintained its position near summer highs, with modest gains over the past week. Despite no major technical developments in recent months, DOGE continues to benefit from consistent social media activity and speculation around potential ETF mentions. This has helped maintain its presence in short-term trading strategies. Historically, Dogecoin often sees inflows at the start of altcoin season, and this pattern appears to be emerging again as other meme tokens struggle with inconsistent volume [1].

Sui is trading near $3.67 with a 24-hour volume above $1.4 billion and a market cap of roughly $12.9 billion. The protocol has quietly rolled out integrations and upgrades targeting scalability and cross-chain functionality, which have contributed to price stability. Over the past month, SUI has gained more than 25 percent, making it an appealing option for traders looking beyond the volatility of meme tokens. Additionally, the emergence of smaller decentralized applications on the Sui network has driven usage without relying on hype or speculation [1].

Pudgy Penguins, a token tied to an NFT collection, is valued at around $0.035, with daily volume surpassing $650 million and a market cap of approximately $2.2 billion. The project has expanded beyond digital assets into physical merchandise and Web3 licensing, broadening its appeal and increasing token activity. While the token is down from its peak, it remains more active than many other NFT-linked assets. Continued social media interaction and campaign-driven product releases have sustained community interest and visibility [1].

The altcoin season index remains below 40, suggesting that most capital is still concentrated in Bitcoin. However, traders are showing renewed interest in altcoins with strong fundamentals, consistent performance, or unique value propositions. Dogecoin offers reliable liquidity, Sui presents ongoing protocol development, and Pudgy Penguins merges community-driven momentum with commercial expansion. While rotation remains limited, these tokens provide alternative entry points for traders seeking exposure outside the top two cryptocurrencies [1].

Harashize imyaka itatu, Republika ya Demokarasi ya Congo yibuka ubwicanyi yise ubukorwa ku nyungu z'ubutunzi, yahaye izina rya ""Genocost"". Ukwo kwibuka kuba  kw'igenekerezo rya 2 Myandagaro buri mwaka, bakibuka amamiliyoni y'abanye Congo bishwe mu ntambara zasambuye igihugu mu myaka irenga mirongo itatu.

Abaharanira uburenganzira bwa kiremwa muntu na bo nyene ntibasigaye inyuma. Ku bwa Fred Bauma, umukuru w'ikigo kijejwe ubushakashatsi ku vya politique muri Congo, ivy'uburongozi n'ubugizi bwa nabi -Ebuteli, avuga ko GENOCOST yerekana inshingano yo kutibagirwa imyaka 30 y'intambara, n'abahuye n'izo ntambara ""bakirindiriye ubutungane.""

Fonarev ivuga ko iriko irakora uko ishoboye kwose kugira ngo ""Genocost"", hamwe na jenoside yakozwe muri Congo vyemerwe n'amakungu.

Intumbero y'iryo shirahamwe ni ugushinga uburyo bwo gusubiza abo bantu bashikiwe n'ivyago agateka kabo, haba mu kubashigikira mu vy'imibereho no kubaronsa uburyo bw' amafaranga, kubashigikira mu mategeko no kubavuza.

Fonarev yatanguje ku mugaragaro igikorwa co kwegeranya intonde z'abakozweko n'ubwo bugizi bw nabi, buturutse ku ntambara be n'ivyaha bihungabanya amahoro n'umutekano.

Patrick Fata, Umuyobozi Mukuru wa Fonarev, agira ati: ""Turafise abantu barenga 400.000 bamenyekanye gushika ubu, ariko tuvuga ko dufise abantu barenga miliyoni 10 bashikiwe n'ivyago.

Ku bwa Patrick Fata, hariho ingingo zimwe zimwe zitegerezwa kwubahirizwa hakurikijwe ivyanditswe bigenzura ivy'itsembabwoko.

""Twatanguye gutegura ikarata y'inzira biciye mu nama yo guhanahana ivyiyumviro twakoze

Kuri we, si agasesehwarumuri ko ivyo abanye Congo bamaze imyaka mirongo bababariramwo  bifise intumbero imwe gusa: gukoresha nabi ubutunzi kama bwaho n'ibidukikije mu buryo butemewe n'amategeko, uno musi ubwo butunzi bukaba bukoreshwa mu buhinga bwose buteye imbere cane, kuva kuri za telefone ngendanwa canke amabateri y'umuyagankuba.

Kimwe mu vyiyumviro vyatanzwe na Fonarev ni ugutangura kwubaka ivyiyumviro bishigikira ukubaho kw'iyo Genocost no kuyigaragaza, nk'uko umuyobozi mukuru wa Fonarev yabivuze mu kiganiro yagiranye na BBC.

Yagize ati: ""Muri iyo nzira niho hateguwe inama, itahuza abantu bo muri Congo gusa, ariko n'abahinga bo mu nzego zitandukanye, baba abahinga mu vya kahise, abashingwamanza canke abandi, bafata umwanya wo gusuzuma bimwe bikomeye ivyabaye muri RDC, kugira ngo basigure ingene genocide ikora."" Ivyo nivyahera, tuzogira ibiganiro bizotuma ivyo dusaba bikomeza kwumvikana no kurushiriza kwizerwa ku rwego mpuzamakungu kugira ngo ivyo bimaze imyaka mirongo bibera muri RDC vyemezwe ku mugaragaro.""

KakaoBank is preparing to enter South Korea's fast-growing stablecoin sector, according to local reports.

In its first-half earnings call on Tuesday, KakaoBank CFO Kwon Tae-hoon said the firm is “actively considering” roles in both stablecoin issuance and custody, with participation aligned to the country's shifting digital asset policies.

“We plan to engage actively in line with market changes,” Kwon said, adding that KakaoBank's internal task force is working with other Kakao units to consolidate strategy.

Join the crypto policy conversation Sept. 10 in D.C. — Register now for CoinDesk: Policy & Regulation.

The move adds a regulated online bank to the list of Korean fintechs jumping into the stablecoin race after the Bank of Korea (BOK) shelved its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot in June.

The project, as CoinDesk previously reported had reached the testing phase with commercial banks and abruptly halted after President Lee Jae-myung's administration submitted legislation enabling the local issuance of stablecoins.

Kwon emphasized KakaoBank's technical readiness, noting the firm had participated in both phases of the now-cancelled BOK pilot.

“We built and operated wallets and handled exchanges and transfers,” he said, pointing to operational experience most firms in the sector can't yet claim.

He also cited three years of compliance work issuing real-name accounts for crypto exchanges, giving the bank a head start in implementing the kind of KYC and AML frameworks regulators are likely to demand for fiat-pegged tokens.

KakaoBank is part of a weekly stablecoin-focused task force within the Kakao ecosystem, working alongside KakaoPay and the parent group. CEOs Chung Shin-ah (Kakao), Shin Won-keun (KakaoPay), and Yoon Ho-young (KakaoBank) are leading the initiative.

The stablecoin pivot has ignited a wave of speculation and retail activity in Korea's markets. Circle stock, which went public in June, became the most-purchased foreign equity among Korean retail investors.

This move is happening in parallel Hong Kong's stablecoin plans, where local firms are lining up to get an issuance license after interest in the People's Bank of China's CBDC failed to materialize.

A month after halting the second phase of its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot, South Korea's central bank is shifting its focus to stablecoins and other digital asset developments. In the latest development, it has launched a new committee to monitor the market and repurposed its CBDC team to explore the wider digital currency sector.

The team was previously called the “Digital Currency Research Lab” and operated under the Financial Settlement Bureau (FSB), which oversees payment and settlement systems within the Bank of Korea (BOK). It will now be known as the Digital Currency Team, dropping “Research” to indicate that it's now prioritizing practical application over theoretical exploration, reports local outlet Chosun Daily, citing a BOK official.

“Since there is no other department other than the Economic Research Institute that uses the word ‘research' in its name, we wanted to make it clear that this is not a department that only does research,” the official stated.

The team has been overseeing South Korea's CBDC efforts. Most recently, it spearheaded Project Hangang, which ran from April to June this year and focused on deposit tokens on public and private networks. The project involved 100,000 Koreans who would convert their bank deposits into deposit tokens and use them for payments at popular retail outlets.

The seven largest banks participated, and settlement between them was facilitated by a wholesale CBDC. While successful, the pilot was marred by complaints from banks that it was too costly; some banks claimed to have spent up to $5 million on new infrastructure to support the tokens.

South Korea targets stablecoin and digital asset adoption

Separately, the BOK is launching a new Virtual Asset Committee under the FSB to advance stablecoin and digital asset adoption. The committee will bridge the central bank and the National Assembly, facilitating the formulation of new laws for the sector.

Furthermore, the regulator has renamed two other related teams to ensure better division of responsibilities. The first will be called the Digital Currency Technology Team and will be tasked with the research aspects, while the second—the Digital Currency Infrastructure Team—will target implementation. Its first project will be a new platform for managing digital vouchers based on deposit tokens.










The reorganization is South Korea's latest effort to boost the adoption of digital assets and stablecoins as global uptake skyrockets. Lee Jae-Myung, who took over as president two months ago, won the seat on a pro-digital asset platform, and his Democratic Party has been pushing this agenda since.

One of his campaign pledges was to champion won-pegged stablecoins. As with many other jurisdictions, from the European Union to the United Kingdom and Asia, South Korea is concerned about the dominance of United States dollar-pegged alternatives, which control around 99% of the market.

Local banks, which have turned against the proposed digital won in recent months, are investing millions in stablecoin development. A local report in June revealed that eight of the largest lenders, led by Kookmin Bank and Shinhan, have teamed up to launch a stablecoin by mid-next year.

Indonesia hikes ‘crypto' tax rate fivefold

In Indonesia, the government has revised its tax rates for the digital asset sector, with offshore exchanges seeing a fivefold hike under the new framework.

Indonesia's Finance Ministry announced that starting August 1, traders on foreign platforms will face a 1% charge, up from 0.2% previously. Tax rates on domestic exchanges were also doubled to 0.21%.

The changes resulted from a reclassification of digital assets from commodities to financial assets under Law No. 4/2023, which took effect two years ago. In January this year, the government then shifted ‘crypto' industry oversight from the commodities watchdog, Bappebti, to the Financial Services Authority (OJK).

The new tax rates significantly advantage local platforms, whose users will only pay a fraction of the levies on foreign bourses, echoing India's move from two years ago. In 2023, the Indian government cracked down on foreign exchanges, accusing them of skirting regulations and taxation. Many quit the market, with local exchanges the biggest beneficiaries; CoinDCX reportedly saw a 2,000% spike in deposits shortly after their departure.

Indonesia remains the leader in the Central and Southern Asia market. According to Chainalysis, it accounted for $157 billion out of the $750 billion (21%) in digital assets the region received in the year ending June 2024.

Home // We asked, they answered: What's going on in the world of crypto?

 

“Everything, everywhere, all at once.” “Mixed signals.” “Unhinged.” “Irrational exuberance.”

We got a mix of passionate responses when asked founders and thought leaders to describe the current state of cryptocurrency. But the bottom line: Crypto currency is here to stay and is embedding in more parts of the economy, a result of new federal regulations.

In the last ten years, the United States has taken a “wait and see approach” when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption and legislation, said Gregory Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Atlanta-based Rubincon Crypto. But that has quickly changed under the second Trump Administration, as a slew of new legislation has paved the way for crypto to move from an experimental technology to a larger part of the US economy.

“Regardless of partisanship, regardless of what side of the [political] aisle you might be sitting upon, the fact remains that the state of the crypto industry in the United States is radically different under the Trump Administration than what we've seen in the previous Biden, and indeed, the previous Trump Administration,” Johnson told Hypepotamus.

So what are those changes?

The Genius Act, which allows private firms to issue stablecoins, which could now quickly be adopted for back-end financial transactions. Johnson called the act “a profoundly important piece of legislation and ultimately will seep into virtually every corner of American business over the next five years.”

Project Crypto, an initiative with the Securities and Exchange Commission, looks to rethink what securities rules and regulations need to look like in an “on-chain” environment.

Some policy researchers and cryptocurrency leaders say that Trump's landmark federal statute, passed in July, could benefit Bitcoin even if there was no specific mention of cryptocurrency.

Through executive order in August, President Trump allowed alternative assets like private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate into 401(k)s, which could spur more wide-spread adoption of crypto

The Clarity Act, also known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, recently passed the House of Representatives and currently awaits Senate approval. If approved, it would change which cryptocurrency tokens are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and which would be by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Another bill that passed the House and is with the Senate is the The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve Bank from offering products and services (including cryptocurrency tokens) directly to individuals.

 

Industry veterans say we are currently seeing a fundamental shift in cryptocurrency's role within the broader financial ecosystem.

“We're finally reaching some of the acceptance and ability to actually utilize the full power of digital assets and crypto that a lot of us who've been in the space for a while have looked forward to,” said Kell Canty, who leads the Atlanta-based digital asset and cryptocurrency tax software Ledgible.

Jesse Shrader, co-founder and CEO of Nashville-based Amboss Technologies, a company that works with high net worth individuals and Bitcoin Treasury companies looking to adopt Bitcoin as a payment system, agreed. He told Hypepotamus that “this cycle is different from every previous cycle with bountiful adoption from even the most conservative firms in traditional finance.”

But there is still a lot of uncertainty around exactly how cryptocurrency adoption will look like.

 “The current market in crypto is sending mixed signals,” Shrader continued. “While there has been an explosion of Bitcoin Treasury companies as a massive success story, the crypto token explosion of years past has failed to take hold. Similarly, while Bitcoin has had a banner year, recent price action has failed to match the massively positive sentiment for the time-tested cryptocurrency.”

For Atlanta-based entrepreneur Ryan DeMattia, Co-Founder and Head of Derivatives at DMG LTD, cryptocurrency and stablecoin adoption is now a “foregone conclusion.” But he believes there are still challenges ahead.

The current explosion in interest in crypto “leads to disjointed “hype” and the announcement economy we now live in where information moves faster but is still very asymmetric. There are more positive headlines than ever before. Some of the most meaningful ones go completely unnoticed,” he told Hypepotamus. “All that said, these are great problems for any industry to have.”

 

Despite the regulatory momentum, significant hurdles remain before cryptocurrency becomes fully integrated into the financial system. The technology is still classified as property for tax purposes, making it subject to capital gains taxation, while security concerns persist as hacks and thefts continue to plague the crypto space.

Yet adoption is accelerating among traditional financial institutions, with major players like JPMorganChase partnering with Coinbase.

Industry leaders believe the federal policy shifts and major financial institutions adopting the technology are creating unprecedented opportunities across for startups and entrepreneurs.

“The normalization of crypto — in 401(k)s, in pension plans, and in the news cycle — is happening at such a velocity that if you're a small business owner, an entrepreneur, or if you're somebody working in a startup, you have to be fluent at least or at least conversational in some of these topics It could make or break the success of your venture, or could make or break the success of your career,” Johnson added.

Canty at Ledgible sees this moment as pivotal for America's competitive advantage.

 “Just like the United States was the leader in the Internet back in the day, and that has brought all kinds of advances and benefits to America, we're going to do the same way with crypto technology,” he said.

I've been at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Annual Convention in Cleveland since August 6. I came expecting to hear about the state of our industry under Donald Trump's second presidency, especially how to navigate the administration's anti-DEI policies, which many in the Black community see as a direct attack on progress. I thought the talk would be about AI: how to use it, how to control it, and whether it was a threat to our profession.

I definitely did not expect to talk about crypto.

But there I was, walking through the Career Fair, when I saw him. A burly young man in a suit, observing the controlled chaos from a distance. He looked more like a recent graduate than a veteran, and when I approached him, it turned out I was right. His name is Jaden Baxter, he's 24, and this was his first NABJ convention. Unlike me, he wasn't a journalist; he's the Special assistant to the mayor of Cleveland, a changemaker in his community.

When I told him I cover AI and Crypto for Gizmodo, his face lit up.

“Crypto, huh?” he asked, his interest immediate and genuine. Usually, it's the AI part that grabs people's attention.

Baxter's knowledge of crypto was built on the same clichés I hear all the time: that it's a tool for criminals, a mirage, something that will disappear as quickly as it came. He had so many questions. Is it real? Is it true? Is it for people like us? Listening to him, I realized we in the media have failed. We haven't done our job of serving a community that is hungry for answers but is being left out of the conversation.

I started by explaining that the crypto industry is basically a decentralized, tech-driven version of the financial system. Imagine all the services your bank offers, but built on a technology called blockchain and without any middlemen.

In simple terms, a blockchain is like a public digital receipt book. Every transaction is a new entry that is visible to everyone, and once it's written down, it can't be erased or altered. This creates a transparent and secure system that isn't controlled by any single company or government.

“Is that true?” he exclaimed, his eyes wide. It was the first time he'd ever heard it explained that way.

Loans, payments, transfers: it's all possible. I told him that cryptocurrencies, by their nature, don't discriminate. Transactions are handled by smart contracts, which are just lines of code designed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Think of it like a highly advanced vending machine: you put in your money, and the code guarantees you get your product without a human needing to approve the sale. The code doesn't care about your skin color, your credit history, or where you live.

This is a massive departure from traditional banking. He couldn't believe it. I explained that for communities that face enormous barriers to financial services, crypto offers a potential alternative. The 2023 FDIC survey found that 5.6 million U.S. households have no bank account, with Black, Hispanic, and lower-income households being the most affected.

Of course, the risks are huge. The government doesn't insure your funds like it does at a bank. You're on your own. If you lose your money, no one is coming to save you. He told me this was another aspect no one in his circle ever talks about.

“People don't know that,” he said. “We don't use it, we aren't in crypto, bro.”

I mentioned that crypto adoption is highest in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, places where millions are denied access to banks and where people in the diaspora need a cheap way to send money back home.

“Wow!!! Really?” he exclaimed. “I didn't know, bro.”

I told him that crypto should, in theory, be embraced by underprivileged communities because of its transparent and non-discriminatory nature. But he, like so many others, associated it with crime. While it's true that criminals use crypto, the data tells a more nuanced story. According to the analytics firm Chainalysis, illicit transactions made up a tiny fraction of total crypto volume in recent years. I explained that the President of the United States, his family, and many of the world's wealthiest people and corporations, like Tesla, hold Bitcoin in their portfolios.

He was stunned.

He asked about Bitcoin, which for him, was synonymous with the entire industry. When I told him the price was now around $120,000, he was fascinated.

“Wow!!! The people who bought it at that time must be multi-millionaires,” he said, a sense of wonder in his voice. He said if he had been better informed as a young adult, he would have bought some. I explained that the most important question to ask before buying any cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin, Ether, or Solana, is: What is the project behind it? What problem does it solve?

“But do you think it'll last?” he asked.

I told him the U-turn in the United States under the second Trump administration changed everything. After years of regulatory hostility, the administration has embraced crypto, legitimizing the industry within the world's most powerful financial system. There will be bumps ahead, but there's no going back.

Then I asked him if he'd heard of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. He hadn't. I explained how they could revolutionize money transfers, making them nearly instant and incredibly cheap.

“Wow, bro,” he said again. “Is this for real? People like us are always late to the party.”

I tried to tell him it wasn't too late, but he was stuck on a thought. He explained that there's a cliché that Black people in crypto must be engaged in criminal activity. He started to wonder aloud if reducing the entire industry to its worst actors wasn't a deliberate way to exclude people like him from an opportunity to build wealth.

“We are always the last people,” Baxter said, a look of disgust on his face. “We miss all the trains to get rich.”

He was disgusted that his community had missed the boat on an industry that could, in principle, solve some of the very problems of discrimination they face every day. And I was left wondering how many other Jadens are out there: curious, ambitious, and waiting for a conversation that no one seems willing to have with them.

XRP rose 3% in the 24 hours through August 7, advancing from $2.91 to as high as $3.02 before closing at $2.98. The move broke through multiple short-term resistance levels and coincided with high-volume buying activity, particularly on Korean exchanges. Technical momentum aligns with key macro developments: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is set to deliberate on Ripple's appeal withdrawal, while Japan's SBI Holdings has filed for a Bitcoin-XRP ETF.

The SEC is expected to deliberate Ripple's decision to withdraw its appeal at 03:00 UTC on August 7, ahead of a broader ruling expected by mid-month. The hearing could lock in XRP's non-security status under U.S. law—an outcome that removes a longstanding regulatory overhang. Meanwhile, SBI Holdings' ETF application highlights international institutional interest, with treasury diversification efforts gaining momentum from corporates reportedly pledging up to $1 billion in XRP purchases.

 A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that while mutual license recognition is a feature, it does not mean automatic passporting to different emirates. 

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) took a significant step toward harmonizing its approach to crypto regulation. The country's Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) and the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced a strategic partnership to unify the UAE's approach to crypto regulations.

Last September, the regulators expressed their intention to work together toward unifying crypto frameworks in the country. One feature of the partnership is that it will allow Dubai-based licenses to service the entire UAE, according to a Wednesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

A VARA spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the latest development formalizes the agreement between the two regulators and “operationalises that intent” with concrete mechanisms. 

“In essence, the 2024 MOU was a starting point. The current partnership is its formal and functional implementation,” VARA said. 

While the agreement establishes a mechanism for mutual recognition of licenses between SCA and VARA, it will not offer automatic “passporting” of licenses across jurisdictions.

 “Licensing reciprocity is a key feature of the partnership, but not automatic passporting,” the spokesperson said. 

The spokesperson clarified that the agreement establishes a mutual recognition mechanism between the SCA and VARA. 

This means that a VASP licensed by one authority can be recognized by the other. However, they will be subject to coordination protocols and applicable regulatory checks. 

“This includes AML/CFT assessments, operational readiness, and supervisory alignment, ensuring that national security and compliance standards remain robust,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph. 

For VASPs operating and wanting to operate in the UAE, the partnership provides regulatory clarity, reduced duplication and a streamlined route to national coverage. 

The VARA spokesperson said this eliminates the need to navigate “separate, potentially conflicting” approval processes, which “lowers operational risk and improves speed to market.” 

“It also strengthens the UAE's global appeal as a credible, innovation-first jurisdiction with a unified approach to virtual asset oversight,” the spokesperson added. 

The mechanisms include a unified virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration framework, mutual license recognition, real-time data sharing and joint supervision protocols, cross-jurisdictional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) coordination and the formation of a Legislative Review Committee. 

The SCA approved the formation of the committee, which is mandated to work with VARA to evaluate and refine crypto regulations in the country in line with international best practices. This signals commitment from both parties to build a globally competitive regulatory environment. 

Officials from both regulators described the partnership as a major step in positioning the UAE as a leader in crypto governance. 

VARA CEO Matthew White called the partnership “a pivotal moment” in the journey to future-proof the UAE's digital economy. At the same time, SCA CEO Waleed Al Awadhi said transparency and trust are central to attracting investment.

While the recent development is a bilateral agreement between the SCA and VARA, the spokesperson told Cointelegraph that it's part of a broader UAE effort to enhance national-level regulatory coordination. 

VARA said that there's an ongoing dialogue between other regulators, including the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) and local and international stakeholders to promote interoperability, supervisory consistency and cross-border cooperation. 

“Future collaborations remain a strategic priority,” the spokesperson added.

On 7 August 1975, Nature published a paper that has had some of the greatest impacts on science and health care in modern times. The study, by biochemists Georges Köhler and César Milstein, described a method for creating lab-made copies of antibodies — called monoclonal antibodies1. Antibodies produced by the immune system are specific to single, unique antigens — these are the molecules generated by viruses, bacteria and other foreign agents that invade the body and try to overpower its defences. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced in huge quantities and can be designed to recognize any target. They have become the workhorse for research laboratories. In the clinic, they are used to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases2, allergy3 and cancer4.

At least 212 antibody drugs have benefited tens of millions of people so far, write Andrew Chan, Greg Martyn and Paul Carter, researchers at Genentech in San Francisco, California, in an article in Nature Reviews Immunology on the past, present and future of antibody treatments5. The global market for monoclonal antibodies, worth around US$250 billion in 2024, is projected to double in value within five years (see go.nature.com/4muxakf).

Fifty years of monoclonals: the past, present and future of antibody therapeutics

Fifty years of monoclonals: the past, present and future of antibody therapeutics

Köhler and Milstein's paper was the culmination of a worldwide effort to understand antibodies: their origin, structure, mechanism and role in the body's immune system. This all happened without the complex organization and funding of today's scientific consortia: at the time, large funders, notably the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the US National Cancer Institute, had a more hands-off role than they do now. This story shows that it is possible to establish a multibillion-dollar industry purely by letting scientists communicate their research, exchange information and share materials.

By the time Milstein arrived in the early 1960s at the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) — then the world's leading centre for studies of DNA structures — in Cambridge, UK, scientists had made progress in understanding antibodies' basic structure. But they didn't know how this class of proteins could target specific antigens.

Following up on biologist Joshua Lederberg's theory that somatic mutations — changes in DNA not inherited from parents — underlie antibody diversity6, Milstein and fellow biochemist Sydney Brenner proposed a mechanism for restricting these mutations to specific gene regions7. As interest in this idea grew, so did the need to find ways to grow antibody-producing cells in the lab. Several groups succeeded in this step, which in turn allowed Milstein and his collaborators to investigate their theory experimentally in myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells that are crucial to the immune response. It was hard work, not least because somatic mutations occur rarely. “The difficulty was that no one knew which specific antigens the myeloma cells bound to,” explains medical historian Lara Marks, who curated an exhibition on monoclonal antibodies for the MRC on the invention's 40th anniversary.

Milstein and Köhler solved this problem by immunizing mice with a particular antigen and taking healthy B cells from the animals' spleens. This, they predicted, would trigger the production of an antibody specific to that antigen. The antibody-producing B cell was then fused with a mouse myeloma cell, creating a hybrid called a hybridoma. Using this technique, they were able to produce essentially limitless quantities of antibodies with known specificity.

Milstein's lab received many requests for cell lines, which were dispatched to researchers all around the world, at little or no cost. This enabled other groups to replicate and build on the invention, creating the current industry. Some policymakers were concerned that the LMB and MRC were too slow to think about intellectual property. In retrospect, it's an unfair criticism. The modern biotech industry was in its nascent phase and it would be several years before the United States (and United Kingdom) would allow universities to patent scientific knowledge from government-funded research. The many groups involved in the breakthrough were mainly looking to answer a fundamental scientific question and did so according to the research community's practices at the time.

The colossal industry that has grown around monoclonal antibodies continues to expand, and scientists are now looking to answer new questions, such as how to deploy artificial-intelligence technologies to design antibodies with drug-like properties — a task that is more complicated than using such tools to predict protein structures.

The story of monoclonal antibodies illustrates how an industry that changed health care was born through a scientific ‘relay race'. Fifty years later, the scientific landscape has transformed, in many ways for the better. Funders and policymakers, however, should consider whether breakthrough discoveries are aided by time-limited funding and complicated management structures. But stakeholders should not lose sight of perhaps the most important aspect of the work: free exchange of knowledge and materials pays dividends.

Fatemeh Ajallooeian, was thrilled when, in June 2024, she received a Swiss National Science Foundation mobility fellowship to go abroad to continue her palaeoclimate research. Ajallooeian, then a biogeochemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, wrote a proposal with a colleague at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, because, she told Nature, Harvard was the only institution with the state-of-the-art mass spectrometry equipment she needed to trace the microbial lipids that can act as indicators of past temperatures. 

On 22 August that year, Ajallooeian, a postdoctoral researcher, applied to the US State Department for a category J visa, which is meant for exchange scholars with funds to cover their research and salary. Following Donald Trump's re-election as US president in November 2024, she has been on an emotional rollercoaster. First there was the arrest of scholars who protested about the war in Gaza. Then, the attacks on Harvard began. But the truly heart-sinking moment occurred when Iran, her country of birth, appeared on the Trump administration's updated travel ban list in June. 

Over the past few months, Ajallooeian and her partner have e-mailed the US embassy in Bern 18 times, seeking updates on her visa application.

“I have had a lot of panic attacks,” she says. “I don't have family in Iran. My research is not political.” 

An Iranian citizen trying to get a visa to do palaeoclimate research at Harvard University is probably one of the most politically fraught combinations at this moment. On 28 July, Harvard terminated Ajallooeian's application, citing the new travel ban. Her struggle is a microcosm of the uncertainties and mobility challenges that international scholars currently face amid anti-immigration sentiment in many countries.

The visa bans and delays promise not only to upend the careers of international students but also to cause drastic economic impacts to the United States. In addition to the 4 June visa bans targeting 19 countries, visa interviews were paused between 27 May and 18 June 2025 — normally the peak period for issuing visas — for students seeking to enrol in a US institution this autumn.

China, India and Japan were among the countries reporting limited US appointments for their students during that period. If the issuing of visas does not recover significantly in July and August, up to 150,000 fewer international students will arrive in the United States this autumn, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization, based in Washington DC, that is dedicated to international education and exchange. If those numbers materialize, the potential economic impact could reach US$7 billion in lost spending and lead to the loss of more than 60,000 jobs. 

Immigration was already a hot topic in not just the United States, but also Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. All four countries are heavily involved in training early-career researchers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and their policies have already, or could soon, set caps on visa numbers or raise visa fees.

At the same time, some countries are streamlining visa applications to attract coveted skilled workers. Last December, the Australian government introduced the national innovation visa: a permanent visa available to migrants, including global researchers, who have a demonstrated ability to benefit Australia's prosperity. France, Germany and Ireland are increasing their international student recruitment. Later this year, the European Commission is expected to present a visa strategy for the European Union that will include measures to support the arrival of top students and researchers.

Nature's careers team spoke to students, academics and immigration-policy specialists in the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia to take the pulse of student-visa challenges. Several early-career researchers requested anonymity for fear of visa reprisals. 

The burdens on international visa holders in the United States are already considerable. A survey, conducted last year, of more than 700 international postdocs at Harvard Medical School found that many spent more than a month in their home country to renew their visa, at a cost of more than $2,000 in some cases1. Individuals from Asian countries, however, were especially likely to report that visa renewals can take up to six months and cost up to $5,000. As a consequence, nearly 75% of respondents reported anxiety and burnout; 30% reported taking time off work as a result. 

The Trump administration has rolled out a number of controversial initiatives in a bid to curtail visas for international researchers. In April, at least 1,680 students had their international status terminated in a database called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Almost 300 international students filed dozens of lawsuits aimed at challenging their visa terminations. 

That same month, the US State Department announced that it would scrutinize the social-media activity of visitors to the country. In May, US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced that the department would vigorously revoke visas issued to students from China.

But 4 June proved most consequential for Ajallooeian. On that day, the Trump administration not only restricted international students from attending Harvard University, but also issued a travel ban on the citizens of twelve countries, including Iran, Libya, Sudan and Yemen, and strict travel restrictions on another seven countries, including Venezuela, Cuba and Turkmenistan. 

An ongoing lawsuit filed by Harvard University has temporarily halted the ban on the attendance of international students. John Quackenbush, a computational biologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Heallth in Boston, Massachusetts, says that Harvard's biostatistics programme admitted eight PhD students this year, roughly half the typical number, owing to concerns over funding. But only four students accepted; two international and two domestic. And the university is concerned that the two international students might not be able to attend because of current visa policies. 

Quackenbush also oversees a two-year master's in computational biology and quantitative genetics, one of three biostatistics master's programmes that have grown in recent years to admit roughly 80 students annually, many of them from abroad.

But with the uncertainty about how many students will arrive in the autumn, it's challenging to determine which classes to offer. “It's so short-sighted, it's a self-inflicted wound,” Quackenbush says. “If we want to make America great again, shouldn't we accept the best and brightest from overseas?” 

By 11 June, following a trade deal with China, however, President Trump signalled that students from China were now welcome — a sign that politics is playing a more prominent part in student exchange. 

Visa denials for international scholars had already reached a high in 2024 — a trend that is anticipated to increase, according to the Cato Institute, a think tank based in Washington DC. The end result, it predicts, will be fewer visa applications. 

The moves have caused a flurry of concern among overseas scholars. A student in China, who has just accepted an offer to do a master's in biomedical informatics at the University of Washington in Seattle, says she was asked before her visa interview to supply information about her social-media accounts.

“It wasn't a smooth process,” she says. Even though she has been accepted into the two-year master's programme and certified as such by the university, she was only granted a one-year F-1 academic visa. She plans to take up the offer, knowing that she probably won't be able to travel outside of the United States during the course. “I just feel so insecure about my future,” she says.

A fifth-year PhD student from China, who studies cancer immunotherapies at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, had come to the United States as an undergraduate during the first Trump administration. She stayed to take advantage of what she describes as “top-notch US biomedical research training”. Even though the new travel restrictions don't specifically target China, they add undue stress to her life. 

“I haven't visited home in four years,” she says — and she doesn't plan to until she's completed her PhD. “I can't take the risk.” The university's international office has advised students from countries on the travel-ban list, and China, not to leave the country unless absolutely necessary. Not only can she not visit her family, she cannot travel to international conferences to present her work, build her professional network or find job leads. As a result, she feels isolated. 

To feel more empowered, she engages with the university's student union on visa issues. She's helped to draft recommendations for international student protections, including paid visa leave to deal with the paperwork and interviews involved, and the setting up of a hotline for international-student visa issues (the university administration has so far rejected their proposals). Because international students cannot vote in US elections, “the union offers what few civil rights that international students have”, she explains.

Before the second Trump administration, she thought she would apply for a job at a US-based pharmaceutical company. Now, she plans to conduct a global job search because the US outlook is bleak as a result of visa issues and drastic cuts to research funding. “How am I, as an international worker, going to compete with laid-off US citizens?” she asks. “I want to work somewhere where I feel seen, valued and appreciated.” 

Trump's efforts to use international research visas from particular countries as a bargaining chip during trade negotiations are expected to further erode scientific exchange between the United States and China — and to have wide-ranging impacts. “I can think of few other policy levers you could pull to bring global science to a halt,” says Brendan Cantwell, a higher-education researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing. US–China research collaborations, which are particularly important in the physical and natural-science fields, have been more difficult since the COVID-19 pandemic, he adds. 

Cantwell predicts that international scholars will experience mixed messages, with universities seeking to reassure students amid the Trump administration's anti-immigrant rhetoric. At the end of the day, however, one factor is likely to be the biggest concern — money. “Visas will be tougher to get but universities will still try to recruit and support students. But if research funding falls off a cliff, they will not be able to fund students or research projects,” he says. 

In recent years, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have also been grappling with how to balance immigration concerns with the desire to attract top scientific talent.

“The concerns about the numbers of international students in general pre-date the second Trump administration,” says Cantwell. And, he adds, concerns about rising housing costs and demands on public services that accompany influxes of immigrants have been the focus of lengthy political discussions in all three countries. In Canada, for example, the vast majority of international students end up at universities in the three largest cities — Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal — which has contributed to a spike in unaffordable housing. 

Canada and Australia have imposed caps on incoming international students. In January 2024, for example, the Canadian government announced that it wanted to achieve zero net growth in its international student population — amounting to a 35% reduction in study permits that would be approved. Both countries, as well as the United Kingdom, have seen declines in international student applications.

The policy shifts have had a direct impact in Canada, says Larissa Bezo, president and chief executive of the Canadian Bureau of International Education, a non-profit organization of international education professionals based in Ottawa. “It sent the message that we were closing the door to international students — which we really have not,” she says. “We have room for hundreds of thousands of students and world-class STEM institutions keen to host them,” she adds, noting that study permits at universities located outside the big cities are often easier to obtain. 

The student response has been immediate. Canada has seen a 32% drop in international student applications and a 48% decline in new study permits issued since 2023 — much more than its original 35% reduction target, according to ICEF Monitor, a website tracking international education and student recruitment. In the first quarter of 2025, there was a significant decline in applications from India, says Bezo.

Similarly, Australia's effort to slow the flow of foreign students, its total population of which sits at roughly 825,000, seems to have worked. A now-revoked policy known as Ministerial Direction 107, which gave Australia's top universities priority in the processing of student-visa applications and doubled visa fees, effectively capped the number of international students at 270,000 last year — an annual decline of nearly 40%.

Cell Painting images offer valuable insights into a cell's state and enable many biological applications, but publicly available arrayed datasets only include hundreds of genes perturbed. The JUMP Cell Painting Consortium perturbed roughly 75% of the protein-coding genome in human U-2 OS cells, generating a rich resource of single-cell images and extracted features. These profiles capture the phenotypic impacts of perturbing 15,243 human genes, including overexpressing 12,609 genes (using open reading frames) and knocking out 7,975 genes (using CRISPR–Cas9). Here we mitigated technical artifacts by rigorously evaluating data processing options and validated the dataset's robustness and biological relevance. Analysis of phenotypic profiles revealed previously undiscovered gene clusters and functional relationships, including those associated with mitochondrial function, cancer and neural processes. The JUMP Cell Painting genetic dataset is a valuable resource for exploring gene relationships and uncovering previously unknown functions.

OpenAI has begun rolling out GPT-5, the latest iteration of its flagship language model, to all ChatGPT users.

The company's CEO Sam Altman called GPT-5 “a significant step along the path to AGI” during a press briefing on Wednesday. While he stopped short of claiming the model reaches artificial general intelligence, Altman noted the latest release is “clearly a model that is generally intelligent.” He added that GPT-5 still lacks key traits that would make it reach AGI, a notably loose term that is defined in OpenAI's charter as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” For example, the model still lacks the ability to learn continuously after deployment.

OpenAI claims GPT-5 is smarter, faster, more useful, and more accurate, with a lower hallucination rate than previous models. In characteristically lofty terms, Altman likened the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5 to the iPhone's shift from pixelated to a Retina display. “GPT-5 is the first time that it really feels like talking to an expert in any topic, like a PhD level expert,” Altman said.

As part of Thursday's launch, OpenAI announced two new model variants: a lightweight GPT-5-mini and an even faster, cheaper, GPT-5-nano (which is only in the API). According to OpenAI, free users will get access to GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini, while the Plus subscription includes the same models with “significantly higher” usage limits. OpenAI says that the $200 a month Pro tier offers unlimited GPT-5 access, along with GPT-5-pro, a more powerful version of the model, and GPT-5-thinking, which allows the model to process a query for longer than usual. Pro users will still have access to pick through legacy models. Most users will no longer need to choose between models, as the chat interface now automatically routes to the right version depending on the complexity of the query and the user's subscription tier.

According to the developer launch blog, GPT-5 will cost developers using the API $1.25/1M to input tokens and $10/1M to output tokens. “GPT-5 mini is priced at $0.25/1M input tokens and $2/1M output tokens, and GPT-5 nano is priced at $0.05/1M input tokens and $0.40/1M output tokens,” it adds. For comparison, developers often use Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite since it's so cheap—GPT-5 nano is now cheaper.

Starting next week, Pro users will be able to connect their Gmail, Google Contacts, and Google Calendar to ChatGPT, with other tiers gaining access at an unspecified date. “ChatGPT automatically knows when it's most relevant to reference them so you don't need to select them before you chat,” the company said in an email.

Users can also choose a chat color and select from four preset personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—a feature WIRED's newsletter Model Behavior reported was in the works last week. According to OpenAI's blog announcement, it plans to bake these personalities into Advanced Voice Mode.

The company's API will offer users all three models, along with optional controls for toggling between detailed or direct responses. GPT-5 can retain more information than prior models—it has a 256,000-token context window, a bump up from the 200,000-token context window available in the company's previous o3 model. That means it can better understand long conversations, documents, or code without losing track of context.

OpenAI's blog post claims that GPT-5 beats its previous models on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified (scoring 74.9 percent), SWE-Lancer (GPT-5-thinking scored 55 percent), and Aider Polyglot (scored 88 percent), which test the model's ability to fix bugs, complete freelance-style coding tasks, and work across multiple programming languages.

During the press briefing on Wednesday, OpenAI post-training lead Yann Dubois prompted GPT-5 to “create a beautiful, highly interactive web app for my partner, an English speaker, to learn French.” He tasked the AI to include features like daily progress, a variety of activities like flashcards and quizzes, and noted that he wanted the app wrapped up in a “highly engaging theme.” After a minute or so, the AI-generated app popped up. While it was just one on-rails demo, the result was a sleek site that delivered exactly what Dubois asked for.

“It's a great coding collaborator, and also excels at agentic tasks,” Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead, says. “It executes long chains and tool calls effectively [which means it better understands when and how to use functions like web browsers or external APIs], follows detailed instructions, and provides upfront explanations of its actions.""

OpenAI also says in its blog post that GPT-5 is “our best model yet for health-related questions.” In three OpenAI health-related LLM benchmarks—HealthBench, HealthBench Hard, and HealthBench Consensus—the system card (a document that describes the product's technical capabilities and other research findings) states that GPT-5-thinking outperforms previous models “by a substantial margin.” The thinking version of GPT-5 scored 25.5 percent on HealthBench Hard, up from o3's 31.6 percent score. These scores are validated by two or more physicians, according to the system card.

The model also allegedly hallucinates less, according to Pokrass, a common issue for AI where it provides false information. OpenAI's safety research lead Alex Beutel adds that they've ""significantly decreased the rates of deception in GPT-5.”

“We've taken steps to reduce GPT-5-thinking's propensity to deceive, cheat, or hack problems, though our mitigations are not perfect and more research is needed,” the system card says. “In particular, we've trained the model to fail gracefully when posed with tasks that it cannot solve.”

The company's system card says that after testing GPT-5 models without access to web browsing, researchers found its hallucination rate (which they defined as “percentage of factual claims that contain minor or major errors”) 26 percent less common than the GPT-4o model. GPT-5-thinking has a 65 percent reduced hallucination rate compared to o3.

For prompts that could be dual-use (potentially harmful or benign), Beutel says GPT-5 uses “safe completions,” which prompts the model to “give as helpful an answer as possible, but within the constraints of remaining safe.” OpenAI did over 5,000 hours of red teaming, according to Beutel, and testing with external organizations to make sure the system was robust.

OpenAI says it now boasts nearly 700 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, 5 million paying business users, and 4 million developers utilizing the API.

“The vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that,” head of ChatGPT Nick Turley says. “Especially average people who haven't been spending their time thinking about models.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Thieves Target Tennessee National Guard Facilities, Stealing Night Vision Goggles and More","https://www.wired.com/story/mysterious-crime-spree-targeted-national-guard-equipment-stashes/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:21:54 GMT","

A string of previously undisclosed break-ins at Tennessee National Guard armories last fall marks the latest in a growing series of security breaches at military facilities across the United States, raising fresh concerns about the vulnerability of US armories to theft and intrusion.

A confidential memo from the Tennessee Fusion Center reviewed by WIRED details four break-ins at Tennessee National Guard armories over a seven-week span. In one incident, thieves made off with night vision goggles, laser target locators, and thermal weapons sights, among other equipment. At others, intruders breached fences, tripped alarms, and gained access to supply rooms discovered in the aftermath to have been unlocked.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

At least some of the break-ins seem to point to potential insider help. In Covington, Tennessee, for example, evidence suggests intruders may have known in advance the location of a secure key control box. At other sites, attempts were made to bypass alarms and entry points.

The memo, which was intended solely for law enforcement use, does not indicate that any weapons were stolen; however, a government anti-terrorism coordinator is quoted as saying: “These events are concerning not only due to the stolen items being sensitive in nature but also because of the indicators for some insider knowledge being needed for successful breach and theft.”

The document, first obtained by the nonprofit watchdog group Property of the People, was shared exclusively with WIRED.

The break-ins remain under active investigation and have drawn the attention of the Pentagon's Office of the Provost Marshal General—the US Army's leading law enforcement authority. A senior police source informed WIRED on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation. The FBI declined to confirm.

“FBI policy prohibits confirming or denying an investigation unless in rare circumstances when publicity would help the investigation, such as in seeking a missing child or trying to identify a bank robber,” Elizabeth Clement-Webb, an FBI public affairs officer, says. “The matter you're inquiring about does not meet that exception, so it would not be appropriate to comment.”

The Pentagon referred questions to the National Guard. The Guard did not respond to a request for comment.

Initially regarded as isolated incidents, the memo cites years' worth of FBI and Defense Department reporting on what agents call “domestic violent extremists,” or DVEs, discussing plans to raid armories for weapons and gear, leading analysts to suspect organized activity. Domestic intelligence has consistently flagged violent militia members and racially motivated extremists eyeing armories as soft targets.

“Although DVEs previously have stolen some lower-level military gear, the FBI has not identified any instances in which a DVE successfully raided an armory to steal heavy military equipment,” the memo reads. “To circumvent such a raid, FBI and DoD are enhancing liaison with local armories and military facilities to address gaps in reporting about current plots to exploit armory vulnerabilities and increase opportunities to detect and prevent DVE theft of military equipment.”

Between 2020 and 2024, the memo says, at least four FBI subjects discussed raiding military facilities for heavy weapons, including .50-caliber firearms and machine guns. Three had confirmed military backgrounds. One—a former Guard member—identified specific armories that he had served in, while describing how best to exploit their security. It's unclear whether any charges were brought.

Extremist chatter cited by the document echos these ambitions. In early 2024, a militia-linked Telegram user proposed assessing armory vulnerabilities with help from sympathetic firefighters and sought military or law enforcement recruits for inside information. In another case, an active-duty tank commander claimed he could sway an armorer to hand over weapons, while a former Air Force contractor talked about raiding a Guard facility to seize mortars and secure land.

Together, these incidents point to a persistent and ideologically varied interest in exploiting armory weaknesses. The Tennessee break-ins, meanwhile, preceded several other armory breaches around the country, underscoring a broader trend in security threats.

""Especially when coupled with more recent events, the document makes clear that violent neo-Nazis and far-right militia groups continue to pose a serious and ongoing threat—and that state governments are failing in their duty to secure dangerous military hardware,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People.

This year alone, thieves stole three Humvees and other military gear from an Army Reserve center in Tustin, California; raided storage containers at a Colorado National Guard facility; and allegedly attempted to steal body armor and communications gear from a US Army Ranger site in Washington. In the latter case, law enforcement claim the suspects used their status as veterans to gain entry to the base, highlighting ongoing concerns about insider access.

Similarly, a break-in at a Massachusetts Army Reserve center in 2015—during which numerous rifles and pistols were stolen—was carried out by a former service member, later sentenced to 11 years in prison. Their familiarity with the facility's security systems and physical layout reportedly enabled the robbery.

For decades, US military stockpiles have been prime targets for high-stakes theft. In the 1970s, arms traffickers raided facilities in California, escaping with caches of powerful weapons. A 1976 heist at a Massachusetts armory turned up a shoulder-fired missile launcher. And in 1995, a former soldier commandeered a tank in San Diego, leading police of a destructive, city-wide chase.

Despite repeated policy changes and years of heightened scrutiny, the nation's thousands of armories remain vulnerable to both external intruders and those with insider access. Modern security improvements have done little to deter interest in breaching them. In Tennessee alone, the fusion center memo notes that state officials have received at least 25 suspicious activity reports over the past decade, detailing attempted surveillance and theft.

Luke Baumgartner, a former Army officer and extremism researcher at George Washington University, says the Tennessee armory break-ins do appear to bear the hallmarks of an inside job—assuming suspicions about the intruders knowing the locations of secure keys are accurate.

“It's not an uncommon occurrence,” he says, pointing to the recent thefts at Washington's Joint Base Lewis-McChord. In June, the FBI arrested two former service members for their alleged involvement in the thefts and the hammer assault of a soldier on base. The FBI recovered a stockpile of weapons found in the suspects' home, amid an assortment of Nazi iconography and white supremacist literature.

Extremist ties to the military can run in both directions, Baumgartner explains: Some groups actively recruit veterans, contractors, and even active-duty troops to exploit their skills and access. Others will join the military explicitly to gain tactical training, weapons experience, and insider knowledge they can later pass on.

Weapons, meanwhile, aren't the only concern. “There's sensitive equipment in there,” he says. “There's secure radios. There's equipment that contains classified information. You have to have a certain level of clearance to access some of that.”

Such heists could also carry symbolic weight for anti-government extremists, Baumgartner says, by casting the federal government as weaker than it appears. “To the casual observer, what it signals is that even institutions we think of as being shielded from this sort of action are not actually immune.”

A drizzly, cool, grey morning in August feels like the perfect time to recognize that Seattle is not for everyone. Announcing that your tech startup is packing up for the Bay Area might be another way to throw a wet blanket over the Emerald City.

The co-founders of Nectar Social sparked a bit of reaction after GeekWire reported Wednesday that sisters Misbah Uraizee and Farah Uraizee are moving their AI-powered social commerce startup to Palo Alto, Calif., to operate in “Valley speed.”

“The hustle factor is real,” Misbah Uraizee told GeekWire. “Right now in [Silicon] Valley, teams are working six, seven days a week because they understand this is a unique moment in technology history. That intensity — that sense of ‘we have to win this market NOW' — is harder to cultivate in Seattle where the pace, even at startups, tends to mirror the steadier rhythms of the big tech companies.”

On Reddit, Seattle pride mixed with a bit of anti-tech sentiment as commenters on the story essentially said, “good riddance” and took issue with everything from what Nectar is building to how intensely they expect people to work on it.

The comments shed fresh light on the long-simmering animosity toward tech in some Seattle circles. And while others might embrace the city's rise as an industry hub, being dumped for the Bay Area always stings.

Here's a sampling: 

Over on LinkedIn, the story and departure also caught the attention of Aviel Ginzburg, a tech investor who leads the Seattle-based startup hub Foundations.

Ginzburg said the first question he asks young and unnetworked or unleveraged founders is “why haven't you moved to the Bay Area?”

“In many cases, this being one of them, Seattle is just not the better place to build your company,” Ginzburg said about Nectar's move. “There is enough stacked up against you already, you've gotta take every advantage that you can.”

But Ginzburg called the startup pace and culture of Seattle a feature, not a bug, and said the city shouldn't strive to be the Bay Area. But it also shouldn't “suck for the folks where Seattle makes sense,” he added.

The Uraizee sisters are not alone in chasing the AI dream to the nation's tech capital. The New York Times reported this week on the wave of 20-something entrepreneurs who are flocking to San Francisco for fear of being left behind the boom.

Nectar Social launched in 2023 to help brands reach consumers where they're hanging out on social media platforms and talk directly to them in personalized conversations using artificial intelligence. The company raised $10.6 million in a funding round earlier this summer.

Misbah Uraizee said that while Seattle's startup ecosystem has “matured tremendously,” there is still a “cultural gap around early-stage risk appetite.”

As GeekWire Editor Taylor Soper pointed out, the departure of this one startup echoes themes highlighted in our story last week in which GeekWire interviewed more than 20 investors and founders across the community about the state of Seattle's startup scene amid a wave of AI-fueled transformation.

“We have the talent. We have the tech. Now we need to move louder, faster, and bolder,” said Samir Manjure, a veteran entrepreneur and CEO of Seattle startup Vieu.

Perhaps Seattle will be loud enough and fast enough for the next startup that decides to stick around.

AI startup Perplexity is powering a new AI-powered search engine on Truth Social, President Donald Trump's social media platform. 

The search engine, dubbed Truth Search AI, is already available on the web version of Truth Social, with public Beta testing on its iOS and Android apps planned for “the near future.”

Trump Media said in a press release that Perplexity's tech provides “direct, contextually accurate answers with transparent citations” which will help Truth Social “exponentially increase the amount of information available” to users. Nonetheless, the social media platform maintains control over which sources of information the AI search engine draws from.

Truth Social is using the Perplexity Sonar API, which promises to query the web to retrieve current and verified information — even if that information is scraped from websites that block Perplexity's crawlers — and supports structured output so users can define the format in which they'd like to see the search engine's responses. 

Jesse Dwyer, a Perplexity spokesperson, told TechCrunch that the Sonar API will be accurate to whatever sources Truth Social limits it to.

“We have no visibility or control over that,” Dwyer said. “Similar to you using the API inside of your own company or if you were an academic researcher and wanted to use it to search your own data.”

TechCrunch has reached out to Trump Media to learn more about whether Truth Search AI will have access to the entire web, whether it will prioritize certain sources over others, and whether the AI will be directed to respond favorably about the president and current administration and unfavorably toward Democrats. 

To assess which sources the searchbot would cite, Axios asked it a bunch of questions — like “What happened on January 6, 2021?” and “Why was Donald Trump impeached?” In all the responses, FoxNews.com was either the most common or the only listed source of information. Others included FoxBusiness.com, The Washington Times, or Epoch Times, per Axios.

In contrast, Perplexity's public search engine returns a wider variety of sources, including Wikipedia, Reddit, YouTube, NPR, and Politico.

Truth Social plans to refine and expand the search function “based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a former California congressman, in the statement.

Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer, also noted in the statement that Perplexity's AI delivers answers with “transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper.”

In late July, alongside his AI Action Plan, Trump published an executive order targeting “biased AI,” or models that aren't “ideologically neutral.” The order specifically referred to information about race or sex, unconscious bias, systemic racism, and other ideas thrown into the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bucket as “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.”

Truth Search AI comes in the same week that top AI firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google were added to a list of approved vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. OpenAI on Wednesday reached a deal with the U.S. government's central purchasing arm to sell ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 per year.

We're now working on improving the scalability of LISTEN/NOTIFY in PostgreSQL, and
to guide that work, I'd like to better understand how it's used (or was used) in
real-world systems. What works well? What doesn't?The current implementation has some known scalability bottlenecks:1. Thundering Herd Problem:  
   A NOTIFY wakes up all listening backends in the current database, even those
   not listening on the notified channel. This is inefficient when many
   listeners are each listening to their own channels (e.g. in job queues).2. Commit Lock Contention:  
   NOTIFY operations are serialized behind a heavyweight lock at transaction commit.
   This can become a bottleneck when many transactions send notifications in parallel.If you've used LISTEN/NOTIFY in production, I'd love to hear:- What is/was your use case?- Does each client listen on its own channel, or do they share channels?- How many listening backend processes?- How many NOTIFYs in parallel?- Are you sending payloads? If so, how large?- What worked well for you? What didn't?- Did you hit any scalability limits?Feedback much appreciated, thanks!/Joel

The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it's still far short of AGI.

At long last, OpenAI has released GPT-5. The new system abandons the distinction between OpenAI's flagship models and its o series of reasoning models, automatically routing user queries to a fast nonreasoning model or a slower reasoning version. It is now available to everyone through the ChatGPT web interface—though nonpaying users may need to wait a few days to gain full access to the new capabilities. 

It's tempting to compare GPT-5 with its explicit predecessor, GPT-4, but the more illuminating juxtaposition is with o1, OpenAI's first reasoning model, which was released last year. In contrast to GPT-5's broad release, o1 was initially available only to Plus and Team subscribers. Those users got access to a completely new kind of language model—one that would “reason” through its answers by generating additional text before providing a final response, enabling it to solve much more challenging problems than its nonreasoning counterparts.

The term is everywhere this week, but its meaning is as vague as ever. Working on a definition matters.

Whereas o1 was a major technological advancement, GPT-5 is, above all else, a refined product. During a press briefing, Sam Altman compared GPT-5 to Apple's Retina displays, and it's an apt analogy, though perhaps not in the way that he intended. Much like an unprecedentedly crisp screen, GPT-5 will furnish a more pleasant and seamless user experience. That's not nothing, but it falls far short of the transformative AI future that Altman has spent much of the past year hyping. In the briefing, Altman called GPT-5 “a significant step along the path to AGI,” or artificial general intelligence, and maybe he's right—but if so, it's a very small step.

Take the demo of the model's abilities that OpenAI showed to MIT Technology Review in advance of its release. Yann Dubois, a post-training lead at OpenAI, asked GPT-5 to design a web application that would help his partner learn French so that she could communicate more easily with his family. The model did an admirable job of following his instructions and created an appealing, user-friendly app. But when I gave GPT-4o an almost identical prompt, it produced an app with exactly the same functionality. The only difference is that it wasn't as aesthetically pleasing.

Some of the other user-experience improvements are more substantial. Having the model rather than the user choose whether to apply reasoning to each query removes a major pain point, especially for users who don't follow LLM advancements closely. 

And, according to Altman, GPT-5 reasons much faster than the o-series models. The fact that OpenAI is releasing it to nonpaying users suggests that it's also less expensive for the company to run. That's a big deal: Running powerful models cheaply and quickly is a tough problem, and solving it is key to reducing AI's environmental impact. 

OpenAI has also taken steps to mitigate hallucinations, which have been a persistent headache. OpenAI's evaluations suggest that GPT-5 models are substantially less likely to make incorrect claims than their predecessor models, o3 and GPT-4o. If that advancement holds up to scrutiny, it could help pave the way for more reliable and trustworthy agents. “Hallucination can cause real safety and security issues,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. For example, an agent that hallucinates software packages could download malicious code to a user's device.

GPT-5 has achieved the state of the art on several benchmarks, including a test of agentic abilities and the coding evaluations SWE-Bench and Aider Polyglot. But according to Clémentine Fourrier, an AI researcher at the company HuggingFace, those evaluations are nearing saturation, which means that current models have achieved close to maximal performance. 

“It's basically like looking at the performance of a high schooler on middle-grade problems,” she says. “If the high schooler fails, it tells you something, but if it succeeds, it doesn't tell you a lot.” Fourrier said she would be impressed if the system achieved a score of 80% or 85% on SWE-Bench—but it only managed a 74.9%. 

Ultimately, the headline message from OpenAI is that GPT-5 feels better to use. “The vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that, especially average people who haven't been spending their time thinking about models,” said Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT.

Vibes alone, however, won't bring about the automated future that Altman has promised. Reasoning felt like a major step forward on the way to AGI. We're still waiting for the next one. 

An exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI's twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models—and superalignment.

It's now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer. Here's how.

Global warming is driving emissions, which are driving global warming, which is driving ...

In the spring of 2021, climate scientists were stumped. 

The global economy was just emerging from the covid-19 lockdowns, but for some reason the levels of methane—a greenhouse gas emitted mainly through agriculture and fossil-fuel production—had soared in the atmosphere the previous year, rising at the fastest rate on record.

Researchers around the world set to work unraveling the mystery, reviewing readings from satellites, aircraft, and greenhouse-gas monitoring stations. They eventually spotted a clear pattern: Methane emissions had increased sharply across the tropics, where wetlands were growing wetter and warmer. 

That created the ideal conditions for microbes that thrive in anaerobic muck, which gobbled up more of the carbon-rich organic matter and spat out more methane as a by-product. (Reduced pollution from nitrogen oxides, which help to break down methane in the atmosphere, also likely played a substantial role.)

The findings offer one of the clearest cases so far where climate change itself is driving additional greenhouse-gas emissions from natural systems, triggering a feedback effect that threatens to produce more warming, more emissions, and on and on. 

There are numerous additional ways this is happening or soon could, including wildfires and thawing permafrost. These are major emissions sources that aren't included in the commitments nations have made under the Paris climate agreement—and climate risks that largely aren't accounted for in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's most recent warming scenarios.

Spark Climate Solutions (not to be confused with this newsletter) hopes to change that.The San Francisco nonprofit is launching what's known as a model intercomparison project, in which different research teams run the same set of experiments on different models across a variety of emissions scenarios to determine how climate change could play out. This one would specifically explore how a range of climate feedback effects could propel additional warming, additional emissions, and additional types of feedback.

“These increased emissions from natural sources add to human emissions and amplify climate change,” says Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously served as climate science advisor to President Joe Biden. “And if you don't look at all of them together, you can't quantify the strength of that feedback effect.”

Other participants in the effort will include scientists at the Environmental Defense Fund, Stanford University, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and other institutions in Europe and Australia, according to Spark Climate Solutions.

The nonprofit hopes to publish the findings in time for them to be incorporated into the UN climate panel's seventh major assessment report, which is just getting underway, to help ensure that these dangers are more fully represented. That, in turn, would give nations a more accurate sense of the world's carbon budgets, or the quantity of greenhouse gases they can produce before the planet reaches temperatures 1.5 °C or  2 °C over preindustrial levels. 

But one thing is already clear: Since the current scenarios don't fully account for these feedback effects, the world will almost certainly warm faster than is now forecast, which underscores the importance of carrying out this exercise. 

Scientists at EDF, Woodwell and other institutions found that fires in the world's northernmost forests, thawing permafrost and warming tropical wetlands could together push the planet beyond 2 °C years faster, eliminating up to a quarter of the time left before the world passes the core goal of the Paris agreement, in a paper under review. 

Earlier this year, Spark Climate Solutions set up a broader program to advance research and awareness of what's known as warming-induced emissions, which will launch additional collaborations similar to the modeling intercomparison project.  

The goal of the program and the research project is “to really mainstream the inclusion of this topic in climate science and climate policy, and to drive research around climate solutions,” says Ben Poulter, who leads the program at Spark Climate Solutions and was previously a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

Spark notes that warming temperatures could also release more carbon dioxide from the oceans, in a process known as outgassing; additional carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that also depletes the protective ozone layer, from farmland; more carbon dioxide and methane from wildfires; and still more of all three of these gases as permafrost thaws.

The ground remains frozen year round across a vast expanse of the Northern Hemisphere, creating a frosty underground storehouse from Alaska to Siberia that's packed with twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.

But as it thaws, it starts to decompose and release greenhouse gases, says Susan Natali, an Arctic climate scientist focused on permafrost at Woodwell. A study published in Nature in January noted that 30% of the world's Arctic–Boreal Zone has already flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source, when wildfires, thawing permafrost and other factors are taken into account.

Despite these increasing risks, only a minority of the models that fed into the UN climate panel's last major report incorporated the feedback effects of thawing permafrost. And the emissions risks still weren't fully accounted for because these ecosystems are difficult to monitor and model, Natali says.Among the complexities: Wildfires, which are themselves hard to predict, can accelerate thawing. It's also hard to foresee which regions will grow drier or wetter, which determines whether they release mostly methane or carbon dioxide—and those gases have very different warming effects over different time periods. There are counterbalancing effects that must be taken into account as well—for instance, as carbon-absorbing plants replace ice and snow in certain areas.

Natali says improving our understanding of these complex feedback effects is essential to understanding the dangers we face.

“It's going to mean additional costs to human health, human life,” she says. “We want people to be safe—and it's very hard to do that if you don't know what's coming and you're not prepared for it.”

Laptops are a huge help when it comes to working, because you can do it anywhere. Sure, that means you can work while commuting or at a temporary desk, and we respect that, but it also means you can work on your couch, or even in bed. Freedom is everything here, but sometimes you need a little bit more than your laptop can actually give you.

In those times, it pays to have access to a good docking station, and you can currently get an amazing Anker 13-In-1 Docking Station for just $140, which is 30% off. That's a big discount, but it's also one that's not going to last forever, so if you are looking to boost the abilities of your laptop, act fast.

See at Amazon

A laptop dock allows you to just hook more things up to your laptop. Sometimes this is going to be more peripherals, sure, but a lot of the time it can be extra monitors as well. This can make it a lot easier to show off work, or even treat your laptop more like a PC at home if that's the kind of setup you have going on. Convenience is important, and a good laptop docking station is a huge deal on that front, and Anker is one of the best companies going on this front.

This particular dock goes into a USB-C port and turns it into USB-A ports, HDMI ports, SD slots, audio slots, an Ethernet port, and USB-C ports as well. This makes it really easy to have everything running through the dock itself instead of your laptop, and that makes it way easier to treat your laptop like a portable core for your whole working life.

You can even charge devices using it, but the fact that you can output visuals to up to three monitors at once is where it really shines, because it can allow you to show off specific work as you need to. It's just a really helpful device to have for creatives, freelancers, or just those who do a lot of travelling and project work.

This beast of a docking station would normally cost you $200, so being able to get it for $60 is amazing. This 30% discount isn't likely to last for very long though, so you'd better be quick if you want to secure one before it expires and you have to pay full price.

Overpower your PC's graphics with the RTX 5090


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In the market for a new GPU or perhaps building a new system ahead of EA's Battlefield 6 release, whatever the reason, if you want the absolute best GPU in your build, then now could be an opportunity to pick one up at a reduced price - and boy, do they need it. The MSRP for these cards, set by Nvidia ahead of the launch of the 50-series flagship, was $1999, but we soon found that that original pricing was nowhere near the reality of the actual release prices. Cards were closer to $3000 than $2000. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can currently pick up one of these powerful graphics cards for its lowest-ever price on Amazon.

The card in question is the Zotac Gaming RTX 5090 Solid OC, which has a retail price of $2,399.99. This is $400 less than its original launch price of $2799.99 a few months ago, and checking the Camelizer and PC-Partpicker price checkers, we can confirm that this is the lowest-ever price offered for this card online from the retailers these price checkers cover.

Zotac's Gaming Solid GeForce RTX 5090 is stacked with 32GB of the latest GDDR7 VRAM running on a superfast 512-bit bus. A whopping 21,760 CUDA cores and a 2422 MHz boost clock speed are what make this beast a ridiculous performer in games. This card has the latest connectivity options, with 1 x HDMI 2.1b port and 3 x DisplayPort 2.1b ports for connecting to displays. If you're looking for the best GPU for gaming and also a popular GPU choice for productivity work, like video editing, or playing around with localized AI//large language model projects, then the 5090 is the way to go.

The most powerful consumer-grade gaming graphics card available, Nvidia's RTX 5090 is the GPU you want in your gaming rig. 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM and 21760 CUDA cores allow you to push the limits in gaming fidelity.

We've tested and reviewed the RTX 5090 and found it to perform roughly 25% better than the previous generation's RTX 4090. There is no better card if you want the absolute best in your machine, and this current price is the cheapest that you can currently get one for. While the card is becoming common on shelves than it was at launch, this is still a very expensive GPU that requires a powerful power supply and possibly a fire extinguisher.

Synergistic therapy combining colistin and meropenem reduced clinical failure rates in carbapenem-resistant infections and was particularly effective in Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia cases. 

""As synergism between colistin and meropenem is frequently present in A baumannii, when treating severe A baumannii infection with polymyxin-based therapy, consideration might be given to combination therapy with meropenem,"" the authors wrote. 

The study was led by Mariya Huralska, MD, from Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and Jason M. Pogue, PharmD, from the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy in Ann Arbor. It was published online on July 19, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The main limitation was that more than three quarters of the study pathogens were A baumannii, which limited the power to determine associations between synergy and outcomes for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and P aeruginosa. Additionally, the findings might be applicable to polymyxin B; however, definitive conclusions cannot not be drawn as colistin was used in the trial. 

The study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Some authors disclosed serving in consulting, advisory, or other financial support roles for Merck, Shionogi, Melinta, Entasis, GlaxoSmithKline, or VenatoRx.

A newly engineered antibody transport vehicle targeting the transferrin receptor enables enhanced delivery of anti-amyloid antibodies to the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, researchers report. According to the study, the approach preserves key immune functions, such as microglial clearance of plaques, while offering a safer and more effective delivery strategy for anti–amyloid immunotherapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein plaques in the brain. FDA-approved anti-amyloid drugs, like aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, have shown limited success in reducing Aβ plaque buildup and slightly slowing cognitive decline in AD. Still, they do not stop the disease from progressing. Their clinical benefits might be further constrained by suboptimal penetration into the brain and by common side effects, including brain swelling and small brain bleeds, collectively known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

To overcome these limitations, Michelle Pizzo and colleagues engineered a novel antibody transport vehicle (ATV) that targets the transferrin receptor – a natural gateway on blood vessels that allows certain molecules to cross the BBB. The design, called ATVcisLALA, incorporates a mutation to reduce harmful interactions with immune receptors on immature red blood cells, thereby preventing cytotoxic side effects. In a mouse model of AD, Pizzo et al. show that, when fused with an anti–amyloid-β antibody (creating ATVcisLALA:Aβ), the modified therapy successfully entered brain tissue more efficiently than conventional antibodies.

Notably, ATVcisLALA:Aβ distributed broadly throughout the brain parenchyma, increasing brain concentrations by five- to eightfold. The researchers' approach also showed enhanced targeting of plaque-associated Aβ in brain tissue rather than in blood vessels, which reduced vascular inflammation and significantly lowered the incidence of ARIA-like side effects. ""Taken together, the findings of Pizzo et al. provide more than preclinical proof of concept; they also establish a framework for therapeutic design,"" write Mengen Xing and Weihong Song in a related Perspective. ""By precisely controlling the route of antibody entry and modulating its function, ATVcisLALA:Aβ overcomes long-standing limitations of AD immunotherapy.

Go to Europe. 

That's long been the refrain for any American soccer player hoping to make his debut with the U.S. Men's National Team. Go to Europe, sign with a recognizable club in a recognizable league, train with a top coach and don't worry about whether or not you're a consistent starter. Trust that the allure of your European bonafides will charm the USMNT and lock in your call-up.

That advice doesn't fly anymore. USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, himself a veteran of the European club system, has flipped the script on how American players can best prepare to represent their country. Named USMNT coach in August 2024, Pochettino is not blinded by the shine of big-name clubs. He's interested in one thing and one thing only: regular, strong performances, no matter where in the world his USMNT candidates are based.

""For me, the most important factor is how they are performing in their club,"" said Pochettino, per Lizzy Becherano of ESPN.com.

Pochettino's new USMNT mindset of club minutes over club reputation has led to a seismic shift in the development path of young American players. Instead of fleeing the U.S. — and, by extension, Major League Soccer — in favor of Europe, many top American prospects are staying put. They're dedicating the prime of their careers to MLS because they know the league will give them what Pochettino wants to see: consistent, dedicated playing time.

No young USMNT player exemplifies this shift more than Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna. The 21-year-old attacker made his mark on the USMNT with gritty, technically gifted performances in 2025, catching the eye of several European clubs in the process. But while playing in Europe remains a goal for Luna, he's not interested in sacrificing his playing time just to get a big-name club on his resume. He's listening to Pochettino and staying in Salt Lake.

""When it comes to moving clubs, the No. 1 thing is playing time,"" Luna told The Athletic. ""You gotta play. You gotta perform. You gotta be 90-minute, 120-minute match fit. Your touch has got to be on, your confidence has to be up.

“When it comes to moving teams with such a small amount of time coming into the World Cup, it's difficult. You don't know where you're going to play, when you're going to break through, how you're going to make it work, or if it's just going to stall for six, eight months. You don't know if you have that type of time right now.""

Luna isn't alone in his feelings. His USMNT teammate Matt Turner, a player who went to Europe earlier in his career to break into the USMNT, returned to MLS to play more regularly.

""I need to find my form leading into the World Cup,"" Turner said of the move, per MLS.com. ""I think this is a really important opportunity.""

Pochettino's belief in consistent playing time has quietly become one of MLS's biggest boons in 2025. Bringing in star athletes like Lionel Messi and Son Heung-min is good for the league, but retaining top American talent is even better. With Luna and Turner sticking around, alongside San Diego's Luca de la Torre, Charlotte's Tim Ream, Cincinnati's Miles Robinson and NYCFC's Matt Freese, keeping American stars in American soccer without sacrificing their international development is finally a reality.

The USMNT will return to action on Sep. 6 to play South Korea in an international friendly. Many of Pochettino's MLS-based players are expected to make the roster.

Real Madrid are more than well-known for doing astute business in the transfer market. They include so many special clauses in their Castilla players' contracts that get them some amount of profit, adding up to a lot over time.

They are also very good at selling players just before their peak ends, as was seen with Raphael Varane and Casemiro in the past. Even Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't quite the same when he left the club in 2018, but I guess that was also because of different reasons.

The former part of this astute business could have got the club 20 million euros without selling a single player.

Real Madrid sold Nico Paz to Como last season, and included a 50% sell-on clause that would get them half the transfer fee for any club Paz is sold to from Como, if that ever happens.

Gianluca Di Marzio just reported that Spurs put a bid of 40 million euros on the table for Paz, but Como rejected the offer. They want 70 million euros.

Real Madrid, if Como had accepted it, would have received half the transfer fee, which comes down to 20 million euros. 

That is business that they could have made without even selling a single player. Obviously, they would lose out on their rights over Paz, but they would have made a fat profit on the player.

Selling him to Como was profitable in the first place, but this would have taken it to another level.

I don't know just how much need there is for Paz at Real Madrid anymore. He is an unbelievably talented player - no doubt about that - but they already have so many players fighting for the same minutes Paz will take up.

Arda Guler, Franco Mastantuono, Rodrygo, Brahim Diaz are players who are probably going to take that one spot in the starting lineup or off the bench. Add Paz to the situation and it becomes tough to see why the club would want him back in the first place.

Paz is too talented to sit on the bench, and if Real Madrid hadn't signed Mastantuono, then it would've made complete sense to bring him back. Now, not so much.

Hopefully, either there is a place for him in the future, or he forces a place in the squad with his performances. Worst case, Real Madrid will make a big profit as soon as Como are ready to sell - whenever that is.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Tony Cascarino backs Chelsea for title challenge after one thing he spotted at Club World Cup","https://www.thechelseachronicle.com/news/tony-cascarino-backs-chelsea-for-title-challenge-after-one-thing-he-spotted-at-club-world-cup/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:30:00 GMT","

Chelsea's performance at the Club World Cup seems to have really convinced their former striker Tony Cascarino.

Chelsea were able to win the tournament after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the final. They also got their hands on the Conference League trophy, so enjoying success in the cup competitions has not really been too much of a problem for the Blues in recent years.

The league is where they have struggled, with the club having not won the Premier League title since 2017.

Jamie Carragher has given his prediction for the new season, tipping Chelsea for another top-four battle. Cascarino, though, thinks they can do better than that.

For Cascarino, the problem Chelsea had last term was overplaying at the back. But after watching Robert Sanchez opt against doing that at the Club World Cup, the 62-year-old believes the ingredients are now there for his old side to mount a title challenge.

Speaking on talkSPORT, Cascarino said: “It was interesting when they won the Club World Cup because again we talked about this. The goalkeeper did not try and overplay, and that cost Chelsea quite a lot last year. 

“They weren't good enough to win the league last season. I think they can be challengers this year. I don't see Chelsea outside the top four, I really don't.”

At one stage, it looked like Sanchez would not be Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper in the new season.

Earlier in the summer, Chelsea had been chasing Mike Maignan. However, after failing to sign the AC Milan goalkeeper, Sanchez retained his spot in the team at the Club World Cup and played a huge role in them winning the competition.

The Spaniard was excellent in America, especially in the final. He kept a clean sheet that day and went on to win the Golden Glove award, which is handed to the best goalkeeper at the tournament.

Sanchez's goalkeeping as a whole was very questionable last term. In total, he made five errors leading to goal. No shot-stopper in the Premier League made more.

The 27-year-old also made four errors that resulted in a chance for the opposition, so there is clearly much room for improvement.

If Sanchez can reduce the above, though, then perhaps Chelsea can do better than fourth place this time around.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Manchester United have reached an agreement with RB Leipzig for the transfer of Benjamin Sesko to Old Trafford this summer. Man United reportedly will be paying a fixed fee worth 76.5 million euros, with easy bonuses up to 8.5 million euros to sign the Slovenian striker.

The Red Devils' quest for a new striker successfully led them to acquire the Slovenian international from Leipzig. After reaching a personal agreement with the player, Man United eventually got the approval from the Bundesliga outfit regarding the transfer fee.

As reported by David Ornenstein and Fabrizio Romano, United will sign Sesko for a fixed fee worth 76.5 million euros with an additional 8.5 million bonuses. Bruno Amorim's side also ensured that the bonuses are easily accessible, making the potential deal go up to 85 million in total.

After the agreement between clubs, United are expecting to complete the Sesko signing before the weekend. The 22-year-old is expected to arrive at Manchester later today and have his medical on Friday, before signing his contract.

In their attempt to snatch Sesko, United beat the competition from Newcastle United, who are even willing to pay 5 million euros more. However, the player preferred to join Amorin's team instead of the Mapgies.

The signing of Sesko could also trigger a potential departure at Man U's current attacking roster, with Rasmus Hoijlund being the one who could leave. The Danish international has several interests, notably from Italy, with AC Milan being the main candidate for now.

The world number two, who was defeated in a Grand Slam final for the first time in his career in London last month, spent his first full day at the Cincinnati site on Wednesday and said he is ready for a reboot during the second half of the season.

""Even if I lost, I left the court proud after Wimbledon,"" the 2023 Cincinnati finalist said. 

""But the goals can change during the second half of the season.

""My goal is to keep doing the right thing and improving. I want to enjoy my time on and off the court.

""But I also want to try and recover the number one ranking by the end of the year,"" he added.

The world number two, who joined the top-ranked Sinner in skipping the ATP Toronto Masters, said he spent a refreshing three weeks at home in Spain after his Wimbledon defeat.

""I took a week off, not doing anything,"" he said.

""Then I started training at home and visiting with friends and family. Just being at home in the summer - I couldn't believe it.

""I tried to make the most of my time. I wanted to come strong to Cincy.""

Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in the French Open final before falling to the Italian at Wimbledon, said he is ""happy to be building such a rivalry.

""We've done a lot in tennis in a short period of time,"" he said.

""People talk about what we have done for the history books. But we have long careers ahead of us. Let's see how far we can go.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Novak Djokovic praised and tennis fans told to 'applaud' him after his latest decision before the US Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/novak-djokovic-praised-and-tennis-fans-told-to-applaud-him-after-his-latest-decision-before-the-us-open/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Novak Djokovic has failed in each of his three attempts to add a 25th Grand Slam title to his collection in 2025.

The Serbian star kicked off his Grand Slam campaign in Melbourne, where he picked up a remarkable win over Carlos Alcaraz, before Djokovic retired injured against Alexander Zverev in the semifinals.

Traveling to Paris for the French Open, he returned to the semifinals once more, where Djokovic lost to number-one seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

Suffering the same fate at SW19, Djokovic was beaten by Sinner 3-6, 3-6, 4-6, as he missed out on a place in the Wimbledon final.

Looking to go all the way in New York, Djokovic has been praised for what he's done before the US Open begins.

Following his run to the last four at Wimbledon, Djokovic pulled out of the Canadian Open, alongside his fellow Grand Slam champions Sinner and Alcaraz.

However, unlike Sinner and Alcaraz, Djokovic has now withdrawn from the Cincinnati Open as well, meaning he will next be seen on court at the US Open.

During the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', Nick Kyrgios' former coach, Simon Rea, gave his verdict on Djokovic's Cincinnati withdrawal.

“I think it's hard to knock the change in approach from the perspective that you are looking at an athlete that is prepared to do whatever he can to give himself the ultimate chance at playing for one more Grand Slam title,” he said.

“I think it's the equations of energy in vs energy out. It's as simple as that. The energy in is normally time on the match court, victories under the belt, momentum, progress, and confidence, which is earned through action. You can't go to the supermarket and buy confidence off the shelf.

“So I think it's to be applauded that he is trying something different again.”

Rea believes Djokovic is sacrificing match sharpness to conserve energy for the latter stages of the tournament.

“He is prepared to go in there slightly underdone from a physical perspective, because he is thinking I need every ounce of energy available at the backend of that fortnight,” he said.

“We know it's hot and humid in New York, we know it's a physical test over five sets.

“He is going to go in there fresh and back himself to find a way, perhaps through some difficult moments in the opening week and back himself to get there with a little bit more in the tank deep in the event against the likes of [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz.”

The Australian may have praised Djokovic for ‘trying something different', although it should be noted that things didn't exactly go to plan when the Serb did the exact same thing in 2024.

After Djokovic lost to Alcaraz in the 2024 Wimbledon final, he chose to skip the two North American hard-court Masters 1000 events just as he has done this year.

Returning to action in New York as the number two seed, Djokovic was looking to defend his title, having beaten Daniil Medvedev to win his 24th Grand Slam one year earlier.

Kicking off his campaign with a comfortable victory, Djokovic defeated Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.

Moving on to play his fellow Serb, Laslo Djere, Djokovic advanced to the third round when his countryman retired injured down two sets to love.

Next up for Djokovic was Australia's Alexei Popyrin, who had won the Canadian Open earlier in the month.

Stunning those in attendance on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Popyrin stormed into a two-set lead, 6-4, 6-4, leaving Djokovic on the brink of defeat.

Djokovic wasn't prepared to give up that easily, however, as he fought back to take the third set, 6-2.

Many expected Djokovic to push on and secure the win in five, although it wasn't to be, as Popyrin regained control in the fourth, securing the win 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.

For the first time since 2017, Djokovic had lost before the fourth round of a Grand Slam, as he headed home from New York much earlier than expected.

Looking to avoid the same fate in 2025, perhaps it would have made more sense for Djokovic to play a warm-up tournament before the US Open.

Only time will tell if Djokovic will be subject to another early exit at Flushing Meadows, but you certainly won't want to miss any of the action when the tournament begins on Sunday, August 24.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to headline action at the Cincinnati Open in their return to the ATP Tour. After their Wimbledon runs, the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings will begin their campaigns in the second round of the Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Sinner is scheduled to play his first match on Saturday, August 9, when all the top half matches will be played. He will open against qualifier Daniel Elahi Galan or Vit Kopriva. Alcaraz will compete on Sunday, August 10, when all the bottom half matches will be played. He will face Mattia Bellucci or Damir Dzumhur.

 



The Cincinnati Open, which runs from 7 to 18 August 2025, will mark their next appearance after their clash in the Wimbledon final, where Sinner defeated Alcaraz in four sets. The Italian improved to 5-8 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the win.

Ben Shelton's rise will hit new heights on Thursday in Toronto when he competes for his maiden ATP Masters 1000 trophy at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, but he will face a stern test from an already accomplished winner at that level, Karen Khachanov.

This will be the No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings' first appearance in a final at this level, while Khachanov is back in the championship match for the first time since triumphing in Paris in 2018. Their clash is scheduled for not before 7:30 p.m. ET/Friday, 1:30 a.m. CEST.

🏆🤷We used data from their tournament so far to create a match up of the two finalists, who will take the title❓#TennisInsights | @atptour | @NBOtoronto pic.twitter.com/AC0Z85EaUf

Shelton is arriving in the final in red-hot form, having defeated Alex de Minaur and Taylor Fritz to score back-to-back wins over Top 10 opponents for the first time in his career. After showcasing variety to overwhelm De Minaur, the 22-year-old dispatched second seed Fritz in straight sets with his trademark power, while also winning 10 of 14 rallies that extended to nine shots or more.

“Playing back to back guys like Demon and Taylor, and having so much success in the long rallies is a big confidence builder for me,” Shelton said after defeating Fritz. “Last night I did it with a little bit more slower, off-pace stuff. Today I had more of my higher-end, attacking tennis. I'm really happy I showed that, depending upon who I'm playing, I can do both.”

That ability to adapt tactically — to either outlast or overpower — has been key to Shelton's run in Toronto, where he cracked the quarter-finals at Masters 1000 level for the first time. But standing across the net is a player proven for his credentials in these events.

Khachanov returns to a Masters 1000 final seven years after his breakthrough run in Paris, where he defeated Novak Djokovic in straight sets. The big-hitting 29-year-old saved a match point to stun top seed Alexander Zverev in Wednesday's semi-finals, finally cracking the title match in Canada after falling short in the last four in 2018 and 2019. He now boasts a 16-6 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, matching his win total in Paris as his most successful Masters 1000 event.

Watch Extended Highlights of Toronto semi-finals: 

“When I came here I didn't like the conditions,” Khachanov said with a smile. “I can say it now. But that's all about adjusting and adapting. I think tennis is all about that. Every week we play in different events. That's why a lot of things matter sometimes on the results, so that's why I think the question is about who adapts better.”

Khachanov's ability to adjust has been on full display throughout the tournament. His compact swings off both wings, particularly his reliable backhand, have helped him absorb pace and redirect attacks effectively. Against Shelton, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 1-0, Khachanov's experience and shot tolerance will be vital in handling the American's firepower and finding ways to extend rallies on his terms.

Thursday's title match will also carry significant implications in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Khachanov, having already climbed four spots this week to No. 12 in the Live Rankings, would return to his career-best No. 8 — a position he last held in 2019 — if he lifts his eighth ATP Tour trophy.

Shelton won their latest meeting in straight sets in Indian Wells, but Khachanov will be hungry for the chance to rejoin the Masters 1000 winner's circle and confirm his return to elite form. Both players are seeking their first title of 2025.

Either way, a new chapter will be written in Toronto, one that could shape the rest of the season for both men as they aim to debut at the Nitto ATP Finals. Shelton is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, while Khachanov is 12th and would jump to 10th with a win.

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto give their views on a tricky race in Hungary for Alpine.

Pierre Gasly has conceded Alpine are ""just too slow"" after he and team mate Franco Colapinto endured a tough Hungarian Grand Prix, with the pair coming home last of the 19 cars to finish.

With Colapinto starting 14th and Gasly 17th at a track where overtaking can be tricky, it was always going to be tough for the French outfit at the Hungaroring, with their best hope being a spot of weather hitting the circuit.

However, the rain did not materialise, and even splitting the strategies – with Gasly one-stopping and Colapinto stopping twice – did not help.

Gasly's race was further hampered by a 10-second time penalty picked up late on, after a collision with Carlos Sainz when fighting for P15. with the stewards deeming him at fault. Although he crossed the line 17th, that penalty demoted the Frenchman to P19 and last, with Colapinto in 18th.

“We cannot be pleased with the end result today, even if it felt like our execution was quite good,” explained Gasly. ""Ultimately, we are just too slow.

“The last two weekends we have been able to maximise the conditions and come away with two good results. Today was more conventional and it really highlighted our weak spots.

""Still, there were a lot of fun battles out there and I felt like the racing was generally very good. I am here to race, not to give up, and I just gave it my best in all the wheel-to-wheel fights.”

Gasly's sixth-place result at Silverstone and P10 at Spa have kept Alpine's points haul ticking over, but they are now 15 points behind Haas in the battle for ninth in the Teams' Championship.

As for Colapinto, his hunt for a first points finish of the year continues – but the Argentine racer can take heart from making Q2 in Hungary and out-qualifying his team mate for the first time since Canada.

However, his race was undone by a couple of slow pit stops, and he found himself stuck in a DRS train for most of the afternoon.

“It was not the best of days today and a difficult race for us as a team,” Colapinto said after the race. ""The pace was good at times in clean air and I had the same feeling as yesterday, I think we have taken a good step forward with the car, which has given me confidence.

“But with the blue flags and losing time in the pitlane, it really limited what we could achieve today. The initial start and getaway was good, but from there we fell back on the first lap and lost places. I was struggling with rear grip and sliding, which came back to us later in the race.

“We opted for a two-stop and unfortunately, we encountered issues on both which meant we were held longer than we expected. As a team, we've been very good recently with pitstops, but these things happen in racing.”

The Cooldown Room - Quiz of the season so far with Victor Martins

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

Lando Norris might be holding second place in the World Championship, but the McLaren driver feels that certain parts of his season so far were ""not good enough"".

Lando Norris has deemed the earlier part of his season as “not good enough”, with the Briton believing that, prior to the last couple of months, his performance was “pretty average”.

Norris' campaign initially looked to have started strongly when 2025 kicked off at the Australian Grand Prix in March, having won what turned out to be a chaotic wet-dry encounter.

However, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri claimed four victories across the next six rounds, Norris had to wait until Round 8 in Monaco to stand on the top step again.

A difficult moment for the team followed two races later in Canada when a late-race collision between Norris and Piastri – for which Norris took the blame – put the former out of the running while the latter managed to make it home in fourth.

But since Round 11 in Austria, the 25-year-old has bolstered his points tally by scoring three wins, with the most recent of these in Hungary seeing him cut Piastri's championship lead down to just eight points.

When asked ahead of the race in Budapest to assess his season and give an insight into what his area of focus will be during the next few weeks, Norris explained: “Just what I've been doing really over the last month, two months.

“Prior to that, [it was] not good enough, so in a harsh way, I would say I was pretty average before then. Since then, I think things have been a lot stronger.

“I still want more, still need to be a lot better and I'm not as good as where I would like to be, but a lot of improvements have been made.

“I think I'm in a much better place, I'm happier with the car – things like that. I've been working hard but I can do a lot more than I have been doing, so, for that reason, just more of the progress that I have been making.”

Earlier in the season, Norris spoke of how he had been spending time off social media, a move that he felt had allowed him to “do things that are productive”.

With this in mind, the nine-time race winner was quizzed on how different his 2025 summer break might look in comparison to previous years.

“It's not going to be that different,” he reflected. “I'm still on social media every now and then, I'm still going to go and have a good time with my friends in different places, and we're going to have a little golf trip and do different things.

“So really, it's not any different to what I've done the last few years, which is a good thing. It shouldn't be any different. There's no reason it should be any different.

“I still have the priorities of making sure I come back more prepared than ever and in a better way than I could possibly be, but for the same sake, I should treat it no different to how I have done before, which is that Formula 1 is the priority, and I make sure I'm in the best shape I can be for that.”

David Ellison as CEO and former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell as president are running the combined Hollywood company, looking for opportunities for investments in growth and cost reductions.



		By Georg Szalai, Alex Weprin 

	August 7, 2025 5:52am	




	Combining entertainment and technology in a new Hollywood giant is paramount for David Ellison. His Skydance Media has closed its takeover, unveiled in July 2024, of Paramount Global to form what the merger partners have called a “next-generation media and technology leader, positioned to win in today's rapidly transforming media landscape.”


	Ellison authored an open letter to shareholders, employees and creative partners, outlining in broad strokes his vision for the company.




	That includes investing in growth areas, “anchored by our creative engines and superior storytelling,” and scaling the company's direct-to-consumer business globally, as well as driving efficiencies.

					Paramount Rounds Out Its Executive Ranks Under David Ellison		
			









Tech is a big part of the pitch, with Ellison touting a unified technology stock, merging Paramount+ and Pluto into one platform, and leveraging new technology to boost creatives. “We also want to empower our creative partners with technology that will enable them to tell bigger, more compelling stories fueled by human ingenuity,” Ellison writes.


	And he listed “core commitments” to the company, promising consumers that Paramount would become the go-to-place for entertainment, news and sports, reassuring creative partners that it will “align rights, revenue and recognition,” and investors that it would operate in a cost-effective way. He added, however, that the company “will face some hard but necessary decisions to align our team for growth and efficiency.”

	











	Ellison also sought to reassure CBS News staff, telling them that “we recognize it's been a challenging period and we're deeply grateful for your resilience, professionalism, and unwavering commitment to the news business. We take immense pride in CBS News' legacy of impactful journalism and look forward to continuing to foster a newsroom culture where journalists are empowered, trusted, and equipped to do their best work.”


	Animation, sports and games are among key drivers that can make the combined company a growth story, Ellison and his team have outlined before. Paramount brings the Paramount film and TV studios, Paramount+, CBS, and such cable channels as Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central to Skydance.


	Ellison is chairman and CEO of the new powerhouse, which is set to pursue previously unveiled plans for $2 billion in cost savings, as well as the benefits from a reworked streaming strategy and a core focus on being a creator-friendly entertainment juggernaut. Former NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, who has been working at Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital, will be running the company day-to-day as president alongside Andy Gordon, who will be COO.


	The deal allowed Shari Redstone, who has controlled Paramount via the controlling stake held by her National Amusements since her father Sumner Redstone's death in 2020, to cash out. Paramount co-CEOs Brian Robbins, George Cheeks and Chris McCarthy have been focusing on cost reductions and a healthy content pipeline in the run-up to the Skydance deal close.

	











	“The transaction will strengthen Paramount and enhance its balance sheet flexibility, allowing the company to invest in new initiatives and deliver greater cash flow growth,” the deal partners said previously. “The transaction serves as a catalyst to re-imagine the company's operating model, transform its technology platform, streamline its organization and accelerate other initiatives already underway. The overriding objective of the repositioned New Paramount platform and properties is to bring stability to the business, protect creative independence and to enable investment in growth initiatives.”


	Wall Street analysts will be looking for updates on the company's strategies for its streaming and linear TV businesses, among other things. “While investors wait for the company to secure its regulatory approval, all the same questions over Paramount's future remain,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman had highlighted in a report at the end of February. 


	“Starting with Paramount+, there remains the question as to whether it has the scale to sustain itself in the longer term,” the expert wrote. “Could either an outside partnership, which both management and Ellison have expressed openness to, or renewed investment change that?”


	Ellison, in his letter, sought to reassure staff, who have been rocked by years of uncertainty.


	“We are in the midst of a generational change in our industry—and we understand Paramount has faced its own significant challenges, compounded by the reality of a merger process that stretched out over a considerable time period,” Ellison wrote. But that time of uncertainty is now behind us. Moving forward, we will work with conviction and optimism to transform Paramount into a tech-forward company that blends the creative heart of Hollywood with the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies to serve great storytelling, we will unlock the company's enormous potential.”

Shari Redstone will receive $1.75 billion for her stake while her exiting C-suite executives will get eight-figure termination awards in addition to their annual salaries. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	Thirteen months after David Ellison and Shari Redstone hashed out an $8 billion megadeal that would shift ownership of Paramount Global from the heir of a media mogul to the heir of a tech mogul, that merger finally closed on Thursday.


	As the Skydance team, led by Ellison as CEO and former NBCUniversal exec Jeff Shell as president, settles in, the former Paramount C-suite and senior management team have drafted their farewell memos, burnished their résumés and touted accomplishments in the face of a tumultuous few years since the merger of Viacom and CBS in late 2019. The company had more than 18,000 employees as of the end of 2024.

	Shari Redstone, who orchestrated the combination of her father Sumner Redstone's companies, and guided Paramount to try and compete with Netflix in the streaming wars with its own flagship service, Paramount+ (which now has 77.7 million subscribers), will get $1.75 billion in cash for the controlling stake in her holding company, National Amusements. Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of David Ellison, backed the deal as did RedBird Capital, led by Gerry Cardinale.

	Only one member of the trio that comprised “the office of the CEO” after the ouster of chief exec Bob Bakish in 2024 will stay on with Skydance. That would be George Cheeks, who oversaw CBS and its assets during the Redstone era and will be the chairman of TV media under Ellison's ownership. (The exec took home the highest pay figure among his co-chiefs at $22.1 million last year.)

	











	Redstone co-CEO Chris McCarthy, the TV chief who oversaw the building of the Taylor Sheridan-verse on Paramount+, is exiting. The exec was paid $19.5 million last year and will receive $18.3 million on top of his 2025 pay tied to the ownership change, per regulatory filings. 


	Fellow departing co-chief Brian Robbins, who oversaw Paramount Pictures, was paid $19.6 million last year and will receive an $18.6 million change in ownership payment this year in addition to his annual pay.


	Bakish, the sole Paramount CEO who was let go last April, saw a major silver lining to his abrupt exit: a severance package alone worth $69.3 million of his total $87 million in pay for 2024.


	Meanwhile, Naveen Chopra, the chief financial officer who worked on the Skydance deal, was paid $8.78 million in 2024. He jumped to gaming giant Roblox as CFO in June and, since he left early, he forwent a $12 million Paramount award tied to a change in ownership.


	Skydance's deal brings together the Top Gun: Maverick producer with Paramount Pictures, Paramount+, CBS, Showtime, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET and Comedy Central. Over the past year, the co-CEOs have executed a plan to shave off $500 million in costs, sell off assets and reduce a workforce by more than 15 percent as Paramount shifts ownership.


	The new Paramount Skydance will trade on the Nasdaq as “PSKY” in its latest incarnation. In an open letter to shareholders on Thursday, Ellison wrote that he wants “to empower our creative partners with technology that will enable them to tell bigger, more compelling stories fueled by human ingenuity” but that the company “will face some hard but necessary decisions to align our team for growth and efficiency.”

The ""Lost Americana"" singer dropped in to ""Jenna and Friends"" on Thursday morning (Aug. 7) to talk about his new album and being a dad again.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



MGK is in full-court promo mode in the lead-up to Friday's (Aug. 8) release of his Lost Americana album. But during a visit to Today With Jenna and Friends on Thursday morning (Aug. 6), co-host Jenna Bush Hager and Las Culturistas co-host Matt Rogers were initially more focused on talking about babies. The pair surprised Kelly with a onesie for his newborn with ex Megan Fox, Saga Blade, featuring the logo of her show, before asking him what kind of dad he is.


	Wondering how life is with the nearly five-month-old, Kelly responded, “It's awesome,” adding, “I wanna detract any of, like, the congrats to me and just move it to Megan because she really does all the work. I keep getting called, like, the ‘Music Teacher.'” He also laughed about someone calling him a “good dad” recently because he was simply holding little Saga, while Fox was “fuming” off to the side about the praise for what he joked was his bare minimum help.

	











	“She is the one… I just play the guitar and hope and pray that the baby is happy,” said MGK, 35, who wore ripped jeans, a stripped T-shirt and a white Lost Americana baseball hat for the occasion. 




	Kelly also gave an update on his daughter from a previous relationship, Casie, who celebrated her 16th birthday last month. Asked if she's working on getting her driver's license, Kelly said there was some paperwork snafu, which means she can't get her permit until September at the earliest. “Either way, she'll get hers before mine, I still don't have mine,” he said, laughing that he expects Casie to drive him to the bank when she gets her permit considering he's picked up all the bills so far.


	Getting back to album promo, MGK said he's planning to do some more small-capacity pop-up shows next week for fans after inviting 300 diehards to join him at Cellar Dog in New York's West Village on Tuesday (Aug. 5) for an intimate gig where he debuted the new “Semi-Charmed Life”-interpolating song “Starman.” He also noted that he was planning to announce a tour a few month ago, but due to what he dubbed the “gnarly” recession and the bumper-crop of other acts on the road, he decided to hold off for now.


	“I inevitably have to announce a tour because I know that is a service to my fans,” he said before showing Hager and Rogers his killer hula hoop skills.

The businessman was also the former stepson of Reba McEntire.

	Hannah Dailey



	Brandon Blackstock, the Nashville music manager who was married to Kelly Clarkson for seven years, has died after a battle with cancer. He was 48.


	Starstruck Entertainment, the company for which Blackstock worked for many years, shared the news via an Instagram statement on Thursday (Aug. 7). “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” it read. 


	“Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,” the message continued. “He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”


	The news comes just one day after the The Voice coach announced that she would be postponing her August residency shows in Las Vegas so that she could be with her kids during a tough period for the family. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.

	











	She'd added, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”




	The son of Starstruck co-founder Narvel Blackstock, Brandon was formerly the stepson of Reba McEntire, who was married to his father for 26 years. Working alongside his dad, Brandon was involved in managing the careers of clients such as Blake Shelton and Carly Pearce.


	Years after meeting each other while Narvel was Clarkson's manager, the singer and Brandon tied the knot in 2013, after which Brandon would become his then-wife's manager. They share two children together, welcoming 11-year-old River in 2014 and 9-year-old Remington in 2016. 


	In 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce, setting off a lengthy legal battle between herself and her ex-husband. Though they'd eventually settle their split in 2022 — with Clarkson agreeing to give Brandon $45,601 in monthly child support as well as a one-time payment of $1.3 million — Starstruck would later sue the American Idol alum for alleged unpaid fees. Clarkson responded by alleging that the Blackstocks actually owed her money, filing a complaint with California's Labor Commissioner that claimed they'd violated the state's Talent Agencies Act by serving as her managers as well as unlicensed talent agents who booked her business deals.


	The ruling went in Clarkson's favor, with Brandon ordered to repay her more than $2.6 million in commissions. Shortly afterward, Blackstock and Starstruck challenged the ruling in court, but the case was ultimately dismissed in May 2024.


	In addition to the children he shared with Clarkson, Brandon is also survived by his kids with ex-wife Melissa Ashworth — Savannah and Seth — as well as a young grandson named Lake.

""This is true?"" a disbelieving Carey said after learning about Blue Origin's all-female flight.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Mariah Carey might be a star, but she has no interest in going to space — even if Katy Perry recently did, not that Mimi had heard anything about it.


	In a memorable moment from her interview with BBC Radio 2 posted Thursday (Aug. 7), Carey learns for the very first time that Perry was part of Blue Origin's first-ever all-female trip past the Earth's atmosphere, despite the event being all over the news in April. “Did she go to space? Where'd she go?” the Songbird Supreme asks after the interviewer brings it up.

	











	“Into orbit and back?” Carey continues in her characteristically reserved manner. “She's like, floating in the … And this is true? Wow. All right, Katy. I'm not mad at her, that's pretty amazing.”


	When asked whether she'd ever take a trip to the stars, Carey had a hilariously snarky response. “I think I've done enough,” she said simply.


	Though Mimi missed it, Perry's journey to space was widely publicized this past spring. She was one of several women who flew approximately 62 miles above Earth on a rocket trip organized by Jeff Bezos' space tech company, riding the line between the atmosphere and outer space before coming back down after about 10 minutes.


	The expedition was also widely criticized at the time, with some people calling it a waste of resources. Perry, however, described it as an empowering step forward for women, telling press shortly after she touched down, “It's about making space for future women and taking up space and belonging … this is all for the benefit of Earth.”

	











	Keeping her feet planted firmly on the ground, Carey is more focused on blasting off on a new album era as opposed to in a rocket ship. The star will release Here for It All in September, following singles “Type Dangerous” and “Sugar Sweet” featuring Kehlani and Shenseea.


	Watch Carey learn about Perry's space adventure below.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that the Dune franchise actor is closing in on two Amazon MGM Studios movies: Chad Stahelski's Highlander which UA is also behind, and Road House 2, which Dave Bautista was also circling. 


	Bautista will star opposite Henry Cavill in Stahelski's revival of the 1980s classic swordsman movie. We hear he's playing The Kurgan, a character made famous by Clancy Brown in the original Sean Connery-Christopher Lambert film.


	Kurgan was an Immortal who was a contender for The Prize — the power of all the Immortals who ever lived. During his life, Kurgan was a bad dude, killing and raping, and taking the heads of many Immortals. In the original movie, he's a foe of Lambert's Connor MacLeod.

	Bautista joins Road House 2 opposite Jake Gyllenhaal who is coming back as ex-UFC fighter Dalton from a script by Will Beall (Bad Boys: Ride or Die). Road House 2 is produced by Atlas Entertainment's Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, Gyllenhaal's Nine Stories Productions with Josh McLaughlin executive producing. As we first told you, Guy Ritchie is no longer directing, rather Nobody's lya Naishuller. Road House released last year on Prime Video, pulled in 80M viewers worldwide in its first eight weeks on the service, one of the top Amazon MGM Studios movies ever viewed.




			Watch on Deadline		







	UA's Scott Stuber and Nick Nesbitt are producing Highlander alongside Neal H. Moritz and 87Eleven Entertainment, Stahelski's production banner. UA took full rights to Highlander, which Lionsgate developed, with potential to also develop a new series. 

	











	The original Highlander, in 1986, followed the climax of an ancient battle between immortal warriors, unfolding through interwoven past and present-day storylines. The movie gained a cult following and generated a universe of movie sequels and a TV series. Russell Mulcahy helmed the original film, which was produced by Peter S. Davis and William N. Panzer. Patrick Wachsberger is also exec producing.


	Bautista made a cameo recently in Paramount's comedy comeback Naked Gun opposite Liam Neeson. Back in June we told you that Paramount Pictures has acquired rights to The Romantic, a romantic comedy spec from Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont, with Bautista attached to star. The Dune and Guardians of the Galaxy franchise star has Aura Entertainment's actioner Trap House up next, as well as the Amazon MGM buddy cop action comedy The Wrecking Crew opposite Jason Momoa, both of which are produced by his Dogbone Entertainment Banner. He also starred in the critically acclaimed Gia Coppola directed Pamela Anderson movie The Last Showgirl. Bautista also has the Zellner Brothers' alien invasion comedy Alpha Gang upcoming. 


	Bautista is repped by WME and Jackoway Austen Tyerman et al.

Here's hoping he gets to do something unusual with both roles.

Something … tender. 

Brute and brawn will only get you so far. The Kurgan is in on “the secret” – laugh even death – especially death – in the face.

Good for Bautista! Terrific actor.

While you do not, under any circumstances, have to give it up for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, we do feel moved to acknowledge a rare moment of self-awareness from the rapidly metastasizing government agency today. After all, we can't think of a better way to impress upon the public that ICE has been drastically dropping its recruitment requirements lately than to let it be known that Dean “A lot of movies with ‘Angel' in the title” Cain has signed up to serve amongst its various ski-masked teens.

Cain announced his incredible ability to still, after all this time, find a genuinely downward-trending career move on social media this week, in a video meant to lure in people with similar employment prospects to his own. (We kid Cain, of course; America will always need people willing to be second-billed to Kevin Sorbo in a film called Pickleball Pandemonium.) Noting his own law-enforcement bona fides—i.e., being sworn in as a reserve officer for a police force in Idaho so he could make web safety courses with Erik Estrada—Cain employs his full range of acting talents in the video, assuring viewers that ICE only goes after bad people, and in no way serves as a poorly trained, highly armed cadre of people heavily incentivized to do whatever the executive branch tells them to do in exchange for validation and table scraps.

Speaking of: Cain also talked up the fact that ICE is now—as reported by our colleagues over at Splinter—getting pretty bribe-y when it comes to trying to lure in recruits to fill out its flagging ranks, offering a $50,000 signing bonus, student loan forgiveness, and other benefits to folks willing to don the agency's standard uniform of “Whatever will keep people from identifying us for doing this thing we have very willingly chosen to do.” And it's never been easier to join, as Cain himself represents: Just today, the Department Of Homeland Security announced that it was removing all age restrictions on who could sign up, a huge boon to 59-year-old former Superman actors everywhere.

Entering a rarefied strata previously occupied only by films like Gotti, Problem Child, and Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol, Ice Cube's new sci-fi movie/Amazon commercial War Of The Worlds has achieved that rarest of things: Consensus. Specifically, the bad kind, as the new “screenlife” film has just achieved a rare 0 percent fresh rating on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

﻿

Now, admittedly, the new movie—directed by music video guy Rich Lee, and starring an extremely sleepy-seeming Ice Cube as a Homeland Security officer who tries to stop an alien invasion from the comfort of his laptop—is only rolling with 20 reviews tallied at this point. (That puts it well below other “0 percent” luminaries like Adam Sandler's The Ridiculous 6—36 reviews—or the all-time record holder, Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever, which brought together an incredible 118 critics in a shared chorus of hate back in 2002.) But it does seem like War has potential to grow, especially as social media has been having a field day mocking the film lately, partially for how much of it seems to be occupied by Ice Cube looking quizzically into a webcam, and most especially for its brand integration with producer Amazon: It took artistic bravery, we'd argue, to have the fate of the world hinge on an Amazon drone delivery (complete with showing Cube's character type the retail juggernaut's name into his search bar), and then extra-special super bravery to have the characters bribe a houseless guy to risk his life to help them with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.

Interestingly, just about every review surveyed by RT acknowledges that the film could, hypothetically be good, were it not burdened by lousy acting, a largely incoherent script, and the looming feeling of Jeff Bezos breathing down its neck. There have, after all, been several very good movies that have used the “screenlife” concept for both thrills and alternative storytelling; this just isn't one of them—and you very much don't have to take our word for it.

It would be patently false to declare By The Stream, the 32nd film from South Korean naturalist Hong Sang-soo, to be the most personally revealing of his oeuvre. That title is likely reserved for 2017's On The Beach At Night Alone, which follows an actress (Kim Min-hee) as she spends a chilly evening wandering the German coast, fretting if the married director she's sleeping with actually cares for her. Hong and Kim announced their extramarital affair during that film's Seoul premiere, a declaration that effectively saw the actress blacklisted from the Korean film industry. Since then, she's solely acted in Hong's output, appearing in 11 of the director's 13 films since On The Beach. But By The Stream continues to meld the auteur and his muse with its two central characters, employing several of Hong's narrative and technical staples with an air of heightened self-reflection. 

Here, Kim plays Jeonim, a visiting artist and lecturer at a women's university who finds herself in a tight bind. With only 10 days before her students are expected to perform a short skit during a performing arts showcase, it's revealed that their boyishly handsome theater professor has been engaging each of them in clandestine romances. He's swiftly removed from his post, leaving the class without a director for the approaching event (and with unresolved tension surrounding their simultaneous courtships). Jeonim calls her uncle, Sieon (Kwon Hae-hyo, another Hong regular), a once-esteemed actor who has since been blacklisted from the industry over a vague political infraction. 

To Jeonim's surprise, he accepts the temporary post, in part to relive the experience he had directing a short play at the same university some 40 years ago. As he and Jeonim rekindle their bond, familiar Hong scenes unfold: Soju is endlessly poured, Korean delicacies are served, sudden zooms and pans are utilized in order not to break long takes. Romantic tensions are also stoked, both between the disgraced professor and one of his students as well as between Jeonim's uncle and her boss Jeong (Cho Yun-hee), who gushes over the former actor's talent. The latter scenario is to Jeonim's thinly veiled chagrin, as she ponders what implications their potential affair might incur both personally and professionally. 

As with many of Hong's films, the fact that the protagonists are artists—namely poets, directors, actors, painters and writers—is typical. Yet details in By The Stream feel more relevant to Hong and Kim's joint experiences as a couple, riffing on the trials they continue to overcome. The most obvious of these allusions is Sieon's blacklisted status, but the impressionistic tapestries woven by Jeonim feel directly inspired by Hong's diminishing vision (which he previously evoked in the intentionally blurry lensing of 2023's In Water). Once again, the amorphous quality of water serves as a metaphor for bleary eyes, as Jeonim sits by the stream near campus and sketches abstract images for her massive two-meter pieces. Entitled Flowing Water, her artwork also feels directly linked to Hong's own artistic approach. “Being able to complete this whole structure by myself,” she says, “that's satisfying.” The filmmaker has served as director, writer, editor, cinematographer, and composer of his most recent projects, first wearing all these hats with Introduction in 2021.

The familial dynamic between Jeonim and Sieon serves as an interesting buffer for their real-life counterparts, allowing Hong and Kim to reflect on each other's personhood without the obfuscating effect of their domestic partnership. In a stunning monologue during a 10-minute oner, Jeonim recounts a “mystical” incident in which she spontaneously bled from the eyes for several days, effectively blinding her before providing divine clarity. Sieon grapples with his confidence as a performer now riddled with restrictions, and the skit's subsequent staging is met with criticism on the basis of gender and politics despite its delicate execution. (For context, Kim was met with international acclaim for her bold, sexually kinetic performance in Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, which premiered only a year before she was blacklisted for her affair with Hong). Once one is considered a persona non grata, even the most calculated and comparatively small-scale of efforts will still garner considerable backlash. 

But the central scandal of By The Stream also finds Hong and Kim probing the nature of their coupling. Jeonim confronts her disgraced former colleague during a crisp fall day on a park bench. “It was just something you shouldn't do,” she scolds in regard to his pursuit of the student actresses. “You made it impossible to work with them.” While an added ethical boundary is at play here—as well as several more hearts involved—there is an intriguing dialogue being had about the validity of pursuing such a relationship in general. One could read this plot detail as a tongue-in-cheek assertion that Hong and Kim's affair is relatively tame, based on mutual attraction and creative appreciation as opposed to the professor's predatory proclivities. Indeed, a revelation regarding the lengthy process of divorce seems to balance things out by referring to the director's experience with his first wife, who long refused to honor Hong's legal request for separation.

If Jeonim is a loose avatar for Hong, the flowing water she draws inspiration from acts as a meditative reflection pool. His life—now inextricably tethered to Kim's—is refracted and shaped by the path carved by the mighty Han river, which Jeonim follows upstream as part of her ongoing tapestry work. Though it might be the path of most resistance, it is also one that eventually leads to placid calm. Hong's recent films have been categorized as overtly languid, narratively slight, and relentlessly quotidian. By The Stream incorporates (at times literal) dramatic details without ever sacrificing the veristic quality of his work, only made possible by the deep artistic and intimate connection he shares with Kim. With Hong's eyesight diminishing, one wonders if he might be increasingly relying on Kim's vision, both in the sensory and artistic sense—their ongoing project of mutual creation is only getting deeper and more transcendent.

Music legend and “The Voice” coach Kelly Clarkson made the heartbreaking announcement on August 6, 2025, that she was postponing the remaining shows of her Las Vegas residency, revealing that the reason was due to a family emergency involving her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock. 

On August 7, his family revealed that Blackstock died of cancer at age 48, per People.  

“It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” a rep told the outlet in a statement. “Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

Brandon was the son of Elisa Gayle Ritter and talent agent Narvel Blackstock, who married in 1973, per IMDb. The couple had three kids, including Brandon, before they divorced in 1988.

Narvel Blackstock then married country legend and fellow “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire in 1989, while managing her career. The two had a son, Shelby, but divorced in 2015. 

Brandon followed in his dad's footsteps, managing music artists through their Nashville firm, Starstruck Management, which still represents Blake Shelton, Carly Pearce, and several other country artists. 

In 2006, Brandon met Clarkson — just four years after she skyrocketed to fame on “American Idol” — at the Academy of Country Music Awards, according to Us Weekly. At the time, his dad was managing Clarkson's career, and Brandon was still married to his first wife, Melissa Ashworth, with whom he had two kids — Savannah and Seth. 

Brandon's divorce from Ashworth was finalized in 2012, the same year that he proposed to Clarkson, per IMDb. He and Clarkson married in 2013, which meant McEntire was Clarkson's mother-in-law for two years — and the couple had two kids, daughter River Rose, now 11, and son Remington, now 9. 

Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020, according to E! News, beginning a nearly three-year battle over assets and alleged mishandling of her talent fees. She was managed by Starstruck's team from 2007 to 2020, per E! News. 

Their divorce was eventually finalized in 2022, and the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement ordered Brandon to return $2,641,374 of paid commissions from when he was Clarkson's manager. 

Blackstock left music management in the midst of their divorce, according to Us Weekly, and focused on becoming a rodeo manager in Montana, where the two shared a ranch. A judge ruled in 2021 that Clarkson would get to keep the ranch, per USA Today. 

In December 2024, the U.S. Sun reported that Blackston founded Valley View Rodeo, which he'd been running with Clarkson's former assistant, Brittany Jones. They also ran Headwater Livestock Auction in Three Forks, Montana, together.

As Kelly Clarkson and her kids mourn the passing of her ex-husband and their dad, Brandon Blackstock, others mourning his death on August 7, 2025, include country superstar Reba McEntire. 

“The Voice” coach was married to Brandon's dad, talent manager Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015, and remained close with him and Clarkson, even through their own divorce, which Clarkson filed for in 2020. Brandon was Narvel's son from a previous marriage. 

In 2021, McEntire told Entertainment Tonight, “Brandon's been my son forever it seems. Although he's my stepson, I still love him like he's my total — my blood, so I'm praying for them both because I love them both.”

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

When McEntire performed at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, it was a family affair. Her and Narvel's son Shelby Blackstock — Brandon's half-brother — shared photos from the event that showed Brandon attended the concert and was backstage with McEntire, along with three of his four kids.  

Shelby captioned the collection of photos by writing, “Family time, the @rodeohouston , & corn dogs! We had a blast in Houston watching @rissablackstock experience her first rodeo & being able to spend cherished time with family! Mom's concert was the icing on the cake!”

Brandon had two kids with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth — Savannah, 22, and Seth, 18. He shared two kids with Clarkson — River Rose, 11, and Remington, 9. He was also a grandpa to Savannah's young son, who was also at the rodeo. 

At the time of publication, McEntire had not spoken publicly about Brandon's passing. 

McEntire didn't take sides as Clarkson and Blackstock were going through their oftentimes contentious divorce, remaining connected to and supporting both of them. 

In 2021, she told Extra, “You know, I love them both. Brandon's my stepson, Kelly's my good friend, and I'm pulling for both of them. I hope they're happy and healthy and pull through this. I pray that everybody gives them the encouragement they can, because they need it right now, both of them.”

She also told Entertainment Tonight that year, “Kelly and I do talk, we text and I love them both, and so I can't play favorites because I've been a friend of Kelly for a long time.” 

Before McEntire became a coach on “The Voice,” she was a Mega Mentor on the show in 2023, and got to work with Clarkson there. 

“I am so proud of Kelly,” McEntire said on the show, as seen in the video above. “She has grown as an artist, as a teacher. From when we first met in 2000 — way back — 2002, so that was how long we've known each other. She was a baby!”

“Now, she's just matured into this wonderful woman that I am just so proud of and I love her with all my heart,” she added.

The chance to speak with Hideo Kojima is not totally unlike meeting a world leader. Alternately — extending this metaphor another way — talking to him while activity at Kojima Productions buzzes in the background over a video interview suggests having a peek inside a spy agency. 

The video game auteur, whose Tokyo studio is visited by everybody from Conan O'Brien to Timothée Chalamet, has just released “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” the sequel to 2019's “Death Stranding” and his second consecutive work that does more to break from the medium's confines than anything I could name. “On the Beach” is an especially bold step towards the cinematic, with a cast (Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Luca Marinelli, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning, and Fatih Akin) far closer to a major festival lineup than animated characters in a video game.

Even if IndieWire's own David Ehrlich hadn't claimed “Death Stranding 2” was a “mega-bizarre masterpiece,” Kojima is a figure who deserves time and attention. Speaking as someone who'd write out the absurdly convoluted “Metal Gear Solid” chronology while bored in middle-school math, the opportunity was not to be taken lightly. When I called into Kojima Productions last week, the director was taking a break from his next projects: “OD,” a horror game co-written with Jordan Peele and starring Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier; and “Physint,” a stealth action game that has already kicked up rumors of a lead role for Robert Pattinson. Questions about those were — surprise — immediately deflected, but “Death Stranding 2” offered sufficient fodder for discussion.

 










This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Indiewire: It's Tuesday in Tokyo, and “Death Stranding 2” has been out for exactly a month. What are you working on today?

Hideo Kojima: Well, I'm checking the data of the players all over the world — what kind of weapons they're using, the routes they're taking, all this data. And I also see these small bugs here and there, so I'm deciding where to fix and what to fix. I also am starting to work with the team on “OD” because that's a new project, and also doing “Physint” all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage. So I'm doing that. And also I have all these interviews every day, and also promotional — photo-shootings, things like that — so I don't feel like I've finished the title, to be frank.

No work of art is ever truly flawless or perfect. I wonder how you feel about having this after-the-fact ability to improve your own work. That's a unique opportunity compared with filmmakers who can't necessarily go back to fix flaws in their films. Do you feel a game ever is emboldened because of its flaws?

There are some things that you shouldn't change. Like the story, for example, because there is a certain era that that story was born. You shouldn't change those kinds of parts. Or, you know, like [George] Lucas changed [‘Star Wars'] to all CG, but that's because it's a new era, right? So I don't want to change anything that would affect the era that it first came out. The things that I said that I'm changing are, you know, all the things basically related to gameplay. Like: This item was not very easy to use, so I'll make it a little bit more accessible, or, like, make the UI bigger. These small parts are the ones that I'm changing. I know that DLC [downloadable content] is not a trendy space because if you start doing that, you'll never finish the project.

 










“Death Stranding 2” is maybe your most confidently directed work, and I'm fascinated by how your style has reached a kind of minimalism since the later “Metal Gear Solid” games. The cutscenes tend to be shorter, the shots longer, the visual style more fluid.

“DS1,” there were a lot of long cutscenes, yes, because it was supposed to start slow, right, and to explain everything — it was slow — but I see a lot of people discontinuing watching the cutscenes from “DS1” by stats. Because, for me, cutscenes are part of the game. Some people don't even think about that, but I believe cutscenes are part of the game. So what I do is: I have these bunches of cutscenes, games, and events, and I lay them out and really change through the play-through — like, I change the length of the cutscene if the cutscene, I feel, is too long. The rhythm is very important. I check the rhythm of the game, and I kind of change everything. So maybe, you know, that's one reason. I even change it after taking the motion after sessions with the actors, and I kind of adjust the balance of that rhythm, as I said, and I think it's becoming better because of that.

What tech advancements affected your directorial style in recent years — is it the reliability of A-list acting talent, smaller cameras that allow for more movement and set-ups, or something else altogether?
 










During the pandemic, we held performance-capture sessions at the Sony studio in L.A. We had the actors arrive on set in L.A, but our staff was restricted from traveling abroad. I had to direct from Tokyo. Those were the rules by Sony at the time. Reluctantly, I was forced to direct from afar. We used smartphones, Zoom, iPads, and multiple cameras for the remote session. I protested and said it was impossible, but I was told that all other studios were also doing it remotely and that I would need to follow the same rules. To test out the remote session, we tried out two scenes that didn't require the main characters. The results were quite disastrous. I couldn't grasp the spatial dynamics of the set, like the positioning of the virtual cameras, the actors' movements, and directing their performance; it felt hopeless. I thought I wouldn't be able to shoot. 

That's when I reached out to the development team about a system called “Mado” [“Window” in English] at Sony headquarters. I borrowed two of them and set them up — one in Tokyo, the other in L.A. It's like a giant smartphone the size of a door. The two were synced and allowed for two-way communication of both footage and sound. On the other side of the screen, we could see life-sized actors. Though it was through a screen, we were able to communicate with each other as if we were standing outside each other's window. We were able to overcome that period by fully utilizing that technology.

 










Can you talk a bit about what that remote work looked like, and how you feel your direction benefits from being in person with your actors?

Well, even though I have, like, 20 cameras on this side and that side as well, it was really difficult to describe the stage and the set in its direction. Like, for instance, me directly saying, “OK, you act from here to there. You walk from here to there.” It's impossible to just say “here to there.” They won't know where from where. For instance, if I were talking to the actor on the spot in the scene — like Norman [Reedus] — I had to say, “Hey, Norman, you walk from here all the way up to Léa and you say this line,” and things like that, it's so difficult to explain that if you're not there. Although I could see, because we set up so many cameras, it's so difficult to explain the position physically at just one point. [Laughs] I couldn't wrap it up as though I was in the scene — I was just through the camera, and that was so difficult.

You talked about how the quality of an actor's facial scan between “Death Stranding” and “On the Beach” improved significantly — specifically how Léa Seydoux's face is now more lifelike, more vivid. Did seeing stronger face work engender anything in a rewriting process? If you watch these scenes and understand you can actually gather more emotion from Léa or Elle Fanning or Norman Reedus, than you had understood while you were initially writing a scene.
 










Yes, I do that a lot. I even did during shooting as well. Like, for instance, Léa's smoking scene — that was not initially in it, and I had it added. [Laughs] As you know, we've been working with 3Lateral, and the rigs of the facial have really upgraded, and we could do a lot of facial expressions — very subtle ones as well — so I kind of even changed the scenes where I take out some lines because facial expressions could be covered, and I kind of make that decision on the spot. Even the lighting: I kind of asked a lighting technician, a professional lighting technician, to come to teach the staff about lighting in general, so we took, like, a healthy two years to learn all of this about all of this — about all the lights and things like that. So that could have an influence, too. [Laughs]

You've often talked about blurring boundaries between cinema and video games. What is the greatest struggle in doing so? Outside the obvious matter of interactivity, where are the media most incompatible?

In film, the creator controls the timeline. They can choose exactly what images to show, what performances to present, and what sounds to let the audience hear. Everything is delivered the way the creator wants. But with games, that's not possible except in cutscenes. The creator has no control over the timeline — the player decides everything. Sometimes, players might even skip important scenes. The creator has no say in that. That's where games differ from films. And from theater, too — in theater, you're free to look wherever you want, but the timeline remains controlled. In games, you can view the stage from any angle and even walk away midway. In other words, creators can't calculate or plan everything because it all depends on the player's actions. Films are about showing a series of carefully curated images, but you can't approach games with the same mindset. I think that's where it creates a sense of uncertainty for both the performers and the director.

 










There's also the issue of recording time. Unlike films, where you can concentrate on the shoot over a period of three to six months, that kind of intensive schedule is difficult for games. Game development involves filming little by little as you go — maybe like a week each month, sometimes with long gaps in between. For “DS2,” the entire process took about three years. That makes it a very challenging environment for the actors. Scheduling is difficult, too. Sometimes there's been a long gap since the last session, and the actor must recall the emotional tone from the previous performance.

“On the Beach” continues the narrative arcs and themes of “Death Stranding” very fluidly. That's surprising because you've been very honest that a lot of the game was rewritten amid COVID-19. But you've never revealed the original plot. Now that we're some time away from “Death Stranding 2” and people like myself have actually been able to play it, are you at any liberty or desire or comfort to say how the original version of the game would have differed?

[Laughs] Well, I found the initial concept sheet, actually. I have to say a big theme of “DS2,” or the direction, hasn't really changed, but the story — or the ending — has changed after the pandemic, yes. The first half seems quite similar to the original one, but from the middle point onwards, I kind of rewrote a lot. You know, all these lines that were newly created are actually spoken by the President [Alastair Duncan] at the end — or what Die-Hardman [Tommie Earl Jenkins] says at the end. This is what I was thinking during the pandemic, and I put that in there. So that's a big change.

 










Do you expressly prefer keeping something like a concept sheet tucked away and letting the game exist as it does? One of your favorite films is “Blade Runner,” and part of its mythology is the question of whether or not Deckard is a replicant, right? But that's something that only came about because Ridley Scott, decades later, would admit it. I wonder if you have a similar interest in sharing alternate versions of your work.

[Laughs] No, I don't feel like I should say those things. I have my conclusion. I have my, you know, things that I thought about, but if I confess that, it won't probably be art anymore. For instance, if I drew a drawing of an apple and I put that in a museum and I say “this is an apple,” but all the people who saw it, it doesn't matter if they think it's an apple or a banana. But if I say, “No, no, no, what are you saying? I drew an apple,” I shouldn't say that. Well, Ridley Scott is an exception. He's a Sir, right? He could say whatever he wants.

Is there something that you look for or see in an actor, in a live-action context, that tells you they could convincingly deliver a motion-capture performance? If it's something in their face, their voice, their body language. Because I think you might be the only person who's ever watched Luca Marinelli and said, “He should be in a video game.” Or is it as simple as one form of acting translating to another?
 










Well, I don't really regard them as being “in the game.” I just look for actors who are good — like, they're good in terms of the looks or the emotion, their expression, their acting. And when I think of a character in my game, I think of, “OK, who should I cast?” And those people come up. At the same time, we take one step of changing them to CG, so they have to really be individualistic. You see what I mean? We take one cushion, as a CG, until we put them in their performance. Then what I do is: I talk to them directly. And if it matches, I talk to their agents. So I think it's the same as, you know, casting in the movies. Every time I talk with Guillermo del Toro or Nicholas Winding Refn, we always talk about, “Oh, who's coming? Oh, did you see that movie? Did you see his acting? Did you see her acting?” It's kind of the same with even these movie directors. So I regard myself as no different than how I cast in other people as well.

Are there any deceased actors who you think might have fit your worlds and sensibility? 

That would be my childhood hero, Steve McQueen. If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday. In my games, I've featured film directors whom I know personally or greatly respect. In fact, I had always hoped to cast David Lynch, a director I've admired for so long. However, he passed away not long ago, and I'm devastated.

 










Some have compared your games to the work of Thomas Pynchon, who even went so far as to mention you in “Bleeding Edge.” Are you familiar with Pynchon's work, and has it served as any kind of influence on you as a writer?

Yes, I know Thomas Pynchon and read, and acknowledge that I was in one of his writings. Yes. But I don't really get the point where I'm “influenced”; I don't really think about it, actually.

Well, that answers the question. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule; it's very appreciated.

Also, I want to add that I do admire Thomas Pynchon as well. [Laughs] I like his writing, so don't, you know… don't get confused about that. Don't say that I'm not influenced by him or anything like that! Because I do admire him.

“Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” is now available on PlayStation 5.

Kelly Clarkson‘s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has died at the age of 48. The cause was cancer, Blackstock's family confirmed in a statement to Rolling Stone.


	“It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,” Blackstock's family said. “He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family.”


	They added: “We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.” The Blackstock family said they would not be commenting further about Blackstock's death, and did not share specifics on Blackstone's illness.


	The news of Blackstock's death comes just a day after Clarkson postponed several of her Las Vegas residency shows to be “fully present” with her family and kids while Blackstock dealt with his illness, which had not been made public. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment,” she wrote on Instagram Wednesday. “I need to be fully present for them.” 

	











	Blackstock and Clarkson started dating in 2012. They married in 2013 and had two children: a daughter, River, born in 2014, and a son, Remington, born in 2016. Blackstock was also the former stepson of Reba McEntire, who was married to his father Narvel Blackstock at the time. When Clarkson and Brandon wed, McEntire said: “To have my buddy as my daughter-in-law, I mean, who could ask for more?”

	Clarkson penned her song “Piece by Piece” about her relationship with Blackstock. “But piece by piece, he collected me up / Off the ground, where you abandoned things,” she sings on the 2015 title track. “Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me.” Clarkson eventually filed for divorce in 2020, and it was finalized in 2022, after two years of court contention.

	Blackstock had served as Clarkson's manager after their marriage (he had previously managed Blake Shelton), an arrangement that caused legal turmoil following the end of their romantic relationship.


	Blackstock also had two children, Savannah and Seth, from a previous marriage. He became a grandfather in 2022 when his eldest child, Savannah, had a son named Lake.

	The economy might be slowing down, but they're still firing on all cylinders at the Black Keys‘ retro-rock factory. “Time don't slow/It's passing you by/No matter how we try,” Dan Auerbach intones on the smooth-rolling title track from No Rain, No Flowers, the band's 13th album. If anything, Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney have built their success by sidestepping time rather than giving in to it. In their reality, rock remains suspended in arena-packing amber, 1970s radio drive-time vibes are an eternal power source, and two tight bros from Akron, Ohio can still form bands that roll on for decades.


	Recently, though, the Keys' uniquely smooth career trajectory hit a bit of a bump. The tour planned for their last album, 2024's Ohio Players, got canceled, and Auerbach and Carney split with their management. So, instead of doing a big tour, they hunkered down and made a good album. On Ohio Players, the often hermetic duo brought in collaborators like Beck, Dan the Automator, and Noel Gallagher to add some new flavors to their signature high-definition garage-rock. No Rain, No Flowers is similarly collaborative, with big-name studio practitioners like Lana Del Rey producer Rick Nowels, hip-hop/R&B vet Scott Storch, and Daniel Tashian (who helmed Kacey Musgraves' landmark Golden Hour) joining the band in their Easy Eye Sound to help craft one of their most precision-tuned LPs yet.

	In the Keys' utopian past, the top radio station in town plays hard rock next to punk next to blues next to funk and soul and glam, without any racial or social distinctions (or even record sales) gumming up the flow. Songs like “The Night Before” and “Babygirl” are euphoric bubble-funk workouts with clever twists, like the wobbly indie-rock guitar buzz in the former. “Down to Nothing” is a begging, pleading stoner-soul benediction. “Make You Mine” follows a sumptuous groove to a floating-falsetto, Bee Gees-tinged chorus. “Man on a Mission” is a fuzzed-out blues-metal stomp. “Kiss it” is a rough-hewn version of lovelorn soft-rock poetry. They close it out with the Southern-rock sweep of the Skynyrd-steeped boogie rocker  “A Little Too High” and the Allman Brothers-loving ballad “Neon Moon.”

	











	Perhaps due to having A-list song-shapers on board, the album is seamlessly smooth and often a poppy far cry from the garage-grind they built their career on, but it's not without heart. The band's recent travails (which include some personal challenges for Carney) seem to color their songwriting, adding a bit of emotional ballast for a band whose lyrics often just seem like riffs on fun rock & roll tropes. ““Don't let yourself get down too long/‘Cause a change is coming soon/You can always find your way back home by the light of the neon moon,” Auerbach offers, perhaps alluding to the way music and the brotherhood of his band have grounded him. Disruptions come and go. The Black Keys' clockwork competence is a durable wonder.

	On Thursday at midnight, steep retaliatory tariffs Donald Trump slapped on dozens of countries went into effect. “IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!” the president wrote on Truth Social minutes before the levies snapped into effect. 


	“Tariffs are flowing into the USA at levels not thought even possible,” he added in a subsequent post. 


	Hours later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on MSNBC, where he was gently coaxed into admitting that while the government might rake in plenty from the new taxes, American businesses and consumers are the ones paying the penalties. 


	“So if someone here, an importer, wants to buy Brazilian products today or tomorrow and import them, they're going to pay 50 percent to the Treasury, and so who writes that check,” host Eugene Robinson asked Bessent of the new tariffs leveled against the South American nation. 


	Bessent first stated that tariffed Brazilian imports could simply be replaced with “substitutes” from other nations, before being pressed by Robinson to clarify “who writes the check to the Treasury,” if the product does come from a tariffed nation like Brazil. 

	











	“Well, the check is written to the person who receives it at the dock, in the U.S.” Bessent replied. 


	“The check is written by the person, the receiver. So the tariff is paid in this country by the importer. Is that right?” Robinson pressed. Bessent then said that the exporter could lower their price to retain market share. Robinson pressed again: “But the check is written by the importer, at the dock?

	











	“Yep,” Bessent said. “And the importer can pass it on or not.”


	The economic reality is that tariffs are not taxes paid by exporters, they are an economic disincentive against the importing specific products that primarily burdens the purchaser. But much like President Trump thinks he can just fire the nation's leading statistician to make his floundering economic metrics go away, the administration believes it can simply declare that centuries of economic theory and practice don't apply to them.

	The pared down tariffs that have been in place for several months have already begun negatively impacting the American economy. Job and GDP growth has slowed, consumer prices are on the rise, and inflation has begun to tick up. Some of Trump's advisers worry that not even dipping economic numbers will get the president to back off his chaotic tariff policy.  


	“Sometimes Trump can't stand prosperity,” longtime Trump economic confidant Stephen Moore, told Rolling Stone this week. “My advice to Trump is to stop with the tariffs. We don't need tariffs right now. … When I see him, he knows my position; every time he sees me, he says: ‘There's Steve Moore! He doesn't like tariffs!' This will hopefully get the administration to back off of the tariffs.”


Rolling Stone reported that Trump fulfilled a long-held dream by firing Erika McEntarfer, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, after the agency released a weak job report on Monday. He is continuing to do what he can to avoid the reality of his economic agenda as the new round of tariffs went into effect last night.

	“BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,” he wrote on Truth Social. 


	He can put it in all caps, he can post it 10 times a day, but by the admission of his own Treasury secretary, it's American businesses who are writing the check for those billions. Consumers are already feeling the squeeze, and it stands to get a lot worse.

The Office's Oscar can't believe he's found himself back in front of the same documentary team that followed him around for years at Dunder Mifflin, in the official trailer for the sitcom's spin-off, The Paper.  


	Reprising his role as the exasperated accountant, Oscar (played by actor Oscar Nunez) wants no part in the crew's latest project. “Not again. I'm not agreeing to any of this,” he exclaims, storming away from the cameras. “I will make this unusable — fuck. Use that.”


	The new show, which premieres on Sept. 4 on Peacock, follows new editor-in-chief Ned Sampson's (Domhnall Gleeson) ambitions to revitalize a sleepy Midwest town's struggling newspaper, the Toledo Truth Teller. 


	It seems he has his work cut out for him, as his team of hesitant reporters admits the closest they've come to working at a legitimate paper was writing essays in middle school, posting on social media, and being part of a group text message.

	“Have you read this paper? How do you think it compares to any other paper?” a staffer, played by Chelsea Frei, asks Gleeson's character. “It sucks,” he immediately replies. “But we are going to make it better.”

Scientists have synthesized methanetetrol, an elusive alcohol that could be the foundation of alien life.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Chemists have synthesized a ""super alcohol"" previously thought to be too unstable to exist. The molecule was formed under extreme, ""space-like"" conditions and may shed light on the complex reactions required to form extraterrestrial life.

The super alcohol is called methanetetrol and is the only alcohol with four oxygen and hydrogen groups around a single carbon atom. It is thought to be a key building block for life in the universe. ""This work pushes the boundaries of what we know about chemistry in space,"" study co-author Ralf Kaiser, a chemist at the University of Hawaii, said in a statement.

Methanetetrol is a type of ortho acid, a class of compounds thought to be critical in the chemistry of early life. However, these compounds are hard to isolate and study. Methanetetrol's high number of oxygen bonds, for example, make it very unstable and likely to break down if not kept in specific environmental conditions.

Methanetetrol doesn't occur naturally on Earth, but scientists have theorized about its existence and chemical structure for more than a century, according to the statement.

To emulate how methanetetrol might form in space, the researchers put water and carbon dioxide in a minus 451 degree Fahrenheit (minus 268 degrees Celsius) cryocooler, and then exposed the mixture to cosmic ray-like radiation to trigger the necessary chemical reactions to bring these molecules together.

Using ultraviolet light, the team then detected small amounts of the super alcohol in a gaseous form. They revealed their findings in a study published July 14 in the journal Nature Communications.

This work ""pushes experimental and detection capabilities to the 'final frontier, the next level beyond what could be accomplished before due to the lack of experimental and computational approaches,"" Kaiser said in another statement.

Now that they are able to study methanetetrol, astrobiologists can learn how this alcohol is synthesized and reacts with other molecules in the coldest parts of space, such as the dust clouds where stars and planets form.

""You have this compact, carbon-oxygen molecule that just really wants to go 'boom,'"" study co-author Ryan Fortenberry, an astrochemist at the University of Mississippi, said in the statement. ""And when it does, when you give it any kind of energy, you'll have water, hydrogen peroxide and a number of other potential compounds that are important for life.""

Methanetetrol is like ""a seed of life molecule,"" he explained, that could be a building block of life across the universe. ""It's something that can lead to more complex chemistry if given the opportunity.""

—Building blocks of life may be far more common in space than we thought, study claims

—NASA finds key ingredient for life gushing out of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus

—What energy source sparked the evolution of life?

Fortenberry likened the alcohol to an acorn, which can't grow into a tree on its own, but requires the right conditions and reactions to do so. ""It's like a prebiotic bomb,"" he said.

The chemists concluded that, because it can form in the space-like conditions of a lab, methanetetrol can also form in space. ""If we can find places where methanetetrol forms naturally, we know that it is a place that has the potential building blocks to support life,"" Fortenberry said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Netflix's Perfect Replacement For Supernatural Boasts 94% On RT","https://screenrant.com/netflix-supernatural-replacement-lockwood-and-co-canceled/","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

With a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes​​​​​, Lockwood & Co. is the perfect replacement show if you're looking for something new after Supernatural. It's been about 20 years since Supernatural premiered, and there are still probably as many fans of the ghost-hunting and demon-fighting series now as there were then.

With 15 seasons following the Winchester brothers as they contend with an assortment of supernatural beings, there's plenty for fans to watch and rewatch. However, if you have just finished a Supernatural watch-through and want something similar but not exactly the same, give Lockwood & Co. a try.

 Lockwood & Co. is based on the five-book series by Jonathan Stroud, which debuted in 2013. The series premiered on Netflix in 2023 and is based on the first two books in the series, The Screaming Staircase and The Whispering Skull. The show is set in an alternate version of present-day Britain where ghosts are real.

For the past 50 years, ghosts, who are deadly to the touch, have been rising from their graves. Because of this, technological advancement stopped around the late '60s. Only children and teenagers are able to see these ghosts, which has led to organized ghost-hunting squads filled with trained teens.

Lockwood & Co. is one of those cult fantasy TV shows that deserves much more attention. The series is a clever twist on the ghost-hunting formula, putting teens in the driver's seat as the only ones capable of stopping this supernatural menace. While adults are still involved, teenagers work with them, not just for them.

If you were a fan of the monster hunting and detective work of Supernatural, you'll get a kick out of Lockwood & Co. The procedural aspects of both shows are very similar, though Lockwood & Co. offers a slightly more charming and nostalgic story that still retains a creepy atmosphere.

Unfortunately, Lockwood & Co. was canceled after just eight episodes and one season, which is especially frustrating considering there are still three more books in the series that have gone unadapted. The series was canceled because of low viewership numbers, but fan backlash suggests it was more popular than the streamer realized.

Netflix is particularly guilty of the habit of many streamers of canceling TV shows prematurely. There's this idea that a show needs to have massive viewership numbers from the pilot episode for a renewal to even be considered. What ends up happening instead is that great shows like Lockwood & Co. don't get a chance to flourish.

Open wide, my babies. The Lion's Gate Portal is peaking today, bringing with it the most powerful moment of the year for soul transformation, clarity and calling in all that is good and plentiful.

The Lion's Gate refers to the annual alignment between the sun in Leo and Sirius — the brightest star in the night sky, also known as Alpha Canis Majoris, or the Dog Star.

The Lion's Gate is open from July 28 to August 12, but peaks in power on August 8th. 

“The Lion's Gate Portal opens a rare energetic doorway. 8/8 carries a vibration of spiritual strength, infinite potential, and alignment with your soul's purpose. This isn't about chasing material goals. It's about stepping into who you're truly meant to be,” said Psychic Solas, of Psychic Source, shared. 

Why is this day of days so fated?

In Numerology, the number 8 is symbolic of infinity, abundance and the balancing of karmic debts. A power number, eight, is the union of the material and the spiritual, represented by the interlocking circles within the numeral itself.

On August 8, the energy and power of the number are doubled for our earthly benefit.

During the Lion's Gate Portal, Sirius rises to align with Earth and Orion's Belt, a cosmic formation that has been revered since ancient times.

The sun in Leo amplifies themes of personal power, courage, creative expression and radical self-love.

This year, August 8 coincides with Mercury retrograde in Leo, when we are called to reflect, reset and consider how our self-expression can be used to elevate the collective.

“Expect old desires to resurface and new clarity to drop in. In 2025, the Lion's Gate Portal centers less on attracting what you want and more on choosing what genuinely aligns with who you are now,” said Solas.

Three weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tried to discredit Donald Trump's Russia scandal and started throwing around words like “treason,” the conspiratorial DNI has certainly succeeded in generating some conversation.

On the one hand, Republicans and conservative media outlets have seized on Gabbard's accusations as proof that the entire controversy surrounding the president and Russia's efforts in support of his 2016 candidacy is a “hoax.” On the other hand, every independent analysis of Gabbard's findings have pointed in the opposite direction: There was no “hoax”; the underlying scandal remains real; and the DNI's claims are “ludicrous.”

Officials from Democratic and Republican administrations urged the public to recognize Gabbard's conspiracy theories as obvious nonsense, while intelligence officials launched a behind-the-scenes effort to discourage the DNI from even releasing her discredited claims in the first place.

Gabbard appeared this week on Fox News — a network that has embraced her latest allegations with considerable enthusiasm — and was asked a straightforward question.

“Now, director, you said there was ‘irrefutable' evidence that [Barack Obama] was the mastermind of this intelligence manipulation and the perpetuation of the Russia hoax,” host Laura Ingraham said. “What is that irrefutable evidence for our viewers tonight?”

Gabbard responded by pointing to a National Security Council meeting, held in December 2016 — after Trump was elected and during the presidential transition process — that Obama called to discuss Russia's operation. As part of that meeting, the Democratic then-president made some standard directives to intelligence officials. Gabbard added:

[V]ery specifically, they were tasked to create an intelligence assessment that detailed how Moscow tried to influence the election. Not ‘if,' but ‘how.' And this was the beginning of this manufactured intelligence assessment where they knowingly wrote things in this assessment that were false, and they knew they were false.

If Gabbard was under the impression that this made sense and her on-air comments constituted persuasive and “irrefutable” evidence that justified her bizarre allegations of treason, she was mistaken.

For one thing, we've known about that National Security Council meeting for years. It was discussed in some detail in the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee's report, and as Media Matters' Matt Gertz explained, the GOP-led panel didn't find anything remarkable about Obama's instructions.

On the contrary, the committee reviewed the assessment that Obama sought and concluded that it was “coherent and well-constructed,” featuring “proper analytic tradecraft,” and that its authors experienced “no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions.”

But what about Gabbard's claim that officials were told to put together an intelligence assessment that detailed “how,” not “if,” Russia targeted the election? That's not scandalous either: By December 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies had already compiled voluminous evidence, collected over the course of months, documenting Moscow's efforts.

The “if” question, in other words, had already been answered. At that point, there was no need to ask it again. To see this as “treasonous” is ridiculous.

Put another way, Gabbard appeared on Fox News — a network where she used to work as a paid contributor — and was asked to support her claims about “irrefutable” evidence. Given the opportunity, she presented a big nothingburger.

On the surface, it might not seem especially surprising that the national intelligence director has struggled to bolster her own baseless conspiracy theories, but let's not forget that a great many Republican officials are heavily invested in the idea that Gabbard knows what she's talking about. Indeed, Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation based almost entirely on Gabbard's claims.

Given that the DNI can't defend her own claims, maybe that ought to raise some red flags for Republicans who are relying on her?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","The FBI has been asked to help locate Texas House Democrats. One state lawmaker says officials would be breaking the law","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/07/politics/texas-house-democrats-fbi-cornyn","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 19:14:00 GMT","


             The chair of the Texas House Democratic caucus remained defiant Thursday in the face of one US senator's bid to enlist the FBI's help in returning him and his state House colleagues to the state.
    


            “Sure, if they don't follow the law,” state Rep. Gene Wu told CNN's Pamela Brown on “The Situation Room,” when asked whether he was concerned the FBI would arrest him and his fellow Texas state House members.
    


            “We know that the governor has no power outside of the state, and we know that the federal government cannot get involved in this unless there is a legal reason why they are allowed to get involved.”
    


            Wu and dozens of Democratic state lawmakers remain outside of Texas as they continue their standoff with the Texas GOP over proposed changes to the state's congressional maps that would favor Republicans. Earlier this week, state House Speaker Dustin Burrows signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats and said law enforcement would “need some time to work.”
    


How Texas Republicans want to dismantle Democratic districts



            The warrants empowered state troopers to arrest the absent Democrats and bring them to the Texas Capitol, but the Democrats fled to Illinois, New York and Massachusetts – three Democratic-led states outside Texas law enforcement's authority without local officials' cooperation. Legal experts consulted by CNN have said it's highly unlikely the Democratic lawmakers can be arrested outside state lines based on the warrants.
    


            Texas US Sen. John Cornyn, who is up for reelection next year, said Thursday the FBI had granted his request of federal assistance for state law enforcement, as they work with Texas Republicans to bring back the lawmakers and reestablish quorum.
    


            “I am proud to announce that Director Kash Patel has approved my request for the FBI to assist state and local law enforcement in locating runaway Texas House Democrats,” Cornyn said in a statement, but did not elaborate on what such assistance would entail.
    


            He told conservative talk show host Mark Davis later Thursday that Patel had assigned agents from the bureau's Austin and San Antonio offices to fulfill his request – though did not detail what role they would have.
    


            The state lawmakers who left the state have held multiple public press conferences and made a number of media appearances. One location where lawmakers were staying received a bomb threat earlier this week.
    


            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters that Republicans threatening law enforcement action were making “an attempt again to thwart democracy.”
    


            “So as far as I'm concerned, we're doing the right thing, and I'm proud of it, and I'm not going to back down,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said at a press conference. “We're going to do everything we can to protect these Texas House Democrats and to help them do what they're doing.”
    


            It's unclear to what extent agents are assisting Texas Republicans in the matter and under what authority they would be allowed to do so. The FBI has declined multiple requests for comments from CNN on the matter.
    


            A similar instance occurred in 2003, when more than 50 members of the Texas Legislature left the state to prevent a vote on a redistricting plan, and state officials reached out to federal agencies to find and bring back the lawmakers.
    


            But back then, President George W. Bush's Justice Department refused to assist, telling one congressman that they were “not aware of any information pertinent to the Texas State legislators that would warrant action by federal law enforcement authorities, including those of the FBI.”
    


            “Accordingly, we have not deployed and have no plans to deploy our law enforcement resources in connection with this matter,” the letter from then-Assistant Attorney General William Moschella stated.
    


            In his initial request for FBI assistance, Cornyn suggested that the Democratic lawmakers could be violating the law if they are accepting funds “to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties” and could “be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.” No such charges have been filed related to their absence.
    


            Cornyn's request to the department comes as he and his primary foe, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, are each trying to stake out an aggressive stand on the controversy and attempt to woo conservative voters in their state.
    


Ken Paxton's long-distance quest for a Trump endorsement



            Cornyn on Tuesday sent a letter to the FBI today urging the federal agency to assist state law enforcement “to locate or arrest potential lawbreakers who have fled the state.”
    


            “I request the FBI's assistance, as federal resources are necessary to locate the out-of-state Texas legislators who are potentially acting in violation of the law. The FBI has tools to aid state law enforcement when parties cross state lines, including to avoid testifying or fleeing a scene of a crime,” Cornyn wrote.
    


            Paxton acknowledged Tuesday night on Fox News that it would be difficult to arrest absent Democrats. His office as well as the office of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott have threatened to go to court to vacate the offices of people who are currently outside the state.
    


            “The challenge here is they go to liberal jurisdictions where we can't get help from law enforcement. So we have really very limited options,” he said.
    


            “One is to wait, which several governors have done, and just waited them out because eventually they have to come home. Or two, this … motion or filing that has been done by Abbott, we're going to file something very similar for more of the legislators to take them out of their office, remove them from office, since they are not showing up to do their job. This is a new thing, it's never been tried before, but we think it has a very good possibility of being successful.”
    


            Abbott, for his part, warned that “in Texas, there are consequences for your actions.”
    


            “Texas DPS and the FBI are tracking down the derelict Democrats. They will be taken directly to the Texas Capitol,” he said on X. “Those who received benefits for skipping a vote face removal from office and potential bribery charges.”

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A wealthy businessman on Thursday became the head of Haiti's transitional presidential council tasked with restoring order in the troubled country as a top gang leader underscored the challenges facing the nation by vowing to overthrow the government.

The appointment of Laurent Saint-Cyr at the council's heavily guarded office in the capital of Port-au-Prince — where criminal gangs control 90% of the neighborhoods — marked the first time that members of Haiti's private sector serve in both the rotating presidency and the post of prime minister, two positions that share the country's executive duties. 

Saint-Cyr had his start at a local insurance company while Haiti's current prime minister once ran an internet firm.

“Our country is going through one of the greatest crises in all its history,” Saint-Cyr said at a ceremony attended by ambassadors of several countries. “It's not the time for beautiful speeches. It's time to act.”




Hours before the swearing-in, a powerful gang federation that has long denounced Haiti's oligarchs threatened to overthrow the government, and gunfire erupted in parts of the capital in the morning as many residents stayed away from normally congested streets.

In a video posted on social media, Viv Ansanm gang leader Jimmy Chérizier — better known as “Barbecue” — warns residents to give his armed group free passage through several neighborhoods to reach the council's office. 

“People of Haiti, take care of yourselves and help us … in the battle to free the country,” Chérizier says, wearing a bulletproof vest and with an automatic rifle slung around his shoulder.

A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police said in a statement that officers thwarted potential attacks by around-the-clock patrols and by boosting the number of armed forces in certain neighborhoods and around critical infrastructure.

“Armed gangs had plotted to disrupt national stability and render the country ungovernable,” it said.

Saint-Cyr thanked all national and international actors who have helped Haiti, as well as the private sector, which he called the engine of the country's economy. He noted that while he's from the private sector, he would serve all people equally.

Saint-Cyr previously served as president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Haiti and of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He'll be working with Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a one-time president of an internet company in Haiti and also a former president of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Saint-Cyr said security was the council's utmost priority. He called on the armed forces to intensify their operations and on international partners to send more soldiers, offer more training and help boost a mission lacking resources and personnel.

“We must restore state authority,” he said. “The challenges we face are certainly linked to insecurity, but they also are the result of our lack of courage, a lack of vision and our irresponsibility.”

He questioned what was preventing the government from offering services Haitians deserve, including health and education. “Mister prime minister, assume your responsibilities!” he said.

Meanwhile, 58 organizations from countries that include the United States in a letter to Saint-Cyr accused the council of violating its legal obligations to Haiti's women and girls.

“Collective rape is endemic,” they said, noting that sexual violence has surged as gangs persist in their rampage. The organizations also accused Haiti's government of being “completely absent” at shelters where rape survivors need basic services. 

A growing number of people have grumbled about Haiti's private sector leading the country. Some of Haiti's wealthy elites and powerful politicians have long been accused of financing and arming dozens of gangs.

However, dozens of Haitians wearing white T-shirts and clutching signs emblazoned with Saint-Cyr's photograph gathered outside the council's office to support him. 

Skirmishes broke out hours later between supporters and those who opposed Saint-Cyr.

“Even though he's a mulatto with good hair, he's Haitian,” one supporter said of Saint-Cyr, who is part of the country's small and powerful lighter-skinned elite — as is Fils-Aimé.

As the country prepared for Saint-Cyr's swearing-in ceremony, Haitians posted a flurry of warnings about violence in hopes that people could remain safe.

“Those of you in the capital, you will hear gunshots both ahead of you and behind you. Remain on guard!” one message stated.

Tripotay Lakay, a local news site, reported that one person was killed and another injured while driving into Port-au-Prince on Thursday, though it was unclear how that happened. A video posted on social media shows a woman's body slumped in the car.

Heavy gunfire around downtown Port-au-Prince persisted on Tuesday afternoon, with local media reporting that several people were wounded. Small explosions from police-manned drones also were heard.

Violence also was reported in Kenscoff, a once peaceful farming area above the hills of Port-au-Prince.

The U.N.-backed mission said it lost two armored vehicles after they became trapped in trenches dug out by gangs. It said Kenyan policemen came under an attack with Molotov cocktails but “courageously held their ground, inflicting significant damage on the assailants.” Three officers received minor injuries.

Videos posted on social media show suspected gang members laughing and cheering as they surrounded one of the armored vehicles that was later set on fire.

“Come get it back if you can!” one gunman is heard jeering.

In a report released Thursday, the U.N.-backed mission noted that it has 991 personnel, far less than the 2,500 envisioned, and some $112 million in its trust fund — about 14% of the estimated $800 million needed a year.

The mission said it has no air support for operations and that only 200 officers can be deployed at a time because of insufficient equipment, including vehicles.

The mission also noted that the government remains fragile: “Partisan infighting within the transitional government has had the effect of paralyzing the government and emboldening the gangs.”

Gangs in Kenscoff recently kidnapped eight people from an orphanage, including an Irish missionary and a 3-year-old child. They remain missing.

Violence surged in the aftermath of the July 2021 killing of President Jovenel Moïse, and ongoing violence has displaced more than 1.3 million people in recent years.

At least 1,520 people were killed and more than 600 injured from April to the end of June across Haiti. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

American bullfrogs are gobbling up everything in sight, including some of the rarest species in the Western US.

On summer evenings in the Midwest, the muggy air comes alive with a chorus of crickets, cicadas, and frogs — especially bullfrogs. Their booming mating calls sound like something between a foghorn and a didgeridoo.

As far as we know, summer here has always sounded like this. Bullfrogs are native to most of the Eastern US, from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Coast. They evolved here. They belong here. I, for one, adored them as a kid growing up in Iowa, and spent countless summer days trying to catch them to get a closer look.

What's unusual is that a few states west — into Colorado and on to California — summer nights are similarly marked by the iconic call of the American bullfrog. But here, they don't belong. They're unwanted. And they threaten the very existence of some of the West's other amphibious animals, such as the Oregon spotted frog, which is found only in the Pacific Northwest.

American bullfrogs are not native to the Western US. Humans brought them to the region more than a century ago, largely as a food source. And in the years since, the frogs — which are forest green and the size of a small house cat — have multiplied dramatically, spreading to countless ponds and gobbling up everything that fits in their mouths, including federally threatened and endangered species. Conservation scientists now consider them among the most dangerous invasive species in the Western US, and in the 40-plus other countries worldwide where they've been introduced.

That leaves bullfrogs in an unusual position. Invasive species are typically brought in from other countries — Burmese pythons in Florida and spotted lanternflies in New York City come from Asia, for example — but American bullfrogs are, as their name suggests, American. They're both native and invasive in the same country. And the difference of just a few states determines whether we treat them like pests or as an important part of the ecosystem.

It's easy to hate bullfrogs. They do cause a lot of damage and, like other non-native species, they're leading to what some researchers call the Starbucksification of the natural world — you find the same thing everywhere you go, which can make ecosystems less resilient. Yet bullfrogs themselves aren't the main problem, but rather a symptom of a much bigger one.

One reason is that people enjoy eating them. Or more specifically, their legs.

In the 1800s, as the human population in the West surged amid the Gold Rush, so did an appetite for frog legs, which were associated with fancy French cuisine. To meet that demand, people collected native amphibians from the wild, like the California red-legged frog. But as those species became rarer and rarer — in part, due to overharvesting, researchers suspect — entrepreneurs and farmers started importing American bullfrogs from the eastern US and tried to farm them.

For a time, it seemed like the bullfrog industry might take off.

“Bullfrog legs! Something to tickle the gustatory glands of the epicurean bon vivants,” a reporter wrote in the Riverside Daily Press, a California paper, in 1922. “Propagation of the bullfrog in this state already has become a successful reality. In the near future, bullfrog farming may be expected to take its rightful place as one of the prominent industries of California.”

That never really came to pass. Bullfrog farming proved challenging and financially risky: They take years to raise, they need loads of live food, and they're prone to disease outbreaks, as Sarah Laskow wrote in Atlas Obscura. And for all that trouble, they don't produce much meat.

But while the frog leg industry didn't spread, the frogs, of course, did.

They escaped from farms and, with other accidental and intentional introductions, proliferated until they were common in ponds, lakes, and other water bodies throughout much of the West, including Arizona, California, and the Pacific Northwest. Now, in some portions of the region, “you see so many bullfrogs that it's just sort of alarming,” said Michael Adams, an ecologist and amphibian expert at the US Geological Survey, a government research agency that monitors wildlife. There are no reliable estimates of the total population of bullfrogs in the West, though a single pond can be home to thousands of individuals.

Part of what enabled their success is biology: A female bullfrog can lay as many as 25,000 eggs at one time, far more than most native species.

But as several researchers told me, humans have also modified the landscape in the West in ways that have helped bullfrogs take over. While western states have rivers and wetlands, permanent warm waterbodies weren't common until the spread of agriculture and the need for irrigation, said Tiffany Garcia, a researcher and invasive species expert at Oregon State University. Now ponds, reservoirs, and canals — which bullfrogs love — are everywhere.

“It's a story of human colonization,” Garcia said. “Bullfrogs were brought by people settling and industrializing the West, and they are maintained by people who are natural-resource users of the West. They wouldn't be here and survive without us changing the landscape to create these systems where they do so well.”

Bullfrogs are often found alongside other non-native species, Garcia said, which typically tolerate landscapes modified by humans. And sometimes they even help each other succeed. Research has, for example, shown that bluegill sunfish — introduced in the West largely for sportfishing — can help bullfrogs survive. Sunfish will eat dragonfly larvae that might otherwise prey on bullfrog tadpoles.

“You can't even consider them invasive species anymore,” Garcia said of bullfrogs. “You have to consider it an invasive community.”

Like unsupervised toddlers, bullfrogs will put pretty much anything in their mouths. Mice, birds, turtles, snakes, rocks, other bullfrogs — if it fits, they'll try to eat it.

This is a big problem for species that are already rare, such as the Chiricahua leopard frog or the northwestern pond turtle. Bullfrogs are shortening their paths to extinction.

“They're implicated in the declines, along with habitat loss and drought, of many of our native reptile and amphibian species,” said Sidney Woodruff, a doctoral researcher at the University of California Davis who studies bullfrogs and other invasive amphibians.

In May, Woodruff published a study that found that waterbodies in Yosemite National Park that were full of bullfrogs had lower densities of northwestern pond turtles than those without invasive frogs. She also found that where bullfrogs were present, only large turtles could survive.

“Our study adds mounting evidence that hatchling and juvenile pond turtle losses to bullfrogs pose a serious threat to pond turtle population persistence,” Woodruff and her co-authors wrote.

And where bullfrogs live in communities with other invasive species, native animals often face even greater challenges, said JJ Apodaca, executive director of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental group. Non-native crayfish, for example, are voracious consumers of plants and other habitat features that native animals hide in. So, where you have invasive crayfish, the local fauna will be that much easier for bullfrogs to eat.

Invasive bullfrogs may also be spreading diseases. A study published in 2018 linked the arrival of bullfrogs in the West with the spread of a pathogen called chytrid fungus. While the pathogen typically doesn't sicken bullfrogs, it has helped drive the decline and extinction of more than 200 amphibian species globally, including those in the West.

No, a bullfrog-killing spree won't fix ecosystems in the West. They're already everywhere, so even if scientists manage to eliminate them from a pond or 10 ponds — which often requires fully drying out the water body and hours and hours of effort — they'll likely come back.

“It's futile,” Garcia said. “We're not getting rid of bullfrogs. Not really.”

Even if we could remove bullfrogs from large areas in the West, ecosystems wouldn't suddenly revert back to some sort of natural state. Bullfrogs are both a problem themselves and a symptom of change — of the large-scale transformation of land in the West.

“There's kind of an irony,” said Brendon Larson, a researcher and invasive species expert at the University of Waterloo. “We're nurturing these agricultural systems — which are monocultures and non-native species — and then we're turning around and saying we're surprised when a non-native species does well in response to that.”

Doing nothing isn't a great option either. Left alone, bullfrogs will continue to replace native species that comprise the ecosystems we depend on, including insects that pollinate our crops and salamanders that can help limit the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere and accelerating climate change.

The best approach, researchers told me, is to prioritize bullfrog control — to get rid of frogs in areas with endangered species or where conservation scientists are reintroducing native species that disappeared.

This works. For her study on pond turtles earlier this year, Woodruff and her colleagues caught more than 16,000 bullfrogs across two waterbodies in Yosemite — using nets, spears, air rifles, and other methods — which they then euthanized. It was only after her team shrank the invasive frog population that they detected small, baby pond turtles in those areas. That suggests that, absent bullfrogs, the turtles were finally able to breed and survive, “providing some hope for turtle population recovery once bullfrog predation pressures are alleviated,” the researchers wrote.

Woodruff says she noticed all kinds of other native animals return after clearing out the invasive bullfrogs, including native frogs, salamanders, and snakes. “The coolest thing to me was that the soundscape changed,” she told me. “Over time, you actually started to hear our native chorus frogs again.”

Managing bullfrogs is complicated, Woodruff says, and especially for her. She grew up in Alabama and Georgia, where the animals are native. She liked hearing them. But now she lives in California, where she's studying how they harm the environment, and so hearing them makes her tense up.

“It sucks because I love these frogs,” Woodruff said. “It is not the animals' fault. They are doing what they instinctively want to do — survive and procreate.” She tries to stay focused on the point, she said: “We're doing this for the native species.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","OpenAI's GPT-5 is available for free for everyone. Sam Altman says it's so good, GPT-4 feels 'miserable.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/gpt5-free-chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-agi-2025-8","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

After weeks of relentless hype, GPT-5 is finally here.

OpenAI officially released the highly anticipated new model on Thursday. It's the latest version of ChatGPT, the company's flagship chatbot, and the most widely used AI model on the market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a ""major upgrade"" and ""a significant step along the path of AGI"" in a conference call with journalists on Wednesday. He said that after using GPT-5, going back to GPT-4 was ""miserable.""

OpenAI says the model will be available for free for everyone and that users will no longer need to switch between previous models for different tasks. GPT-5 will switch automatically, the company said, depending on the kind of request and its complexity. GPT-5 will be available in standard, mini, and nano versions. Paid users will have higher usage limits.

Altman said GPT-5 was also the company's fastest model yet.

""One of the things I had been pushing the team on was like, 'Hey, we need to make it way, way faster,'"" Altman said. ""And I now have this experience of like, 'Are you sure you thought enough?'""

The team said GPT-5 will have improved capabilities for vibe coding, the latest craze in Silicon Valley.

OpenAI has been teasing this next iteration of ChatGPT for over a year, but has ramped up the chatter in the last few days and weeks. On Sunday, Altman shared a screenshot of GPT-5 on X, asking the model to recommend the ""most thought-provoking"" TV show about AI.

In July, Altman said that ""GPT-5 is smarter than us in almost every way."" Speaking to podcaster Theo Von, Altman said he asked GPT-5 a question he ""didn't quite understand"" and it ""answered it perfectly,"" making him feel ""useless relative to the AI.""

The OpenAI CEO also likened GPT-5's development to the Manhattan Project, the US government's effort to build the atomic bomb during World War II, and said that it made him feel nervous.

""There are moments in the history of science, where you have a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, you know: 'What have we done?'"" Altman said.

OpenAI's last notable model launch was GPT-4.5 in February, which Altman described at the time as ""the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person.""

The release of GPT-5 has faced several delays, with the timeline shifting from mid-2024 to mid-2025, to August.

During that time, the number of ChatGPT users has continued to grow. In April, Altman said ChatGPT had 500 million weekly active users. OpenAI said on Thursday that ChatGPT is now on track to hit 700 million weekly active users ""this week.""

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he has selected Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, replacing Adriana Kugler, who resigned Friday.

The nominee will serve out Kugler's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026.

""In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post, indicating that the nominee for the full 14-year term on the board could be someone else and Miran may just be in a caretaker role.

""He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job,"" Trump added. ""Congratulations Stephen!""

In addition to the Kugler vacancy, which officially takes effect Friday, current Chair Jerome Powell's term expires in May. Likely candidates for that position include current Governor Christopher Waller as well as former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.

Miran's appointment comes amid continuing speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a ""shadow chair"" whose job it would be mainly to act as a gadfly on the board. Trump said Wednesday that the nominee for the Kugler seat would be temporary rather than a permanent replacement for Powell.

The president has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates. Miran is a past critic of the Fed, specifically its aggressive stimulus actions during the Covid crisis.

In addition, he is the author of the controversial ""Mar-A-Lago Accord,"" a plan to devalue the dollar as a way of managing the current account deficit problem for the U.S.

Miran still needs Senate confirmation to the seven-person board, something unlikely to happen until the upper house reconvenes in September. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, of which he would be a permanent voting member, meets next Sept. 16-17.

Prior to serving in the first Trump White House as senior advisor for economic policy under then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Miran was senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital Management and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. 

While at Treasury, he played a key role in development the Paycheck Protection Program following the Covid economic shutdown in 2020. He has since spoke in favor of reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has used extensively this year as part of a global trade war, and he also has been strongly pro-crypto.

In addition to voting on interest rates, Miran's role as governor would include financial regulation.

However, his most pressing role between confirmation and January could be as an antagonist to Powell. 

Trump has fiercely criticized the central bank chief, calling him a barrage of names, requesting his resignation and even mulling the legally questionable possibility of firing him. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the past has advocated for a shadow chair, reasoning that even if the Fed does not meet the administration's demands, Powell's positions could be counteracted by a dissenting voice on the board who would voice the White House's positions on monetary policy.

At last week's FOMC meeting, two governors — Trump appointees Waller and Michelle Bowman — dissented from the decision to hold the overnight funds rate steady. It was the first time multiple governors voted against a rates decision in more than 30 years.

Two Seas Capital, the third largest shareholder in Core Scientific (CORZ) with a 6.3% stake, has come out against the bitcoin miner's proposed all-stock acquisition by AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV).

In a letter published Thursday, Two Seas said it intends to vote against the deal, which was announced July 7, and plans to rally other shareholders to do the same unless significant changes are made.

The opposition centers on the all-stock, uncollared nature of the transaction, which Two Seas argues unfairly favors CoreWeave and fails to reflect Core Scientific's strategic position in high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.

""The proposed sale materially undervalues the company and unnecessarily exposes its shareholders to substantial economic risk,"" said Sina Toussi, founder of Two Seas.

CORZ is up modestly in Thursday trading at $14.24, substantially below what the roughly $20 the shares would have been worth at the time of the proposed acquisition four weeks ago.

Two Seas has backed CORZ since 2022, participating in its post-bankruptcy restructuring and financing rounds. The firm says it still believes in Core Scientific's long-term value and prefers it remain independent if a better offer doesn't emerge.

Despite also holding a stake in CoreWeave and supporting the idea of a combination, Two Seas called the current deal underwhelming and pointed to Core Scientific's 30% stock drop after the deal announcement as evidence of investor concern.

Two Seas urged the board to pursue alternative bids, including from CoreWeave, but only at terms that reflect the full strategic value of Core Scientific's assets and growth prospects. The firm plans to release further analysis and engage with shareholders in the coming weeks.

Analysts at investment bank KBW predicted that Core Scientific shareholders may push back on the terms of the deal, given the unchanged asset base since CoreWeave's first failed bid and the lack of a cash component, in a report published last month.

In July, Siyan, a UK-based Discord user, logged on one morning and found himself unable to access some of his text chats marked NSFW. The channel, a popup informed him, was now age-restricted. The United Kingdom had enacted its far reaching child safety laws, which includes an age requirement system to verify users are over 18. Discord's updates required users to verify their age, either by government ID or a face scan.

Siyan (who requested to only be referred to by his screen name for privacy reasons) describes himself as “painfully over the age of needing to fake an ID.” He didn't want to take a photo of his ID. The face scan feature wasn't yet available on mobile, he says, and he didn't own a webcam, so he decided to give the platform someone else's face. First, he tried using an emoji of “an old dude” he often uses on Discord. (“It speaks to me.”) Face scans, however, often require users to submit multiple shots that include them looking a specific way, or specific poses. Siyan needed a passable image of a man with an open mouth.

Two games in his library, Stellar Blade and Death Stranding, include a photo mode that allows players to pose a character and set their expressions; Siyan opted for Death Stranding's Sam, modeled after 56-year-old actor Norman Reedus.

He dropped screenshots of his success into a discord, after which a friend posted them to X. Siyan's gambit quickly went viral, inspiring others to try with games like Death Stranding, God of War, and more.

Age verification is now the norm in the UK, though similar laws worldwide are expected to have a profound impact on how we access the web. Companies like Google are rolling out AI-driven age estimation systems for Search and YouTube. On gaming platforms like Roblox, age checks are becoming a key element of safety measures. But whether by using IDs or face scanning, it's an imperfect system. Several Discord users tell WIRED they've already managed to get around face scans using video game characters. Generative AI could make this problem even more difficult to control as the tech grows more sophisticated; just last month, WIRED wrote about a startup working on AI that can create video in real-time. Users are also worried about giving companies their personal information in case of security breaches.

In theory, age verification serves to keep kids safer. On platforms like Roblox, where failed moderation has allowed predators to groom or even assault some children, confirming that someone is a minor—or over the age of 18—is one way to determine what features they can use. For adult content sites like Pornhub, age verification aims to make sure children cannot access pornography. Critics, however, say the systems being put into place are flawed ones, both from a privacy and protection standpoint.

David Maimon, the head of fraud insights for SentiLink and a criminology professor at Georgia State University, says that the current methods of verification can still be fooled. People use many different methods to bypass “liveness checks”—security measures used to verify the user is a real person—whether that's using AI, video games, or videos of other, real people. IDs can be faked, or bought. “The process of age verification is complicated,” he says, and people in charge of these systems need to give them more thought.

Ash, a UK-based 20-year-old who requested his last name not be used, tells WIRED he was able to pass verification using God of War's photo mode with main character Kratos. “I didn't expect [verification] to work because of Kratos' white skin and beard, but it worked first try,” he says. Another Discord user in the UK, who goes by Antsy online, says he achieved the same results with Arma 3 and a mod that allows you to pose characters. “I figured out I could simply by trying, as all people should,” he tells WIRED. “Arma 3 characters look very poor, nowhere near realistic, so I thought it would be a solid experiment to solidify or challenge my views on this technology.” Antsy says he and his friends consider this kind of tech “a challenge” they try to bypass. “I am very pro internet safety,” he says. “I believe, though, that it should not be the internet's job to parent and protect its younger users.""

Video game characters from several games worked. In a video from YouTuber beebreadtech, he's able to swiftly get an adult-age rating repeating Siyan's steps with Death Stranding. Other Discord users WIRED talked to say they were able to do so with games like Days Gone, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, The Sims 4, Cyberpunk 2077, Days Gone, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Gray Zone Warfare. Some say they even successfully used Garry's Mod, a game with slapstick physics and character models resembling something from a fever dream.

Discord has not yet responded to WIRED's request for comment.

Maimon says there are too many possible loopholes with age verification that people can slip through. “The industry is trying to find solutions to the issue of AI deepfakes and and and live AIs,” he says. That may mean relying on a combination of factors that look at a person's associated information like telephone numbers, addresses and more. “You need to rely more heavily on historical evidence for the existence of the individual,” Maimon says, “and put less of an emphasis on checkpoints like driver licenses, photos, livenessness tests, and so on.”

Maimon says that bad actors are adept at bypassing these kinds of technologies. “Criminals are always like 7 to 12 months ahead of us in terms of their ability to find vulnerabilities and bypass some of the technologies out there,” he says. Even without generative AI, people can still sell videos of their faces to pass age verification.

Even photo IDs aren't bulletproof. “The quality of a [fake] driver license—it's just impeccable,” Maimon says. All the watermarks, the UV lights, all the security, even the right plastic material on which the driver license is being printed on—even that criminals now have access to.”

For legitimate IDs, there's an issue with minors and who owns one. WIRED previously asked Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman about 13-year-olds—the minimum age for Roblox to unlock some of its features—that might not have government-issued IDs. “That is a problem,” Kaufman told WIRED at the time, adding that in North America and the United States, it's uncommon for people so young to have them.

“I'm hesitant to say that [photo ID] is a useful way to verify folks' age,” Maimon says, “simply because we have so much evidence suggesting that it doesn't work.”

There's also hesitance on behalf of users to hand over their IDs. “I don't trust the third party services that are being used with my data, especially with how damaging data leaks can be,” Ash says. “Most of the verification apps say that they don't hold your data for more than seven days and while that might be true there's no way for me to know for sure that they are telling the truth.”

There's a risk in handing over sensitive information to companies that request photo or ID verification. In July, Tea—an app where women can share their negative experiences with men—suffered a massive data breach that exposed thousands of women's photos used for verification; a second security issue, according to 404 Media, allowed hackers to access sensitive information like phone numbers, social media handles, and real names through user messages, which has been spread throughout forums like 4chan to dox and harass women.

People WIRED spoke to who have used video games to trick verification are against age verification. “Requiring people to give up facial information to access all the features of websites and apps like Discord and Bluesky is a massive overreach of what governments should be allowed to ask for digitally,” Ash says.

Furthermore, he's doubtful that such systems won't be exploited, whether it's by using video games or some other method. “I don't think that face scans are a useful way to verify age since people can easily look under their age and be incorrectly flagged as being under 18,” he says.

Antsy, the Discord user who passed verification with Arma 3, isn't convinced websites or platforms should be in charge of verifying ages. “All you are doing by putting these laws into place is pushing young people towards corners of the internet the government can't police,” he says. “If someone believes this is protecting children more than an active parent already would, I refuse to believe they are well versed in the corners of the internet outside of the Google home page or their child's life.”

A new Seattle startup is building a personal AI tutor that doesn't just give the answer but guides students through lessons, adapts to how they learn, appeals to their personal interests, and grows with them over time.

Wild Zebra, founded by edtech veteran Edan Shahar and longtime AI technologist Erik Selberg, uses AI to guide students through Socratic-style interactions — drawing out their thinking through guided questioning — while adapting to their interests, learning styles, and individual needs.

“We think the days of trains leaving Boston and going to Chicago are dead,” said Shahar, the company's CEO, referring to stodgy word problems. He explained that any subject can be taught using topics a student is already passionate about, such as sports or pop music.

Operating in stealth mode up to this point, the startup has already piloted its AI tutor in four schools, reaching more than 6,000 students with an initial focus on math and reading comprehension.

The feedback from teachers and administrators has exceeded expectations, Shahar said. Some educators have observed students becoming more focused and choosing to use the AI tutor outside of class time.

Building on its current school-based model, Shahar said Wild Zebra also plans to launch a direct-to-consumer version for students to use at home.

“So much of the conversation about AI has been around cheating,” Shahar said. “The reason for that is when you go to ChatGPT and you ask it a question, you expect an answer.”

While a wave of AI-powered learning tools have flooded the market, Wild Zebra is deliberately charting a different path. Rather than delivering quick solutions, its AI engages students in multi-turn conversations, asking questions that prompt reflection and reasoning. 

“A lot of our work is to make sure to not give away the answer,” he said.

When asked how Wild Zebra differentiates itself from established competitors like Khan Academy's Khanmigo, Shahar pointed to two key areas: 

As students interact with the system, the AI continually updates their learning profiles — surfacing gaps in understanding that may trace back years, while enabling more advanced learners to progress at their own pace.

Wild Zebra recently raised $2 million in funding to build on that early traction, expand its school partnerships, and prepare for a broader rollout. The startup has eight employees. It's not yet generating revenue. The company plans to introduce an implementation fee for schools starting in the fall of 2025 but has not yet decided on final pricing for its platform. 

The idea for Wild Zebra emerged in mid-2024, after Shahar, who previously co-founded the travel-tech startup Utrip and served for nearly a decade as CEO of edtech company Test Innovators, returned from helping lead Israel's national quantum computing initiative. 

He connected with Selberg — a veteran technologist whose career spans leadership roles at eBay, Grab, and Microsoft — through Docusign co-founder Court Lorenzini, a startup advisor. Selberg, who also co-created the MetaCrawler search engine in the early days of the web, brought deep experience in large-scale AI infrastructure and machine learning systems.

Behind the scenes, the system draws on multiple large language models depending on the context — a flexible, privacy-conscious architecture that Shahar said was shaped by Selberg's experience. This multi-model approach is also key to ensuring accuracy and preventing the AI from hallucinating or otherwise teaching incorrect information.

Selberg has “been working in AI since before it was cool,” with a “deep understanding of what problems AI can and can't solve, and how to think about the shifting landscape,” Shahar said. 

Delivered as a web-based application, Wild Zebra's AI tutor starts by assessing each student's skills, a process enhanced through a key partnership with the Educational Records Bureau (ERB), an investor in the company. 

Access to ERB's anonymized student trajectory data helps the AI understand where a student is on their learning journey. From there, the AI guides students through conversations designed to promote reasoning rather than simply providing answers. 

As students engage, the system adapts dynamically — adjusting its pace and pulling in relevant examples based on each student's preferences and interests.

Teachers remain part of the loop through a dashboard that tracks student progress and flags areas where additional support may be needed. In that way, it's designed to solve what Shahar calls one of their biggest challenges: tailoring the learning experience to individual students. 

He envisions the Wild Zebra AI as a virtual “learning specialist sitting with each and every student.” This specialist can identify whether a student is bored and needs a greater challenge or has a learning gap that needs to be filled. Those insights are then reported to the teacher's dashboard, allowing them to provide targeted small-group support where it's needed most.

Shahar said the startup is a watershed moment in his own journey, as well. 

“It does feel like everything I've worked on in my life has led to this point — building companies, working in education, being a student myself,” he said. “I don't know if a lot of people get that visceral feeling, but I'm getting it right now, and it's awesome.”

American sports fans know the showmanship and excitement Super Bowl Sunday brings. Considered a de facto national holiday, the event sets up a flourish of fanfare and high stakes competition– weeks-long anticipation, sunrise tailgaters in front of the stadium, at-home gatherings around the television, music thumping, flags waving, fans cheering, fit athletes on the largest stage, must-watch halftime entertainment, bragging rights, trophies, confetti, celebrations that go well into the night, parades that take place in the heart of the winning city. Needless to say, if you like American football, the Super Bowl is the apex – and you never want to miss a moment.

Now, imagine that excitement, that anticipation, that joy, those festivities every single day in the span of just over a month.

CEO and Secretary General of U.S. Soccer JT Batson said that's what Americans can expect next summer when the FIFA World Cup arrives in the United States. The U.S. Soccer executive was a featured guest on the latest episode of Building Bridges, a video podcast hosted by Michael Hershman.

“The scale, the fans, the atmosphere is going to be incredible,” he said. “And it's not just about the games. It's also about the parties and the fan fest outside of the games. We're going to have a little bit longer than a month of essentially multiple Super Bowls every day, all across the United States, Canada and Mexico.”

While North American countries Mexico and Canada serve alongside the U.S. as co-hosts, about 75-85 percent of the matches will be played on American soil, including all matches in the latter stages: 

For Batson, an Atlanta native who grew up playing, coaching and refereeing soccer, the scale and opportunity of the moment is not lost on him. The World Cup, which occurs every four years, is already the premier tournament in the sport worldwide. With the field expanding to 48 teams for the first time in 2026, the global event will attract billions.

The United States is well-equipped to handle that enormous scale with stable infrastructure. Airports, hotels, roads and public transportation are in place in all 11 American host cities to accommodate millions that will be arriving to the country. And those numbers aren't underrated. The only other time the United States has hosted a World Cup was in 1994. In that edition, 24 nations competed. And to this day, it's the largest-attended tournament in World Cup history.





Another legacy of the 1994 World Cup is that it created a world-class professional soccer league here in the United States. Major League Soccer is thriving to this day, and the United States will once again have the chance to create more opportunities to grow the sport and make soccer more accessible to more Americans in 2026.

This commitment to access is a priority in U.S. Soccer's overall belief that soccer is more than a sport; it's a force for good. Batson says the key is making sure the federation invests in the sport at all levels. For example, U.S. Soccer has more disability national teams than any other country in the world.

“[We have] a very strong commitment to everyone who wants to play soccer in this country,” Batson said. “We'revery focused on making sure everyone in America can play soccer. We believe soccer is a force for good. It makes communities healthier, happier and more connected. The opportunity to bring soccer to more places and using big events to do things like that is something we're very passionate about.”

Enter Soccer Forward, the campaign at U.S. Soccer dedicated to making soccer available to everyone – no matter the place, age or skill level. Every time a fan buys a U.S. Soccer scarf or a ticket to a senior team match, part of the sale goes toward the campaign's mission of building healthier and more connected communities.

“Every American who is part of that, we say thank you. We're excited to do you proud,” Batson said.

While 2026 will be all about men's soccer, Batson is also looking ahead to the future of women's soccer. The U.S. Women's National Team is the top women's sports entity in the world and generates more income than any other women's team – and they'll have the chance to display why in 2027 and 2031 during the upcoming FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments.

Currently, the United States is the sole bid to host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. Similar to the men's tournament next summer, 2031 will be the first time the Women's World Cup welcomes a field of 48 teams. Essentially, between 2026 and potentially 2031, the United States would play host to the biggest tournament in men's and women's soccer in a short span of five years.

“Women's sports is a big business, and they're a great example of that,” Batson said.

The Building Bridges podcast focuses on connection and finding what unites us, which is a goal U.S. Soccer is aiming for, too, beyond the World Cup. On theme with his podcast, Hershman finished his conversation with Batson talking about his hope that, even in a divisive world filled with conflict and tension, the World Cup next summer will not be fraught with hate or politics. He is optimistic that the tournament will be peaceful, respectful and a celebration that shows the world soccer is for everybody.

Batson agreed whole-heartedly that what makes soccer special is the way it brings people together. In fact, he ended the podcast with a charge to his fellow U.S. Soccer fans, one they can keep in mind as they're buying tickets for next summer – go to a game that the U.S. isn't playing in. Experience a different culture, watch a different style of play. He says it will be something to remember forever.

“One of the great benefits of the World Cup being here in 2026 and in 2031 is that we're going to see so many incredible cultures from around the world come together to celebrate their culture and share that with us.”

Ben Shelton defeated compatriot Taylor Fritz on Wednesday, advancing to his first Masters 1000 final.

After defeating Washington Open champion Alex de Minaur in straight sets, Shelton produced a fine display to dispatch Fritz, winning 6-4 6-3.

The big-serving American will now face Karen Khachanov in the Canadian Open final after the Russian defeated top seed Alexander Zverev in the other semi-final match.

Shelton broke into the ATP top 10 for the first time earlier this year and has followed up this breakthrough by producing a consistent stream of high-level performances in Toronto.

With his victory over Fritz, Shelton confirmed his status as one of the world's best players, while putting himself in the same conversation with Pete Sampras.

Ben Shelton made American tennis history on Wednesday night.

As per OptaAce, Ben Shelton is the youngest American to achieve successive ATP top 10 wins in an ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final and semi-final since Pete Sampras.

Shelton was aged 22 years and 291 days when he achieved the feat on Thursday night.

Meanwhile, Sampras was aged 20 years and 364 days when he achieved the feat at the 1992 Cincinnati Open.

2 – Ben Shelton (22y 291d) is the youngest American to achieve successive ATP top 10 wins in an ATP Masters 1000 QF and SF since Pete Sampras (20y 364d) in Cincinnati in 1992. Wow.#NBO25 | @NBOtoronto @atptour @ATPMediaInfo

If Shelton can go on to have a career anything like Sampras', he will have achieved a great deal in the sport. After all, Sampras is a 14-time Grand Slam singles champion.

The 22-year-old will hope to create further history against Karen Khachanov on Thursday night. The pair have met one time previously on the ATP Tour, at the 2025 Indian Wells tournament: a match Shelton won in straight sets, 6-3 7-5.

As per the ATP Live Rankings, Ben Shelton is on 3,970 ATP points. If he defeats Khachanov on Thursday night, the American would overtake Novak Djokovic in the ATP rankings.

Djokovic is currently on 4,130 points. A victory over Khachanov would see Shelton climb to 4,320 points and into the world number six spot.

This would certainly be a monumental achievement if realised. Not many players can say they have been ranked above Novak Djokovic while he is still near his best.

Meanwhile, Karen Khachanov has already risen four places to number 12 in the world. If he defeats Shelton, the Russian would rise to world number eight.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

But it wasn't going to be easy. The conditions in Canada—fast courts, fast balls—were a recipe for inconsistency and frustration, and we saw that from a lot of players. So it makes sense that the finalists, Shelton and Khachanov seem like the last two survivors on the island. Shelton won two of his matches 7-6 in the third set, and Khachanov did the same against Alexander Zverev in the semifinals on Wednesday night.“When I came here I didn't like the conditions,” Khachanov said with a laugh on Wednesday. “I can say it now. But that's all about adjusting and adapting. I think tennis is all about that.”

For Shelton, the satisfaction comes from surviving the close ones.“Finding a way to get through those tough matches where I'm down a break in the third, or the other guy's serving for the match where I could be out of the tournament, those are the ones that are really special for me,” he said.This will be Shelton's first Masters 1000 final, and Khachanov's second—his first was seven years ago. But their recent form makes their success here feel like less than a total surprise. They were both quarterfinalists at Wimbledon, and Shelton made the semis at the Citi Open two weeks ago. Each is 6-foot-4 or above, and each has the right game for a fast hard court in this day and age: Big serve, heavy topspin forehands, consistent two-handed backhands, an ability to attack and close at net.They've played once before, earlier this year in Indian Wells, and Shelton won 6-3, 7-5. I'd say Khachanov is, or was, more solid from the baseline, but that day Shelton was the more creative player, and was one shot ahead of the Russian in the rallies.

Since then, the American has only improved, in virtually every area. Once upon a time, Shelton's game looked like a serve and a prayer, but no more. In his last two matches, he has played guys who are normally steadier from the back court, Alex de Minaur and Taylor Fritz, but it was Shelton was won most of the protracted rallies. By the time he faced Fritz in the semis, Shelton was in the zone, and he played circles around his higher-ranked countryman.“Playing back-to-back guys like Demon and Taylor, and having so much success in the long rallies like the stats showed, is a big confidence-builder for me,” Shelton said.Shelton said he had everything “clicking” against Fritz. He looked that way for much of Wimbledon and D.C., but then the clicking stopped. Can the 22-year-old maintain his top level a little longer this time, and take the next step up by winning his first Masters 1000? The conditions, in his case, seem right. Winner: Shelton
