                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American sports fans know the showmanship and excitement Super Bowl Sunday brings. Needless to say, if you like American football, the Super Bowl is the apex – and you never want to miss a moment. CEO and Secretary General of U.S. Soccer JT Batson said that's what Americans can expect next summer when the FIFA World Cup arrives in the United States. The U.S. Soccer executive was a featured guest on the latest episode of Building Bridges, a video podcast hosted by Michael Hershman. We're going to have a little bit longer than a month of essentially multiple Super Bowls every day, all across the United States, Canada and Mexico.” While North American countries Mexico and Canada serve alongside the U.S. as co-hosts, about 75-85 percent of the matches will be played on American soil, including all matches in the latter stages: For Batson, an Atlanta native who grew up playing, coaching and refereeing soccer, the scale and opportunity of the moment is not lost on him. The United States is well-equipped to handle that enormous scale with stable infrastructure. Airports, hotels, roads and public transportation are in place in all 11 American host cities to accommodate millions that will be arriving to the country. And to this day, it's the largest-attended tournament in World Cup history. Another legacy of the 1994 World Cup is that it created a world-class professional soccer league here in the United States. For example, U.S. Soccer has more disability national teams than any other country in the world. “[We have] a very strong commitment to everyone who wants to play soccer in this country,” Batson said. “We'revery focused on making sure everyone in America can play soccer. We believe soccer is a force for good. It makes communities healthier, happier and more connected. “Every American who is part of that, we say thank you. We're excited to do you proud,” Batson said. While 2026 will be all about men's soccer, Batson is also looking ahead to the future of women's soccer. Essentially, between 2026 and potentially 2031, the United States would play host to the biggest tournament in men's and women's soccer in a short span of five years. The Building Bridges podcast focuses on connection and finding what unites us, which is a goal U.S. Soccer is aiming for, too, beyond the World Cup. On theme with his podcast, Hershman finished his conversation with Batson talking about his hope that, even in a divisive world filled with conflict and tension, the World Cup next summer will not be fraught with hate or politics. He is optimistic that the tournament will be peaceful, respectful and a celebration that shows the world soccer is for everybody. Batson agreed whole-heartedly that what makes soccer special is the way it brings people together. In fact, he ended the podcast with a charge to his fellow U.S. Soccer fans, one they can keep in mind as they're buying tickets for next summer – go to a game that the U.S. isn't playing in. He says it will be something to remember forever. “One of the great benefits of the World Cup being here in 2026 and in 2031 is that we're going to see so many incredible cultures from around the world come together to celebrate their culture and share that with us.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's performance at the Club World Cup seems to have really convinced their former striker Tony Cascarino. They also got their hands on the Conference League trophy, so enjoying success in the cup competitions has not really been too much of a problem for the Blues in recent years. Cascarino, though, thinks they can do better than that. Speaking on talkSPORT, Cascarino said: “It was interesting when they won the Club World Cup because again we talked about this. “They weren't good enough to win the league last season. I think they can be challengers this year. At one stage, it looked like Sanchez would not be Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper in the new season. Earlier in the summer, Chelsea had been chasing Mike Maignan. Sanchez's goalkeeping as a whole was very questionable last term. In total, he made five errors leading to goal. No shot-stopper in the Premier League made more. The 27-year-old also made four errors that resulted in a chance for the opposition, so there is clearly much room for improvement. If Sanchez can reduce the above, though, then perhaps Chelsea can do better than fourth place this time around.</p>

The Paris Saint-Germain winger and two of his treble-winning team-mates have been inexplicably left off the shortlist for the men's prize

The Ballon d'Or never fails to create controversy. Rather amusingly, Real Madrid even refused to turn up for last year's ceremony after being upset by the just decision to give the prize to Rodri over Vinicius Jr. 

The award is, by its very nature, contradictory, in that it champions individualism in a team sport, while the inherently subjective nature of the voting is always bound to provoke a backlash. Ballon d'Or recognition has become a very important marketing tool in the modern game, though, so whenever a player is the victim of a perceived snub, it generates a lot of headlines.

So, which stars will be reeling after being left off the list of nominees for this year's Ballon d'Or - and its plethora of other prizes? GOAL runs through the most notable oversights below...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raul Asensio is no longer in Xabi Alonso's plans for next season. According to Defensa Central, Alonso does not see Asensio as part of his defense, where names like Rudiger, Militao and Huijsen are in the foreground. Although Asencio gained minutes under Carlo Ancelotti, he has already fallen down the pecking order. Last season gave him the opportunity to play, especially in Militao's absence. Los Blancos would allow the defender to leave if an offer of around 35 million euros came in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid are more than well-known for doing astute business in the transfer market. They include so many special clauses in their Castilla players' contracts that get them some amount of profit, adding up to a lot over time. They are also very good at selling players just before their peak ends, as was seen with Raphael Varane and Casemiro in the past. Even Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't quite the same when he left the club in 2018, but I guess that was also because of different reasons. Real Madrid sold Nico Paz to Como last season, and included a 50% sell-on clause that would get them half the transfer fee for any club Paz is sold to from Como, if that ever happens. Gianluca Di Marzio just reported that Spurs put a bid of 40 million euros on the table for Paz, but Como rejected the offer. Real Madrid, if Como had accepted it, would have received half the transfer fee, which comes down to 20 million euros. Obviously, they would lose out on their rights over Paz, but they would have made a fat profit on the player. I don't know just how much need there is for Paz at Real Madrid anymore. He is an unbelievably talented player - no doubt about that - but they already have so many players fighting for the same minutes Paz will take up. Arda Guler, Franco Mastantuono, Rodrygo, Brahim Diaz are players who are probably going to take that one spot in the starting lineup or off the bench. Paz is too talented to sit on the bench, and if Real Madrid hadn't signed Mastantuono, then it would've made complete sense to bring him back. Hopefully, either there is a place for him in the future, or he forces a place in the squad with his performances. Worst case, Real Madrid will make a big profit as soon as Como are ready to sell - whenever that is. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herculez Gomez reacts to Johnny Cardoso's move to Atletico Madrid after the USMNT midfielder completes the transfer for a reported fee of €30M (1:40) Mind you, there have been times when the outline of said roster has looked more like a funhouse mirror than a perfectly rendered image. Some seized their opportunity and will get further looks, while others will have little to no shot at making the 26-player roster next summer. But U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to cope with the hand he's been dealt, and -- knock on wood -- the American player pool is at least beginning to heal up, likely giving him more options going forward. With that in mind, here is latest look at a projected roster for 2026, with some room at the end for those on the outside looking in. Turner's return to MLS from Europe looks like a retreat, but moving back to New England should give him something been lacking ever since he left the Revs in 2022: steady playing time. But Pochettino has made it clear that performances matter, and Turner will need to deliver at club level if he's to reclaim his starting spot with the USMNT. Freese boosted his stock with some solid performances at the Gold Cup, which included outdueling Costa Rica legend Keylor Navas in a penalty shootout. There were mistakes, including a giveaway that led to a goal against Haiti, and that is something he'll need to clean up. Suffice to say, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open, and now that Turner is back in MLS, Freese's performances will be compared on a weekly basis. Steffen looked poised to get some playing time at the Gold Cup, only for a knee injury to scuttle his opportunity. Staying healthy is the single biggest issue holding Steffen back. The New York City native had a successful first season in Ligue 1 with Toulouse, but he has yet to translate that into consistency with the Americans. McKenzie looked to have earned Pochettino's trust following the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal round against Jamaica, but subsequent performances against Canada, Turkey and Switzerland saw him fall out of favor. Few defenders in the United States pool provide as imposing of a physical presence as Carter-Vickers, but he needs a refined passer beside him. Since then, there have been shaky outings in the Copa America and Nations League. He's a player Pochettino knows well given their brief overlap at Tottenham Hotspur. Can CCV make more of an impression in the time that's left? He hasn't quite gotten back to that pre-injury level and had just a few cameos at the Gold Cup, but he has been solid for FCC, and his ability to cover space behind the defense remains a strong suit. Robinson is another mainstay who appears to be on his way back after having knee surgery earlier this summer. Scally was one of the players conspicuous by his absence at the Gold Cup, but his experience -- he has made more than 120 Bundesliga appearances -- is difficult to overlook. That said, his lack of impact going forward means he could find himself under pressure from any one of the young crew of full backs who have suited up for the Americans in the past year. Wiley wasn't included in the Gold Cup, but his numbers last year on loan with Watford showed marked improvement on the defensive side of the ball with both his duel and aerial percentage over 60%. His second season with the Hornets will give him an opportunity to show off more of his ability in that area. That said, Adams remains one of the key U.S. players and if healthy -- no guarantee given his injury history -- he'll be on the roster next summer. One would expect him to be on the roster next summer, but Pochettino has let it be known that reputations will count for little, and McKennie will need to prove once again that he deserves to be in the starting XI. At club level, he's proved to be a player that can knit the game together from a deep-lying position, so much so that Atlético manager Diego Simeone made it a priority to bring Cardoso to his side this summer. Injury prevented Cardoso from having any kind of impact at the Gold Cup and he remains a solid squad pick for now, but at some point, he'll need to start producing for the U.S. The San Diego midfielder's ability to keep possession on a team that at times struggles in that regard is a valuable trait to have. His spot seems a bit vulnerable, however, and he'll need to keep excelling at club level. Tessmann was another head-scratching omission earlier this summer, given that he seemed to have won Pochettino over during the early days of his tenure. The only question surrounding Pulisic is the extent to which his relationship with Pochettino needs to be mended after he publicly backed the U.S. manager into a corner over his offer to play in two friendlies last summer. The reality is there's too much at stake for a rapprochement not to happen. Tillman was another player who benefited from an extended run at the Gold Cup, even as he became a target for physical play by opponents. Now he's taking a big step up at club level, moving to German powerhouse Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven. That said, there are still a few players to move past in order to make the starting XI when the full team is together. Luna has become a Pochettino favorite given his creativity, toughness and ability to play out of tight spaces. He popped up for some vital goals too, including two in the Gold Cup semifinal triumph over Guatemala. A difficult Gold Cup final against Mexico showed there's still room for growth. An injury-riddled campaign that included shoulder surgery meant that Balogun hasn't suited up for the USMNT at all in 2025, but with no other U.S. forward stepping up to claim the starting spot, Balogun is still -- marginally -- the front-runner. Pepi is another U.S. forward who was felled by injury during the last club season, with knee surgery ending his season prematurely. With longtime club foil Luuk de Jong know having left PSV for FC Porto, there should be more of an opportunity for Pepi to get playing time with the Dutch giants. That could be enough for a player who just missed out on the 2022 World Cup to become mainstay with the USMNT. Ricardo Pepi looks back on his five-month injury absence as he prepares to return to PSV in time for the new season. It's a familiar tale with these forwards: Sargent's club form also hasn't yet translated to international level. After turning down a move to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, Sargent looks set to spend another season in the English Championship, where he's had success in the past, but is Pochettino willing to give Sargent another chance? Agyemang showed flashes of ability in the Gold Cup, but there are also parts of his game -- primarily his touch -- that look raw. Wright is another player set to spend time in the English Championship, and he'll be looking to improve on the 12 goals he scored last season. An untimely injury forced Schulte off the Gold Cup roster, otherwise it might have been him getting time in the tournament instead of Freese. With other keepers such as Steffen getting back into form, the window of opportunity looks to be closing for Schulte. Trusty is one of those players where you wonder why he hasn't been given more of a chance with the U.S., given that he has both Premier League and UEFA Champions League experience. To be clear, not all of those experiences were positive, and includes a relegation with Sheffield United, but Trusty was a steady contributor during Celtic's double-winning campaign in 2024-25, and at age 26, he's entering his prime years. As such, Arfsten struggled defensively early in the tournament, but got better with each game. He even tallied his first U.S. goal against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. He faces a bit of a logjam at right back behind Dest and Scally, but his steady defensive play as well as his ability to get forward could see him make a late challenge for the final roster. If not, he figures to get chances later in his career. Once part of the vaunted "MMA" midfield with McKennie and Adams, Musah has seen his stock fall for both club and country. Last season Musah fell out of favor at Milan, and his appearances under Pochettino saw him deployed as a wingback rather than his usual spot in the center of midfield. Musah asked out of the Gold Cup for personal reasons. A settled club situation will aid Musah's way back, with Napoli and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested, but new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has experimented with Musah in multiple positions. His time at San Siro might not be over yet. Zendejas' omission is puzzling given his form for América, for whom he scored seven goals in 19 league and playoff appearances during last spring's Clausura. Reyna's descent from supernova prospect to nearly forgotten man is well documented. If he can get out of Dortmund and land in a spot where he can get playing time, then there's hope. Otherwise, next summer's World Cup will pass him by. That said, he's another performer who has a lot of players to climb over if he's going to get into the full roster. Downs is another forward who offers up impressive size and strength. Those traits will be put to good use in the English Championship with Southampton. Downs would seem to be in direct competition with Agyemang, and with the latter player now with Derby (not to mention Sargent at Norwich) there will be direct comparisons in terms of their performances.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herculez Gomez reacts to Johnny Cardoso's move to Atletico Madrid after the USMNT midfielder completes the transfer for a reported fee of €30M (1:40) Mind you, there have been times when the outline of said roster has looked more like a funhouse mirror than a perfectly rendered image. Some seized their opportunity and will get further looks, while others will have little to no shot at making the 26-player roster next summer. But U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to cope with the hand he's been dealt, and -- knock on wood -- the American player pool is at least beginning to heal up, likely giving him more options going forward. With that in mind, here is latest look at a projected roster for 2026, with some room at the end for those on the outside looking in. Turner's return to MLS from Europe looks like a retreat, but moving back to New England should give him something been lacking ever since he left the Revs in 2022: steady playing time. But Pochettino has made it clear that performances matter, and Turner will need to deliver at club level if he's to reclaim his starting spot with the USMNT. Freese boosted his stock with some solid performances at the Gold Cup, which included outdueling Costa Rica legend Keylor Navas in a penalty shootout. There were mistakes, including a giveaway that led to a goal against Haiti, and that is something he'll need to clean up. Suffice to say, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open, and now that Turner is back in MLS, Freese's performances will be compared on a weekly basis. Steffen looked poised to get some playing time at the Gold Cup, only for a knee injury to scuttle his opportunity. Staying healthy is the single biggest issue holding Steffen back. The New York City native had a successful first season in Ligue 1 with Toulouse, but he has yet to translate that into consistency with the Americans. McKenzie looked to have earned Pochettino's trust following the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal round against Jamaica, but subsequent performances against Canada, Turkey and Switzerland saw him fall out of favor. Few defenders in the United States pool provide as imposing of a physical presence as Carter-Vickers, but he needs a refined passer beside him. Since then, there have been shaky outings in the Copa America and Nations League. He's a player Pochettino knows well given their brief overlap at Tottenham Hotspur. Can CCV make more of an impression in the time that's left? He hasn't quite gotten back to that pre-injury level and had just a few cameos at the Gold Cup, but he has been solid for FCC, and his ability to cover space behind the defense remains a strong suit. Robinson is another mainstay who appears to be on his way back after having knee surgery earlier this summer. Scally was one of the players conspicuous by his absence at the Gold Cup, but his experience -- he has made more than 120 Bundesliga appearances -- is difficult to overlook. That said, his lack of impact going forward means he could find himself under pressure from any one of the young crew of full backs who have suited up for the Americans in the past year. Wiley wasn't included in the Gold Cup, but his numbers last year on loan with Watford showed marked improvement on the defensive side of the ball with both his duel and aerial percentage over 60%. His second season with the Hornets will give him an opportunity to show off more of his ability in that area. That said, Adams remains one of the key U.S. players and if healthy -- no guarantee given his injury history -- he'll be on the roster next summer. One would expect him to be on the roster next summer, but Pochettino has let it be known that reputations will count for little, and McKennie will need to prove once again that he deserves to be in the starting XI. At club level, he's proved to be a player that can knit the game together from a deep-lying position, so much so that Atlético manager Diego Simeone made it a priority to bring Cardoso to his side this summer. Injury prevented Cardoso from having any kind of impact at the Gold Cup and he remains a solid squad pick for now, but at some point, he'll need to start producing for the U.S. The San Diego midfielder's ability to keep possession on a team that at times struggles in that regard is a valuable trait to have. His spot seems a bit vulnerable, however, and he'll need to keep excelling at club level. Tessmann was another head-scratching omission earlier this summer, given that he seemed to have won Pochettino over during the early days of his tenure. The only question surrounding Pulisic is the extent to which his relationship with Pochettino needs to be mended after he publicly backed the U.S. manager into a corner over his offer to play in two friendlies last summer. The reality is there's too much at stake for a rapprochement not to happen. Tillman was another player who benefited from an extended run at the Gold Cup, even as he became a target for physical play by opponents. Now he's taking a big step up at club level, moving to German powerhouse Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven. That said, there are still a few players to move past in order to make the starting XI when the full team is together. Luna has become a Pochettino favorite given his creativity, toughness and ability to play out of tight spaces. He popped up for some vital goals too, including two in the Gold Cup semifinal triumph over Guatemala. A difficult Gold Cup final against Mexico showed there's still room for growth. An injury-riddled campaign that included shoulder surgery meant that Balogun hasn't suited up for the USMNT at all in 2025, but with no other U.S. forward stepping up to claim the starting spot, Balogun is still -- marginally -- the front-runner. Pepi is another U.S. forward who was felled by injury during the last club season, with knee surgery ending his season prematurely. With longtime club foil Luuk de Jong know having left PSV for FC Porto, there should be more of an opportunity for Pepi to get playing time with the Dutch giants. That could be enough for a player who just missed out on the 2022 World Cup to become mainstay with the USMNT. Ricardo Pepi looks back on his five-month injury absence as he prepares to return to PSV in time for the new season. It's a familiar tale with these forwards: Sargent's club form also hasn't yet translated to international level. After turning down a move to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, Sargent looks set to spend another season in the English Championship, where he's had success in the past, but is Pochettino willing to give Sargent another chance? Agyemang showed flashes of ability in the Gold Cup, but there are also parts of his game -- primarily his touch -- that look raw. Wright is another player set to spend time in the English Championship, and he'll be looking to improve on the 12 goals he scored last season. An untimely injury forced Schulte off the Gold Cup roster, otherwise it might have been him getting time in the tournament instead of Freese. With other keepers such as Steffen getting back into form, the window of opportunity looks to be closing for Schulte. Trusty is one of those players where you wonder why he hasn't been given more of a chance with the U.S., given that he has both Premier League and UEFA Champions League experience. To be clear, not all of those experiences were positive, and includes a relegation with Sheffield United, but Trusty was a steady contributor during Celtic's double-winning campaign in 2024-25, and at age 26, he's entering his prime years. As such, Arfsten struggled defensively early in the tournament, but got better with each game. He even tallied his first U.S. goal against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. He faces a bit of a logjam at right back behind Dest and Scally, but his steady defensive play as well as his ability to get forward could see him make a late challenge for the final roster. If not, he figures to get chances later in his career. Once part of the vaunted "MMA" midfield with McKennie and Adams, Musah has seen his stock fall for both club and country. Last season Musah fell out of favor at Milan, and his appearances under Pochettino saw him deployed as a wingback rather than his usual spot in the center of midfield. Musah asked out of the Gold Cup for personal reasons. A settled club situation will aid Musah's way back, with Napoli and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested, but new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has experimented with Musah in multiple positions. His time at San Siro might not be over yet. Zendejas' omission is puzzling given his form for América, for whom he scored seven goals in 19 league and playoff appearances during last spring's Clausura. Reyna's descent from supernova prospect to nearly forgotten man is well documented. If he can get out of Dortmund and land in a spot where he can get playing time, then there's hope. Otherwise, next summer's World Cup will pass him by. That said, he's another performer who has a lot of players to climb over if he's going to get into the full roster. Downs is another forward who offers up impressive size and strength. Those traits will be put to good use in the English Championship with Southampton. Downs would seem to be in direct competition with Agyemang, and with the latter player now with Derby (not to mention Sargent at Norwich) there will be direct comparisons in terms of their performances.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— The now-iconic shuttlecocks that adorn the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art's lawn weren't always beloved, but they will be looking their best for a global audience next summer. “In 1994, they may have caused a little bit of consternation — people raised some eyebrows, ‘Was this art?'" said Stephanie Fox Knappe, the museum's Sanders Sosland senior curator. Few cityscapes are more distinctly associated with Kansas City today than Coosje van Bruggen and Claes Oldenburg's shuttlecocks, which were commissioned by the Sosland Foundation. “They (van Bruggen and Oldenburg) had free rein. So they looked at this museum, this formidable neoclassical facade and the great 22-acre lawn, and thought, ‘Wow, this would be an amazing place to create the effect of a badminton match that was interrupted with the birdies left all over the lawn. It takes a herculean effort to keep the oversized shuttlecocks — each stands more than 19 feet tall with a diameter of nearly 16 feet — pristine. The one closest to Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard on the museum's south lawn was removed in October 2024, repainted and reinstalled last winter. Every 500-pound feather needs to be taken off, then they roll off the lawn to an industrial painting company here in the Kansas City area. The region's climate — rainy springs, scorching summers, wind-swept falls and icy winters — takes a toll on outdoor artwork, so chipping, cracked and weathered paint is to be expected. It's quite a departure from their controversial beginnings. “Now, they've become a symbol, not only of the Nelson-Atkins treasures, but also Kansas City," Fox Knappe said. Visitors like Alexis Colosky, who stopped in Kansas City on a road trip from Colorado to Ohio, flock to the museum's lawn daily for photo ops with the nearly 20-foot-tall shuttlecocks. This is one of the Kansas City stops that I'm going to remember.” The father and son are making their way from Fresno, California, to mid-Missouri for a youth writing retreat. “I'd never heard about it before, but we played badminton quite a bit during COVID in our backyard, so I thought it would be fun to see.” Tosh, a high school math teacher, took pictures of Colson next to the fully restored shuttlecock and laughed at the idea of sending them home to students who play on his school's badminton team. “The photo on Google made it look big,” he said. Colosky agreed: “It definitely feels a little crazy being right next to it and realizing, holy crap, this thing is a really tall thing. “I think now we'd be more surprised if a major event happening in Kansas City didn't feature the shuttlecocks here at the Nelson-Atkins,” Fox Knappe said. Next year, they'll look fresh for the World Cup's worldwide audience. “Certainly, with the World Cup on the horizon here in Kansas City — so proud to be a host site — we definitely want everything at the museum to be looking great,” Fox Knappe said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kansas City Police Department is creating a “strong security posture” for the FIFA World Cup 26, deploying thousands of law enforcement officers as it prepares for 650,000 international visitors descending during a hot Midwestern summer and imbibing through 23-hour-a-day alcohol sales. Working for the past year and a half, KCPD is building “scalable plans,” for use on crowd sizes at different games, the cultural considerations brought by international fans, and hosting ticket-holders who will be made up mostly of men ages 18-39, the largest group of FIFA's fan base. KCPD officers will be barred from taking vacation time, reserves will be on duty, police and sheriffs' deputies from Missouri and Kansas are being called up, and the National Guard will be activated for the event, from June 11 to July 19. Mounted patrols will be brought in from other police agencies, the Missouri State Highway Patrol will provide helicopters, and a new program using drones as first responders will be implemented, KCPD Major Abigail Martinez said. Martinez said they want to keep the same patrols in place for all the events they normally cover, like Royals baseball games, KC Current soccer games or downtown concerts. And the department has consulted with officials in Atlanta, where the city hosts summer events, as they are considered experts in handling heat emergencies. Open containers will be allowed at the FIFA Fan Festival at the National WW1 Museum grounds, and in the entertainment districts where it is already OK, like at Power & Light and Westport, Martinez said. Still to be determined is how to grapple with the issue of young fans from Europe who are allowed to drink in public venues at home, some as early as 16 or 18 years old. “We are used to 21 and over, others (countries) are not,” said Major Michelle Hon, commander of the North Patrol Division. That's a change from some of the city's larger outdoors events, like the 2024 Super Bowl parade and rally, where one woman was killed and 23 injured, and the city has been sued for what the lawsuit alleges was a lack of proper precautions. Although police have staffed events at Arrowhead for years, they are changing their plans for the games there, as soccer has a different culture, with fans bringing flags, drums and other things into the stadium, Martinez said. “It's going to be a whole different look,” Martinez said of security at Arrowhead. Shuttles will be running to Arrowhead and to practices at Children's Mercy Park and CPKC Stadium, home of the KC Current, among other venues, Martinez said. The city has leased 200 coach buses to be able to ferry fans to stadiums, the fan fest, and other entertainment and shopping areas, like Zona Rosa in north Kansas City, she said. Other concerns for the department include the city's troubled 911 system, which has often been under-staffed and had long wait times, and the lack of a new jail, a long-term issue the city and Jackson County have failed to settle. In May, city council began the process of building a temporary facility, which would be completed before the World Cup. Plans are also being made to possibly create a temporary designated camping site for those fans who come to town without booking hotels or making other arrangements, Campbell said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Because Xabi Alonso's side competed at the Club World Cup, their 2024-25 season ended up being extended until July 9, when they lost 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. On Monday, Madrid's players returned for work at the club's Valdebebas training ground. So, what's the plan for this atypical season start, and will having played at the Club World Cup be a help or a hindrance? Here, The Athletic explains what's next for Alonso's new side before they start their La Liga campaign on August 19 at home to Osasuna. Resting, or at least getting as much rest as is typical of a professional athlete during their summer holidays. After exiting the Club World Cup, Madrid's players were given time off. They all took advantage of this break to have a holiday. Both also had time to visit Ibiza, as have other team-mates such as Thibaut Courtois, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior. Others opted for more exotic destinations, such as Dani Ceballos, who visited Soneva, an island resort in the Maldives. As for new manager Xabi Alonso, he spent time back in Guipuzkoa, the Basque province of northern Spain where he grew up. But the 43-year-old remained in regular contact with his staff to plan and evaluate the team's return to work and what comes next. During the holidays, each player was sent a specific training plan designed by the club's specialists, as is usual. In many cases, this plan was designed to complement the work of their personal trainers, who were also in contact with Madrid. Madrid actually wanted to postpone their first La Liga match of the new season against Osasuna, arguing that they needed more rest after progressing into the Club World Cup's latter stages. The decision did not go down well at Madrid, with the club's official TV channel launching an angry response this week. The Osasuna game will take place a little later than might have been previously expected, however. Since then, individual and group exercise in the gym has been combined with ball work on the training fields, mixing focus on possession, finishing, dribbling and small-sided matches. One of the main differences in Madrid's physical preparation between now and last season is a greater focus on field work, rather than the specific individual strength work Antonio Pintus favoured when he was in charge of fitness training. Several changes have been made to the medical staff, too, after a spate of injuries last season. Two of Madrid's new permanent physical trainers employed this summer, Javier Arnaiz and Ismael Fernandez, also favour new techniques such as coordinating muscle training based on the body's temperature. Madrid now plan to continue training at Valdebebas until they travel to Innsbruck, Austria, for a friendly match against top-flight side WSG Tirol next Tuesday (at 7pm local time). According to staff sources — who, like all those cited here, asked to speak anonymously as they did not have permission to comment — arranging the match was not suggested by the coaching team. Madrid do not plan to stay in Austria for a training camp. It would not have been surprising — and, in fact, a club source mentioned it as a possibility for this summer — for Madrid to face local teams such as Getafe or Leganes behind closed doors in other games that might have been held at Valdebebas instead, as has happened in recent years. However, the Tirol game is expected to be their only preparation match before their first fixture of the new season. Madrid have mixed feelings about the Club World Cup. A source close to the coach suggested that two more signings would be necessary. They pointed to how domestic rivals Atletico Madrid and European challengers Liverpool have strengthened this summer. However, club sources believe Alonso has a good squad and point out that there are 24 players already registered, with the 25th (La Liga's maximum) probably going to academy product Gonzalo Garcia. In other words, if no one leaves, and nobody has shown signs of wanting to, they cannot bring new faces in.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Morocco, which will host the 2030 football World Cup, has denied accusations by animal welfare groups that it is systematically culling stray dogs ahead of the event. Authorities maintain that they have been neutering and vaccinating stray dogs before releasing them back onto the street. Advocates have charged that Morocco was indiscriminately ridding its streets of strays ahead of the global sporting event it will jointly host with Portugal and Spain. And a bill aimed at protecting street animals was adopted earlier this month, still pending parliament review. Yet the culling accusations persist as online videos show dogs being shot or poisoned with strychnine, a toxic alkaloid which is sometimes used as a pesticide. Mohammed, a resident of Tangiers in Morocco's north who refused to give his last name for fear of retribution, said he witnessed a dog he had often seen in the neighbourhood where he works get poisoned and killed. In June, an activist interrupted a FIFA Club World Cup match, invading the pitch with a sign that read: "Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats". France's Brigitte Bardot Foundation, created by the movie star in 1986 to promote animal protection, has called on FIFA to block Morocco from hosting the 2030 tournament. Moroccan Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit has decried "media attacks" against the government with "wrong and out-of-context information". Advocates say Morocco has around three million stray dogs, but no official figures exist. Each year, there are about 100,000 stray dog bites nationwide, according to official data. In 2024, authorities said 33 people died from rabies, which is often transmitted by unvaccinated animals. Kadaoui commended government efforts to protect animals, saying she was "fully available" to work with authorities and build up on the success of Hayat – meaning "life" in Arabic – which has treated more than 4,600 dogs in Tangiers alone since 2016. If a rabid dog shows up, they drive it away and protect the community." The government has invested more than $24 million in creating clinics capable of implementing TNVR en masse, said Mohammed Roudani, head of hygiene and green spaces at the interior ministry. One clinic is already active in Al Arjat, near the capital Rabat, where veterinarian Youssef Lhor said more than 500 dogs had been treated this year and nearly half of them released back to the areas where they had been captured. A young female dog, tagged "636", was recovering at the clinic after being sterilised, and will soon be released. "Sometimes people tell us: 'You took the dogs away, why are you bringing them back?'" Moroccan authorities have developed a mobile app explaining what these clinics do, and allowing users to report sightings of stray dogs. Kadaoui said it was important to educate people on proper behaviour around strays and to warn against myths, like the idea that spitting on a dog bite could heal the injury.

Authorities maintain that they have been neutering and vaccinating stray dogs before releasing them back onto the street. Advocates have charged that Morocco was indiscriminately ridding its streets of strays ahead of the global sporting event it will jointly host with Portugal and Spain. And a bill aimed at protecting street animals was adopted earlier this month, still pending parliament review. Yet the culling accusations persist as online videos show dogs being shot or poisoned with strychnine, a toxic alkaloid which is sometimes used as a pesticide. Mohammed, a resident of Tangiers in Morocco's north who refused to give his last name for fear of retribution, said he witnessed a dog he had often seen in the neighbourhood where he works get poisoned and killed. In June, an activist interrupted a FIFA Club World Cup match, invading the pitch with a sign that read: "Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats". France's Brigitte Bardot Foundation, created by the movie star in 1986 to promote animal protection, has called on FIFA to block Morocco from hosting the 2030 tournament. Moroccan Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit has decried "media attacks" against the government with "wrong and out-of-context information". Advocates say Morocco has around three million stray dogs, but no official figures exist. Each year, there are about 100,000 stray dog bites nationwide, according to official data. In 2024, authorities said 33 people died from rabies, which is often transmitted by unvaccinated animals. Kadaoui commended government efforts to protect animals, saying she was "fully available" to work with authorities and build up on the success of Hayat – meaning "life" in Arabic – which has treated more than 4,600 dogs in Tangiers alone since 2016. If a rabid dog shows up, they drive it away and protect the community." The government has invested more than $24 million in creating clinics capable of implementing TNVR en masse, said Mohammed Roudani, head of hygiene and green spaces at the interior ministry. One clinic is already active in Al Arjat, near the capital Rabat, where veterinarian Youssef Lhor said more than 500 dogs had been treated this year and nearly half of them released back to the areas where they had been captured. A young female dog, tagged "636", was recovering at the clinic after being sterilised, and will soon be released. "Sometimes people tell us: 'You took the dogs away, why are you bringing them back?'" Moroccan authorities have developed a mobile app explaining what these clinics do, and allowing users to report sightings of stray dogs. Kadaoui said it was important to educate people on proper behaviour around strays and to warn against myths, like the idea that spitting on a dog bite could heal the injury.
