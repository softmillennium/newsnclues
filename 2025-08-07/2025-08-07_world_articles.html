                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We know that the governor has no power outside of the state, and we know that the federal government cannot get involved in this unless there is a legal reason why they are allowed to get involved.” Wu and dozens of Democratic state lawmakers remain outside of Texas as they continue their standoff with the Texas GOP over proposed changes to the state's congressional maps that would favor Republicans. Earlier this week, state House Speaker Dustin Burrows signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats and said law enforcement would “need some time to work.” Texas US Sen. John Cornyn, who is up for reelection next year, said Thursday the FBI had granted his request of federal assistance for state law enforcement, as they work with Texas Republicans to bring back the lawmakers and reestablish quorum. “I am proud to announce that Director Kash Patel has approved my request for the FBI to assist state and local law enforcement in locating runaway Texas House Democrats,” Cornyn said in a statement, but did not elaborate on what such assistance would entail. He told conservative talk show host Mark Davis later Thursday that Patel had assigned agents from the bureau's Austin and San Antonio offices to fulfill his request – though did not detail what role they would have. One location where lawmakers were staying received a bomb threat earlier this week. JB Pritzker told reporters that Republicans threatening law enforcement action were making “an attempt again to thwart democracy.” It's unclear to what extent agents are assisting Texas Republicans in the matter and under what authority they would be allowed to do so. A similar instance occurred in 2003, when more than 50 members of the Texas Legislature left the state to prevent a vote on a redistricting plan, and state officials reached out to federal agencies to find and bring back the lawmakers. But back then, President George W. Bush's Justice Department refused to assist, telling one congressman that they were “not aware of any information pertinent to the Texas State legislators that would warrant action by federal law enforcement authorities, including those of the FBI.” “Accordingly, we have not deployed and have no plans to deploy our law enforcement resources in connection with this matter,” the letter from then-Assistant Attorney General William Moschella stated. In his initial request for FBI assistance, Cornyn suggested that the Democratic lawmakers could be violating the law if they are accepting funds “to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties” and could “be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.” No such charges have been filed related to their absence. Cornyn's request to the department comes as he and his primary foe, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, are each trying to stake out an aggressive stand on the controversy and attempt to woo conservative voters in their state. The FBI has tools to aid state law enforcement when parties cross state lines, including to avoid testifying or fleeing a scene of a crime,” Cornyn wrote. Paxton acknowledged Tuesday night on Fox News that it would be difficult to arrest absent Democrats. “The challenge here is they go to liberal jurisdictions where we can't get help from law enforcement. Or two, this … motion or filing that has been done by Abbott, we're going to file something very similar for more of the legislators to take them out of their office, remove them from office, since they are not showing up to do their job. They will be taken directly to the Texas Capitol,” he said on X. “Those who received benefits for skipping a vote face removal from office and potential bribery charges.” CNN's Arlette Saenz, Ed Lavandera and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel share price drops after US president accuses Lip-Bu Tan of links to Chinese Communist party “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post. Trump did exclude Taiwan Semiconductor and Apple, companies that have said they plan to increase their investments in US manufacturing. Trump's criticism of Intel, which has lagged chipmakers such as Nvidia in producing graphics-processing chips suitable for AI applications, comes after Arkansas senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to company chairman Frank Yeary expressing concern over Tan's investments and ties to semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the CCP and the People's Liberation Army, the party's military arm. Cotton, a Republican, asked Intel's board if Tan had divested his interests and questioned if Tan's previous leadership of Cadence Design Systems, a company that last month said it had sold products to China's National University of Defense Technology, a violation of US export controls. Tan, 65, is regarded as an industry veteran in technology and venture capital. He was tapped to lead the once-dominant personal computing and laptop chipmaker in March as part of a turnaround effort. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Intel has received about $8bn from the Chips and Science Act for US investments, the Biden-era legislation framed as a national security imperative to reduce US dependence on foreign chip production. A number of foreign-based chipmakers have recently announced they are boosting US chip production , including Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung. Beneficiaries of the Chips Act besides Intel include TSMC, Micron Technology, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. But the $1bn grants are dwarfed by more than $400bn in pledged private-sector investments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Army Secretary Dan Driscoll honored the soldiers who sprang into action when an active-duty sergeant allegedly opened fire at Fort Stewart yesterday. • Quornelius Samentrio Radford, 28, was taken into custody and is accused of shooting five of his fellow service members. He had a disagreement with one of the shooting victims on Tuesday, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the case. “We got to the point where the magazine ended up coming out, and by that time frame the next one was trying to get loaded in, got loaded, but (I) still had physical control over it,” Staff Sgt. Aaron Turner, told CNN's Ryan Young on Thrusday. Turner said he tried to talk Radford down before physically restraining him. “Clearly that wasn't working, and I ended up having to go hands-on to try and disengage,” he said. “Knowing the fact that it's a teammate, it never ends up getting to the point where you really process that,” said Turner. Army officials have credited Turner's actions with preventing more casualties. Melissa Taylor, a career counselor at Fort Stewart in Georgia, said she reenlisted the suspected shooter Quornelius Radford, but no red flags were raised at the time. She noted that other than the contractual part of reenlistment and “the work part of it, I do not believe that the soldier ever spoke to me about anything personal. So I did not have any kind of background history on him.” She said there were no red flags when he was reenlisted. “You cannot reenlist a soldier if there was any kind of flag in place or anything like that. The soldiers who helped stopped yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia, have been identified by Army officials. Aaron Turner of Farmington, New Mexico, was the first to subdue suspect Quornelious Radford, with Master Sgt. Turner, an automated logistical specialist, has been at Fort Stewart for less than a year, the Army said. “The fast action of these soldiers under stress and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” Driscoll said. They are both combat medics who specialize in responding to medical emergencies. Watch Army Secretary Dan Driscoll award medals to soldiers who helped halt yesterday's shooting by subduing the suspect who wounded five people in a shooting at Fort Stewart: Melissa Taylor, one of the six soldiers awarded a medal for their actions during yesterday's shooting at Fort Stewart, said she was in her office when she heard a fellow soldier “yelling that a gunshot went off,” before she peered into the hallway and saw smoke. And so I was rendering aid to him, while the first sergeant started calling medics,” Taylor told reporters. Asked if she was scared during those moments, Taylor said, “not at that time.” Taylor credited adrenaline, her seven years of experience as a combat medic and working for a county's emergency medical services. “So, I have been in these type of situations before where I've had to render aid to someone with gunshot wounds. So I had a little bit of experience I believe helped get me through that situation,” Taylor said. One of the soldiers who sprang into action in the moments after a suspect opened fire at Fort Stewart on Wednesday explained in his own words what he heard and did during the attack. US Army 1st Sergeant Joshua Arnold, one of the six soldiers awarded medals for responding to the shooting, said when he first heard the gunshots, it took a moment for him to realize what was happening – but then his training kicked in. “It seemed like a flash went past my conference room,” Arnold told CNN. “I started yelling through the hallways, ‘That was a gunshot. Then he saw a soldier who had been shot. He rushed to help the soldier, who told him someone else had been injured, Arnold said. The gunshots were being fired by a fellow service member, but Arnold said he didn't think about that in the moment. “It's really a — it's a battle drill,” said Lt. Col. Mike Sanford of the 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, “and they went into action and did what they needed to do. Sanford said he knew the suspect, Quornelius Radford. Asked if there were any warning signs ahead of the shooting, Sanford responded, “Not at this time.” Quornelius Radford, the 28-year-old Army sergeant accused of carrying out the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia, will likely be transferred to a military detention center, said Ryan O'Connor,Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Special Agent in Charge. O'Connor said Radford is currently in custody and that CID is working through the Uniform Code of Military Justice processes. He said he did not know when Radford will be transferred or the location of the military detention center. “One solider remains as an in-patient at Winn Army (Community Hospital) right here on Fort Stewart. She's doing very well, in high spirits,” said Brig. We're hopeful she may be released as early as this weekend but that will just depend on how things heal up over the next couple of days.” Another solider who was more seriously injured is recovering at Savannah Memorial Community Hospital, about 45 miles from the base, the general said. “She's got a little bit longer road to recovery,” said Lubas. “The doctors are very positive, but I think it's going to take her a big longer to recover. They're very hopeful she's going to make a complete recovery.” The other three shooting victims were released yesterday, according to Lubas. An unarmed soldier tackled the shooter, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said during a news conference at Fort Stewart in Georgia. “So just think about this, they were unarmed and ran at and tackled an armed person who they knew was actively shooting their buddies, their colleagues, their fellow soldiers,” Driscoll said. He added that another soldier “jumped on top of the person to subdue them” until law enforcement officials arrived. Four other soldiers attended to the injured, Driscoll said. US Army officials who met with the families of soldiers wounded in yesterday's shooting described those meetings as “heartbreaking” in this morning's news conference. “It was heartbreaking sitting in there, and seeing the soldier, their daughter, sitting behind them, struggling,” said Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in response to a question from CNN's Ryan Young. We tried to hug them,” Driscoll said, adding he tried to convey support from the president, vice president and secretary of defense. Army officials will not speculate on the motives of the attacker who shot and injured five people at Fort Stewart yesterday. Counselors will be available for soldiers dealing with trauma after the shooting at Fort Stewart that left five people injured, US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll said. “We want you to take care of yourself,” Driscoll said. “People are going to process this and work through this at different rates, and we know we've got to keep a very close eye on them and wrap our arms around them,” he said. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll awarded medals to soldiers who he said helped halt yesterday's shooting at Fort Stewart by subduing the suspect and tending to the injured. “We're going to take a moment and thank these six soldiers,” Driscoll said. The medal is awarded to servicemembers who distinguish themselves through “outstanding non-combat meritorious achievement or service,” according to the US Army. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll arrived at Fort Stewart a short while ago and addressed soldiers gathered outside before he planned to recognize those who helped halt yesterday's shooting by tackling the suspect. “You are in all of our thoughts and prayers,” Driscoll told them, saying he had spoken with President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The soldiers, Driscoll said, endured a “terrible day” yesterday that “could have gone much worse if not for you and your colleagues.” “The heroism shown under fire is something that we should all aspire to know,” Driscoll said. Authorities have identified the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart as 28-year-old Quornelius Samentrio Radford, an active-duty sergeant who the US Army said had enlisted in 2018 as an automated logistical specialist. He had not deployed to a combat zone and had no known behavioral incidents on his military record. According to a law enforcement official briefed on the case, Radford used a 9mm Glock that he bought in Florida in May. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll today will honor the soldiers who sprang into action to stop the active-duty sergeant accused of opening fire at Fort Stewart yesterday and wounding five of his coworkers. Driscoll will recognize the soldiers' “acts of heroism,” according to a news release. Gen. John Lubas previously said the attack was stopped when nearby soldiers “immediately and without hesitation tackled the soldier (and) subdued him.” The wounded coworkers were in stable condition as of Wednesday afternoon. Some background: Driscoll, of North Carolina, served in the Army before attending Yale Law School, working in banking and unsuccessfully running for Congress as a Republican. He was nominated by President Donald Trump to his current position and was sworn in to the role in February.</p>

Most recently, the senators noted, reporting by The Guardian alleged that UnitedHealth is using a bonus scheme to push nursing homes that contract with Optum to reduce hospital transfers as part of an aggressive cost-cutting effort. Optum is a UHG subsidiary that employs or affiliates with roughly 10% of all physicians in the U.S. Wyden and Warren demanded that UnitedHealth provide answers to numerous questions related to its practices at nursing homes, including whether it institutes “hospital transfer quotas” at the facilities it works with. The newspaper identified “several cases” in which “nursing home residents who needed immediate hospital care under the program failed to receive it, after interventions from UnitedHealth staffers.” “At least one lived with permanent brain damage following his delayed transfer, according to a confidential nursing home incident log, recordings, and photo evidence,” the newspaper reported. “To reduce residents' hospital visits, UnitedHealth has offered nursing homes an array of financial sweeteners that sounded more like they came from stockbrokers than medical professionals.” “UnitedHealthcare is compelling medical professionals to comply with its financially-driven playbook at the expense of patient safety in a way that pressures providers to violate their ethical obligations,” the whistleblower added. “I'd like to see them held accountable for putting profits over patients.” Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive who now serves as president of the Center for Health and Democracy, wrote in a recent blog post that mounting scrutiny of UHG's practices shows the company is “facing a reckoning it can't ignore.” As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. You'll hear from Denzel Caldwell, an organizer with the Black Nashville Assembly — a quarterly gathering where Black residents of Nashville come together to discuss the issues impacting their lives, develop solutions, and take action. As authoritarianism intensifies in the U.S., we often hear calls to “save democracy.” But one of the problems with that framing is that many people don't feel they have a meaningful relationship with democracy. But the participatory nature of a public assembly can allow people to create democratic experiences, hear each other out, and begin to solve problems together. I think this is going to be an essential organizing tactic in the coming months and years, and I am excited for you all to hear from Denzel about it. Denzel recently shared some of these ideas here in Chicago at a workshop I organized on this subject. That workshop went so well that I decided we should cover some of the same ground here on the show so that those of you who weren't able to attend could engage with these ideas as well. Like all online publications, we are up against a lot right now — from AI-generated search engine sludge to social media algorithms designed to bury our work. We're fighting to keep the truth alive in a sea of bullshit, amid rising authoritarianism and an overwhelming flood of AI slop. Sharing this show, leaving a review on Apple or Spotify, or simply telling people about our work goes a long way. We publish stories the craven corporate press won't touch, and we only exist because of the support of readers and listeners like you. And with that, I hope you enjoy the show. It's burning hot outside, and the air here in Chicago is awful today, but the sun is shining through my window, and everything looks lovely, so there's that at least. KH: I am so happy you could join me today, and I'm really glad we've had the chance to collaborate a bit recently. I am a kid born, raised, and organizing in Nashville, Tennessee. I do organize under a number of different formations, but the one I definitely want to talk about today is the Black Nashville Assembly. And with the BNA I've been organizing for about five. And so, yeah, I've been doing that for quite some time, learning along the way, got some lessons and victories. But yeah, outside of that, I love to read. KH: Well, I love hanging with you, too — and I've been so interested in the work you've been doing in Nashville. But before we get into the evolution of the Black Nashville Assembly, can you start by explaining: What is a People's Movement Assembly? DC: Yeah, so I think the easiest, most straightforward answer to this question is it's a gathering of community members. What are the solutions that they need for those problems? And how can they work together to make those solutions concrete? I would say that's the most distilled, easiest answer to shape or to explain what it does or what it is. Now, I would say historically, people's movement assemblies as we know them today, can be traced back to what's called the World's Social Forum. And this was a coalition of organizations, movements and those that are adjacent who were coming together to combat neoliberalism, capitalism, imperialism. And while the World Social Forum is a clear predecessor to some of the assemblies we're seeing today, this kind of gathering and this approach to organizing has ancient roots, across the Americas and Africa. And that same year, I got my first experience of direct democracy in the Occupy movement. Occupy's General Assemblies were messy, and we didn't always get where we needed to go, but gathering together with dozens and sometimes hundreds of people to listen, share ideas, and make decisions that would shape our movement and affect our lives was a really important experience for me as an activist. I had never had that kind of opportunity to be heard, or to decide what would happen next, at that scale, in concert with other people. Eventually, we had neighborhood-based assemblies here in Chicago, and some of the core people who attended those neighborhood Occupy assemblies in my area became part of an organizing crew that I worked with for years after the Occupy movement had faded. What moved you and your co-organizers to create the Black Nashville Assembly? Prior to 2020, because 2020 is really a watershed moment for us. Prior to 2020, there was some growing interest across the local (and by local, I'm referring to Nashville) ecosystem in terms of doing invest/divest campaigns or abolitionist campaigns that encouraged city councils to spend more money on social services and things that people actually need and less on cops, courts and cages. And so, what emerged from that was just a coalition where folks who were on the left were committed to that work. But as we initiated this work in 2019 going into 2020, one of the themes that kept coming up from our opponents on the city council was that we weren't organizing Black people in Nashville. They were trying to make this claim that we didn't represent the interest of working-class Black folks in the city. And so, a number of different organizers, including myself, Erica Perry, Jamel Campbell-Gooch, Mike Floss, we who are from Nashville, decided to go out and organize our folks. But what we realized is that along the way, a lot of our folks were interested in creating a container where Black folks, working-class Black folks were able to build their own analysis, assess their own problems, and create strategies and methods for making those solutions concrete. So those who participate are of African descent or identify as Black, but we do have spaces where we invite our comrades to build with us. KH: I love that you and your co-strugglers responded to this claim that you didn't represent your community by mobilizing your community in such a highly visible and participatory way. I think there's a lot to be learned from that example. So, how did this project evolve over time? DC: So initially as it started, it was a call, as I mentioned earlier, from a larger coalition to particularly organize Black people to build a people's budget for the city, an abolitionist one. And that still is a pretty key core to our work. But over time, as we learn more and more about the importance of organizing working-class Black folks in the city, and more importantly falling within the lines of the traditions that we descend from, that being SNCC and others, within the Black Radical Tradition, we learned that our assembly had to become more multifaceted and it had to reflect our people. We've developed a youth assembly that has come out of our work where our youth are organizing our political agendas and bringing it to the larger assembly, and going through the voting process to land on an agreed upon political agenda. And a lot of other programs from that assembly work have emerged. We're just constantly coming up with different ways and things to evolve our work and to reflect the needs of our folks. Black Nashville Assembly is also a project of Southern Movement Committee, which is a container that we created not only for our youth assembly work, but also to engage in statewide assembly work or aspirationally engage in statewide assembly work for Black communities across the state of Tennessee. Larger gatherings and political projects often serve as incubators in ways that people don't always consider or realize. Years ago, I was involved with a project called “We Charge Genocide” here in Chicago, which challenged police violence. That effort sent a group of young people to present a shadow report to the UN about police violence and torture in Chicago. It also played an important role in winning reparations for police torture survivors. At We Charge Genocide meetings, we would engage as a large group, and then break into working groups that were focused on different projects and pursuits. My collective, Lifted Voices, which provided political education workshops for thousands of people during the decade or so before it sunsetted, wouldn't have existed without We Charge Genocide's radical education working group. Those working groups set people on a number of paths. In a moment like this one, when we don't have all of the projects, participation, and experiments that we need, we need to create more fertile ground for that work to begin. And so, that colored how we approached the assembly work. However, one of the most brilliant things that has come from our assembly work in these past five plus years has been that a lot of the most innovative, radical, grounded ideas have come from folks who have participated in the assembly process. I think sometimes there's this assumption that for those of us, especially on the left, but that we have to take this evangelical approach to organizing. But one of the most powerful things that we've recognized doing our assembly work here is that a lot of our folks know exactly what we need and do have a grounded analysis in the systems that oppress them and really are looking for a container to actualize some of the solutions that would need to take root and to be birthed into reality to address those problems. And so, of course we have political struggle and our politics are evolving, our practice is evolving, but a lot of our direction, if not most of it, comes directly from those who participate in the assembly. And one of the things I definitely want to lift up here is that the first time that we released a political agenda, that was the result of months and months of deliberation, power mapping with our folks, turning some solutions into policy demands or into policy language and then doing things like a candidate forum during a judicial election as well as the city council and mayor elections, so that instead of politicians coming to our space to do a stump speech, they are being interrogated based on the concretized political agenda of the assembly. KH: I love the idea of politicians having to contend with questions that are informed by an agenda a community collectively built. DC: Yeah, I think for me it's a couple of things. It didn't take this, again, this evangelical approach where we're just browbeating people over the head with our ideological reading and position necessarily. A lot of folks came to very abolitionist, anticapitalist conclusions on their own. I'll never forget one time or often, we do this often anytime we table, we'll create a poster and we'll ask folks, “What makes you feel safe?” And we've done that several times and every time that we do it, not once do people write down “police,” not once do people write down “cages” and not once do people write down this carceral system, any piece of this carceral system that makes them feel safe. They talk about family, their faith, their community, their loved ones, the things they love to do, the things that make the city great, things like that from music to culture. But not once do people bring up police. And so, I think sometimes we can really underestimate the radical potential of our people. And you can actually find at least the mayoral one on YouTube and I'll share that link for folks to see later. And it threw me off and it threw others off because in my mind I'm thinking there's a lot of civic organizations throughout the city, throughout the state that do civic engagement, electoral work. And you would think, oh yeah, folks have asked the critical questions. But when folks felt like this was groundbreaking, we were like, wait, all we did was just concretize the political agenda that folks our base wanted and then interrogated politicians based on that. But for me, that was surprising because that just showed how anti-democratic just like our norm is in terms of how we engage in governance under this current structure. But it was just a reminder also of how powerful the People's Movement Assembly process is. KH: One thing I really appreciate about this process is that it's really the opposite of how a lot of people are experiencing politics right now, alone together in the glow of their screens. We have a serious problem in the U.S., in that our reliance on digital mobilization has left us with a generation of organizers who never learned how to base build or how to canvas. In this alienating culture, that often means that people simply don't know how to talk to strangers or how to work with people who aren't of their own choosing. And unless your political work evolved within an organization that wanted you to canvas or do the labor of base-building, you probably never got that training. When you compound that with the alienating dynamics that have evolved on social media, and the isolation of late capitalism, we're in real fucking trouble. Even when people want to make a difference, they often don't know how to do more than seek or reward affinity and agreement. They don't know how to navigate difference or talk about justice with people who don't understand them or their goals. So, that said, I'm really curious, how did you and your co-organizers adapt some of your movement, language, and ideas to fit the needs of the community? And there's a meta-note that I have to make here. One of the most important organizing lessons that we have learned in the past five years is our people are very receptive to listening and engaging in learning and political struggle when you consistently show up, I think too often, and I don't think this is exclusive to liberals, but I think too often even those of us on the left will engage in momentary organizing with folks based on a campaign or a particular flashpoint, but we're not continuing to cultivate those relationships with our base, which leads to this hamster wheel where we don't get any farther. And so, part of our work has really centered on relationship building. So that means in our early days we used to have this thing called “the recharge” where instead of there being an assembly, it was like a party essentially. We got a DJ, people were playing music, and folks were just recharging because we probably went through a particular election season or some really rough moment or we just needed a break. And so, it's through that constant interaction that it gives us the trust and basis to do certain, what we would consider mass meetings, because our mass meetings are different than our people's movement assemblies, where our mass meetings are where we engage in civic and political education and the people's movement assemblies are the moments where we actually develop our political agenda and strategy. And so, it's through those constant interactions, constant events where we're bringing together community members that we get the trust to engage in civic and political education. Or the reason that we keep running into this issue around youth violence is because this carceral system adds to or shapes the violence that our youth are victimized by. And so, we really just take the opportunity through relationship building and through moments where people are assessing their problems to inject this political, more politicized conversation and some of the movement language, where we reshape things like public safety, reshape things like the notion of community safety and things like that. And that's what helps people to sharpen their analysis in our experience. KH: Can you give me an example of something that you might hear in a leftist space language-wise and how it might be talked about differently in the community space? And we talk about how we need to build a world where those things don't exist, and we have these robust accountability processes that exist that allow us to get to the root of a problem. But then when we're talking about talking to our folks in the assembly, we might be in conversation and our folks are like, “Yeah, we don't rock it to police. We're forced to go through this court system, but I really just want to be in a place where I can talk to my folks and have some type of community trust and buy-ins, where we can address the problems without having to involve the law. Or people will bring up a lot of these really robust ideas, especially the youth, around how we resolve conflict in the public schools. Our youth are bringing up restorative justice processes on their own. They're brilliant enough to say, “Hey, we have to find ways to restore relationships within the school because we know that the school resource officers and the metal detectors and things are a threat to our safety.” And so, our people are talking about the things that they already do to avoid the carceral system. And what they're doing is talking about ways to institutionalize those things, so that the necessity for police becomes less and less, or the legitimacy of the police becomes radically less. And so, this is how the abolition conversations come up. KH: That really resonates with me, and I have had a similar experience talking with people who are trying to combat the damage done by the opioid overdose crisis. In Native communities, some of the people I talk to are on the same page as me about not fucking with police, but I've also heard people talk about holding out hope that there was some way the cops could arrest our way out of this. They thought that if the cops could just be pushed to “do their jobs,” or do their jobs in a particular way, fewer of our people would die. Because while they're locked up for a few days, their tolerance to the drug drops, and when they get out and use — which will happen, because people don't heal in jail, they just become more traumatized — they are more vulnerable to overdose. So, some people who previously looked at cops as a potential solution now recognize that our people actually need care, and to be insulated from contact with the police, whenever possible. And these are things I've heard from people across different communities, and the Native people I've talked to about this stuff, most of them wouldn't call themselves abolitionists, and they are not out here calling for the abolition of prisons, but the work of replacing carceral responses with care is abolitionist. The work of reducing contact between our community members and police is abolitionist. So, often, I've found, it's really about addressing people's needs in very concrete terms. And if we're thorough and honest in our analysis on those points, there's going to be alignment with some of our radical politics — because those politics exist for a reason. Activists and justice-minded people have really built their own cultures and subcultures around the pursuit of justice, and we can sometimes be intolerant of people using the wrong terminology, or knowingly or unknowingly saying things that are problematic or disrespectful. So, how do you handle it, in the public assembly setting, when someone says something fucked up, or there's a harmful impact that occurs? And so, some of those things include not making assumptions about folks, being curious, making space and taking space. A lot of us on the left and in movement spaces are familiar with. Because oftentimes when people talk about accountability, people forget that a prerequisite of accountability is relationship and an agreed upon set of values or agreements to which we hold people to account. So when someone says something fucked up or when someone says something that is out of alignment, we take time to remind people, “Hey, we agreed to these community agreements. We have no problem pushing back in our space. We do it not from a place always of combativeness, from a place of love, and love being the willingness to see the fullness of our people and the willingness to struggle with them towards a collective liberatory victory. We recognize that people come in with fucked up ideas, that people come in with a colonial mentality or colonial outlook. We don't run away from that, and that's embedded in our agreement so that when we do hear things that are colonial, are carceral, are anti-Black, all these things, we are able to address it from a more solid basis than just calling somebody out because they said something fucked up, but not really being in relationship with them, which is something we see too often online and unfortunately even in some spaces, real world spaces. So it can take a lot of organic forms. We can hit folks up and just say, “Hey, I want to follow up with you and just talk with you about what you said at the assembly.” Or sometimes that might even shape our mass meeting content. So a couple of things that I think it's important to note. I think with the community agreements, that is probably of the places that initially was shaped by our political orientation, our political pillars, and to specify, our four political pillars as an organization are pan-Africanism, Black queer feminism, economic democracy, and police and prison abolition. And so, as I mentioned earlier, a number of those of us who were at the beginning and formed the assembly, we came in with a certain set of politics or political dispositions already. And so, a lot of the things we saw in community agreements, in other spaces, other movement spaces of the base-building organizations we brought with us. But the thing about it is that as we started to engage our people, as we started to learn our folks, struggle with our folks and have the assembly shape be shaped in our folks' collective image, the way in which those community agreements evolved began to more directly reflect the people that were in the space. So it's not that so much they shifted in terms of being curious about people not making assumptions, acknowledging growth edges. It's not so much that they shifted in terms of the spirit, but the language might have shifted to reflect our people. And so, yeah, I say that to say that there was a mixture of our initial or our base political orientation that shaped it, but it has evolved based on the engagement of folks in the assembly work. And we need to shape our goals in the same way. DC: We've had a couple of strong wins, actually. Because before 2020, if you brought up this idea that money needed to be reallocated away from Metro Nashville Police to the social services, there would be a lot of pearl clutching. But we played a huge role in normalizing that language when post-2020, post-George Floyd uprising, in a way that has shifted the Overton window left locally, as far as the budget cycle is concerned. I would say more concretely our biggest, we've had back-to-back wins in the past two years, this year and as well as last year. Last year, just to give you context, our youth, when they developed their demands for the budget cycle in 2024, they came up with this plan called the Varsity Spending Plan. And this was a $10 million plan where you had money that would go to the nation's first Office of Youth Safety, which was an office that was dedicated to creating proactive solutions, youth-led solutions to youth gun violence that is fundamentally working separate from the carceral system. And this is language that was included in the executive order, the mayoral executive order when this office was erected. The other part of the varsity and spending plan includes some restorative justice programs or pilots in a number of different schools, public schools that are predominantly Black in the city, as well as providing more support for community center funding as well as ensuring there's funds for a full-time restorative justice staff. And so, with this Varsity Spending Plan, the assembly got behind it. And so, back in 2024, we were able to secure a million dollars towards this plan. And again, this is not something that's going to our organization. And so, that a million dollars had $750,000 go towards the Office of Youth Safety, which again, according to our analysis, is the first of its kind in the nation, not just in Nashville. And we also got funding to go towards restorative justice pilots in some of our targeted schools. And so, we've been on a two-year winning streak. We both expressed earlier that we think that the creation of public assemblies is a particularly important organizing tactic right now. Can you talk about the importance of the public assembly as a tactic in this moment of intensifying authoritarianism? DC: Yeah, I think that there's always, in this country, even when we take a decolonial lens, in public discourse, there's always been this question or conversation around democracy. And so, I think in that vein, I think that what this process, the People's Movement Assembly process provides is a unique opportunity for people to build a democracy that has yet to be born or has yet to exist. And I think that is particularly unique and something very opportune in this moment because a number of people across the political spectrum, honestly here in the United States, are looking for something different. And so, with that, one of the most potent tools that people can do, not only as a means of survival, but as a means of world making is to engage in a governance structure process like the People's Movement Assembly, because this process invites people to be active participants in shaping the collective outcome of our people's futures. And that is a primary and oftentimes missing ingredient in building mass movements, because if people don't participate in the shaping of their futures, then we can't hope for more radical or revolutionary outcomes. And if we look across history at various revolutionary moments, radical moments, especially throughout the world, one critical component was organizing the masses towards being active participants in the shaping of their futures. And I think particularly in this moment in the United States history and this particular political moment, not just domestically, but internationally, that the U.S. and people who live within the U.S. can in some ways, once again, depending on the history that you reference, can participate in a larger struggle for a world where people and systems are governed directly and democratically by the masses, and controlled by the masses rather than by a wealthy predominantly European few. KH: I couldn't agree more, and I think that we need to give people a different set of experiences, if we want people to want folks to develop a different perspective. Maybe we echo a perspective or add one to the mix. Some of that needs to happen in person. It can also happen with an eye toward accessibility and COVID safety. Repeating the same patterns isn't going to give us different outcomes. And whether people are gathering around a specific issue, like housing struggles, austerity, a site fight, or defending their neighbors, let's give people a hands-on sense of what it means to come together and make decisions that shape what happens next. I know some people in this country already have a passionate or romanticized relationship with democracy, but that's not everyone, and I don't think it's most people. We have to make democracy a vehicle toward those ends. So, all of that said, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today? DC: Yeah, definitely, if folks are interested in following the developments of the Black Nashville Assembly or the Southern Movement Committee, definitely feel free to connect with us or support our work through OurSMC.org. Beyond that, I would highly encourage folks to find an organization. Whether you're engaged in mutual aid, whether you're engaged in particular policy campaigns or whether you're engaged in assembly work, to find an organization, find an organization in particular that is, ideally, anti-imperialist, that is challenging capital and wants to build a fundamentally different world. But yeah, I would encourage folks to find an organization. I think it's very easy and it's a tool of the empire for folks to engage in Doomerism, especially those of us on the left. So I would highly encourage folks to adopt a revolutionary optimism that isn't delusional, it's not idealist. So I would leave with just those parting words of: join an organization, maintain revolutionary optimism, and ensure that your political education that you're engaged in is tied to some type of organizational work. Over the years, I have worn a lot of hats, because I've picked up a lot of skills. Sometimes, skills that weren't immediately relevant to what I was doing became crucial under unforeseen circumstances. In unpredictable times like these, having just-in-case skill sets is going to be important. And on the subject of skill-building, if you want to learn more about facilitating public assemblies, Denzel and I are planning a virtual followup workshop that will build on some of the ideas Denzel covered in his recent workshop in Chicago, and in today's episode. And you can look for updates about that in my newsletter. Right now, we are thinking that will happen in early October. Denzel, I want to thank you again for joining me today. I'm excited to be participating and I'm looking forward to leading this virtual workshop and conversation and talking with more folks who are interested in engaging in this type of work. KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broad language could allow cities to lock up unhoused people as aid is cut and housing costs soar, experts warn Donald Trump's executive order that pushes local governments to remove unhoused people from the streets will exacerbate the issues already facing people who have unstable housing, mental health conditions and substance use disorders – and the vague wording could be used for wider action, experts say. It is not going to help anybody,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center. The order instructs states and municipalities to crack down on public substance use; camping, loitering, or squatting in urban spaces; mental health issues; and sex offender registration. It calls for “shifting” people without stable housing into “long-term institutional settings”. The conditions for detainment outlined in the order are poorly defined, which means it could be interpreted broadly to detain and involuntarily institutionalize people in public spaces. And it doesn't detail who may make determinations on institutionalization. It also doesn't define who's qualified to make an assessment,” said Rabinowitz. Individuals with mental illness are defined in the order as people who “pose risks to themselves or the public”, which could be broad enough to encompass many people, he said. And while the order sometimes refers to cracking down on “illicit” substance use, at other times it speaks more generally to substance use disorder – a condition that can include legal substances such as alcohol and prescription medication. Many states already have laws on involuntary commitment for mental illness, Sullivan said. To strip away those checks and balances, and make it so that there's more essentially policing on the streets of mental illness … has never been proved to be effective in the long run,” Sullivan said. “This goes a step further than what we've seen in some other states or cities,” she added. The Trump administration will also stop supporting housing-first policies, which provide housing and support services as quickly as possible to people experiencing homelessness, the order said. It comes amid significant proposed reductions for affordable housing. “The Trump administration is going to make housing more expensive. And then once people are homeless, they're going to take away actual solutions, and instead lock people up for being homeless,” Rabinowitz said. This approach has serious repercussions for health, he added. Higher rates of involuntary institutionalization would add greater strain to the healthcare system, Sullivan said. “We know that involuntary commitment leads to more people being in the emergency room and emergency rooms being more overwhelmed than they currently are.” And the order instructed Trump administration officials to pursue possible lawsuits against such programs. States and cities receiving federal funding could see that money restricted or frozen if they don't enforce the new rules, the executive order said. In the wake of last year's supreme court decision on Grant's Pass, upholding the Oregon city's ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness, several states and municipalities introduced stricter laws to target people living outside. “Especially when federal funding is really disappearing, this hamstrings cities and municipalities into compliance in order just to fund vital services,” Sullivan said. Focusing on programs addressing these issues in innovative ways “makes it seem like this is another mechanism for going after places like LA or Portland or Chicago or any place that is trying to do something different with addressing homelessness and substance use”, Sullivan said. But it will have sweeping effects on homeless people and others to whom the order is applied. Even if that were true, he said, “there are no carrots right now, there's no housing that anybody can afford, but there are a whole ton of sticks, and we know that people don't need a stick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine created an online "catalog" where Ukrainian children are offered up for adoption while sorted based on physical traits like eye or hair color, the head of a Ukrainian NGO said on Aug. 6, denouncing the practice as child trafficking. "Most children in this catalog were born in Luhansk Oblast before the Russian occupation and had Ukrainian citizenship," Mykola Kuleba, CEO of the Save Ukraine organization, said in an Instagram post. "Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction." Ukraine has identified more than 19,500 children abducted by Russia during the full-scale war and forcibly transferred to Russia, the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, or Belarus. Ukrainian officials estimate the real figure could be far higher. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets puts the number at up to 150,000, while Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Daria Herasymchuk has given a range of 200,000–300,000. Children are introduced with their photos, age, gender, and character traits, with some being described as "obedient" or "calm." "The way they describe our children is indistinguishable from a slave catalog. Save Ukraine is a charitable organization founded in 2014 to support vulnerable groups, namely orphans and children rescued from Russian-occupied territories. The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine's children's rights officials for comment. Their return has remained a central and non-negotiable demand in Ukraine's negotiations with Moscow. During peace talks in Istanbul, Russian officials dismissed Kyiv's appeal to return the abducted children as a "show for childless European old ladies," even as they admitted to relocating hundreds, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their personal roles in organizing the illegal transfers. Ukraine's military launched a drone attack on Russia's Volgograd Oblast overnight on Aug. 7, striking a railway station in the town of Surovikino, regional Governor Andrei Bocharov reported. Preparations for the meeting are underway, and the venue has already been agreed upon, Russian foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said. "This step will help ensure transparency and legality in the work of enlistment offices' teams, as well as protect the rights of both sides," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said. "Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction," said Mykola Kuleba, head of the Save Ukraine organization. "Yesterday (Aug. 6), various potential formats for leader-level meetings to bring peace were also discussed – two bilateral and one trilateral," President Volodymyr Zelensky said after a phone call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Ukraine's debt securities, sensitive to prospects of an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, hit their highest levels in four months. The comments reportedly came during a phone call on Aug. 6, just two days before U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face harsher U.S. penalties. The official, who has not been publicly named, is accused of organizing a campaign of abuse against Ukrainian detainees, including civilians. Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, was among the victims, prosecutors said. "President (Donald) Trump has made it clear that he's willing and capable of moving forward on some economic actions, secondary sanctions, or other direct sanctions as well," U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a little misleading to ask what the average home costs in Canada: there are so many types, markets and submarkets that the answer makes little statistical sense. The latest figures from June show four months of slowly deflating home prices, but they also set a benchmark of $776,400 for single-family detached homes prices across the country. CREA's numbers show these types of homes are still historically quite expensive, but still lower than when the pandemic-era boom rocketed prices to a peak of $951,200 in 2022. Since then, the trend has been down to the point where CREA's national numbers say these homes are now about 18 per cent lower than their peak. Not all markets are created equal though: some are still seeing prices marching upwards while others have properties available at a relative bargain. features four bedrooms and about 2,100 square feet of living space.Supplied While there are undeveloped lots for sale in Greater Vancouver for under $800,000 (although in the case of the two currently for sale in Burnaby, there's literally a cargo rail track in your front yard) you have drive about an hour away to Maple Ridge to find something like a livable detached house (such as a 1,000-square foot, three-bedroom bungalow at 12121 228 St.) For something near national benchmark price you're better off searching B.C. 's vast interior, which is one of the more affordable single family markets in the province with a June single family benchmark of $802,200, down 7.9 per cent from the peak it hit in April, 2022 ($866,200). It's a relatively new-build home finished in 2019, with four bedrooms and about 2,100 square feet of living space. There is also has a three-car garage and a huge deck (and second-floor balcony) looking into the forests of Fintry Provincial Park just behind. The relatively new-build home, finished in 2019, is selling for around $779,900.Supplied It's location – almost equidistant between Vernon and Kelowna – contributes to its relative affordability. “If that house was right in the city it would be substantially more money; You save money by driving a bit every day,” said listing agent Gord Heighton, realtor with RE/MAX Vernon Salt Fowler. “We get a lot of people relocating around town, upsizing or downsizing. They come here and buy their house for cash,” said Mr. Heighton. 7604 157 Ave. NW is a 3,200-square-foot, three-bedroom home selling for around $775,000.MaxWell Progressive Alberta is one of the few provinces that didn't see huge swings upward during the pandemic that then retrenched. That means in the most expensive market – Calgary, where prices sit around $694,000 – you can get a lovely single-story bungalow or split level on a modest lot near Nose Hill Park for under $780,000. For $775,000 you could have 7604 157 Ave. NW, a 3,200-square-foot, three-bedroom home that backs onto one of the city's man-made stormwater lakes. The listing agent, Paul Afonso, with MaxWell Progressive, is more of a builder and entrepreneur but is listing the home for a friend. There's a vented barbecue and wood-burning stove to help make it through those long Edmonton winters. In Toronto, you could find a 700-square-foot detached worker's cottage built in the postwar period for under $800,000, but there aren't a lot of family-sized options at that price. Outside of Greater Toronto and Hamilton there's quite a few regions where the single family prices are lower than the national number. In the Barrie-Simcoe area, prices are 21 per cent off their 2022 peak (from just over $1-million to $808,300), in Hamilton they are 25 per cent down (from $1.15-million to $864,100) while Kitchener-Waterloo has dropped 26 per cent (from $1.094-million to $805,600). Bargain hunters should note the K-W deals are still relative: the detached prices are still 40 per cent higher than they were in 2019. Inside there's a lot of personality expressed with hand-painted decorations on everything from kitchen cabinets and furnishings to doorway casings and trim. According to listing agent Alina Telescu with Red and White Realty Inc., rumour has it a host of notable locals have lived there over the years. In Quebec, this two-storey, split-level home at 14355 Rue Meadowvale is on the market for around $779,000 and features four bedrooms spread across about 1,200 square feet.Groupe Sutton Performer Inc. Detached homes have also been on a fairly steady rise in Quebec, up 47 per cent from the end of 2019 to June's $600,200 benchmark. There are plenty of options for a detached house at the national benchmark: closer to the city centre, they might be a little smaller or on eccentric lots. For $779,000 you could get a two-storey, split-level home in the West Island area known as DDO or Dollard-des-Ormeaux at 14355 Rue Meadowvale. This part of the city is 95-per-cent Anglophone, according to listing agent Nabil Rougui, with Group Sutton-Performer Inc., and looks a lot like many Canadian suburbs that began to spring up in the 1960s. This house has four bedrooms spread across about 1,200 square feet, as well as a finished basement, and features a two-car garage and an in-ground pool in the backyard. As sales slow and the market tips away from sellers towards favouring buyers, Mr. Rougui said he's increasingly having the conversation with clients about how much bigger their next house has to be? The price growth in New Brunswick from 2019 is nothing short of remarkable with prices almost doubling (up 94 per cent) from $169,500. In comparison, Newfoundland looks sluggish with just 44 per cent growth from $226,400 over the same period.

These days some of that Ontario money has had to leave, thanks to remote working policies withering away, and now the market is tilting more toward more moderate price growth even while home values remain higher than they had ever been historically.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli flags are a common sight at Auschwitz-Birkenau.AFP / Getty Images So bad, the answer might go, that Israeli flags weren't allowed at Auschwitz. While not exactly accurate, that is what a group of Israelis felt they experienced when visiting the site of the concentration camp – now a huge, sprawling museum of horrors, near Oswiecim, Poland. Here about 1.1-million people were murdered by Nazis, who had built high-efficiency gas chambers in German-occupied Poland for that purpose. Most of the victims were Jewish, murdered for that sole fact. When I first heard about last week's flag controversy, the image that immediately came to mind was of a young March participant walking along the railway tracks that once led to death, wearing an Israeli flag as a cape. Opinion: As a Jewish Canadian, I want my community to speak out about the horrors in Gaza Opinion: Genocide is a process, not an event Here's what actually happened last week: A group of 180 Israeli army officers and security officials arrived at the gates of Birkenau for a commemoration known as “Witnesses in Uniform” and were told they could not enter carrying the flags, according to Ynet news. Discussions with local officials ensued, and finally, the group entered without their flags. One participant told Ynet news that he believed the incident stemmed from antisemitism and an attempt to reshape the historical narrative. The museum stated on X that organizers failed to follow proper procedures. “Under no circumstances can the grounds of the former camp be a space for unco-ordinated manifestations or ceremonies – even those carried out with good intentions.” Even if the optics aren't great, this is fair. On social media, Israel's ambassador to Poland called this a misunderstanding, dismissing claims of antisemitism and humiliation. Among them surely were descendants of Holocaust survivors, perhaps the children or grandchildren of people who had survived – or were murdered in – this very place. Mr. Bartyzel did not answer my question about whether this has happened before. Have unauthorized Israeli flags entered the site previously by people marching in? Has such an order been given before Israel became the global pariah it is now? In the midst of this, it is easy for Jews to assume antisemitic intent. We need to be thoughtful in each circumstance. That said, if there is a spot where the consequences of antisemitism can be felt viscerally, it is at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where the absolute worst happened. It was a difficult day for her, but she drew comfort from not just her own descendants, but from seeing so many young Jews from around the world – and the sea of Israeli flags. Nobody should have to experience such staggering losses. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MINSK, August 7. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has expressed concern over the increasingly aggressive stance of Poland and the Baltic states. During a meeting focused on the activities of the State Security Committee (KGB), he emphasized that the situation extends beyond internal affairs, primarily reflecting the tense military and political environment surrounding Belarus, the BelTA news agency reports. Lukashenko remarked, "It is alarming that our neighbors – Poland and the Baltic countries – are acting in a very intimidating and hostile manner toward Belarus. They are exerting pressure from all sides, and our intelligence agencies are feeling this most acutely. That's why we, and I personally, are paying the closest attention to the work of the KGB and the security sector as a whole." BelTA recalled that some time ago, KGB Chief Ivan Tertel proposed measures to enhance the agency's effectiveness. The main report was delivered by Alexander Volfovich, the Secretary of Belarus's Security Council. Attending the event were notable figures including KGB Chairman Andrey Shved, Prosecutor General Igor Sergeyenko, and Chief of Staff of the Council of Ministers Valery Vakulchik. Lukashenko concluded with optimism, stating, "I hope we will have an open and objective discussion on this topic and reach a suitable conclusion."</p>

By Hayato Kobayashi / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writer Enrique Ochoa, Mexico's undersecretary for multilateral affairs and human rights, expressed concern that the threat of nuclear weapons is being underestimated globally in an online interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on Tuesday. Ochoa, who holds the stance of promoting nuclear abolition said that “there has been a kind of banalization of nuclear threats and their use,” as the focus on nuclear deterrence has increased. He raised urgency about nuclear proliferation, saying, “A world with more states possessing nuclear weapons … will be more dangerous.” Ochoa stated Mexico's willingness to collaborate with Japan on nuclear disarmament, emphasizing that “we have a lot of common ground in terms of peace and security.” He expressed gratitude for the activities of Nihon Hidankyo (the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations), which received the Nobel Peace Prize last year, and said Mexico would further develop its achievements through diplomatic action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. He is the author of Bombing to Win: Air Power and Coercion in War. After nearly 700 days of war, the death toll in Gaza has risen to extraordinary levels. Amid heavy bombardment that has turned the territory into a wasteland of rubble and stringent blockades that have led to mass hunger and even starvation, over 61,000 Palestinians have died and over 145,000 have been seriously wounded, according to Gaza's Hamas-affiliated health authorities, which do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters. In February, the medical journal The Lancet published an extensive analysis based on a wide variety of sources (including obituaries) and estimated that the official death toll underreported the direct war deaths in Gaza by at least 41 percent and perhaps by as much as 107 percent, while not accounting at all for nontrauma-related deaths resulting from the impact of Israeli military operations on Gaza's health services, food and water supplies, and sanitation. In sum, the authors of the study suggested that Israel's campaign has caused at least an additional 26,000 Palestinian deaths and perhaps as many as over 120,000 additional deaths, with the true death toll possibly upward of 186,000. Leaders and scholars have long assumed that democracy offered a solution to the worst pathologies of authoritarian states, especially the willingness of a government to subject populations to coercion, cruelty, and violence. Indeed, the United States and other Western democracies, including Israel, have insisted that democracy is crucial for the promotion of fundamental human rights, individual prosperity, and a more peaceful world. That is also the conclusion of numerous international institutions and human rights groups. Indeed, the notion that Hamas can be eradicated via military means is a “fantasy,” as former Shin Bet director Yoram Cohen said this week. As civilians continue to suffer in Gaza, Israel has squandered the moral high ground for no good strategic purpose. Israel's critics may demand that, based on its treatment of the Palestinians, the country should not be considered a democracy. That understates the full dimensions of Israel's behavior in Gaza. Even now, Israel retains the political institutions built on majority rule and the high levels of citizen participation in free elections that are the hallmarks of representative government and that have long characterized Western democracy. These included four campaigns in and around World War II—Japan's invasion of China from 1937 to 1945, Germany's invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945, the Allied bombing and invasion of Germany from 1939 to 1945, and the U.S. bombing and conquest of Japan from 1942 to 1945—and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1988. Whether it is called a “genocide” or not, no sensible observer could look at Israel's war in Gaza and miss the stunning levels of devastation that Palestinians have endured. And yet despite this mammoth destructive enterprise, Israel has not come close to fulfilling its stated aim of eliminating Hamas. It may be diminished as a military force, but it can replenish its depleted ranks with new recruits—indeed, by some accounts, it has managed to bring in over 10,000 new fighters since the war began. The moral case for harming civilians is always dubious even when such violence serves a strategic purpose. When that strategic purpose does not exist, however, the moral case evaporates altogether. Israel now finds itself in a morally untenable situation. Rather than incur the world's growing wrath, increased economic pressure, and the greater likelihood of future violence, Israel must reverse course and pursue alternatives to its campaign of mass death in Gaza. But even intense civilian punishment rarely achieves these goals. To be sure, Israeli attacks had devastated the group's leadership and smashed much of its infrastructure. But according to the most reliable polling information available at that point in time, Palestinian support for Hamas had remained the same or risen in Gaza and the West Bank. In January 2025, U.S. officials revealed that according to their estimates, Hamas had recruited around 15,000 new fighters since the start of Israel's military operations in 2023, more than making up for the 11,000 to 13,000 losses that U.S. intelligence estimated the group had suffered. For its part, Hamas seems to be stepping up its guerrilla tactics of ambushes and bombings targeting Israeli soldiers in Gaza, but the group has not been able to meaningfully defend the territory and its population from Israeli attacks. Media reports in recent months have revealed sporadic demonstrations in Gaza against Hamas, suggesting that some Palestinians are fed up with the group and its actions. But according to recent polling, Hamas remains broadly popular among Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas's relative power cannot simply be measured the same way one would measure the military balance between Israel and its state rivals. Instead, these groups seek to impose losses on their opponents in other ways, mostly through guerrilla operations that pick off enemy military personnel in small numbers and over long stretches of time and through attacks against civilians. And since they are always weaker than their state rivals in the usual military indicators, terrorist groups expect to suffer great losses as the conflict persists. As a result, the most telling power of Hamas is its ability to replace the fighters it loses with new ones. Estimates of Hamas's fighting strength bear out this logic. According to the Israeli military, in early 2025, Hamas had as many as 23,000 fighters, a figure roughly the same as an Israeli estimate of the group's size prior to October 7, 2023. Hamas can recruit new fighters because it still enjoys support. Surveying public opinion is the best way to measure how much support exists among Palestinians for Hamas. The best available surveys conducted among Palestinian populations in Gaza and the West Bank are by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), an independent, nonprofit survey center established in 1993 following the Oslo accords, that collaborates with Israeli scholars and institutions. My previous June 2024 analysis relied on the PSR surveys from 2023 and 2024. When recent surveys from May 2025 are added to the mix, a striking finding emerges: Hamas has more support among Palestinians today than it did before October 7. In September 2023, Fatah enjoyed a four-point lead over Hamas (26 to 22 percent). In polling from May 2025, Hamas now enjoys an 11-point lead over Fatah (32 to 21 percent). The shift toward Hamas is particularly acute in the West Bank, where support for Hamas has more than doubled. There, support for armed attacks on Israeli civilians has risen from 48 percent in June 2023 to 59 percent in May 2025. In September 2023, Hamas had a 13-point lead over Fatah in Gaza (38 to 25 percent), and in May 2025, the numbers were almost the same: Hamas held a 12-point edge over Fatah (37 to 25 percent). Far from dwindling, support for Hamas has grown or remained the same, and the willingness of Palestinians to attack Israeli civilians remains high enough to satisfy Hamas's recruiting needs, despite the most brutal punishment campaign by a Western democracy in history. Hamas's abiding popularity could be a factor in wider violence beyond Gaza. With Israeli forces stepping up raids on Palestinian refugee camps and settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, the region is now a powder keg. Recent Israeli plans to expand settlements in the West Bank and rhetoric from far-right figures calling for the territory's annexation will likely add fuel to this potential fire. Israel's announced intention to seize control of at least 75 percent of Gaza and then confine Gazans to a small portion of territory won't succeed in divorcing the population from Hamas. As Palestinians are driven into a small corner of the enclave, Hamas will just move with them; this plan is no more likely to defeat Hamas than were the previous population transfers that forced people from area to area inside Gaza. Israel could go further still, expelling Gazans into the Sinai Desert, but such a drastic measure would stoke the possibility of future retributive violence targeting Israelis. And most damaging for long-term Israeli security, throwing Gazans out of the territory would leave Israel open to accusations of engaging in ethnic cleansing, undermining any moral case for supporting the country. Military operations that, intentionally or not, result in historic levels of civilian deaths are ultimately leading to a more dangerous situation for Israel, making it a less desirable home for Jews and a more likely target for those seeking revenge. Instead, Israel should establish a new security perimeter between Israeli civilian population centers and the Palestinians in Gaza, allowing Gazans enough space to rebuild their lives, letting humanitarian and economic aid to flow into the territory unimpeded, and working with international allies to foster alternative political arrangements to Hamas or Israeli control in Gaza. The war in Gaza, however, has seen a swelling tide of condemnation of Israel for committing intentional harm to civilians, mass atrocities, and even genocide. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants that require some 125 countries, including France and the United Kingdom, to detain Israel's prime minister and other members of Israel's cabinet. Even within Israel, prominent voices are calling for a course correction: former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has declared that Israel's actions in Gaza are tantamount to a “war crime,” arguing that “what we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: the indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.” As Israel becomes an international pariah and faces stiffening resistance to its rule in Gaza, the historic scale of its punishment of civilians is only jeopardizing the country's long-term security. Many Western countries have already begun to make moves to chastise Israel, including by joining much of the rest of the world in formally recognizing a Palestinian state, a step that could lead to large-scale humanitarian intervention in Gaza and economic sanctions on Israel. The United States will likely not follow that path, but U.S. President Donald Trump is mercurial. He has already contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and insisted that the starvation of Gaza must end. Rifts within Trump's base are widening over Israel. U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leading hard-right Republican, declared that Israel is in fact committing genocide in Gaza, borrowing from rhetoric heard more often on the left. Israel is the most militarily powerful country in the Middle East and has scored numerous victories over its opponents in recent years. But it is also a tiny country surrounded by rivals. And it needs close relations with major Western democracies to ensure the viability of its economy. Those relations could be tested and strained as Israel continues waging the worst campaign of civilian punishment ever performed by a Western democracy, a campaign that has not come close to eliminating Hamas and has given Israel more adversaries and left it more isolated. Israeli leaders must decide whether their ongoing immoral actions in Gaza are really worth the costs to their country's future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's cooperation with Russia is reasonable and lawful, as well as deserving of respect and protection, Chinese Embassy Spokesperson Liu Pengyu told TASS in response to potential new US import tariffs targeting China over its trade relations with Russia. "The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Russia within the framework of international law. This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected," Liu stated. "China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. Tariff wars have no winners. Coercion and pressuring will lead nowhere." Liu noted that "recently, China and the U.S. held the latest round of China-US economic and trade talks in Stockholm," where both sides "reviewed and affirmed the implementation of the consensus reached in the economic and trade talks in Geneva and the framework agreed on in London talks." "We hope that the US can work with China to continue adhering to the important consensus reached by the two heads of state during their phone talks, make full use of the role of the China-US economic and trade consultation mechanism, keep enhancing consensus, reducing misunderstandings and strengthening cooperation, further deepen dialogue and consultations, and strive for more win-win outcomes," the spokesperson concluded. Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that The Washington administration may impose additional tariffs on China for trading with Russia. When asked about the matter during a White House press briefing, the US leader said that it will depend on how things go.</p>
