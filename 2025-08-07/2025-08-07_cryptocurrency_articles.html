                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins - Bitcoin dominates crypto markets, but altcoins like Dogecoin, Sui, and Pudgy Penguins show rising traction amid fragmented altcoin season. - Pudgy Penguins ($0.035) expands into physical merchandise and Web3 licensing, sustaining community engagement despite token price declines. - Altcoin season index remains below 40, but traders favor assets with fundamentals, liquidity, or unique value propositions over pure meme speculation. Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but signs of a shift toward select altcoins are becoming evident. These assets showcase varying strengths, from liquidity and developer support to brand-driven community engagement [1]. Despite no major technical developments in recent months, DOGE continues to benefit from consistent social media activity and speculation around potential ETF mentions. This has helped maintain its presence in short-term trading strategies. Historically, Dogecoin often sees inflows at the start of altcoin season, and this pattern appears to be emerging again as other meme tokens struggle with inconsistent volume [1]. Pudgy Penguins, a token tied to an NFT collection, is valued at around $0.035, with daily volume surpassing $650 million and a market cap of approximately $2.2 billion. While the token is down from its peak, it remains more active than many other NFT-linked assets. The altcoin season index remains below 40, suggesting that most capital is still concentrated in Bitcoin. However, traders are showing renewed interest in altcoins with strong fundamentals, consistent performance, or unique value propositions. Dogecoin offers reliable liquidity, Sui presents ongoing protocol development, and Pudgy Penguins merges community-driven momentum with commercial expansion. While rotation remains limited, these tokens provide alternative entry points for traders seeking exposure outside the top two cryptocurrencies [1].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Howells, from Newport, who claimed his ex-girlfriend mistakenly threw away a hard drive containing 8,000 bitcoins in 2013, has given up on retrieving the wallet, currently worth £695m, but has been hit with a £117,000 legal bill from his fight. Instead of buying the site to retrieve it, he has now launched his own cryptocurrency - Ceiniog Coin - to try and regain some of his money. "We will not be spending any more of our officers' time on this issue until that payment is made," the council told BBC News. Mr Howells has spent significant time and energy trying to access the site and recover the cryptocurrency, once describing it as his "9 to 5". But in January, Newport council asked a High Court judge to strike out Mr Howells' legal action to access the landfill or get £495m in compensation. Judge Keyser KC said there were no "reasonable grounds" for bringing the claim and "no realistic prospect" of succeeding at a full trial. This led Mr Howells to represent himself at the Court of Appeal in London, using artificial intelligence to support his case, but this was rejected. Earlier this year, the council announced that the landfill site is set to close, after which Mr Howells said he intended to buy it. "In July, I made a multi-million pound offer to Newport City Council. A spokesperson for the council said that Mr Howells "currently owes the council just short of £117,000 in legal costs, costs which we occurred defending his claim for £500m submitted last year". It added that the council has a duty to the taxpayer to recover this money and to ensure that council resources are "used efficiently, and that officers time is not taken up unnecessarily". "As such, the council has responded to Mr Howells' correspondence, reiterating that he is required to pay us these costs, and that we will not be spending any more of our officers' time on this issue until that payment is made," it added. Responding to the council's comments, Mr Howells said it was "effectively holding the landfill sale process in an attempt to force a payment", something he described as "financial coercion". But this tactic of using unrelated debts to shut down a lawful offer - one that's in the public interest - raises serious questions, not just legally but morally," he added. Speaking to BBC News on Thursday, he said he remained "open to a proper discussion" with council leaders until 17:00 BST on Friday, "after which I no longer care what they do, and will move forward with a tokenisation proposal regardless". The council said it would not be commenting further. Bitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. Satoshis are named after bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto - believed to be a pseudonym – who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008. Those investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a "very small" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter. Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being "very quickly enamoured with it", Mr Bambrough said. He now intends to "tokenise" the full value of the wallet assets into a new Bitcoin-based smart token called Ceiniog Coin (INI), which he intends to launch later this year. Mr Howells will use his Bitcoin wallet value as a "store-of-value or 'vault'" providing backing for the new token. Josh Riddict, a cryptocurrency expert, said there are many coins in crypto ecosystems that have "value derived from some kind of asset backing or vault". "Since James' wallet is publicly known and the blockchain is there for all to see, its easy evidence that these 8,000 coins do indeed exist. "Ultimately the market will decide how valuable they deem this new coin offering to be," he added. Police ask people not to speculate following the death of one-year-old Jayla-Jean Mclaren. Seven men are charged with violent disorder following an incident in Newport. Residents told councillors traffic clogged rural lanes around Caynton during previous work on the A41.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Binance sees sharp spike in altcoin deposits. Altcoins saw a broad-based rotation in July. Despite the rally, rising exchange inflows and BTC.D stalling below 63% suggest traders may be exiting into strength. July marked a decisive shift in crypto market structure. Total crypto market cap surged 13.3%, driven by Bitcoin [BTC] retesting all-time highs. But the headline move: Ethereum [ETH]-led rotation, fueled by a record 19-day streak of net inflows into spot ETH ETFs. Despite BTC's headline rally, Bitcoin dominance [BTC.D] dropped 5.2% to 60.6%, while altcoin dominance spiked 10% to 39.2%, marking the strongest rotation since early 2021. Zooming in on leadership dynamics, Ethereum dominance [ETH.D] spiked over 12%, reclaiming levels not seen since the “Trump pump,” with the BTC–ETH ratio widening as capital flowed down the risk curve. TOTAL3 (the market cap excluding BTC and ETH) saw a $100 billion+ influx post-BTC ATH, signaling aggressive flows into the long tail of altcoins, with traders clearly chasing momentum across outliers. Since tapping a $1.07 trillion local top, TOTAL3 has rolled over to $980 billion, logging roughly $20 billion in outflows over the past two weeks. At the same time, BTC.D printed two strong weekly green candles. BTC remains just under ATH levels, yet altcoins are seeing a surge in inflows. While it hints at altcoin rotation, the aggressive inflows suggest traders may be exiting into strength, not rotating. In short, the market's at a key pivot. July's rally pushed risk assets into overbought levels, with altcoins looking stretched. If this stalls out further, we're likely looking at a cooldown phase before any fresh breakout. Trading, buying or selling cryptocurrencies should be considered a high-risk investment and every reader is advised to do their own research before making any decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ETH treasury firm has entered into an agreement to sell its common stock to four institutional investors, with shares priced at $19.50 each. “Sharplink is proud to be joined by globally-recognized institutional investors, augmenting our strong existing investor base and further validating our mission to be the world's leading ETH treasury,” Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom said Thursday in a statement. Sharplink Gaming did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for additional comment. As part of that trend, several Ethereum treasury firms have emerged over the past year, catapulting Ethereum to its highest price in roughly two years. Ethereum was recently trading at $3,812, just 22% below its record price of $4,878 that it touched during the bull run of 2021, according to data provider CoinGecko. Sharplink held 521,939 ETH worth $1.9 billion as of August 3, according to its filings with federal regulators. The company initiated its Ethereum-accumulation strategy in June of this year. Fifty-five percent of bettors on Myriad Markets, an events-contract platform, have wagered that Sharplink will not accumulate at least one million ETH before mid-September. Myriad is owned by Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt. The largest ETH treasury firm is the Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion, which holds roughly $2.9 billion in ETH, according to publicly available data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since Donald Trump was reelected as president, Washington, D.C., has made many moves to become friendlier with the world of cryptocurrency. From new laws to executive orders, the Trump administration and Congress are moving quickly to make the U.S. a leader in digital assets innovation. Another example arrived on Thursday when Trump said he would sign an EO that broadens the availability of crypto and other alternative assets in retirement plans. Some advisors, led most notably by Ric Edelman, say that investors should hold as much as 40% of their portfolio in digital assets (primarily as an update on the 60% stock-40% bond investment model). Cryptocurrency isn't new, with a history now dating back almost two decades, but it continues to disrupt the markets. Cryptocurrency ETFs are one example, experiencing explosive growth, all the while evolving at a rapid pace in investment strategy. Crypto ETFs have seen record inflows this year, at roughly $13 billion, making them one of the most popular portfolio choices within the ETF universe, and led by flagship bitcoin ETFs such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). ETFs offer convenience for the long-term investor as a way to gain exposure to the asset class without holding an underlying cryptocurrency and needing to open a crypto wallet or use a crypto exchange. "From our perspective, demand is really strong, investors are really interested," said Eric Pan, CEO of ICI, the fund industry trade association, on a recent edition of CNBC's "ETF Edge." "And we have a new regulatory environment here in Washington that is encouraging this kind of innovation," Pan added. Bitcoin and ethereum have generated strong returns, though not without their fair share of volatility to match the gains. Both cryptocurrencies popped on the news about Trump pushing the government to make them broadly available in 401(k) plans. July was a winning month, in particular, for ether and bitcoin ETFs, which have had $5 billion and $6 billion inflows during the month, out of a ETF industry cumulative haul of $55 billion in net new money from investors. But within the world of retirement plans, access to crypto ETFs remains limited. Retirement plans that offer self-directed brokerage window options alongside company-sponsored 401(k)s and individual IRAs already offer investors ways to invest in crypto like bitcoin. One of those evolutions within crypto space has been leveraged funds, which provide double or triple exposure to individual digital currencies, such as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), which provides double exposure to Ripple's XRP. Leveraged and inverse ETFs have ballooned as an asset class, offering a way for traders to make big bets on some of the market's most popular assets, like tech stocks, whether they want to bet the asset is going to increase or decrease in value on any given day. But these types of funds are not meant for the faint of heart, the risk-averse, or, most importantly, to be held as a long-term investments. "This is an aggressive product, it's leveraged, it's not designed to be bought and held, it's designed to be traded each day," said Sal Gilberte, Teucrium Trading's president, on the recent edition of CNBC's "ETF Edge." The exposure provided via such funds comes at a lower cost than buying equivalent holdings. While leverage funds offer the potential for big returns, double or triple the market return, they also increase the risk factor, which is why investors need to be savvy and "understand what they're owning", Gilberte said. If investors are looking for a steady exposure to crypto, non-leveraged crypto ETFs such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF or VanEck Ethereum ETF might be better options. "They should buy a fund that just holds the token, and goes up and down with the token very smoothly with no leverage whatsoever," Gilberte said. Watch the video above to learn more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've been at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Annual Convention in Cleveland since August 6. I came expecting to hear about the state of our industry under Donald Trump's second presidency, especially how to navigate the administration's anti-DEI policies, which many in the Black community see as a direct attack on progress. I thought the talk would be about AI: how to use it, how to control it, and whether it was a threat to our profession. I definitely did not expect to talk about crypto. He looked more like a recent graduate than a veteran, and when I approached him, it turned out I was right. Unlike me, he wasn't a journalist; he's the Special assistant to the mayor of Cleveland, a changemaker in his community. “Crypto, huh?” he asked, his interest immediate and genuine. Usually, it's the AI part that grabs people's attention. Baxter's knowledge of crypto was built on the same clichés I hear all the time: that it's a tool for criminals, a mirage, something that will disappear as quickly as it came. Listening to him, I realized we in the media have failed. We haven't done our job of serving a community that is hungry for answers but is being left out of the conversation. I started by explaining that the crypto industry is basically a decentralized, tech-driven version of the financial system. Imagine all the services your bank offers, but built on a technology called blockchain and without any middlemen. Every transaction is a new entry that is visible to everyone, and once it's written down, it can't be erased or altered. This creates a transparent and secure system that isn't controlled by any single company or government. “Is that true?” he exclaimed, his eyes wide. I told him that cryptocurrencies, by their nature, don't discriminate. Think of it like a highly advanced vending machine: you put in your money, and the code guarantees you get your product without a human needing to approve the sale. The code doesn't care about your skin color, your credit history, or where you live. This is a massive departure from traditional banking. I explained that for communities that face enormous barriers to financial services, crypto offers a potential alternative. The 2023 FDIC survey found that 5.6 million U.S. households have no bank account, with Black, Hispanic, and lower-income households being the most affected. He told me this was another aspect no one in his circle ever talks about. “People don't know that,” he said. I mentioned that crypto adoption is highest in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, places where millions are denied access to banks and where people in the diaspora need a cheap way to send money back home. I told him that crypto should, in theory, be embraced by underprivileged communities because of its transparent and non-discriminatory nature. But he, like so many others, associated it with crime. While it's true that criminals use crypto, the data tells a more nuanced story. According to the analytics firm Chainalysis, illicit transactions made up a tiny fraction of total crypto volume in recent years. I explained that the President of the United States, his family, and many of the world's wealthiest people and corporations, like Tesla, hold Bitcoin in their portfolios. He asked about Bitcoin, which for him, was synonymous with the entire industry. The people who bought it at that time must be multi-millionaires,” he said, a sense of wonder in his voice. I explained that the most important question to ask before buying any cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin, Ether, or Solana, is: What is the project behind it? “But do you think it'll last?” he asked. Then I asked him if he'd heard of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. I explained how they could revolutionize money transfers, making them nearly instant and incredibly cheap. People like us are always late to the party.” I tried to tell him it wasn't too late, but he was stuck on a thought. He explained that there's a cliché that Black people in crypto must be engaged in criminal activity. “We are always the last people,” Baxter said, a look of disgust on his face. “We miss all the trains to get rich.” He was disgusted that his community had missed the boat on an industry that could, in principle, solve some of the very problems of discrimination they face every day. And I was left wondering how many other Jadens are out there: curious, ambitious, and waiting for a conversation that no one seems willing to have with them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But it's definitely spent some time in the wilderness due to multiple ownership changes, directionless plans and waning community sentiment. The NFT project had one of the most highly anticipated mints ever in April 2022, and with prices once again soaring and momentum building, much of the renewed optimism centers around one name: Spencer. Known simply as Spencer on X, the new owner of Moonbirds is no stranger to NFTs — he's a prolific collector and head of “Spencer Ventures,” an institutional-grade NFT fund. “I bought my first Bored Ape at like 2.8 ETH. At the time, Spencer was writing venture checks, and he came to an unusual but very profitable conclusion. That single bet ended up outperforming all of my venture investments by a pretty wide margin.” Spencer is optimistic about “Birbs” being able to fly once more and playing a pivotal part in a larger comeback of the NFT space. “There wasn't a lot of attention, especially net new attention in the NFT space for quite a while. But I always believed the most important thing to build toward in a bear market is being top of mind for that friend who stayed plugged in. The one you call to find out what's next and who should I join. In my mind, that was always the Moonbirds customer,” Spencer says. With the recent run up of NFTs led by collections such as CryptoPunks and Moonbirds, Spencer's arrival could be the beginning of a turnaround to rival the Pudgy Penguins 2.0 success story. If you've spent any time on NFT Twitter, chances are you've come across Spencer, one of the most active voices in the space. He comes from the class of 2021 and says it's possible no one has traded more NFTs in the world than he has. I parlayed the success of my personal NFT trading into a fund. At peak, we did about 5% of market volume on Blur. I would make the argument no one who has traded more NFTs than me and my team. It's a reflection of how immersed he's been in the market's every twist and turn. That success laid the groundwork for his interest in Moonbirds. “The team we've built is incredibly good at taking IP and bringing it to life. At some point, it makes sense to have our own IP,” he says. I've made money trading memecoins, too, but it's not the same. Everyone who's stuck around is nostalgic for the era of trading NFTs.” As Moonbirds continue their fast run up in price and enthusiasm for the project's future, many are wondering: Is Spencer going to pull off a Luca Netz? You should ‘go and build' your own AI agent: Jesse Pollak, X Hall of Flame Who takes gold in the crypto and blockchain Olympics? From physical toys in Walmart to viral content to having its mascot, Pengu, ring the opening bell for the Nasdaq on Wall Street, the cultural relevance of Pudgy Penguins is undeniable. Now, Spencer has his sights set on following a similar playbook. That is really why he won I think — against a lot of other people over that period of time — was because he had this perspective that nobody else had,” Spencer says. Where the Luca Netz comparison really lands is Spencer's unapologetic commitment to action over aspiration. In his first 51 days, Spencer has dropped a custom Moonbirds-themed Pokémon-style card for holders, secured an airdrop through a project backed by a16z and Coinbase Ventures, launched a new X presence for Mythics, negotiated OpenSea branding changes and brought visibility roaring back to the brand. People shouldn't have to say, ‘I think they'll deliver.' They should say, ‘Look at what's been delivered. “We've also made a couple of key hires and begun a couple partnerships, some of which I can't share. I think you can look at what was a really strong first 51 days right. I don't know what the next 51 days are going to look like, but if it's like the first 51, I think we're in really good shape.” Moonbirds was once the envy of the NFT world, peaking at the height of last cycle's NFT collective euphoria with a floor price of just under 40 ETH shortly after mint. “It's just a collection people want to see win,” Spencer says. And if the Luca Netz playbook for Pudgy Penguins is anything to go by, they just might. Spencer has a pretty simple philosophy for rebuilding trust in the brand. “It's very understandable if you feel burned, maybe there's some new liquidity and you just want to get out. I don't need to win that person back.” “There are some people that really want to see it come back, and those people I want to activate. I'm most excited about someone who remembers how cool Moonbirds were in 2022 but never owned one. Now they finally have the opportunity to collect. This is how to make — and lose — a fortune with NFTs The blockchain projects making renewable energy a reality Prior to NFTs, a lot of my net worth is on trading cards. Trading cards is a very large part of my personal portfolio. That's a big, big one that I like.From the art side of things, I think Nick Kuder is really interesting. It's a fun little side thing that not a lot of people know, so I do like Nick Kuder's Rings Genesis collection. With the initial Moonbirds mint, how many birds did you have in your wallet within the first 24 hours?None. My collecting of Moonbirds also happened post FTX. I'm one of these people who saw the disgusting face melting run that Moonbirds went on with just nothing but utter jealousy and, you know, admittedly some amount of contempt. It's cheating because that's my PFP, but I'll go with cosmic. I think bar none that if all that mattered in NFTs was how something looked, Mythics would probably be the top collection in the world. It's great, and I feel very strongly about that. And if you do, it's really hard not to buy one. The team has launched a new dedicated X account @MythicBirbs. I wouldn't enter the space purely as a trader. I think that if you enter the space as a trader and collector, you're better having a rule for that if you don't like it, don't buy it. I think that's what you have to do. Who are your top three favorite follows for NFTs on Crypto Twitter? If you want to see interesting different opinions, I'd say the following: Seedphrase is really good and an interesting follow. I actually think people might see this one as a controversial one, but I think Wizard of SoHo generally is a better trader than most people will admit that he is, so I like Wizard. Where do you see Moonbirds this time in 12 months?As I said, the first 51 days, I think we've done a pretty good job. If we can continue streaks of 51 days that are as productive, then at the end of this, we should be in a good spot.

Ant Group affiliate aims to promote blockchain technology for the tokenisation of real-world assets, executive says

Ant Digital Technologies, an affiliate of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, is promoting its blockchain platform for asset tokenisation in Hong Kong, a week after the city's stablecoin law came into effect.

Ant is positioning itself as a “portal” that connects Web2 and Web3, “providing more credible assets to Web3 and more compliant capital to Web2”, Bian Zhuoqun, vice-president of Ant Group and president of blockchain business at Ant Digital, said at an event in Hong Kong on Thursday.

Ant Digital in April announced Jovay, a “completely self-developed” Layer 2 public blockchain that does not issue cryptocurrencies, Bian said. Jovay was specifically built for RWA transactions in overseas markets, Ant Digital said in a blog post then.

What's the hype about stablecoins?

The company planned to officially launch Jovay in September, at which point it would be able to run “real money”, Bian added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pharos, a Layer 1 blockchain focused on Real-World Asset Finance (RWAfi), are integrating Morpho's lending infrastructure natively into its mainnet, marking a strategic step toward building credit rails for both institutional and decentralized participants in DeFi lending market. The collaboration is aimed at bringing modular, transparent lending systems to real-world assets on-chain. Pharos is not the first Layer 1 to focus on real-world assets, but the platform's emphasis on building modular systems with institutional compatibility gives this collaboration a different weight. Wish Wu, CTO and Co-Founder of Pharos, framed the collaboration as foundational. “For us, working together with Morpho is about building trust and composability at the core of RWAfi,” Wu said. “By integrating Morpho's lending infrastructure directly into our mainnet, we're laying the foundation for a more transparent and capital-efficient on-chain credit ecosystem.” Their infrastructure is already used for various crypto-backed loans and custom yield products. Kirk Hutchison, who leads new chain growth at Morpho, sees the collaboration as a way to extend those lending frameworks into newer territories. “Deploying natively on Pharos allows us to keep extending Morpho's most trusted lending infrastructure to the real-world asset space following initial success like private credit and tokenized stocks,” Hutchison said. RWAfi, short for Real-World Asset Finance, refers to financial systems that bring real-world assets, such as credit, invoices, real estate, or tokenized equity, onto public blockchains. These systems aim to improve transparency, automation, and capital efficiency while reducing dependence on opaque intermediaries. It also requires robust infrastructure for pricing, credit modeling, liquidity routing, and risk segregation. By deploying on Pharos, Morpho's infrastructure can provide tools for asset originators to spin up lending markets with isolated risk exposure, composable underwriting models, and automated collateral management. It also allows institutional lenders to allocate capital using transparent, programmable logic rather than relying on opaque term sheets. Pharos' upcoming vault products, powered by Morpho, are expected to include structured lending strategies and capital deployment frameworks. That modularity is critical for experimenting with new forms of yield structures and underwriting logic. Retail users will benefit from more accessible yield opportunities that are backed by real-world cash flows rather than purely crypto-native assets. On the other side, institutional participants get a sandbox for programmable credit with auditability and composability. The launch of yet another RWA protocol is not newsworthy in itself. Too many RWA projects have focused on tokenizing assets without rethinking the credit, compliance, or custody infrastructure that needs to support them. Credit markets need to be transparent, programmable, and modular—qualities that have often been missing from past RWA efforts. If the collaboration delivers, it could offer a test case for how on-chain lending should work when assets are tied to real-world value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC), China is quietly changing course. This is due in part to slow adoption and a recent corruption scandal involving its key architect. Now, officials are warming up to a more flexible alternative: stablecoins. The change comes amid growing concern in China over the dominance of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which continue to expand in global trade and cross-border payments. In early August, new legislation came into effect  allowing licensed entities to issue stablecoins backed by fiat currencies—including potentially the Chinese yuan. However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) isn't rushing to approve. JD.com has already piloted a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin and plans to launch it officially later this year. The token, issued on a public blockchain, will be integrated into JD's payments infrastructure in Hong Kong and Macau. Ant Group is also preparing to apply for stablecoin licenses in both Hong Kong and Singapore, signaling a broader push to internationalize the yuan via blockchain rails. Both companies argue that offshore yuan stablecoins are crucial for boosting the renminbi's role in global trade and reducing reliance on dollar-based tokens. Yao Qian, the former lead architect of China's CBDC, was recently expelled from the Communist Party and is under investigation for taking bribes—allegedly even in crypto. The market is worth $247 billion and could surpass $2 trillion by 2028. More than 99% of circulating stablecoins  are pegged to the U.S. dollar, giving Washington a major soft power advantage. In contrast, the yuan's share of global payments is just 2.9%. China's exporters are increasingly opting for dollar stablecoins like USDT to bypass controls and settle international transactions quickly. Even Chinese regulators now acknowledge that the country needs to offer an alternative or risk falling behind entirely. State-owned enterprises have reportedly expressed interest  in using RMB stablecoins for cross-border trade, but capital controls and compliance concerns remain a major obstacle. That means progress will likely remain slow and closely supervised.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The daily average fluctuated between a low of 252.46 cents, on July 11, and a high of 269.57 cents five days later on July 16. Share your coffee stories with us by writing to info@comunicaffe.com. MILAN – Uncertainties weighing on the world economy and the global geopolitical picture had a significant impact on the coffee market in July, pushing prices down, with double-digit declines for all indicators, and keeping volatility high, shows the monthly report of the ICO, released yesterday, Wednesday, Aug. 6. The daily average fluctuated between a low of 252.46 cents, on July 11, and a high of 269.57 cents five days later on July 16. In fact, the average Robusta indicator lost 14.8% plunging to 167.19 cents, the lowest level since November 2023. The London indicator plummeted (-16.3%) also reflecting the substantial replenishment of ICE Robusta's certified stocks (see below). On the Arabica side, the average indicators for Colombian Milds, Other Milds, and Brazilian Naturals fell by 10.5%, 10.4%, and 12.3%, respectively. Volatility has increased slightly further to 10.2%, peaking at 16.6% for the London indicator. Arabica exports remained relatively stable (-0.7%) at 7.077 million, with the significant decrease in Brazilian Naturals (-19.5%) being almost entirely counterbalanced by an increase in Colombian Milds (+18.5%) and Other Milds (+16%). As a result, world coffee exports for the first nine months of the 2024/25 coffee year (October–June) are roughly on par with those of the equivalent period of 2023/24 (-0.2%), standing at 104.141 million. A slight increase in Arabica volumes (+0.2%) was matched by a slight decline in Robusta shipments (-0.7%). Within the Arabica category, the decrease in Brazilian Naturals (-5.6%) was fully offset by increases in Colombian Milds (15.9%) and Other Milds (2.4%). ICO maintains its estimate of world production and consumption unchanged at 178 and 177 million bags respectively, forecasting a slight production surplus after two years of deficits. Since the first issue, on May 1st 2002, the objective of Comunicaffe International has been to provide an updated, punctual and essential information service to operators in the sector. The idea is to be useful, providing information on the coffee, cocoa and tea supply chains in order to develop critical thinking and debate. Comunicaffe International is also a daily newsletter sent to 38.000 professionals in Italy and more than 85.000 worldwide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These are the fundamental infrastructure of the entire ecosystem, but they often face challenges such as insufficient incentives, unbalanced governance, and even increasing centralization. This year, Polymarket has repeatedly been at the center of public opinion, particularly with events surrounding Trump's election victory, oracle manipulation in Ukraine's rare earth trade, and political betting on the color of Zelenskyy's suit. The sheer scale of capital and market influence it carries make these controversies particularly challenging. Why have public infrastructure like The Graph failed to fulfill their intended role? What form should a truly usable and sustainable data indexing public good take? In July 2024, Goldsky experienced a six-hour outage (Goldsky is a real-time blockchain data infrastructure platform for Web3 developers, providing indexing, subgraph and streaming data services to help quickly build data-driven decentralized applications), which paralyzed a large part of the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, the DeFi front-end was unable to display users' positions and balance data, and the prediction market Polymarket was unable to display correct data. This shouldn't happen in the world of decentralized applications. After all, wasn't blockchain technology designed to eliminate single points of failure? The Goldsky incident exposed a disturbing truth: while blockchains themselves are as decentralized as possible, the infrastructure used by applications built on them often includes a large number of centralized services. The reason for this is that blockchain data indexing and retrieval are non-exclusive, non-rivalrous digital public goods. Users often expect them to be free or extremely low-cost, but these services require continuous and intensive investment in hardware, storage, bandwidth, and operations personnel. Public welfare projects like Gitcoin have repeatedly emphasized that "open source infrastructure can create billions of dollars in value, but authors often can't rely on it to pay their mortgages." This serves as a stark reminder that the decentralized world urgently needs to diversify Web3 infrastructure through public goods funding, redistribution, or community-driven initiatives. We urge DApp developers to build local-first products and the technical community to consider data retrieval service failures when designing DApps, ensuring that users can still interact with projects even without data retrieval infrastructure. Most users are accustomed to using tools like Etherscan to track on-chain transaction status, obtain necessary information on the front-end, and initiate transactions and interact with contracts. But where does this data displayed on the user's front-end actually come from? Suppose you are building a lending protocol that needs to display a user's holdings, as well as the margin and debt status of each position. This is like asking someone to manually search millions of pages of ledgers for specific information - technically feasible, but extremely slow and inefficient. In fact, it is difficult for the front-end to complete this retrieval process. Therefore, we must introduce infrastructure to accelerate data acquisition. At this point, some readers may be curious about the existence of a decentralized data retrieval platform called TheGraph within the Ethereum ecosystem. Some readers here may be curious why there are multiple operators in SubGraph? There is no implementation for how data flows into the SubGraph program and what kind of database the final output results are written to. These contents need to be implemented by the SubGraph operator himself. Generally speaking, SubGraph operators will make node modifications to achieve faster speeds. After the introduction of this technology solution, TheGraph can achieve faster data retrieval than before. However, Goldsky has not openly disclosed the core program running its SubGraph. As mentioned above, TheGraph is a decentralized data retrieval platform. Taking the Uniswap v3 subgraph as an example, we can see that there are a large number of operators providing data retrieval for Uniswap v3. Therefore, we can also regard TheGraph as an integration platform for SubGraph operators. Users can send their own SubGraph code to TheGraph, and then there are some operators inside TheGraph that can help users retrieve data. TheGraph has a completely different fee structure than conventional billing. This fee structure is related to the token economics of GRT. Register an API KEY in the TheGraph backend and use the API KEY to request data retrieved by operators in TheGraph. According to the profit distribution method mentioned above, they need to tell other participants that my query service is better and can get more money. They need to stake GRT, which is similar to advertising and guaranteeing themselves that there will be profits, so that people will come. During testing, developers can deploy SubGraph to the TheGraph platform for free. TheGraph will then assist users with some searches, providing a free quota for testing purposes. If developers believe SubGraph performs well within TheGraph's official testing environment, they can publish it to the public network and wait for other operators to participate in the search. Developers cannot directly pay a single operator for guaranteed search access; instead, multiple operators compete to provide services, avoiding a single point of dependency. This process requires using GRT tokens to perform curation (also known as signaling) on their SubGraph. This involves developers staking a certain amount of GRT into their deployed SubGraph. Operators will only participate in the SubGraph search process when the staked GRT reaches a certain level (previously consulted data is 10,000 GRT). For most project developers, using TheGraph is a relatively cumbersome process. While purchasing GRT tokens is relatively easy for Web3 projects, the process of curating deployed SubGraphs and waiting for operators is quite inefficient. Obviously, for most developers, it is simpler to directly choose Goldsky. This has also led to the situation of relying on a single product in blockchain data indexing and retrieval services. Clearly, TheGraph's complex GRT token economics have hindered widespread adoption. For example, GRT's curation and staking mechanisms shouldn't be exposed to users. The above disparagement of TheGraph is not my personal opinion. As for how to solve the single point of failure in data retrieval, we have actually mentioned it above. That is, developers can consider using TheGraph service, but the process will be more complicated. Developers need to buy GRT tokens for staking curation and paying API fees. Currently, there are a lot of data retrieval software in the EVM ecosystem. For details, you can refer to The State of EVM Indexing written by Dune or the summary of EVM data retrieval software written by rindexer. For another more recent discussion, please refer to this tweet. This article will not discuss the specific cause of Glodsky's issues. Glodsky currently knows the cause, but is only disclosing it to enterprise users. This means that no third party can currently determine the exact nature of Glodsky's failure. Why do I recommend using ponder instead of other software? Ponder is still under rapid development, and developers may encounter situations where previous projects become inoperable due to breaking updates. Readers with a technical background are encouraged to consult the documentation. A more interesting detail about Ponder is that it has also begun partial commercialization, but Ponder's commercialization path is very consistent with the "isolation theory" discussed in the previous article. Therefore, charging for public goods will cause some users to stop using them, and social benefits will not be maximized (this is described in economic terms as "no longer Pareto optimal"). In theory, public goods can be priced differently for each user, but the costs of differential pricing are likely to outweigh the benefits. Therefore, the reason public goods are free is not that they are inherently free, but rather that any fixed fee will harm social benefits, and there is currently no cheap way to implement differentiated pricing for each user. This is clearly an application of the "isolation theory" principle: developers who are unwilling to operate and maintain the Ponder service themselves are isolated, and these developers can obtain simplified Ponder deployment services for a fee. Furthermore, when using ponder, the validity of RPC return data should be considered. While there's no direct evidence linking the Goldsky incident to invalid RPC return data, I suspect Goldsky may have encountered a similar issue. Local-first has been a hot topic for the past few years. Simply put, local-first requires software to have the following features: Currently, most discussions related to local-first technologies often touch upon CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type). In a distributed environment, CRDT can guarantee data integrity and consistency. However, in blockchain development, we can relax the aforementioned software requirements for local-first. Furthermore, the local-first requirement for cross-client collaboration is already addressed by blockchain. This local-first DApp design philosophy significantly improves application resiliency, preventing unavailability in the event of a data retrieval service crash. Regardless of usability, the best local-first applications require users to run a local node and then retrieve data locally using tools like trueblocks. While blockchains inherently offer decentralization and resistance to single points of failure, the application ecosystems built on them remain highly dependent on centralized infrastructure services. This reliance poses systemic risks to the entire ecosystem. This article briefly explains why TheGraph, a long-standing decentralized search service, is not widely used today, specifically discussing the complexities introduced by the GRT token economics. Finally, this article discusses how to build a more robust data search infrastructure. I encourage developers to use the Ponder self-hosted data search framework as an emergency response option and also outline a promising path to commercialization for Ponder. Finally, this article discusses the local-first development philosophy, encouraging developers to build applications that can function even without a data search service.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In its July 2025 crypto monthly recap report, global investment management firm VanEck suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could emerge as a superior store of value compared to Bitcoin (BTC). In recent years, a growing number of companies have diversified their treasuries by allocating capital to digital assets – most notably Bitcoin. However, emerging trends show that corporations are also beginning to accumulate Ethereum, recognizing its potential as both a yield-generating and deflationary asset. VanEck's report emphasizes that while Bitcoin's finite supply and predictable issuance policies make it a strong candidate for a store of value, Ethereum provides greater financial flexibility. In particular, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, collect network revenue, and participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield. Ethereum's initial issuance rate at launch was 14.4%, compared to Bitcoin's 9.3%. However, two major policy changes have since dramatically reduced ETH's inflation rate – bringing it below Bitcoin's. The second transformative event was “The Merge” in September 2022, when Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Following these changes, ETH's inflation rate fell below Bitcoin's for the first time in March 2023. Since then, ETH's supply has grown by only 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin's 3%. Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%). Over the past month, several companies have unveiled Ethereum-focused treasury strategies. For instance, cryptocurrency firm Bit Digital recently crossed 120,000 ETH in total holdings. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed that its ETH holdings had surged past 833,000 tokens, making it the largest known corporate holder of the digital asset.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has publicly responded to comments made by Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, who recently questioned the origins, direction, and integrity of Ripple's projects—including the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the XRP token, and Ripple's newly announced stablecoin RLUSD. During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the company behind XRP. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple's past had “all the makings” of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger. Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. “I'm available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.” He wrote. Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which “sets the record straight” and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information. He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently. Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger. Vet said Long's comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can't update the network unaided. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn't trusting in its infrastructure. XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL's long-standing technical leadership. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts. Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.
