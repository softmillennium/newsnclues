                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tried to discredit Donald Trump's Russia scandal and started throwing around words like “treason,” the conspiratorial DNI has certainly succeeded in generating some conversation. Officials from Democratic and Republican administrations urged the public to recognize Gabbard's conspiracy theories as obvious nonsense, while intelligence officials launched a behind-the-scenes effort to discourage the DNI from even releasing her discredited claims in the first place. Gabbard appeared this week on Fox News — a network that has embraced her latest allegations with considerable enthusiasm — and was asked a straightforward question. Gabbard responded by pointing to a National Security Council meeting, held in December 2016 — after Trump was elected and during the presidential transition process — that Obama called to discuss Russia's operation. As part of that meeting, the Democratic then-president made some standard directives to intelligence officials. If Gabbard was under the impression that this made sense and her on-air comments constituted persuasive and “irrefutable” evidence that justified her bizarre allegations of treason, she was mistaken. It was discussed in some detail in the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee's report, and as Media Matters' Matt Gertz explained, the GOP-led panel didn't find anything remarkable about Obama's instructions. But what about Gabbard's claim that officials were told to put together an intelligence assessment that detailed “how,” not “if,” Russia targeted the election? That's not scandalous either: By December 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies had already compiled voluminous evidence, collected over the course of months, documenting Moscow's efforts. The “if” question, in other words, had already been answered. At that point, there was no need to ask it again. Put another way, Gabbard appeared on Fox News — a network where she used to work as a paid contributor — and was asked to support her claims about “irrefutable” evidence. On the surface, it might not seem especially surprising that the national intelligence director has struggled to bolster her own baseless conspiracy theories, but let's not forget that a great many Republican officials are heavily invested in the idea that Gabbard knows what she's talking about. Indeed, Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation based almost entirely on Gabbard's claims. Given that the DNI can't defend her own claims, maybe that ought to raise some red flags for Republicans who are relying on her?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have synthesized methanetetrol, an elusive alcohol that could be the foundation of alien life. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The super alcohol is called methanetetrol and is the only alcohol with four oxygen and hydrogen groups around a single carbon atom. It is thought to be a key building block for life in the universe. "This work pushes the boundaries of what we know about chemistry in space," study co-author Ralf Kaiser, a chemist at the University of Hawaii, said in a statement. However, these compounds are hard to isolate and study. Methanetetrol's high number of oxygen bonds, for example, make it very unstable and likely to break down if not kept in specific environmental conditions. Methanetetrol doesn't occur naturally on Earth, but scientists have theorized about its existence and chemical structure for more than a century, according to the statement. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Now that they are able to study methanetetrol, astrobiologists can learn how this alcohol is synthesized and reacts with other molecules in the coldest parts of space, such as the dust clouds where stars and planets form. "You have this compact, carbon-oxygen molecule that just really wants to go 'boom,'" study co-author Ryan Fortenberry, an astrochemist at the University of Mississippi, said in the statement. "And when it does, when you give it any kind of energy, you'll have water, hydrogen peroxide and a number of other potential compounds that are important for life." Methanetetrol is like "a seed of life molecule," he explained, that could be a building block of life across the universe. "It's something that can lead to more complex chemistry if given the opportunity." —Building blocks of life may be far more common in space than we thought, study claims —NASA finds key ingredient for life gushing out of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus Fortenberry likened the alcohol to an acorn, which can't grow into a tree on its own, but requires the right conditions and reactions to do so. The chemists concluded that, because it can form in the space-like conditions of a lab, methanetetrol can also form in space. "If we can find places where methanetetrol forms naturally, we know that it is a place that has the potential building blocks to support life," Fortenberry said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When staff members were frightened by unexplained paranormal activity, the royal family attempted to rid their estate of any lingering spirits Did Queen Elizabeth and her mother really hold an exorcism at one of their royal residences? The rumor about the supernatural event can be traced back to royal biographer Kenneth Rose, who wrote in his journal about a ceremony reportedly held at Sandringham House in 2000. After reports from staff about strange and frightening phenomena in the bedroom where Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, died in 1952, the Queen Mother reportedly decided to stage a "religious cleansing ritual" to rid the room of any possible ominous spirits. "It wasn't a conventional exorcism," historian and royal biographer Robert Hardman explained in a recent episode of his podcast, Queens, Kings and Dastardly Things. "There was no dramatic casting out of demons, like you see in films. "No one was quite sure who the ghost was supposed to be, despite it appearing in the room where George VI had died," Hardman noted. "Rose speculated whether it might be the ghost of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, who had died a few years before." It's unclear if any of the royal attendees actually believed in the paranormal; however, Hardman thinks their attendance — especially that of the ever-pragmatic Queen Elizabeth — may have been more as a show of support and action towards their frightened staff. "The late Queen had a strong faith, but she was not superstitious," Hardman said. "She did not have time for these wilder theories – but she did have a strong sense of the spiritual, as does King Charles." In his book, Britain's Ghostly Heritage, author John West claims that the then-Prince of Wales had a frightening encounter in a library on the estate, which left him and a staff member bolting from the room.

However, no foul play was detected in his death, and he died of “natural causes”. Psychic medium Matt Fraser has now issued a chilling warning as he told the Daily Mail that Rife's move could unleash “dark, aggressive energy.” Also Read: Elton Castee net worth: What to know as YouTuber buys Annabelle doll's haunted home Fraser told the Daily Mail, “Because of all the hype surrounding the Annabelle doll, from naming her to interacting with her and now putting her on display, people are unintentionally breathing life into something that should never be awakened.” This is not just an old doll, it is a vessel tied to dark, earthbound energy.” He continued, “Dolls do not just become possessed on their own. A spirit must be invited in, often through dark rituals or intentional acts of black magic." You can yell, push back and try to assert control, but in the end you are left drained while the bully feels stronger. This is exactly why Ed and Lorraine Warren never wanted the Annabelle doll to be glorified or used for entertainment.” He also believed that the late couple truly “understood the danger” that possessed Annabelle. Fraser said that “People think they are just observing something creepy, but what they are really doing is inviting chaos.” He described the possessed items as “spiritually active” and said that these are “tied to dark, earthbound souls that never crossed over.” Also Read: Matt Rife buys Annabelle doll: What is comedian's net worth?

This isn't about chasing material goals. Why is this day of days so fated? During the Lion's Gate Portal, Sirius rises to align with Earth and Orion's Belt, a cosmic formation that has been revered since ancient times. The sun in Leo amplifies themes of personal power, courage, creative expression and radical self-love. This year, August 8 coincides with Mercury retrograde in Leo, when we are called to reflect, reset and consider how our self-expression can be used to elevate the collective. In 2025, the Lion's Gate Portal centers less on attracting what you want and more on choosing what genuinely aligns with who you are now,” said Solas. Solas views August 8 as one of the most potent days of the year, characterized by high energy and profound clarity, making it an ideal opportunity to set intentions that align with your soul's path.

A German resident has admitted to running a massive psychic mail fraud scheme that targeted elderly and vulnerable victims to the tune of over $10 million.

58-year-old Georg Ingenbleek was indicted in 2020 and had been a fugitive. He was apprehended in Bolzano, Italy, last year and extradited this past May to face an indictment charging him with two counts of mail fraud, to which he pleaded guilty earlier this week.

Federal authorities in New Jersey said from 2011 through 2016, Ingenbleek created numerous direct mail solicitations supposedly from world-renowned psychics that falsely and fraudulently claimed to offer, among other things, great fortune.

Many of the letters falsely promised that the psychic services being offered were free; however, Ingenbleek directed his co-conspirators to send fraudulent billing notices to those customers who claimed they owed money for those services.

The fraudulent billing notices included threats of legal action if the bills, usually in the $20 to $50 range, weren't paid.

According to officials, this psychic scheme brought in over $10 million.

The mail fraud charges each carry up to 20 years in prison and fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sentencing is scheduled for December 17th.

He specializes in history, strange science, and anything out of the ordinary. Katy is Managing Editor at IFLScience where she oversees editorial content from News articles to Features, and even occasionally writes some. A newly published study by Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) researchers has looked at mysterious "transient events". Since 2017, the Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project has attempted to look for stars and other sources of light that have appeared and disappeared from view or have dimmed unusually over the 20th and 21st centuries, known as "transient events". The team has previously found that around 100 stars have disappeared from view without an explanation (though other teams have suggestions as to where they went). "These short-lived transients (lasting less than one exposure time of 50 minutes) are absent in images taken shortly before the transients appear and in all images from subsequent surveys," the team explained in a recent pre-print paper. "In some cases, multiple transients appear in a single image, exhibiting characteristics not easily accounted for by prosaic explanations (e.g., gravitational lensing, gamma ray bursts, fragmenting asteroids, plate defects)." By focusing on this timeframe, they could eliminate any transient events that are due to reflections from human-made satellites, a common source of bright objects in the night sky. The team is motivated directly to study UAP phenomena – a topic which scientists have generally steered well clear of. "Searches for extraterrestrial probes were proposed as early as the 1960s, but to date only a few searches for NTAs have been attempted or proposed." The latest paper identified a number of interesting transient events for which they could not provide an explanation, including a bright but short-lived transient event on July 19, 1952, in which three stars vanished within 50 minutes. "Notably, this particular event coincides in time with one of the most extensively documented aerial anomalies in historical records: the Washington D.C. 'UFO flap' of July 1952, which unfolded over two consecutive weekends (July 18–19 and 26–27)," the team writes. While this is all pretty speculative and unlikely to be resolved due to the event taking place over 70 years ago, the team offers up an intriguing statistical analysis that might warrant further attention, potentially showing that these might not be something as simple as photographic plate defects. "One of the most revealing tests involves Earth's shadow. No matter how asymmetric or irregular the distributions of plate defects may be, they have no plausible reason to avoid the Earth's shadow. In contrast, transients associated with solar reflections would," the team explains. In short, if the transients were just plate defects, then we would see them no matter where the astronomical equipment was pointed. But according to their analysis, there were far fewer transients detected in Earth's shadow compared to the rest of the sky. However, we find only N = 79 transients in shadow, yielding fobs = 0.00074 ± 0.000084," the team explains. "The difference in these observed fractions is also highly significant, with a significance level of 12.7σ, computed by combining the Poisson uncertainties in quadrature." Which is somewhat odd, given that the period studied was pre-satellite. A separate paper by the team, for instance, found that they were associated with nuclear weapons tests. "Our results motivate continued investigation of historical sky surveys and the application of similar alignment-based detection methods to modern deep-sky imaging," the team concludes. "Whether or not these events ultimately point to the existence of NTAs [non-terrestrial artifacts], the identification of statistically improbable, spatially aligned transients in pre-satellite data represents a novel observational anomaly deserving of further scientific attention. Future work may help clarify whether these transients constitute a new class of astronomical phenomena—or represent the first hints of artificial activity near our planet."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This discovery greatly expands the search for planets that may support life. This information was published by the SciTechDaily portal. One of the main goals of researchers is to identify Earth-like planets in so-called habitable zones — regions around stars where the existence of liquid water is possible. A planet like this was recently detected by an international team led by astronomers from China. This planet has a mass about 10 times greater than that of Earth and orbits the star Kepler-725, which is similar to the Sun. This is the first discovery of a planet with such characteristics using the TTV method. Kepler-725c has an orbital period of 207.5 days and is located at a distance of 0.674 astronomical units from the star. The planet receives about 1.4 times more radiation than Earth, and part of its orbit falls within the habitable zone. This makes Kepler-725c a promising candidate for further studies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to falling down a rabbit hole with conspiracy theories ― QAnon, the “Plandemic” conspiracy theory ― it's young people, not older demographics, who are more prone to buy into such beliefs. Age is the most significant predictor of conspiracy beliefs among all other factors, according to a study that was recently published in the journal Political Psychology. And it's people under 35 who are consistently more likely to endorse conspiratorial ideas than any other age group. “From age 35 on, susceptibility to conspiracy theories decreases relatively steadily across older age groups,” said Jean-Nicolas Bordeleau, a research Fellow at the Jeff Bleich Centre for Democracy and Disruptive Technologies, at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. It's not uncommon to hear about siblings who are estranged over extremist political views or people who “lost” their family members to QAnon, a conspiracy theory that posits that a satanic cabal of elites and pedophiles is working behind the scenes to orchestrate global events and enslave children. Conspiracy theories increasingly affect our elections, too; QAnon believers came out heavily for President Trump in recent elections; to them, Trump is a white-knight figure destined to bring down the aforementioned cabal. (That's what's made his current handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files such a divisive issue for many.) And voter fraud conspiracy theories drove thousands to violently storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, an act of domestic terrorism that threatened the nation's peaceful transfer of power. Given the growing impact of conspiracy theories in our political and personal lives, Bordeleau and Daniel Stockemer, a political studies professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada, thought it was high time to find out what factors most influence people buying in. “We were really curious to understand why some people adhere to some really unbelievable narratives like the flat Earth theory and QAnon,” Bordeleau told HuffPost. “Our results don't imply that all young people are attracted to all conspiracy theories, but what we can demonstrate is that younger people are more likely to believe various conspiracy theories than older individuals. If you assumed it might be Boomers who most frequently fall into conspiracy theory traps ― there are countless depressing stories in online forums of grown children detailing how their Fox News-watching parents fell into a QAnon rabbit hole after “doing research” ― you're not alone. This huge dataset, which included over 374,000 participants, suggested a “robust” association between young age and belief in conspiracies, Bordeleau said. “To confirm that, we ran our own original multinational survey of more than 6,000 people across six diverse countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the U.S. and South Africa,” he explained. So why are younger generations more intrigued by conspiracy theories? “First, the fact that younger people have a deep sense of political disaffection and alienation,” Bordeleau said. “Second, there's a tendency for younger people to adopt an activist style of political participation and be exposed to more radical environments, where conspiracy theories thrive.” (QAnon originated on the dark web first, with various ideas circulating on 4chan and 8chan as early as 2017.) “Low self-esteem can partly explain why younger people are attracted to conspiracy theories,” Bordeleau said. “It becomes a way to cope with feelings of powerlessness.” Bordeleau said he'd love to further research the socialization component of conspiracy beliefs: how young people are exposed to these narratives, for instance, and whether or not social pressures play a part. On a wider social level, he hopes that more time and resources are put into looking for ways to help young people become more media literate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. When Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri won a reversal from the U.S. Department of Justice, allowing HPE's $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks to go ahead, he could have been forgiven for thinking his troubles were behind him. Instead, HPE has been dragged into one of those weird MAGA conspiracy theories that orbit President Trump's White House. Even Laura Loomer, the vituperous online Trump activist, somehow got involved. But because the DOJ's sudden reversal got the gears whirring inside the brains of multiple online sleuths, resulting in an objection letter from Senator Elizabeth Warren, it is suddenly more likely—perhaps not probable, but plausible—that Judge P. Casey Pitts will hold a “Tunney review” that may overturn the deal. A negative Tunney review would be a defeat for Neri, who is fending off activist Elliott Management, which bought a $1.5 billion stake in the company and demanded seats on the board in part because it believes HPE stock is being held down by execution errors on Neri's watch. For its part, HPE believes it has done nothing wrong, and that it has simply prevailed in a routine judicial process. “HPE is confident our acquisition of Juniper Networks is in the public interest and will promote further competition in the enterprise WLAN market,” the company told Fortune. But several online corporate dirt diggers, including Matt Stoller, Francine McKenna, Lever News and Capitol Forum, drew attention to personnel changes at the DOJ immediately prior to its approval of the deal. They included what Sen. Warren's letter described as “MAGA-aligned antitrust thought leader Mike Davis.” It is this person that Stoller and his online colleagues believe is a lobbyist responsible for changing the minds of Attorney General Pam Bondi and her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, and thus reversing their opposition to the deal. Following that, Loomer used X to insist that HPE had paid consultants allied to President Trump $1 million each to engage in “influence peddling.” Loomer later deleted the post. Sources previously told Fortune they didn't understand why Loomer was paying attention to the deal. The Lever published a claim that “In a last-minute effort to save face … intelligence authorities intervened to rubber-stamp the deal because of national security reasons, a claim that never appeared in any of the DOJ and HP's legal briefs.” In fact, HPE did cite national security in its July 7 certification of the proposed judgment approving the deal. (You can see it here on page 2.) The national-security angle is that by combining HPE and Juniper it creates a larger market share for a U.S. company in places where the alternative might be Huawei, which many Western governments regard as a Chinese Communist Party asset. The next step is up to Judge Pitts. It is not clear cut that Pitts will rubber-stamp the DOJ's decision. Pitts is a Biden appointee who previously worked at a public interest law firm—and he may therefore be sceptical that Trump's DOJ went from fierce opposition to “whatever” so quickly. Meanwhile, HPE stock has not reacted well to all the gossip. Elliott's stake is a long position—meaning they want shares to rise.
