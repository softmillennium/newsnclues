                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Kelly Clarkson and her kids mourn the passing of her ex-husband and their dad, Brandon Blackstock, others mourning his death on August 7, 2025, include country superstar Reba McEntire. “The Voice” coach was married to Brandon's dad, talent manager Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015, and remained close with him and Clarkson, even through their own divorce, which Clarkson filed for in 2020. Brandon was Narvel's son from a previous marriage. In 2021, McEntire told Entertainment Tonight, “Brandon's been my son forever it seems. When McEntire performed at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, it was a family affair. Her and Narvel's son Shelby Blackstock — Brandon's half-brother — shared photos from the event that showed Brandon attended the concert and was backstage with McEntire, along with three of his four kids. We had a blast in Houston watching @rissablackstock experience her first rodeo & being able to spend cherished time with family! Brandon had two kids with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth — Savannah, 22, and Seth, 18. He shared two kids with Clarkson — River Rose, 11, and Remington, 9. At the time of publication, McEntire had not spoken publicly about Brandon's passing. McEntire didn't take sides as Clarkson and Blackstock were going through their oftentimes contentious divorce, remaining connected to and supporting both of them. In 2021, she told Extra, “You know, I love them both. Before McEntire became a coach on “The Voice,” she was a Mega Mentor on the show in 2023, and got to work with Clarkson there. “Now, she's just matured into this wonderful woman that I am just so proud of and I love her with all my heart,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brandon Blackstock, the Nashville music manager who was married to Kelly Clarkson for seven years, has died after a battle with cancer. “Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,” the message continued. “He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. She'd added, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.” The son of Starstruck co-founder Narvel Blackstock, Brandon was formerly the stepson of Reba McEntire, who was married to his father for 26 years. Working alongside his dad, Brandon was involved in managing the careers of clients such as Blake Shelton and Carly Pearce. Years after meeting each other while Narvel was Clarkson's manager, the singer and Brandon tied the knot in 2013, after which Brandon would become his then-wife's manager. In 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce, setting off a lengthy legal battle between herself and her ex-husband. Though they'd eventually settle their split in 2022 — with Clarkson agreeing to give Brandon $45,601 in monthly child support as well as a one-time payment of $1.3 million — Starstruck would later sue the American Idol alum for alleged unpaid fees. Clarkson responded by alleging that the Blackstocks actually owed her money, filing a complaint with California's Labor Commissioner that claimed they'd violated the state's Talent Agencies Act by serving as her managers as well as unlicensed talent agents who booked her business deals. In addition to the children he shared with Clarkson, Brandon is also survived by his kids with ex-wife Melissa Ashworth — Savannah and Seth — as well as a young grandson named Lake.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that the Dune franchise actor is closing in on two Amazon MGM Studios movies: Chad Stahelski's Highlander which UA is also behind, and Road House 2, which Dave Bautista was also circling. Bautista will star opposite Henry Cavill in Stahelski's revival of the 1980s classic swordsman movie. We hear he's playing The Kurgan, a character made famous by Clancy Brown in the original Sean Connery-Christopher Lambert film. During his life, Kurgan was a bad dude, killing and raping, and taking the heads of many Immortals. In the original movie, he's a foe of Lambert's Connor MacLeod. Ilya Naishuller In Talks To Direct 'Road House 2' Guy Ritchie Exits Amazon MGM Studios 'Road House 2' Bautista joins Road House 2 opposite Jake Gyllenhaal who is coming back as ex-UFC fighter Dalton from a script by Will Beall (Bad Boys: Ride or Die). Road House 2 is produced by Atlas Entertainment's Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, Gyllenhaal's Nine Stories Productions with Josh McLaughlin executive producing. As we first told you, Guy Ritchie is no longer directing, rather Nobody's lya Naishuller. Road House released last year on Prime Video, pulled in 80M viewers worldwide in its first eight weeks on the service, one of the top Amazon MGM Studios movies ever viewed. The original Highlander, in 1986, followed the climax of an ancient battle between immortal warriors, unfolding through interwoven past and present-day storylines. Russell Mulcahy helmed the original film, which was produced by Peter S. Davis and William N. Panzer. Bautista made a cameo recently in Paramount's comedy comeback Naked Gun opposite Liam Neeson. Back in June we told you that Paramount Pictures has acquired rights to The Romantic, a romantic comedy spec from Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont, with Bautista attached to star. The Dune and Guardians of the Galaxy franchise star has Aura Entertainment's actioner Trap House up next, as well as the Amazon MGM buddy cop action comedy The Wrecking Crew opposite Jason Momoa, both of which are produced by his Dogbone Entertainment Banner. Bautista also has the Zellner Brothers' alien invasion comedy Alpha Gang upcoming. Bautista is repped by WME and Jackoway Austen Tyerman et al. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Perry, however, described it as an empowering step forward for women, telling press shortly after she touched down, “It's about making space for future women and taking up space and belonging … this is all for the benefit of Earth.” The star will release Here for It All in September, following singles “Type Dangerous” and “Sugar Sweet” featuring Kehlani and Shenseea.

Alternately — extending this metaphor another way — talking to him while activity at Kojima Productions buzzes in the background over a video interview suggests having a peek inside a spy agency. The video game auteur, whose Tokyo studio is visited by everybody from Conan O'Brien to Timothée Chalamet, has just released “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” the sequel to 2019's “Death Stranding” and his second consecutive work that does more to break from the medium's confines than anything I could name. “On the Beach” is an especially bold step towards the cinematic, with a cast (Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Luca Marinelli, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning, and Fatih Akin) far closer to a major festival lineup than animated characters in a video game. Related Stories In ‘Social Studies,' Non-Fiction Auteur Lauren Greenfield Reveals the Inner Workings of Gen Z Lindsay Lohan Says ‘All About Eve' Could Never Be Remade: ‘It's So Perfect' Even if IndieWire's own David Ehrlich hadn't claimed “Death Stranding 2” was a “mega-bizarre masterpiece,” Kojima is a figure who deserves time and attention. Speaking as someone who'd write out the absurdly convoluted “Metal Gear Solid” chronology while bored in middle-school math, the opportunity was not to be taken lightly. When I called into Kojima Productions last week, the director was taking a break from his next projects: “OD,” a horror game co-written with Jordan Peele and starring Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier; and “Physint,” a stealth action game that has already kicked up rumors of a lead role for Robert Pattinson. Questions about those were — surprise — immediately deflected, but “Death Stranding 2” offered sufficient fodder for discussion. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Indiewire: It's Tuesday in Tokyo, and “Death Stranding 2” has been out for exactly a month. I also am starting to work with the team on “OD” because that's a new project, and also doing “Physint” all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage. And also I have all these interviews every day, and also promotional — photo-shootings, things like that — so I don't feel like I've finished the title, to be frank. No work of art is ever truly flawless or perfect. I wonder how you feel about having this after-the-fact ability to improve your own work. That's a unique opportunity compared with filmmakers who can't necessarily go back to fix flaws in their films. Do you feel a game ever is emboldened because of its flaws? There are some things that you shouldn't change. Like the story, for example, because there is a certain era that that story was born. You shouldn't change those kinds of parts. Or, you know, like [George] Lucas changed [‘Star Wars'] to all CG, but that's because it's a new era, right? So I don't want to change anything that would affect the era that it first came out. The things that I said that I'm changing are, you know, all the things basically related to gameplay. Like: This item was not very easy to use, so I'll make it a little bit more accessible, or, like, make the UI bigger. These small parts are the ones that I'm changing. I know that DLC [downloadable content] is not a trendy space because if you start doing that, you'll never finish the project. “Death Stranding 2” is maybe your most confidently directed work, and I'm fascinated by how your style has reached a kind of minimalism since the later “Metal Gear Solid” games. “DS1,” there were a lot of long cutscenes, yes, because it was supposed to start slow, right, and to explain everything — it was slow — but I see a lot of people discontinuing watching the cutscenes from “DS1” by stats. Because, for me, cutscenes are part of the game. Some people don't even think about that, but I believe cutscenes are part of the game. So maybe, you know, that's one reason. I even change it after taking the motion after sessions with the actors, and I kind of adjust the balance of that rhythm, as I said, and I think it's becoming better because of that. What tech advancements affected your directorial style in recent years — is it the reliability of A-list acting talent, smaller cameras that allow for more movement and set-ups, or something else altogether? During the pandemic, we held performance-capture sessions at the Sony studio in L.A. We had the actors arrive on set in L.A, but our staff was restricted from traveling abroad. Reluctantly, I was forced to direct from afar. We used smartphones, Zoom, iPads, and multiple cameras for the remote session. I protested and said it was impossible, but I was told that all other studios were also doing it remotely and that I would need to follow the same rules. To test out the remote session, we tried out two scenes that didn't require the main characters. That's when I reached out to the development team about a system called “Mado” [“Window” in English] at Sony headquarters. Though it was through a screen, we were able to communicate with each other as if we were standing outside each other's window. Can you talk a bit about what that remote work looked like, and how you feel your direction benefits from being in person with your actors? Well, even though I have, like, 20 cameras on this side and that side as well, it was really difficult to describe the stage and the set in its direction. Like, for instance, me directly saying, “OK, you act from here to there. For instance, if I were talking to the actor on the spot in the scene — like Norman [Reedus] — I had to say, “Hey, Norman, you walk from here all the way up to Léa and you say this line,” and things like that, it's so difficult to explain that if you're not there. Although I could see, because we set up so many cameras, it's so difficult to explain the position physically at just one point. [Laughs] I couldn't wrap it up as though I was in the scene — I was just through the camera, and that was so difficult. You talked about how the quality of an actor's facial scan between “Death Stranding” and “On the Beach” improved significantly — specifically how Léa Seydoux's face is now more lifelike, more vivid. Did seeing stronger face work engender anything in a rewriting process? I even did during shooting as well. Like, for instance, Léa's smoking scene — that was not initially in it, and I had it added. [Laughs] As you know, we've been working with 3Lateral, and the rigs of the facial have really upgraded, and we could do a lot of facial expressions — very subtle ones as well — so I kind of even changed the scenes where I take out some lines because facial expressions could be covered, and I kind of make that decision on the spot. Even the lighting: I kind of asked a lighting technician, a professional lighting technician, to come to teach the staff about lighting in general, so we took, like, a healthy two years to learn all of this about all of this — about all the lights and things like that. So that could have an influence, too. You've often talked about blurring boundaries between cinema and video games. What is the greatest struggle in doing so? But with games, that's not possible except in cutscenes. Sometimes, players might even skip important scenes. The creator has no say in that. And from theater, too — in theater, you're free to look wherever you want, but the timeline remains controlled. In games, you can view the stage from any angle and even walk away midway. In other words, creators can't calculate or plan everything because it all depends on the player's actions. Films are about showing a series of carefully curated images, but you can't approach games with the same mindset. I think that's where it creates a sense of uncertainty for both the performers and the director. There's also the issue of recording time. Unlike films, where you can concentrate on the shoot over a period of three to six months, that kind of intensive schedule is difficult for games. Game development involves filming little by little as you go — maybe like a week each month, sometimes with long gaps in between. For “DS2,” the entire process took about three years. That makes it a very challenging environment for the actors. But you've never revealed the original plot. Now that we're some time away from “Death Stranding 2” and people like myself have actually been able to play it, are you at any liberty or desire or comfort to say how the original version of the game would have differed? [Laughs] Well, I found the initial concept sheet, actually. You know, all these lines that were newly created are actually spoken by the President [Alastair Duncan] at the end — or what Die-Hardman [Tommie Earl Jenkins] says at the end. Do you expressly prefer keeping something like a concept sheet tucked away and letting the game exist as it does? I wonder if you have a similar interest in sharing alternate versions of your work. For instance, if I drew a drawing of an apple and I put that in a museum and I say “this is an apple,” but all the people who saw it, it doesn't matter if they think it's an apple or a banana. Is there something that you look for or see in an actor, in a live-action context, that tells you they could convincingly deliver a motion-capture performance? Because I think you might be the only person who's ever watched Luca Marinelli and said, “He should be in a video game.” Or is it as simple as one form of acting translating to another? Well, I don't really regard them as being “in the game.” I just look for actors who are good — like, they're good in terms of the looks or the emotion, their expression, their acting. At the same time, we take one step of changing them to CG, so they have to really be individualistic. And if it matches, I talk to their agents. Every time I talk with Guillermo del Toro or Nicholas Winding Refn, we always talk about, “Oh, who's coming? Did you see her acting?” It's kind of the same with even these movie directors. So I regard myself as no different than how I cast in other people as well. Are there any deceased actors who you think might have fit your worlds and sensibility? That would be my childhood hero, Steve McQueen. If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday. In fact, I had always hoped to cast David Lynch, a director I've admired for so long. However, he passed away not long ago, and I'm devastated. Some have compared your games to the work of Thomas Pynchon, who even went so far as to mention you in “Bleeding Edge.” Are you familiar with Pynchon's work, and has it served as any kind of influence on you as a writer? Yes, I know Thomas Pynchon and read, and acknowledge that I was in one of his writings. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule; it's very appreciated.

Filmmaker Kayci Lacob knew she wanted to capture everything about growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley during the early-2000s tech boom for her directorial debut. She also knew that her first film deserved to be in theaters, and so Lacob did what most established auteurs are still hesitant to do (other than Francis Ford Coppola with “Megalopolis”): She is self-distributing her debut “Everything to Me” for a theatrical run and “betting” on audiences to buy tickets. “Everything to Me” isn't without star power. “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Ponyboi,” and “You” actress Victoria Pedretti leads the film as Claudia, a woman reflecting on her career trajectory and life choices years after aspiring to be the next Steve Jobs as a Stanford freshman (Abigail Donaghy plays a younger version of the character). But this isn't an Elizabeth Holmes story gone awry: “Everything to Me” is more “Lady Bird” than “The Dropout.” Related Stories Hideo Kojima on ‘Death Stranding 2,' the Sequel's Big Changes and Improvements Post-Pandemic, and How He Hoped to Cast David Lynch in a Game Charlie Kaufman's New Short Film Is Coming to a Public Library Near You The synopsis reads: “Set in early-2000s Silicon Valley, ‘Everything to Me' follows a precocious teen determined to become the next Steve Jobs. As adulthood sets in, she's forced to reconsider what success really means — and maybe even laugh at her younger self along the way.” Indie icon Judy Greer co-stars, along with Lola Flanery, Utkarsh Ambudkar, and Rich Sommer. Writer/director Lacob counts fellow Northern California native and “Lady Bird” helmer Greta Gerwig among her filmmaking “heroes.” And while Gerwig's “Barbie” proved that women are a massive theater-going audience, female directors have still scrambled in the indie space to find funding, let alone theatrical distribution. Lacob is redefining — and to use Silicon Valley tech speak, disrupting — the path for first-time filmmakers by self-distributing the theatrical release of “Everything to Me.” “We decided to self-distribute this movie through Concourse Media for a theatrical run by betting on our audience,” Lacob told IndieWire. “But getting noticed by buyers is a whole other ballgame. The Gerwig (and all of the Coppolas, from Francis to Sofia to “Palo Alto” helmer Gia) comparisons don't stop there. Lacob is ready to be synonymous with Bay Area Gen-Zers and millennials: “My goal is to be my generation's storyteller of Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area,” she said. As young Gen-Z women are funding the reopening of almost century-old theaters and bypassing large studios to ensure theatrical debuts, it seems as though the next generation of female filmmakers are dedicated to preserving the future of theatergoing more than anyone. Below, director Lacob unpacks her critically acclaimed “Everything to Me” and shares with IndieWire why she was determined to release the film in theaters without waiting for a studio. IndieWire: As a fellow Bay Area native, what inspired the story of “Everything to Me”? There were two huge influences bearing down on me, outside of my family, that led to this film. One was the Bay Area itself, which I view almost as its own character in my upbringing. This place has soul and is a part of who I am; it really shaped my view on the world. Part of this is because I grew up in a really special time, right at the change of the millennium. There have been many eccentric and prolific innovators in Silicon Valley who have changed the world, but Steve was an entity all his own. It seemed as though he was creating technology, movies, music, and stores just for me. Being surrounded by all of this created both significant challenges and beautiful opportunities for those of us who grew up there. Before the millennial minimalism aesthetic took over, our world was colorful and changing constantly. We were living in a cautionary tale, but we were also there for the dawn of the digital age. I wanted a movie that captured all of these emotions, partially because I wasn't even aware of it all while it was happening. When did you realize this story was what you wanted to make as your debut feature?As a young hopeful filmmaker, I turned to my heroes: Greta Gerwig, Tina Fey, Sofia Coppola, Richard Linklater, the list goes on. They all began their careers with a coming-of-age story that set the stage for their point-of-view, how they see the world. Much like our adult Claudia in the film, I had to turn back and look at my life, my experiences, and where I'm from to try to answer the questions, “Who am I and what do I want to say?” It was through this exploration that Claudia's story started to take shape.We can all look back at a slate of movies by a single filmmaker and think that their journey was deliberate, that they knew exactly who they were and what they wanted to say about the world from the get-go. For some of them, that very well may be the case, but some of us learn our voice and our view of the world as we go, and then connect the dots in hindsight. This film was in development for about two-and-a-half years before we had everyone assembled on set and a real movie was underway. How did you land your rising stars and also connect with Victoria Pedretti and Judy Greer?I'm still in awe that my name shows up next to theirs on this film. I am so fortunate to have worked with these legends, especially on my debut. We knew from the beginning that we wanted to discover the new “It” group of young actors to shine in this film alongside some real heavyweights who could connect with audiences of all ages. Victoria brings a wisdom and intensity to every role she plays, which was absolutely how we wanted our adult Claudia to present. To have a true queen of the screen like Judy Greer on board was nothing short of a dream come true. That was the most sensitive role to cast for me personally, and once we spoke to Judy and her warmth and strength emanated so organically, I felt that the part was in capable hands.Finding our “teens” was a fun part of the whole process, and they made it easy for us. The only real challenge was casting four actresses to play the same role at different life stages (a difficult task I wouldn't recommend to a future first-time filmmaker!). But the Donaghy sisters came into our lives and made it all possible. It was a fairly quick shoot (22 days), but they all bonded so quickly. It really felt like I was a high school teacher corralling my students who were all already best friends. What advice would you give to first-time directors, especially young women? I'm going to borrow the advice that my producer, Tom Nunan, gave to me before we started filming: Vulnerability is our greatest superpower. I was always fearful of being treated like a wallflower or worse, that people would think I had no right to be there. There's this pressure as a young woman to assert yourself so that you're taken seriously. But there's a difference between confidence and total control. You need to be confident in your vision while being completely open and honest about what you don't know. Always ask for help when you need it. I came across a meme of a foal wearing a flower crown with the words, “This actually is my first rodeo, and I'm very scared.” I showed it to Tom, and he loved it. As long as I knew what I wanted, that's what mattered.One more piece of advice that I can't emphasize enough for a young filmmaker, especially a young woman, is to surround yourself with the best talent possible. This is advice for life, not just film. For me, that was Tom Nunan (producer), Shasta Spahn (director of photography), O'Shay Brooks (production designer), Lily Trotter (casting director), Stephanie Economou (composer), Matt McBrayer (editor), and Randy Wayne and Talia Bella (executive producers). What is the path for distribution as an indie filmmaker? Why did you decide on the festival circuit, and are you hoping for a theatrical run as opposed to streaming? We did a full festival circuit last fall and spring. But getting noticed by buyers is a whole other ballgame. Have them help carry us to buyers.We decided to self-distribute this movie through Concourse Media for a theatrical run by betting on our audience. Plus, it is every filmmaker's dream to see their movie on the big screen in theaters. We're going out and making it happen ourselves!What do you hope audiences take away from “Everything to Me”? This movie is about the drive for excellence and the fear of being ordinary, and finding your own voice amidst all that. I've had grown men come up to me after watching this movie and tell me how much they resonated with Claudia. You, a man in your fifties, connected to a 15-year-old girl growing up in Silicon Valley?” But that's the thing about movies. Concourse Media is distributing “Everything to Me” in theaters on Friday, September 5. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Since he got his start in Hollywood nearly 40 years ago, John Wells has averaged more successes per decade than most creatives accumulate over an entire career. The prolific writer, director, producer and filmmaker's latest feat is The Pitt, a real-time medical drama that spans one 12-hour emergency room shift in a 15-episode season. Reuniting Wells with former ER collaborators R. Scott Gemmill and Noah Wyle, the HBO Max procedural launched unexpectedly into the zeitgeist with its January premiere ­­— thanks in part to weekly drops (how novel!) that saw the audience quickly pass 10 million per episode. This is hardly Wells' first time scrubbing in for TV. He cut his teeth writing on China Beach, then developed ER with the late Michael Crichton and co-created Third Watch. Noah Wyle on 'The Pitt' Storylines Mirroring the Real World: "We Got Lucky a Few Times" 'The Pitt' Production Assistants Launch Landmark Unionization Drive (Exclusive) And that's only getting more dramatic because these Medicaid reductions are going to directly hit the urban and rural hospitals delivering primary care. As for the characters you've introduced, you made a bit of news with the departure of Tracy Ifeachor. Look, the show is set at a teaching hospital. And if you're a fourth-year resident in a teaching hospital, your time there is done at the end of that year. Not to scare any of the other castmembers, but people don't stay at these hospitals forever. We're not committed to doing a year every season as we go on, but we can't say that we're going to be true to the medicine and teaching hospitals and maintain the same cast for the entire time. So you're planning large time jumps between seasons? The beginning of the residency year usually starts on July 1, so everybody will have moved up and there'll be new people coming in. One of the advantages is we are not able to play medical melodrama in the sense of long-term relationship issues. You're dropping in on people at a specific day and time, so you may discover that somebody's been having a relationship. Part of my first conversation with Scott and Noah was that we don't really want to tell those stories anymore. This is not where you're going to get your romantic Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway story, and it's a bit liberating. We are trying still to get China Beach going! I was a writer on that show, it was Bill Broyles and John Young who created it. The problem is that it was filled with Motown music, and the cost for getting that is high. Warner Brothers has tried and gotten closer, but it really should be steaming. It's a very dangerous moment in the industry. So many people have been let go. So many people are out in the marketplace looking for work. And that has had a chilling effect on taking risks, especially since shows have gotten more and more expensive. It takes tremendous courage to say to somebody, “Go make this show, here's $60 million for 15 episodes or $80 million for eight episodes.” So what can someone in your position do about it? We have to be aware of how much these shows are going to cost while we're writing them. Otherwise, somebody is going tell you to make it in Budapest. When did that become part of the job? When everything exploded, and we were making so many shows with not a lot of concern about how much those shows were costing. How would you define a big swing in this marketplace? Is it Donald Glover shooting Mr. & Mrs. Smith all over Europe or adapting big IP? I don't necessarily mean a big financial swing. I have kids in their 20s, and they want to know how many episodes there are going to be if they get involved with something. They don't want six or seven episodes. They're like, “Are there 100 episodes of this?” One thing I don't think gets enough attention is how harmful the delays between seasons can be to audience relationships with the material. Is it important for you to get The Pitt back on the air as soon as possible? How am I supposed to keep a fandom with something when I can't even remember what happened two and a half years later? It will be the eighth of January — 365 days later. And with all due respect to all of my friends who make TV, there is no reason these shows can't be on every year. These delays are becoming even more conspicuous now that the series load is diminishing. In this trepidatious if not fearful marketplace, what are buyers looking for right now? I keep hearing that people want The Pitt. People want shows that can come back on a regular basis with a strong cast and at a number that makes sense for the studio and platform that's doing it. That's nothing new, but it seems like we're having to rediscover it again as if we hadn't all known this for a long time. Netflix is trying to build this huge library because they don't have one. We had a good time making it, but it's also been available on Amazon ever since we were on the air. Then Warners sold [the library] to Netflix in our year five or six. It turned into a huge hit on Netflix. We had been winding down and ended up doing five more years because of that. Ask somebody who made Shameless and they'll probably tell you Netflix. Speaking of Shameless, you cast Jeremy Allen White in his breakthrough role. He was 18, just out of high school. He showed up, did a fantastic job and then stayed the entire 11 years. I've been very fortunate to work with a lot of people like that. There have been a lot of great creative partners. It sounds funny now, but the three executives on ER were David Nevins, John Landgraf and Kevin Reilly. Jinny Howe worked as my assistant before she ran television here. Now she's head of drama at Netflix. Warren Littlefield was at NBC when we were making those shows, and I watched him just get beat to hell. When I was at ABC, Brandon Stoddard literally lost his job for putting Twin Peaks, China Beach and thirtysomething on the air. What's some bullshit that you had to deal with back then that you'd never have to deal with now? Liz Meriwether was surprised that I still get notes, and I want to dissuade anyone from thinking that having had success means that the job itself changes substantially. It gives you more credibility in responding to notes, but it does not change the amount coming in. But I really appreciate not dealing with standards and practices on a daily basis anymore. What are some of the more infuriating ones? I had huge discussions during the ER days about racial storylines. I was like, “Guys, what are we even talking about?” A big storyline we did in the third season of ER was Gloria Reuben's character being HIV positive. There were real conversations where they said, “So, she's going to survive? You've been coy on this, but there must be a line you're not willing to cross on The Pitt in terms of the graphic medical stuff. We want nothing to be gratuitous, and it's only what the doctors would really see. We don't want to do emergency medicine porn, where we're just daring the audience to watch. Do you have any squeamish people on staff? I just shot the first episode of season two, and there's an eye thing. With distance from it now, how do you look back on the experience of Aaron Sorkin quitting The West Wing in season five and leaving you on the hook to keep it going? Professionally, as a writer, that was the hardest thing. It's not like we didn't still have a great staff in place, but at that point it was widely considered to be the best show on television — though there's certainly people who'd argue for The Sopranos. We went back in the writers room, looked at each other, and I said, “Aaron doesn't have any idea about where the story goes, so we're just going to do the best that we can and hope that the audience would come along.” And they did. I would never argue that I wrote an episode as good as Aaron or rose to those same heights, but I was proud that we maintained that show. Many actors, and even Aaron, occasionally tease reviving that show. Aaron and I have talked about it a number of times. My worry — and never say never — has always been that when the show existed, it was not perceived as one-sided. What's happening now, that's not the world in which it was written, so I'd be worried that it would be perceived as a statement. What the show was trying to do is highlight the sacrifice in public service, that these people are really good, well-meaning people, and I don't think anybody would let us do that in this polarized climate. You've launched many shows over the years. What's a misfire that you think should have done better? Ten years ago, I did a pilot at Fox with Krista Vernoff. While we were casting, I was in London, where I'd been asked to watch this small film for some other reason. But there was this young woman in it, and I thought, “Oh, she'd be perfect for our show.” It was Florence Pugh! She was only 18 years old, and we brought her over to shoot this pilot. What about something that made it to air? We did a show called Smith [in 2006] with Ray Liotta and Virginia Madsen for CBS. I really loved it, but no one showed up. I don't want to say “ahead of its time,” but it was very violent for a broadcast network at the time. And it was a show about the bad guys. CBS might not have been the place for it. Les Moonves later told me that it definitely was not. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dean Cain, who played Superman on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman from 1993 to 1997, has announced his latest career pivot: becoming an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. Congress needs to fix it, but in the interim, President Trump ran on this. Cain's decision comes after he shared an ICE recruitment video on Instagram earlier this week. At the time, he hadn't taken steps to become an agent. “I wasn't part of ICE, but once I put that out there and you put a little blurb on your show, it went crazy,” Cain told Watters. “So now I've spoken with some officials over at ICE.” In the Instagram video, Cain echoed the selling points ICE has deployed as it launches a nationwide recruitment effort in hopes of intensifying already brutal crackdowns on undocumented immigration. “Since President Trump took office, ICE has arrested hundreds of thousands of criminals, including terrorists, rapists, murderers, pedophiles,” he said as the Superman theme song blared in the background. Cain boasted about a $50,000 signing bonus and “legal” student loan repayments. The Department of Homeland Security has started to forcibly reassign Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees to ICE, threatening them with termination if they do not agree. Trump previously said that his new Florida immigrant detention facility, which he dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” would hold “some of the most vicious people on the planet,” using similar language that Cain echoed in his video. Another 250 detainees only have immigration violations on their records, but no criminal convictions or pending charges. Website ‘Glitch' Removes Trump's Least Favorite Part of Constitution Kelly Clarkson Says Ex-Husband Is Ill, Postpones Las Vegas Shows “It's being portrayed as a real negative thing that we want people to follow our immigration laws, which is insane to me,” Cain said in July, while complaining about Hollywood making Superman — a character who doesn't have the greatest history of getting along with the U.S. government — too “woke.” “I feel we are in a bad situation here now because it's being stoked by politicians and by NGOs that have a political agenda. And I think bringing Superman into it, I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it's an immigrant thing, and I think it's going to hurt the numbers on the movie.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's similarly efficient in letting viewers know who, say, their new Jim is going to be, with Domhnall Gleeson's Ned quickly introducing himself as the straight-laced normie having to wrangle a staff of oddballs, while cracking jokes and smiles with a similarly sane female co-worker (Chelsea Frei). Said oddballs, meanwhile, include Tim Key, The White Lotus‘ Sabrina Impacciatore, American Vandal‘s Melvin Gregg, Ramona Young, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, and Eric Rahill, who round out the staff of a local Ohio  newspaper that seems to have  recruited its staff entirely from a roster of extremely quirky sitcom character archetypes. (Is it worth noting here that all the non-Michael, non-Dwight characters on The Office started out kind of normal, and then got crazy as we get to know them? The trailer saves its biggest connection for its end, which reveals that poor Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nuñez) is apparently doomed to have these documentarians intrude into his life no matter where he goes. (His determination to render any footage of him unusable makes up the trailer's one genuine laugh-out-loud moment.) The Paper debuts its first four episodes on Peacock on Thursday, September 4; it'll roll out two new episodes every week after until September 25.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ‘Outer Banks' creators tapped William Lipton, Axel Ellis, Jeremy Yun, Zendé Murdock and Jesse Golliher to form a teenage rock band, and then let the cameras roll. Outer Banks creators Jonas and Josh Pate tapped real-life musicians to form a teenage rock band that features in the official trailer for Prime Video's The Runarounds, which dropped on Thursday. Along with fellow cast members Lilah Pate, Maximo Salas, Kelley Pereira, Marley Aliah, Mark Wystrach, Brooklyn Decker, Hayes MacArthur and Shea Pritchard, the band members after high school graduation chase rock fame and success in Wilmington, North Carolina, while falling in love and partying as they pursue their dreams. Kelly Clarkson Postpones Vegas Residency Dates, Revealing Ex-Husband "Has Been Ill" Rock and Resistance Meet on the Music Fest Circuit “When you see them on stage, I love passion like that,” Outer Banks star Lilah Pate, who plays Sophia Kinney in The Runarounds, says at one point in the trailer. The group first performed together when they played for Pate ahead of appearing in season three after being selected from more than 5,000 musicians who responded to the casting call. The Runarounds, which like Outer Banks was shot in North Carolina, is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Skydance Television. The executive producer credits are shared by Jonas Pate, Joon Yun, David Wilcox, Josh Pate, Shannon Burke, Scott Lambert, Lisa Mae Fincannon, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Matt Thunell.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When she's not making indie-folk with Florist, Emily A. Sprague records ambient albums, and she has a new one on the way. Sprague recorded her new album while she was on tour in Japan last year. “When I began preparing for the tour, I couldn't shake a sense that the invitation to Japan was more about opening myself up to this new place instead of bringing something into it tightly under my control,” Sprague reflected. “Improvisation has always been such a pillar in my music practice, and I really wanted to meet the country, spaces, and people through that process.” Cloud Time is Sprague's first solo album since 2020's Hill, Flower, Fog. She and her bandmates in Florist released the album Jellywish earlier this year. All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before you can even say “trick or treat,” Hallmark Channel's 2025 Countdown to Christmas will be underway, with round-the-clock holiday fare and all-new movies and series to celebrate the season. The programming stunt typically kicks off in October and runs right up until Christmas. While Hallmark hasn't announced its full line-up yet, we do know about quite a few projects coming your way. Hallmark Channel has already begun promoting Countdown to Christmas with a preview that showed glimpses of what's to come, “with more joy than ever before.” Quick glimpses of upcoming movies show stars like Jonathan Bennett and Janel Parrish are in new movies. Fans have been asking for a reunion of Hynes and Erin Krakow ever since their 2021 hit “It Was Always You.” They'll finally get it with “Christmas Above the Clouds.” They won't be playing the same characters though, since it's a modern version of “A Christmas Carol.” According to the synopsis, Krakow plays a workaholic CEO who tries to skip Christmas by flying to Australia on her own and is visited by “three quirky spirits” and a surprise run-in with her ex, played by Hynes. This follow-up to 2024's “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story” is set in Buffalo with an all-star cast that includes Holland Roden playing pediatric doctor Morgan Quinn and Matthew Daddario as a longtime friend who's the Bills' VP of Stadium Development Gabe DeLuca. The cast also features Tracy Pollan, Steve Schirripa, Patti Murin, Joe Pantoliano, Caroline Aaron, Bills Head Coach Sean McDermott, and numerous players. Ella is shocked to suddenly find Nick, played by Wes Brown, a sailor and local Newport historian, aboard her schooner and accuses him of being a stowaway.” Andrew Walker and Lacey Chabert reunite onscreen for the first time since 2018's “My Secret Valentine.” According to the movie's logline, “When Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes (Chabert) is assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie Duncan, she expects a routine case. But things get complicated when Isabel unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan (Walker), and begins to question the rigid rules of her job. But in late May, Bennett told the Laughing Place that the second season will include a “surprise element we didn't have before” as well as “bigger challenges, bigger personalities,” and a “chaotic scene.” “Twelve Dates ‘Til Christmas,” first announced in March, is a six-episode, limited series starring “Parenthood” alum Mae Whitman, Emmy winner Jane Seymour, and two-time Oscar nominee Mary McDonnell.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That title is likely reserved for 2017's On The Beach At Night Alone, which follows an actress (Kim Min-hee) as she spends a chilly evening wandering the German coast, fretting if the married director she's sleeping with actually cares for her. Hong and Kim announced their extramarital affair during that film's Seoul premiere, a declaration that effectively saw the actress blacklisted from the Korean film industry. But By The Stream continues to meld the auteur and his muse with its two central characters, employing several of Hong's narrative and technical staples with an air of heightened self-reflection. With only 10 days before her students are expected to perform a short skit during a performing arts showcase, it's revealed that their boyishly handsome theater professor has been engaging each of them in clandestine romances. He's swiftly removed from his post, leaving the class without a director for the approaching event (and with unresolved tension surrounding their simultaneous courtships). Jeonim calls her uncle, Sieon (Kwon Hae-hyo, another Hong regular), a once-esteemed actor who has since been blacklisted from the industry over a vague political infraction. As he and Jeonim rekindle their bond, familiar Hong scenes unfold: Soju is endlessly poured, Korean delicacies are served, sudden zooms and pans are utilized in order not to break long takes. Romantic tensions are also stoked, both between the disgraced professor and one of his students as well as between Jeonim's uncle and her boss Jeong (Cho Yun-hee), who gushes over the former actor's talent. The latter scenario is to Jeonim's thinly veiled chagrin, as she ponders what implications their potential affair might incur both personally and professionally. Yet details in By The Stream feel more relevant to Hong and Kim's joint experiences as a couple, riffing on the trials they continue to overcome. The most obvious of these allusions is Sieon's blacklisted status, but the impressionistic tapestries woven by Jeonim feel directly inspired by Hong's diminishing vision (which he previously evoked in the intentionally blurry lensing of 2023's In Water). Once again, the amorphous quality of water serves as a metaphor for bleary eyes, as Jeonim sits by the stream near campus and sketches abstract images for her massive two-meter pieces. Entitled Flowing Water, her artwork also feels directly linked to Hong's own artistic approach. “Being able to complete this whole structure by myself,” she says, “that's satisfying.” The filmmaker has served as director, writer, editor, cinematographer, and composer of his most recent projects, first wearing all these hats with Introduction in 2021. The familial dynamic between Jeonim and Sieon serves as an interesting buffer for their real-life counterparts, allowing Hong and Kim to reflect on each other's personhood without the obfuscating effect of their domestic partnership. Once one is considered a persona non grata, even the most calculated and comparatively small-scale of efforts will still garner considerable backlash. “It was just something you shouldn't do,” she scolds in regard to his pursuit of the student actresses. “You made it impossible to work with them.” While an added ethical boundary is at play here—as well as several more hearts involved—there is an intriguing dialogue being had about the validity of pursuing such a relationship in general. One could read this plot detail as a tongue-in-cheek assertion that Hong and Kim's affair is relatively tame, based on mutual attraction and creative appreciation as opposed to the professor's predatory proclivities. His life—now inextricably tethered to Kim's—is refracted and shaped by the path carved by the mighty Han river, which Jeonim follows upstream as part of her ongoing tapestry work. Hong's recent films have been categorized as overtly languid, narratively slight, and relentlessly quotidian. With Hong's eyesight diminishing, one wonders if he might be increasingly relying on Kim's vision, both in the sensory and artistic sense—their ongoing project of mutual creation is only getting deeper and more transcendent.
