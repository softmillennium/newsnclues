                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Laurent Saint-Cyr, left, attends the ceremony for his appointment as president of the Transitional Council in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025. Outgoing president of the transitional council Fritz Alphonse Jean, right, speaks during a ceremony to name Laurent Saint-Cyr, center, as the new council president in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025. Saint-Cyr had his start at a local insurance company while Haiti's current prime minister once ran an internet firm. “Our country is going through one of the greatest crises in all its history,” Saint-Cyr said at a ceremony attended by ambassadors of several countries. In a video posted on social media, Viv Ansanm gang leader Jimmy Chérizier — better known as “Barbecue” — warns residents to give his armed group free passage through several neighborhoods to reach the council's office. “People of Haiti, take care of yourselves and help us … in the battle to free the country,” Chérizier says, wearing a bulletproof vest and with an automatic rifle slung around his shoulder. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police said in a statement that officers thwarted potential attacks by around-the-clock patrols and by boosting the number of armed forces in certain neighborhoods and around critical infrastructure. “Armed gangs had plotted to disrupt national stability and render the country ungovernable,” it said. He'll be working with Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a one-time president of an internet company in Haiti and also a former president of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Saint-Cyr said security was the council's utmost priority. He called on the armed forces to intensify their operations and on international partners to send more soldiers, offer more training and help boost a mission lacking resources and personnel. He questioned what was preventing the government from offering services Haitians deserve, including health and education. “Mister prime minister, assume your responsibilities!” he said. Meanwhile, 58 organizations from countries that include the United States in a letter to Saint-Cyr accused the council of violating its legal obligations to Haiti's women and girls. “Collective rape is endemic,” they said, noting that sexual violence has surged as gangs persist in their rampage. The organizations also accused Haiti's government of being “completely absent” at shelters where rape survivors need basic services. A growing number of people have grumbled about Haiti's private sector leading the country. However, dozens of Haitians wearing white T-shirts and clutching signs emblazoned with Saint-Cyr's photograph gathered outside the council's office to support him. Skirmishes broke out hours later between supporters and those who opposed Saint-Cyr. “Even though he's a mulatto with good hair, he's Haitian,” one supporter said of Saint-Cyr, who is part of the country's small and powerful lighter-skinned elite — as is Fils-Aimé. As the country prepared for Saint-Cyr's swearing-in ceremony, Haitians posted a flurry of warnings about violence in hopes that people could remain safe. Tripotay Lakay, a local news site, reported that one person was killed and another injured while driving into Port-au-Prince on Thursday, though it was unclear how that happened. Heavy gunfire around downtown Port-au-Prince persisted on Tuesday afternoon, with local media reporting that several people were wounded. Small explosions from police-manned drones also were heard. Violence also was reported in Kenscoff, a once peaceful farming area above the hills of Port-au-Prince. The U.N.-backed mission said it lost two armored vehicles after they became trapped in trenches dug out by gangs. It said Kenyan policemen came under an attack with Molotov cocktails but “courageously held their ground, inflicting significant damage on the assailants.” Three officers received minor injuries. Videos posted on social media show suspected gang members laughing and cheering as they surrounded one of the armored vehicles that was later set on fire. “Come get it back if you can!” one gunman is heard jeering. In a report released Thursday, the U.N.-backed mission noted that it has 991 personnel, far less than the 2,500 envisioned, and some $112 million in its trust fund — about 14% of the estimated $800 million needed a year. The mission said it has no air support for operations and that only 200 officers can be deployed at a time because of insufficient equipment, including vehicles. Violence surged in the aftermath of the July 2021 killing of President Jovenel Moïse, and ongoing violence has displaced more than 1.3 million people in recent years. At least 1,520 people were killed and more than 600 injured from April to the end of June across Haiti. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

Seattle Kraken center John Hayden and their mascot, Buoy, had a close encounter with a brown bear during a promotional video shoot in Alaska in June. Hayden and Buoy were on a fly-fishing outing in Katmai National Park when the bear approached them. While fishing, Hayden and Buoy were accompanied by a guide, who spotted the bear. This image taken from video provided by the Seattle Kraken shows a brown bear splashing toward the NHL Kraken sea troll mascot known as Buoy, left, next to a fishing guide during the filming of a promotional video in a river outside Anchorage, Alaska, June 25, 2025. As they were moving away, the bear, which had been moving closer to them, turned and charged through the water for a few paces before coming to a stop and turning away. "They were pretty interested in his look." Seattle Kraken mascot Buoy celebrates on the ice following a 4-0 victory against the Vancouver Canucks at Climate Pledge Arena on October 1, 2022, in Seattle, Washington. Brown bears commonly feast on salmon in the Brooks River in Katmai National Park, gobbling them as they leap upstream over Brooks Falls to spawn. "Bears are everywhere at Brooks Falls and, like, this is their territory," said Kraken Partnership Marketing Director Melissa O'Brochta, who also recorded the encounter from shore. "They're also super used to seeing humans. Seattle Kraken center John Hayden (15) looks on against the San Jose Sharks during the third period at SAP Center in San Jose on April 5, 2025, in San Jose, California. Hayden and Buoy were in Alaska as part of an annual trip organized by the Bristol Bay Native Corporation in Anchorage, Alaska, with events that promote youth ice hockey. Alaska does not have its own NHL team; the closest teams are in Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, which has the Vancouver Canucks. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is “ready to pay a big price” and pledged to back India's farmers amid increased U.S. tariffs on his country. “But I'm ready for the sake of India's farmers, fishermen, and livestock keepers. Modi did not mention the new tariffs, which his country recently called “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” On Thursday, Trump celebrated the rollout of his tariffs on more than 50 countries. Trump could restrict Russia's trade prospects further if India relents and drops its financial support of the Russian oil industry. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,” Trump wrote on social media. “They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine. Indian officials have indicated that they will continue to buy Russian oil. However, the tariffs are making Trump less popular with India, a U.S. ally, and its people. Farmers are a large voting bloc in India, and the tariffs will undoubtedly affect them. The prime minister also spoke with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? For the past few months, when I really needed to get something done, I put on a special pair of headphones that could read my mind. The headphones are equipped with a brain-computer interface that picks up electrical signals from my brain and uses algorithms to interpret that data. It sounds like something out of science fiction, but a decade-old startup called Neurable is pioneering the technology, and it's preparing to put the brain-tracking tricks into more gadgets. Earbuds, glasses, helmets — anything that can get an electrode near your head could provide a real-time stream of data about what's going on inside of it. Beyond measuring attention, the company is now using that data to track and improve brain health. But, it knows when you're entertained or distracted and could one day detect symptoms of depression or, on a much more consequential front, early signs of Alzheimer's disease. I came across Neurable on a longer mission to understand the future of health-tracking technology by testing what's out there now. It's one that left me anxious, covered in smart rings and continuous glucose monitors, and more confused about the definition of well-being. That's because almost all health trackers that are popular on the market right now — Apple Watches, Oura Rings, Whoop Bands — are downstream sensors. They measure consequences, like elevated heart rate or body temperature, rather than the root cause of that state. By tapping directly into your brainwaves, a brain-computer interface can spot issues sometimes years before they would show up. “Biologically, your brain is designed to hide your weaknesses: It's an evolutionary effect,” Neurable's co-founder and CEO Ramses Alcaide, a neuroscientist, told me. Other major tech companies are also exploring ways to incorporate non-invasive brain-computer interfaces into headphones. A couple years ago, Apple quietly applied for a patent for an AirPod design that uses electrodes to monitor brain activity, and NextSense, which grew out of Google's moonshot division, wants to build earbud-based brain monitors for the mass market. There's also been a recent boom in activity around invasive brain-computer interfaces being developed by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink and even Meta that surgically implant chips into people's brains. It's safe to say that's not currently a mass-market approach. Still, while all of those mega market cap companies ponder the possibilities of their own brain-powered projects, Neurable's is on the market. Spun out of the University of Michigan's Direct Brain Interface Lab in 2015, Neurable initially planned to break into the gaming industry. An early version of its technology used EEG sensors in a VR headset to power the world's first brain-controlled video game but pivoted to wearables before launching a wildly successful Indiegogo campaign for a futuristic set of headphones. That attracted the attention of major hardware makers and a partnership with Master & Dynamic. If you start to get distracted by, say, thinking about flying an actual rocket ship, the numbers go down, and the rocket ship slows. The EEG sensors in Neurable's products can pick up a range of brainwave frequencies, which are associated with different behaviors and activities. The beta frequency band provides some information about attention state as well as anxiety, while alpha indicates a mind at rest. While EEG sensors and brain-computer interfaces are most often seen in labs, putting these sensors into a device that people wear every day stands to transform our understanding of the mind. If you changed the technology's mission from measuring focus to, say, symptoms of depression, you could imagine how an everyday gadget could offer some life-changing interventions. The Pentagon has been using Neurable's portable technology to study traumatic head injuries in soldiers, for instance, and that research could have practical applications in sports. Alcaide also mentioned Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as potential targets for their technology. Symptoms for these diseases don't appear for years after onset, but early markers could show up in the kind of EEG data their technology captures from everyday wear. If you changed the technology's mission from measuring focus to, say, symptoms of depression, you could imagine how an everyday gadget could offer some life-changing interventions. For now, however, the MW75 Neuro headphones are primarily used to sharpen your attention — with the new and added benefit of giving you a snapshot of your brain health. Your focus is measured as low, medium, or high, and when you're flagging for a while, the app will prompt you to take a break. You can also turn on a feature called Biofeedback, which plays music of varying intensity in order to nudge your focus toward the high range. The Brain Health reports are still in beta mode but will show you daily estimates of how you're doing in terms of things like anxiety resistance, cognitive speed, and wakefulness. The way you know that the device isn't actually reading your mind comes down to science and a strong data policy. Neurable's technology picks up raw voltage — not actual thoughts — from your neurons and uses AI to decode the data and identify signals associated with focus, the company's co-founder Adam Molnar explained to me recently. Furthermore, he said, Neurable has no ambitions to be a data company. As with many other health trackers, there's sort of a placebo cat effect: Simply deciding to track the behavior changed my state of mind and made me behave a certain way. I wear AirPods for most of the day, whether it's taking calls for work, listening to podcasts, or just drowning out the sounds outside my Brooklyn apartment. If these earbuds were also collecting data about my cognitive well-being during all those activities, I'd be interested in knowing what I could glean from that information, if only to better understand what's rotting my brain. And I'm sure plenty of companies would be happy to collect more data about their users' states of mind at any given time. Imagine if the TikTok algorithm knew you weren't interested in something — not because you swiped through it but rather because your brainwaves said so. Neurable's website has mockups of EEG-equipped earbuds, helmets, and smart glasses, and it's clear that the company is eager to move beyond its first product. The company doesn't just want to make gadgets, either. It wants to be the leading platform for brain-powered technology. “Just like Bluetooth is in every single device, and everyone should have access to Bluetooth, we believe that everyone should have access to neuro tech,” Alcaide told me. Neurable is indeed one of many startups trying to bring neuro tech to the masses, although they're the only ones selling a product I'd actually wear in public. A company called Emotiv, which also partnered with Master & Dynamic, will start selling its own EEG-equipped earbuds this fall. It remains to be seen if and when Apple will make brain-reading AirPods, but they've already partnered with a brain interface startup called Synchron, which allows people to control iPhones with their minds (Haven't you always wanted to become one with your iPhone? Whether that future ends up looking miraculous or like a Black Mirror episode is up to us — and to the companies, like Neurable, pioneering it.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Harvard medical student Nick Norwitz reveals the science behind his food experiment, in which he consumed 133,000 mg of dietary cholesterol The question of whether to incorporate eggs into a healthy diet has long been debated due to their cholesterol content. High cholesterol is known to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a leading cause of death. The randomized, controlled study — which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition — assigned 61 adults with baseline LDL cholesterol to various diets for five weeks each. Previous guidance warned against egg intake as a potential risk to heart health. These included a high-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet with two eggs per day; a low-cholesterol, high-saturated fat diet without eggs; and a high-cholesterol, high-saturated fat control diet with one egg per week. Across all three diets, saturated fat intake was "positively correlated" with LDL cholesterol, but dietary cholesterol (primarily found in animal products like meat and eggs) was not. "The key message is that it is not foods that are high in cholesterol that increase blood levels of 'bad' cholesterol, but it is the saturated fat in the foods that we consume," study co-author Jon Buckley, executive dean at the University of South Australia, told Fox News Digital. These findings follow a December 2024 advisory from the FDA that deemed eggs "healthy," due to growing research that the food does not raise bad cholesterol. "Current research shows that cholesterol in eggs does not negatively impact your body's cholesterol levels as was once thought," the news release stated. These findings follow a December 2024 advisory from the FDA that deemed eggs "healthy," due to growing research that the food does not raise bad cholesterol. "This important milestone closes the door on decades of debate over whether eggs are good for you and reinforces their standing as a powerhouse of nutrition." Certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco, who is based in New York, confirmed in an interview with Fox News Digital that eggs can be part of a balanced diet. They serve a "decent amount" of lean protein at about 6 grams per egg and contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the expert said. "For a long time, it was thought that dietary cholesterol (any foods containing cholesterol) caused cholesterol levels to rise – but in more recent years, that notion has been debunked by many studies," she said. DeCicco, who was not involved in the study, said saturated fat is mostly found in dairy and meat products like cheese, creams, butter, fatty cuts of meat, dark meat, poultry, processed meats like sausage and bacon, and processed baked goods. "Not only do eggs contain little saturated fat, but they also contain monounsaturated fat and omega 3 fats, which are heart- and brain-protective," she added. Eggs contain less than 2 grams of saturated fat, and the American Heart Association recommends about 12 to 13 grams of saturated fat per day for a 2,000-calorie diet. "So eating two to three eggs with vegetables and fruit is a nutritious breakfast full of protein, fiber and healthy fat that will provide long-lasting fuel," DeCicco said. Buckley agreed, recommending that "if you are going out for a cooked breakfast of bacon and eggs, consider swapping out some of the bacon or sausage for more eggs, and this will help you maintain a healthier blood cholesterol level."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Army estimated the restoration of a Confederate statue in Arlington National Cemetery that was removed in 2023 will cost $10 million, an official said Wednesday. However, the statue is plagued by past controversy. Arlington National Cemetery describes the statue, built by Confederate veteran Moses Jacob Ezekiel and erected in 1914, as “a nostalgic, mythologized vision of the Confederacy, including highly sanitized depictions of slavery.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings. A congressional-mandated commission ordered the statue to be taken down or renamed along with other Confederate monuments in 2022. Gen. Ty Seidule, vice chairman of the commission, said the commission found Ezekiel's memorial is “problematic from top to bottom.” Hegseth has found a unique way to keep Confederate names intact. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which slams attempts to rename historical objects. The order says, “Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We're reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those reports,” Wright told CNN's Kaitlan Collins in an interview on “The Source.” Wright dismissed the past reports, saying “they weren't fair in broad-based assessments of climate change.” Energy spokesperson Andrea Woods said, “The National Climate Reports are published by NOAA, not DOE. Trump EPA proposes revoking pollution limits based in part on document authored by 5 climate contrarians The reports take years to research, draft and publish and go through multiple rounds of peer review, with all 13 federal agencies that conduct climate research. An independent National Academy of Sciences panel signs off on the content. Altering or revising previously published assessments would be a significant escalation in the administration's attempts to wipe credible climate science off the record. “That would be a very unusual approach, especially given the process that went into creating these,” said scientist Zeke Hausfather, the climate research lead at financial services company Stripe, who helped author the Fifth National Climate Assessment. Wright played a large role in commissioning a new federal report that questioned the severity of climate change, authored by five researchers who are well-known climate contrarians. The report was issued last week, in conjunction with a proposed regulatory repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency's “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety. Wright told CNN that he hand-picked the four researchers and one economist who authored the Trump administration report: John Christy and Roy Spencer, both research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Georgia Tech professor emeritus Judith Curry and Canadian economist Ross McKitrick. “I made a list of about a dozen of them that I thought were very senior and very well respected. I called the top five, and everyone said yes.” It is now undergoing a public comment process.</p>

Manitoba has seen the highest amount of fires this season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The numbers showed that the US economy added a modest 73,000 jobs in July, several thousand under what economists had forecasted. President Donald Trump was outraged by the revisions, calling the data “a scam.” And he directed his anger towards BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Kimberly Adams, senior Washington correspondent for Marketplace and the host of the Marketplace podcast Make Me Smart, told Vox that everyone in her business is getting whiplash. “We were doing all of these stories about why is the economy so resilient? Why isn't anybody reacting to tariffs?” Adams said. “And then this week we're all talking about, my gosh, are we heading into stagflation and recession?” Below is an excerpt of Adams's conversation with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. The jobs numbers came in lower than expected last week, and they indicate that there's not the same kind of robust labor market that we thought we'd had over the last couple of months. And they were pretty drastic revisions that shocked a lot of people. These revisions tell us that the labor market we thought we had the last few months — that seemed to be pretty resilient against the tariffs and other changes President Trump and his administration were making in the economy — it wasn't actually as resilient as we thought. I should say: Labor market numbers get revised all the time. GDP numbers get revised all the time to pick whatever economic indicator you want. But these revisions in particular were, a) really large, and b) just fundamentally changed the story of what the labor market looked like over the last couple of months. So not only did the numbers tell us that there was less hiring than we thought there was, it also told us that the labor market itself shrank, that there was a lower labor force participation rate. The report also told us that if it weren't for job growth in the tariff-resilient health care sector, we would have had almost no job growth at all. I imagine that may be what the president wants to believe, that the numbers will be a bit more appealing. There's been a huge backlash to this firing from the community of people that follow this stuff very closely. And putting in someone who might be a little bit more amenable to the president's narrative around economic data has the potential to undermine economic data in the United States and make it less trustworthy — both for businesses here in the US, as well as in the global economy. I mean, for people who don't pay attention to these numbers, why does trustworthy data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics matter to this country and to the world? Because lots of different businesses and countries and even individuals use this data to make decisions about how they're going to manage their money, how they're going to manage their businesses, and how they're going to plan for the future. So, for example, if you know that the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, which is what the numbers came in at last week, you can say that's a pretty low unemployment rate. The Federal Reserve has two mandates: full employment and stable prices. Stable prices equates to a more or less 2 percent inflation rate. We are still trending a little bit above 2 percent inflation, but when the Fed met last week, which was before these jobs numbers came out, the unemployment situation looked pretty good. So they didn't have much of an incentive to do anything about interest rates, because inflation was still running a bit high. So let's leave interest rates until inflation cools down a bit more. If the Fed had the information on Wednesday that they ended up getting on Friday, would that have changed their decision? It has sounded for weeks now like Trump has been itching to fire Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed. He didn't end up firing Powell, but then he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Are the economists you're talking to afraid that this might not be the end of Trump getting rid of people who seem to disagree with his imaginary vision of what the numbers should be? This is definitely creating an environment where folks are worried that even if people at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (or any other federal statistical agencies) are still putting their heads down, doing the work, and churning out the data without fear or favor — if they release a report that the president doesn't like, they might lose their job. Even if they still do the work, other people and other entities might look at it and say, well, can it really be true? Look at a country like China, which releases economic data about the performance of its economy all the time. And you'll always hear folks say, take it with a grain of salt because the Chinese Communist Party likes to mess with the numbers. What happens if we end up in the same boat?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But whatever you may read in the press, Gregory Washington is running out of options. GMU's Board of Visitors is responsive to the state's voters and taxpayers, not to a leftist professoriate predictably circling the wagons around Washington. The board did not fire Washington last week as many expected, but soon enough, it will have to do its duty and vote on whether to remove him. The first is that GMU has allowed antisemitism to thrive on campus, making Jewish students feel unsafe. The other Education Department investigation is “based on a complaint filed with OCR by multiple professors at GMU who allege that the university illegally uses race and other immutable characteristics in university policies, including hiring and promotion.” The DOJ investigations seek to “determine whether it is engaged in discriminatory employment practices based on race and sex,” and “whether the university has denied equal treatment of individuals based on race or national origin, in violation of Title VI.” Give Washington credit for his adroit use of the faculty, the press, and friendly Democrats in Virginia's legislature and congressional delegation. They have rallied to his cause and given him the Houdini-like abilities to escape accountability that we saw last week — so far. But Washington's use of politics and PR is being recognized for what it is: a refusal to accept that the nation's mood has changed. Trump was elected in part because voters have had it with the use of race in hiring, promotions, and as a cudgel to change society. Ditto for the political cover Washington has been able to garner, as valuable as that has been for the moment. Mark Warner (D-VA), a liberal Democrat, and Tim Kaine (D-VA), a left-wing progressive, rushed to Washington's aid in a July 9 op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, likening Washington's predicament to the recent ousting of Jim Ryan as president of the University of Virginia. Already, the Trump administration appears to be eyeing its next target: George Mason University President Gregory Washington. Warner and Kaine added, sagely, that “decisions about who leads our colleges and universities should rest with their boards — appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state legislature — not with partisan actors in Washington seeking headlines or revenge.” First, it is the Left that politicized higher education in the first place, when it began to hire only like-minded liberals to populate the faculty lounge and then leveraged that monopoly to indoctrinate students into a leftist worldview. It could be resolved much earlier if either federal department finds that GMU — that is, Washington — is not compliant with strong antidiscrimination laws. Not that the board gave Washington a ringing endorsement at its meeting last week, either — far from it. It was the same lack of support by the UVA board that convinced Ryan this summer that his gig was up. Unfortunately for Washington, the evidence that he uses racial preferences is clear. Just four years ago he wrote, “If you have two candidates who are both ‘above the bar' in terms of requirements for a position, but one adds to your diversity and the other does not, then why couldn't that candidate be better, even if that candidate may not have better credentials than the other candidate?” And it's not just something he said four years ago. GMU included in a recent student orientation video a land acknowledgment statement, and it referred to America as “Turtle Island,” a term supposedly originating with some Indian tribes that leftists use to legitimize the United States. Three members of the GMU faculty wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education recently, “Let's be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn't about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. The views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not reflect any institutional position for Heritage or its board of trustees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A picture of hostage Eitan Horn, held in Hamas captive in the Gaza Strip, hangs on a barbed wire during a protest by families at the plaza known as the hostages square in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to the audience at a conference in Jerusalem, Sunday, July 27, 2025. Israel has routed its enemies across the region but has yet to return all its hostages from the Gaza Strip. Hamas appears to have been decimated militarily but has kept up insurgent attacks. Gaza is in ruins and experts say it is sliding into famine, and long-running ceasefire talks seem to have broken down. Both Israel and Hamas have embraced visions for how the war should end, but mediators from two American administrations, Egypt and Qatar have yet to bridge the gaps. There are at least two other scenarios in which the war goes on indefinitely, at an unimaginable cost to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians, the Israeli hostages and their families. For days now, Israeli media have reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of ordering the full reoccupation of Gaza for the first time since Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers two decades ago. That would mean sending ground troops into the few areas of Gaza that haven't been totally destroyed, the roughly 25% of the territory where much of its 2 million people have sought refuge, including the sprawling coastal displacement camps of Muwasi. It would lead to countless more Palestinian deaths and more mass displacement, and it could put the roughly 20 remaining living hostages at serious risk. It would also leave Israel in full control of the territory, obliged by international law to provide security and ensure the basic needs of the population are met. There is also opposition within Israel, from those who fear for the hostages and former security chiefs who have warned of a quagmire. Hamas has said it will release all the remaining hostages in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. Israel fears that withdrawing from Gaza would allow Hamas to eventually rebuild its military machine and maintain influence in the territory even if doesn't hold formal power, paving the way for another Oct. 7-style attack. Netanyahu may also fear that his far-right allies would follow through on threats to bring down the government if he agrees to such terms. That could spell the end of his 16 nearly unbroken years in power, leaving him more vulnerable to long-running corruption charges and inquiries into the security and intelligence failures around the 2023 attack. Netanyahu has said he will end the war once all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or agrees to disarm and go into exile. But even then, he says Israel will pursue plans to relocate much of Gaza's population to other countries through what he refers to as “voluntary emigration.” The Palestinians and much of the international community see the plan as forcible expulsion in violation of international law. Netanyahu says Israel is willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire in which Hamas would release several living hostages and the bodies of others in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a flood of humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli pullback. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to the audience at a conference in Jerusalem, Sunday, July 27, 2025. Hamas has said it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not lay down its arms as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. But Hamas has already lost thousands of fighters and nearly all of its top leaders in Gaza, where it no longer controls many areas. Its strongest allies, Iran and Hezbollah, have been severely weakened. The hostages are the last bargaining chip held by Hamas, which also has a strong culture of martyrdom. It's quite possible the war continues in its current state. Israel could continue carrying out daily strikes across the territory, which it says have only targeted militants but have frequently killed adult civilians and children. Hamas could keep up a low tempo of hit-and-run attacks, occasionally killing Israeli soldiers. Additional measures to get more food into Gaza may stave off famine and allow aid to be distributed more safely. The hostages could survive in captivity for months or even years. Israel is set to hold elections in October 2026 — and likely earlier — which could bring in new leadership even if Netanyahu keeps his coalition intact. Which scenario unfolds will largely depend on U.S. President Donald Trump, who has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, and who proved he has leverage over Netanyahu when he brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after 12 days of war in June. A picture of hostage Eitan Horn, held in Hamas captive in the Gaza Strip, hangs on a barbed wire during a protest by families at the plaza known as the hostages square in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025. Trump has said he wants to end the war in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home, but he has exerted no public pressure on Israel and appears to have fully accepted its terms for a ceasefire. Asked on Tuesday whether he would support Israel reoccupying Gaza, Trump said, “It's going to be pretty much up to Israel.”</p>

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss oil giant BP's decision to lower their spending on green energy initiatives. In Tuesday's "Morning Glory" column, I laid out a small part of the abuses perpetrated on farmers, ranchers and landowners by the application of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) to private property by the 9,000 bureaucrats of the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS.) The USFWS is by far the worst offender of private property rights, but NOAA as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also contribute to the giant, tangled tumbleweed of regulations, rules, "guidance," incompetence and environmental extremism that have paralyzed major infrastructure projects as well home and apartment building projects across the country. Three executive orders from President Trump would greatly assist the farmers, ranchers and landowners who have been shut down from using their land in whole or part because of the listing of one or more of the 1,300 species and subspecies listed as "endangered" or "threatened" by the USFWS and NOAA. The first EO would direct Secretary Burgum to immediately remove from the list of "endangered" or "threatened" species and subspecies all mammals, birds, crustaceans and insects that were added to the list because of the application of the criteria that looks at the "projected decline" in "critical habitat" or "occupied or potentially occupied habitat." This criteria for declaring a species or subspecies on the basis of "projected decline" of its habitat is guesswork, not "science," and the application of this criteria has been repeatedly abused by bureaucrats for the past three decades. A species or subspecies is considered "endangered" when it is in "imminent" danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A "threatened species" is one that is liable to become endangered in the foreseeable future. Both the terms "imminent" and "foreseeable" are accordion terms that can be stretched to absurd limits. When the ESA passed in 1973 there were 78 species or subspecies listed as "endangered" or "threatened." This extraordinary rise in the number of "protected" species is because the Service began using "projected future decline" in a species' or subspecies' range. Every species or subspecies that is on the list because of projected loss of habitat should be immediately removed from the list. Very often the USFWS doesn't even account for permanently set aside parks and open spaces in its calculations of "projected habitat loss." If President Trump orders these removals from the ESA list be done immediately, he will focus the energy and budget of the bureaucracy on truly endangered and threatened species, and stop environmental extremists within the USFWS and NOAA and outside of those agencies from manipulating the list. Finally, President Trump should order Secretary Burgum and USFWS Director Brian Nesvik to downsize both the USFWS and NOAA and do so on the basis of merit. Too many activists have infiltrated these agencies and use the ESA to block development, not protect species. It is long past time to clean house, beginning with new regional and area directors who are committed to the Constitution's explicit protection of private property, not their own private agendas or stopping development. The Pacific Legal Foundation does yeoman's work to protect the rights of all landowners, including ranchers, farmers and developers, but the scale of this problem has been growing exponentially for decades. Secretary Burgum and Director Nesvik would do well to hire from within the Pacific Legal Foundation for their senior staffs. That way lies growth and true protection of genuinely endangered or threatened species. And if that protection requires the sequestration of private property for months or years, the landowner should be paid immediately for their lost economic value of their land, as the Fifth Amendment requires.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever. The poll aligns with many others, which have shown public support for the Supreme Court collapsing since Justice Amy Coney Barrett's 2020 confirmation gave Republicans a 6-3 supermajority on the high Court. One of the Gallup poll's most significant, if unsurprising, findings is that there is also an unprecedented partisan gap in public approval of the Court. This partisan gap is more or less what any close observer of the justices would predict, given the Court's recent behavior. Last year, the Republican justices ruled that President Donald Trump has broad immunity from prosecution — so broad, in fact, that the GOP justices even determined that Trump may order the Justice Department to prosecute his perceived enemies “for an improper purpose.” Similarly, since Trump returned to power last January, the Court has blocked more than a dozen lower court decisions that limited Trump's ability to act unilaterally. In Medina v. Planned Parenthood, for example, the Republican justices effectively repealed a law permitting Medicaid patients to choose their own health providers after some of those patients chose Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider and Republican bête noire. In fairness, not all polls show the Court is currently at its all-time low point. Fox's poll shows public approval of the Court rising this July from its post-Trump immunity low. (Although Fox News is closely aligned with the GOP, its polls are well-respected and generally viewed as reliable.) Still, while individual polls disagree about whether the Court is unpopular or historically unpopular, the broader trend of voters losing faith in the Court as it aligns itself more closely with the Republican Party has been apparent in polling data for quite some time. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Court had distinct “liberal” and “conservative” blocs, but it would not be fair to describe it as partisan. Two Republican appointees, Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter, typically voted with the Court's liberal bloc. Justice Anthony Kennedy, another Republican, voted with the conservative bloc on most issues, but also held moderate views on abortion and frequently supported gay rights. Obama replaced Stevens and Souter with his own appointees. Trump replaced Kennedy with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a much more hardline conservative. Now, the best predictor of how each justice will vote in politically charged cases is whether they were appointed by a Democrat or a Republican. In the past, American presidents often paid surprisingly little attention to their justices' ideologies — President Woodrow Wilson, for example, appointed the reactionary Justice James Clark McReynolds largely because he found McReynolds obnoxious and wanted to get the man (who was serving as Wilson's attorney general) out of the cabinet. Some of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's justices, for example, were segregationists — a view that put them at odds with the Democratic Party's liberal views on race under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Beginning in the Reagan administration, however, the Republican Party started producing lengthy documents laying out what Republicans did and did not believe judges should do. They also worked with ideologically aligned organizations like the Federalist Society to vet potential nominees to ensure that their judges shared the party's vision. Democrats, meanwhile, do not have the same formal structures to evaluate potential Supreme Court nominees, but they've been no less successful in choosing justices who share the Democratic Party's approach to governance. So it is no surprise that, after decades of both parties appointing carefully vetted partisans to the Supreme Court, public approval of the Court now aligns with voters' political party. The American people correctly perceive that the Supreme Court has become a partisan institution, and that perception is now apparent in polling data. ﻿The Court recently saved part of the Voting Rights Act. The justice has one half of a really good idea. Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action. Zed Nelson spots the painting on the wall behind me almost as soon as we begin our interview. The painting reminds him of another artwork, “A young Tiger Playing With Its Mother,” by the French Romantic artist Eugene Delacroix, who used a captive tiger at a zoo and his pet cat as models. As we removed ourselves from nature, and it receded from our imagination, we reenacted these hyper-romantic versions of nature,” said Nelson. Captured across 14 countries and four continents over six years, the images show nature as imagined by humans: staged habitats in zoos, manufactured ski slopes, indoor rainforests, and artificial beaches. In his previous project, “Love Me,” Nelson explored the homogenization of beauty standards. It's about how this artificial, idealized version of nature is being — I mean, I want to say sold back to us, but we're willing participants in it, too,” Nelson explained. “While we destroy the real thing, we seem to be creating more and more artificial or choreographed, curated versions of nature.” It's this “psychological disconnect” that Nelson is most interested in exposing. The collection is equal parts ironic (a Maasai tribesman posing beside a picnic blanket for an “Out of Africa” champagne brunch in Kenya) and dystopian (a child perched on a fiberglass rock at a beach in the world's largest indoor rainforest, the canvas of the sky slightly ripped behind him). More than anything, though, there's a feeling of sadness that permeates the collection: taxidermied museum dioramas of endangered species; vibrant fish shoals swimming in dark aquariums with plastic pipes, captive elephants paraded to a bathing spot for the benefit of flocks of Instagram influencers; a caged polar bear crouched beside a mural depicting an Arctic landscape it will never know. “What we replaced real nature with becomes an unwitting monument, really, for what we've lost,” Nelson observed. But Nelson believes firmly that, in years to come, today's society will mark the beginning of this new era, evident in elevated carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels, an abundance of microplastics, and layers of concrete. “The usefulness of renaming an epoch, in this instance, would be to focus people's attention on our impact on the planet,” said Nelson. He wanted to counter this collective numbness with visuals that “make you think or feel differently.” Bleak but beautiful, his photos reveal a paradox. Less than 3% of the world's land remains ecologically intact, according to a 2021 study, yet nature-based tourism and biophilic architecture, a design philosophy that mimics nature, are surging in popularity. Arctic ice sheets are on course for catastrophic “runaway melting” that would see rising sea levels devastate coastal communities. But at the same time, cocktail bars in Dubai are importing ancient glacier ice from Greenland to provide the wealthy with pollution-free drinks. There's a spectrum to the illusion, ranging from managed outdoor landscapes to contrived scenes that simply evoke the idea of nature. We want to consume it and then come home. Despite his criticisms of the “consumerist” qualities of today's manufactured natural experiences, Nelson emphasizes that he's not necessarily against any of these things: people should enjoy safaris, be awe-inspired at aquariums, relish their time in a local park, and not “destroy ourselves with guilt.” Haunting images from photo prize show the ‘beauty and tragedy' of our planet There's a limit to what the individual can do, too: the kind of sweeping change required to protect the environment needs to come from major corporations and political leaders, which, in Nelson's view, is sorely lacking. “It's important to remind ourselves, it's not that we don't have ideas for things that can be done,” he said, reeling off a long list of environmental policies that could change the course of climate change. Perhaps this book, with its stark juxtaposition of astonishing wildlife and human interference, can be a reminder of just how in control of the world we are — with the power to remodel it in our own image, or protect and restore the landscapes we feel so connected to. “When you're surrounded by something so much, it can become utterly invisible,” Nelson said. A cockatoo-shaped ceramic jug next to pine-scented candles and an aluminum “lemon-wedge” bottle opener. It's hard to shake Nelson's words about our collective complicity; our willingness to participate in reconstructing the natural world, instead of saving it.</p>
