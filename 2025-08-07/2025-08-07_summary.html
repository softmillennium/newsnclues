             The chair of the Texas House Democratic caucus remained defiant Thursday in the face of one US senator's bid to enlist the FBI's help in returning him and his state House colleagues to the state.
    


            “Sure, if they don't follow the law,” state Rep. Gene Wu told CNN's Pamela Brown on “The Situation Room,” when asked whether he was concerned the FBI would arrest him and his fellow Texas state House members.
    


            “We know that the governor has no power outside of the state, and we know that the federal government cannot get involved in this unless there is a legal reason why they are allowed to get involved.”
    


            Wu and dozens of Democratic state lawmakers remain outside of Texas as they continue their standoff with the Texas GOP over proposed changes to the state's congressional maps that would favor Republicans. Earlier this week, state House Speaker Dustin Burrows signed civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats and said law enforcement would “need some time to work.”
    


How Texas Republicans want to dismantle Democratic districts



            The warrants empowered state troopers to arrest the absent Democrats and bring them to the Texas Capitol, but the Democrats fled to Illinois, New York and Massachusetts – three Democratic-led states outside Texas law enforcement's authority without local officials' cooperation. Legal experts consulted by CNN have said it's highly unlikely the Democratic lawmakers can be arrested outside state lines based on the warrants.
    


            Texas US Sen. John Cornyn, who is up for reelection next year, said Thursday the FBI had granted his request of federal assistance for state law enforcement, as they work with Texas Republicans to bring back the lawmakers and reestablish quorum.
    


            “I am proud to announce that Director Kash Patel has approved my request for the FBI to assist state and local law enforcement in locating runaway Texas House Democrats,” Cornyn said in a statement, but did not elaborate on what such assistance would entail.
    


            He told conservative talk show host Mark Davis later Thursday that Patel had assigned agents from the bureau's Austin and San Antonio offices to fulfill his request – though did not detail what role they would have.
    


            The state lawmakers who left the state have held multiple public press conferences and made a number of media appearances. One location where lawmakers were staying received a bomb threat earlier this week.
    


            Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters that Republicans threatening law enforcement action were making “an attempt again to thwart democracy.”
    


            “So as far as I'm concerned, we're doing the right thing, and I'm proud of it, and I'm not going to back down,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said at a press conference. “We're going to do everything we can to protect these Texas House Democrats and to help them do what they're doing.”
    


            It's unclear to what extent agents are assisting Texas Republicans in the matter and under what authority they would be allowed to do so. The FBI has declined multiple requests for comments from CNN on the matter.
    


            A similar instance occurred in 2003, when more than 50 members of the Texas Legislature left the state to prevent a vote on a redistricting plan, and state officials reached out to federal agencies to find and bring back the lawmakers.
    


            But back then, President George W. Bush's Justice Department refused to assist, telling one congressman that they were “not aware of any information pertinent to the Texas State legislators that would warrant action by federal law enforcement authorities, including those of the FBI.”
    


            “Accordingly, we have not deployed and have no plans to deploy our law enforcement resources in connection with this matter,” the letter from then-Assistant Attorney General William Moschella stated.
    


            In his initial request for FBI assistance, Cornyn suggested that the Democratic lawmakers could be violating the law if they are accepting funds “to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties” and could “be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.” No such charges have been filed related to their absence.
    


            Cornyn's request to the department comes as he and his primary foe, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, are each trying to stake out an aggressive stand on the controversy and attempt to woo conservative voters in their state.
    


Ken Paxton's long-distance quest for a Trump endorsement



            Cornyn on Tuesday sent a letter to the FBI today urging the federal agency to assist state law enforcement “to locate or arrest potential lawbreakers who have fled the state.”
    


            “I request the FBI's assistance, as federal resources are necessary to locate the out-of-state Texas legislators who are potentially acting in violation of the law. The FBI has tools to aid state law enforcement when parties cross state lines, including to avoid testifying or fleeing a scene of a crime,” Cornyn wrote.
    


            Paxton acknowledged Tuesday night on Fox News that it would be difficult to arrest absent Democrats. His office as well as the office of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott have threatened to go to court to vacate the offices of people who are currently outside the state.
    


            “The challenge here is they go to liberal jurisdictions where we can't get help from law enforcement. So we have really very limited options,” he said.
    


            “One is to wait, which several governors have done, and just waited them out because eventually they have to come home. Or two, this … motion or filing that has been done by Abbott, we're going to file something very similar for more of the legislators to take them out of their office, remove them from office, since they are not showing up to do their job. This is a new thing, it's never been tried before, but we think it has a very good possibility of being successful.”
    


            Abbott, for his part, warned that “in Texas, there are consequences for your actions.”
    


            “Texas DPS and the FBI are tracking down the derelict Democrats. They will be taken directly to the Texas Capitol,” he said on X. “Those who received benefits for skipping a vote face removal from office and potential bribery charges.”

Intel share price drops after US president accuses Lip-Bu Tan of links to Chinese Communist party

Donald Trump has called on Intel's chief executive to resign, alleging Lip-Bu Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock of the US chipmaker falling.

“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”

Shares in Intel dropped more than 3% in early trading. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's post.

Trump's comments came a day after he threatened a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips, which could favor Intel as a US-based semiconductor firm.

Trump did exclude Taiwan Semiconductor and Apple, companies that have said they plan to increase their investments in US manufacturing.

Apple chief Tim Cook announced from the White House that the company would invest $100bn in US chip fabrication.

Trump's criticism of Intel, which has lagged chipmakers such as Nvidia in producing graphics-processing chips suitable for AI applications, comes after Arkansas senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to company chairman Frank Yeary expressing concern over Tan's investments and ties to semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the CCP and the People's Liberation Army, the party's military arm.

Cotton, a Republican, asked Intel's board if Tan had divested his interests and questioned if Tan's previous leadership of Cadence Design Systems, a company that last month said it had sold products to China's National University of Defense Technology, a violation of US export controls.

Cotton said Tan controlled dozens of Chinese companies, at least eight of which had ties to the People's Liberation Army.

In a statement, the company said: “Intel and Mr Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the US defense ecosystem. We appreciate Senator Cotton's focus on these shared priorities. We look forward to addressing these matters with the senator.”

Tan, 65, is regarded as an industry veteran in technology and venture capital. He was tapped to lead the once-dominant personal computing and laptop chipmaker in March as part of a turnaround effort. Intel's market valuation is about $89bn, compared with $4.4tn for rival Nvidia.

Tan, 65, has said he wants to sell off Intel assets that are not core to the company's revitalization, cut jobs and to delay or cancel projects to reduce operating expenses. Intel has received about $8bn from the Chips and Science Act for US investments, the Biden-era legislation framed as a national security imperative to reduce US dependence on foreign chip production.

A number of foreign-based chipmakers have recently announced they are boosting US chip production , including Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung.

Beneficiaries of the Chips Act besides Intel include TSMC, Micron Technology, Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. But the $1bn grants are dwarfed by more than $400bn in pledged private-sector investments.

The Trump administration wants Congress to scrap the Chips Act, arguing that tariffs are a more effective incentive for companies to build fabrication plants on US soil, pointing to TSMC's decision to expand its chipmaking capacity from three to six plants in Arizona.

            • Army Secretary Dan Driscoll honored the soldiers who sprang into action when an active-duty sergeant allegedly opened fire at Fort Stewart yesterday. One of the soldiers tackled the suspected gunman, another jumped on top of the suspect to subdue him and four others tended to the injured, Driscoll said.
    


            • Quornelius Samentrio Radford, 28, was taken into custody and is accused of shooting five of his fellow service members. Two of the five wounded soldiers remain hospitalized, and the other three have been released, officials said.
    


            • Radford's motive is not known. He had a disagreement with one of the shooting victims on Tuesday, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the case.
    


Our live coverage has ended. You can read more about the soldiers who subdued the suspected gunman and the investigation into the shooting here.



            The Fort Stewart soldier who grabbed and subdued the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting on base said Quornelius Radford was trying to reload his personal weapon during the struggle.
    


                    “We got to the point where the magazine ended up coming out, and by that time frame the next one was trying to get loaded in, got loaded, but (I) still had physical control over it,” Staff Sgt. Aaron Turner, told CNN's Ryan Young on Thrusday.
                





            Another solider, Master Sgt. Justin Thomas, helped restrain Radford, giving Turner the ability to take the gun away.
    


            “I was able to disarm him, drop the magazine and eject the round,” said Turner.
    


            Turner said he tried to talk Radford down before physically restraining him. “Clearly that wasn't working, and I ended up having to go hands-on to try and disengage,” he said.
    


            It was a shock to the unit to see a comrade arrested, Turner said.
    


            “Knowing the fact that it's a teammate, it never ends up getting to the point where you really process that,” said Turner.
    


            Army officials have credited Turner's actions with preventing more casualties. Turner is one of the six soldiers awarded a medal for his actions during the shooting.
    


            Staff Sgt. Melissa Taylor, a career counselor at Fort Stewart in Georgia, said she reenlisted the suspected shooter Quornelius Radford, but no red flags were raised at the time.
    


            Taylor, one of the six soldiers honored for responding to the mass shooting, told CNN's Pamela Brown that she did not know Radford personally but, “As the career counselor, the soldier had talked to me about reenlistment previously.”
    


                    “I do believe I actually did reenlist this soldier a little while back.”
                





            She noted that other than the contractual part of reenlistment and “the work part of it, I do not believe that the soldier ever spoke to me about anything personal. So I did not have any kind of background history on him.”
    


            She said there were no red flags when he was reenlisted. “You cannot reenlist a soldier if there was any kind of flag in place or anything like that. So, he met all the criteria at the time,” she said.
    


            The soldiers who helped stopped yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia, have been identified by Army officials.
    


            Staff Sgt. Aaron Turner of Farmington, New Mexico, was the first to subdue suspect Quornelious Radford, with Master Sgt. Justin Thomas from Kingwood, Texas, helping to keep him restrained, according to the Army.
    


            Turner, an automated logistical specialist, has been at Fort Stewart for less than a year, the Army said.
    


            He was unarmed when he took down Radford, according to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.
    


            “The fast action of these soldiers under stress and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” Driscoll said.
    


            Additional assistance came from Staff Sgt. Robert Pacheco and Sgt. Eve Rodarte, base officials told CNN. They are both combat medics who specialize in responding to medical emergencies.
    


            Watch Army Secretary Dan Driscoll award medals to soldiers who helped halt yesterday's shooting by subduing the suspect who wounded five people in a shooting at Fort Stewart:
    


            Staff Sgt. Melissa Taylor, one of the six soldiers awarded a medal for their actions during yesterday's shooting at Fort Stewart, said she was in her office when she heard a fellow soldier “yelling that a gunshot went off,” before she peered into the hallway and saw smoke.
    


                    “I saw the smoke at the end of the hallway and I noticed there was a soldier laying on the ground, so I immediately sprinted over to the soldier and started rendering aid. He had been shot. And so I was rendering aid to him, while the first sergeant started calling medics,” Taylor told reporters.
                





            Asked if she was scared during those moments, Taylor said, “not at that time.”
    


            Taylor credited adrenaline, her seven years of experience as a combat medic and working for a county's emergency medical services.
    


            “So, I have been in these type of situations before where I've had to render aid to someone with gunshot wounds. So I had a little bit of experience I believe helped get me through that situation,” Taylor said.
    


            One of the soldiers who sprang into action in the moments after a suspect opened fire at Fort Stewart on Wednesday explained in his own words what he heard and did during the attack.
    


            US Army 1st Sergeant Joshua Arnold, one of the six soldiers awarded medals for responding to the shooting, said when he first heard the gunshots, it took a moment for him to realize what was happening – but then his training kicked in.
    


            “It seemed like a flash went past my conference room,” Arnold told CNN.
    


                    “I started yelling through the hallways, ‘That was a gunshot.'”
                





            As the suspect ran away, Arnold said he saw smoke and a shell case on the ground. Then he saw a soldier who had been shot.
    


            He rushed to help the soldier, who told him someone else had been injured, Arnold said.  He said he was able to find later and help them, too.
    


            Arnold said he and other combat medics provided aid until EMS arrived and continued helping the injured.
    


            The gunshots were being fired by a fellow service member, but Arnold said he didn't think about that in the moment.
    


            “You don't really know how to process that in that moment,” Arnold said, adding that he instead focused on taking care of the people around him.
    


            In the aftermath of the attack, Arnold said he's focused on helping his fellow soldiers.
    


            “Of course, friends were shot. Bad things happen, and I'm going to continue to take care of my soldiers and continue to move forward,” he said.
    


            The Army soldiers who responded to the scene of yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart had to treat the situation as though they were training for war, the battalion commander said in a news conference.
    


                    “It's really a — it's a battle drill,” said Lt. Col. Mike Sanford of the 703rd Brigade Support Battalion, “and they went into action and did what they needed to do. So whether it's here or overseas or we're in combat, they did the right thing.”
                





            Sanford said he knew the suspect, Quornelius Radford. Asked if there were any warning signs ahead of the shooting, Sanford responded, “Not at this time.”
    


            Quornelius Radford, the 28-year-old Army sergeant accused of carrying out the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia, will likely be transferred to a military detention center, said Ryan O'Connor,Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Special Agent in Charge.
    


            O'Connor said Radford is currently in custody and that CID is working through the Uniform Code of Military Justice processes.
    


            He said he did not know when Radford will be transferred or the location of the military detention center.
    


            Two of the five soldiers who were shot at Fort Stewart yesterday remain hospitalized today, according to the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division.
    


            “One solider remains as an in-patient at Winn Army (Community Hospital) right here on Fort Stewart. She's doing very well, in high spirits,” said Brig. Gen. John Lubas. “Of course, she's got a little bit of a road to recovery. We're hopeful she may be released as early as this weekend but that will just depend on how things heal up over the next couple of days.”
    


            Another solider who was more seriously injured is recovering at Savannah Memorial Community Hospital, about 45 miles from the base, the general said.
    


                    “She's got a little bit longer road to recovery,” said Lubas. “The doctors are very positive, but I think it's going to take her a big longer to recover. They're very hopeful she's going to make a complete recovery.”
                





            The other three shooting victims were released yesterday, according to Lubas. The Army has not identified the victims nor the nature of their injuries.
    


            An unarmed soldier tackled the shooter, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said during a news conference at Fort Stewart in Georgia.
    


                    “So just think about this, they were unarmed and ran at and tackled an armed person who they knew was actively shooting their buddies, their colleagues, their fellow soldiers,” Driscoll said.
                





            He added that another soldier “jumped on top of the person to subdue them” until law enforcement officials arrived.  Four other soldiers attended to the injured, Driscoll said.
    


            US Army officials who met with the families of soldiers wounded in yesterday's shooting described those meetings as “heartbreaking” in this morning's news conference.
    


            “It was heartbreaking sitting in there, and seeing the soldier, their daughter, sitting behind them, struggling,” said Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in response to a question from CNN's Ryan Young.
    


            “Our hearts broke with them. We tried to hug them,” Driscoll said, adding he tried to convey support from the president, vice president and secretary of defense. “We stand behind them.”
    


            Army officials will not speculate on the motives of the attacker who shot and injured five people at Fort Stewart yesterday.
    


            “We will not speculate on the assailant's motives or the circumstances that led to yesterday's events,” Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Angel Tomko said today ahead of a news conference, citing the ongoing investigation into the attack.
    


            Counselors will be available for soldiers dealing with trauma after the shooting at Fort Stewart that left five people injured, US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll said.
    


            Driscoll addressed the soldiers after presenting those who helped stop the suspected shooter with medals.
    


                    “We want you to take care of yourself,” Driscoll said. “It may be a little bit until this moment really fully hits you, and that's OK, but just know that you can talk to anyone around you. We are here for you. We love you.”
                





            The Army and community members are standing by the soldiers, Brig. Gen. John Lubas said.
    


            “People are going to process this and work through this at different rates, and we know we've got to keep a very close eye on them and wrap our arms around them,” he said.
    


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll awarded medals to soldiers who he said helped halt yesterday's shooting at Fort Stewart by subduing the suspect and tending to the injured.
    


                    “We're going to take a moment and thank these six soldiers,” Driscoll said. “Under duress and fire, they ran into battle to the sound of the gunfire, took down the assailant, and then took care of their comrades, and that made all the difference.”
                





            Driscoll then presented the Meritorious Service Medal to six soldiers, four of whom appeared to be men and two of whom appeared to be women.
    


            The medal is awarded to servicemembers who distinguish themselves through “outstanding non-combat meritorious achievement or service,” according to the US Army.
    


            Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll arrived at Fort Stewart a short while ago and addressed soldiers gathered outside before he planned to recognize those who helped halt yesterday's shooting by tackling the suspect.
    


            “You are in all of our thoughts and prayers,” Driscoll told them, saying he had spoken with President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
    


            The soldiers, Driscoll said, endured a “terrible day” yesterday that “could have gone much worse if not for you and your colleagues.”
    


                    “The heroism shown under fire is something that we should all aspire to know,” Driscoll said.
                





            Authorities have identified the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting at Fort Stewart as 28-year-old Quornelius Samentrio Radford, an active-duty sergeant who the US Army said had enlisted in 2018 as an automated logistical specialist.
    


            Assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Radford's role involved handling supplies and warehouse operations, the Army said. He had not deployed to a combat zone and had no known behavioral incidents on his military record.
    


            Here's what else we know:
    


A recent arrest: Brig. Gen. John Lubas on Wednesday acknowledged Radford had recently been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Radford's chain of command was unaware of the arrest, which happened in May, before yesterday's shooting, Lubas said. Radford was out on bond and due for arraignment on August 20.
    


A personal weapon: Radford used a personal handgun in the attack, Lubas said. According to a law enforcement official briefed on the case, Radford used a 9mm Glock that he bought in Florida in May. The gun was recovered at the scene along with shell casings, the official said.
    


            Army Secretary Dan Driscoll today will honor the soldiers who sprang into action to stop the active-duty sergeant accused of opening fire at Fort Stewart yesterday and wounding five of his coworkers.
    


            Driscoll will recognize the soldiers' “acts of heroism,” according to a news release.
    


            Brig. Gen. John Lubas previously said the attack was stopped when nearby soldiers “immediately and without hesitation tackled the soldier (and) subdued him.” The wounded coworkers were in stable condition as of Wednesday afternoon.
    


Some background: Driscoll, of North Carolina, served in the Army before attending Yale Law School, working in banking and unsuccessfully running for Congress as a Republican. He was nominated by President Donald Trump to his current position and was sworn in to the role in February.

As 95% of its residents now use the Digital Post service, Denmark has seen a 90% decline in letter volumes since 2000, from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year.
  On top of that, the Postal Act of 2024 removes the government's obligation to provide universal mail service and puts an end to postal exemptions from value-added tax, raising the cost of a single letter to 29 Danish krone (US$4.20). As a result, PostNord is switching

UnitedHealth brought in $34 billion in profits in 2024, far more than any other health care company in the US.

A pair of Democratic senators on Thursday launched an investigation into the most powerful corporation in the U.S. healthcare system, sounding alarm over allegations that UnitedHealth Group is incentivizing nursing homes to slash care expenses for patients insured by the company.

Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote in a new letter to the company's CEO that UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has “been at the center of numerous reports suggesting that it is maximizing profits at the expense of patients' health and well-being,” including accusations that the company “systematically denied needed care to children and adults with chronic illnesses” and used an artificial intelligence algorithm to deny Medicare Advantage enrollees necessary care.

Most recently, the senators noted, reporting by The Guardian alleged that UnitedHealth is using a bonus scheme to push nursing homes that contract with Optum to reduce hospital transfers as part of an aggressive cost-cutting effort. Optum is a UHG subsidiary that employs or affiliates with roughly 10% of all physicians in the U.S.

Wyden and Warren demanded that UnitedHealth provide answers to numerous questions related to its practices at nursing homes, including whether it institutes “hospital transfer quotas” at the facilities it works with.

“UHG denies the allegations in The Guardian's reporting and maintains that its practices reflect best practices in the care of nursing home residents,” the senators wrote. “However, we are concerned that the methods UHG appears to rely on to deliver the high-quality care it purports to provide may in fact incentivize practices that threaten resident safety.”

The Guardian's reporting underscores the extent to which UHG has injected itself into virtually every aspect of the American healthcare system. The healthcare conglomerate has roughly 2,700 subsidiaries, according to an analysis by the Center for Health and Democracy.

Using confidential corporate and patient records, whistleblower accounts, and interviews with UHG staffers and nursing home employees, The Guardian examined a company program under which Optum medical teams provide care on-site at nursing homes or in partnership with facility staff.

The newspaper identified “several cases” in which “nursing home residents who needed immediate hospital care under the program failed to receive it, after interventions from UnitedHealth staffers.”

“At least one lived with permanent brain damage following his delayed transfer, according to a confidential nursing home incident log, recordings, and photo evidence,” the newspaper reported. “To reduce residents' hospital visits, UnitedHealth has offered nursing homes an array of financial sweeteners that sounded more like they came from stockbrokers than medical professionals.”

The company also allegedly gave its medical teams “budgets” limiting the number of hospital admissions they could allow for nursing home patients.

One whistleblower, a nurse practitioner formerly employed by a UnitedHealth insurance subsidiary, said in a statement that “scores of elderly patients may never have received the care that they needed, all because UnitedHealthcare skimped on care to cut costs.”

“UnitedHealthcare is compelling medical professionals to comply with its financially-driven playbook at the expense of patient safety in a way that pressures providers to violate their ethical obligations,” the whistleblower added. “I'd like to see them held accountable for putting profits over patients.”

UnitedHealth raked in over $34 billion in profits last year — far more than any other U.S. healthcare company.

Wendell Potter, a former Cigna executive who now serves as president of the Center for Health and Democracy, wrote in a recent blog post that mounting scrutiny of UHG's practices shows the company is “facing a reckoning it can't ignore.”

“It's coming from every direction: the U.S. Department of Justice (under President Donald J. Trump), congressional Republicans and Democrats, state lawmakers and regulators, the media, physicians, hospital administrators, tens of thousands of Americans on the internet sharing their own personal UnitedHealth horror stories, and, most importantly for the C-Suite, enraged investors who've lost hundreds of billions of dollars in recent months,” Potter wrote.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we're talking about public assemblies and how we can build direct democracy at the community level. You'll hear from Denzel Caldwell, an organizer with the Black Nashville Assembly — a quarterly gathering where Black residents of Nashville come together to discuss the issues impacting their lives, develop solutions, and take action.

As authoritarianism intensifies in the U.S., we often hear calls to “save democracy.” But one of the problems with that framing is that many people don't feel they have a meaningful relationship with democracy. But the participatory nature of a public assembly can allow people to create democratic experiences, hear each other out, and begin to solve problems together. I think this is going to be an essential organizing tactic in the coming months and years, and I am excited for you all to hear from Denzel about it. Denzel recently shared some of these ideas here in Chicago at a workshop I organized on this subject. That workshop went so well that I decided we should cover some of the same ground here on the show so that those of you who weren't able to attend could engage with these ideas as well.

KH: Denzel Caldwell, welcome to “Movement Memos.” 

Denzel Caldwell: Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

KH: How are you doing today?

DC: So far so good. It's climate change-degrees outside, so it's a little hot, but I'll take it for now.

KH: I am right there with you. It's burning hot outside, and the air here in Chicago is awful today, but the sun is shining through my window, and everything looks lovely, so there's that at least. 

DC: Yeah, exactly.

KH: I am so happy you could join me today, and I'm really glad we've had the chance to collaborate a bit recently. For folks who may not be familiar with your work, can you share a little about who you are and what you do?

DC: Yeah, so peace to everyone listening. My name is Denzel Caldwell. I am a kid born, raised, and organizing in Nashville, Tennessee. I do organize under a number of different formations, but the one I definitely want to talk about today is the Black Nashville Assembly. I've been organizing overall for about a little under 10 years or a little bit over 10 years. And with the BNA I've been organizing for about five. And so, yeah, I've been doing that for quite some time, learning along the way, got some lessons and victories. But yeah, outside of that, I love to read. I love to work out and talk to cool people like Kelly.

KH: Well, I love hanging with you, too — and I've been so interested in the work you've been doing in Nashville. But before we get into the evolution of the Black Nashville Assembly, can you start by explaining: What is a People's Movement Assembly?

DC: Yeah, so I think the easiest, most straightforward answer to this question is it's a gathering of community members. And when I say community members, I mean people who share particular geographic location, at least traditionally. And they answer three questions: What are the shared problems that they face? What are the solutions that they need for those problems? And how can they work together to make those solutions concrete? I would say that's the most distilled, easiest answer to shape or to explain what it does or what it is.

Now, I would say historically, people's movement assemblies as we know them today, can be traced back to what's called the World's Social Forum. And this was a coalition of organizations, movements and those that are adjacent who were coming together to combat neoliberalism, capitalism, imperialism. And within that body, the People's Movement Assembly was a mode of governance that they used to make decisions. And so, from there, given the fact that this was an international body, when folks went home, folks utilized this mode of governance and it made its way to the USA in the 2000s, I'll say, because I'm forgetting the date. And since then we've seen a number of different people's movement assemblies emerge in the United States as the idea or the concept spread. And so, you'll have some that are regional, some that are very local, and something that I think will be very relevant to this current political moment.

KH: I couldn't agree more about the relevance of this approach in the current moment. And while the World Social Forum is a clear predecessor to some of the assemblies we're seeing today, this kind of gathering and this approach to organizing has ancient roots, across the Americas and Africa. The Muscogee councils, which have existed for hundreds of generations, are one just one example. Within my lifetime, we've seen a resurgence of some of these traditions during moments of transition, upheaval and social reclamation. The Zapatista movement, for example, created village assemblies to facilitate decision-making at the community level. The Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil, known as MST, has used assemblies for collective decision making in their encampments. In 2011, the Indignados movement in Spain held horizontal, plaza-based assemblies to deliberate and make decisions outside of formal institutions. And that same year, I got my first experience of direct democracy in the Occupy movement. 

Occupy's General Assemblies were messy, and we didn't always get where we needed to go, but gathering together with dozens and sometimes hundreds of people to listen, share ideas, and make decisions that would shape our movement and affect our lives was a really important experience for me as an activist. I had never had that kind of opportunity to be heard, or to decide what would happen next, at that scale, in concert with other people. Eventually, we had neighborhood-based assemblies here in Chicago, and some of the core people who attended those neighborhood Occupy assemblies in my area became part of an organizing crew that I worked with for years after the Occupy movement had faded. A lot of really important work was born out of that moment, and out of those spaces that incubated so many ideas and so much potential.

During Occupy, we were moved by the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, the austerity of neoliberalism, and the momentum of global justice movements. What moved you and your co-organizers to create the Black Nashville Assembly?

DC: There were a couple of factors. Prior to 2020, because 2020 is really a watershed moment for us. Prior to 2020, there was some growing interest across the local (and by local, I'm referring to Nashville) ecosystem in terms of doing invest/divest campaigns or abolitionist campaigns that encouraged city councils to spend more money on social services and things that people actually need and less on cops, courts and cages.

And so, what emerged from that was just a coalition where folks who were on the left were committed to that work. So that was around the budget cycle. But as we initiated this work in 2019 going into 2020, one of the themes that kept coming up from our opponents on the city council was that we weren't organizing Black people in Nashville. They were trying to make this claim that we didn't represent the interest of working-class Black folks in the city.

And so, a number of different organizers, including myself, Erica Perry, Jamel Campbell-Gooch, Mike Floss, we who are from Nashville, decided to go out and organize our folks. And so, we initially were bringing Black folks, and in this case for us, this was our family and friends and our networks to the larger coalition, the assembly work to challenge the carceral appropriations to the city budget. But what we realized is that along the way, a lot of our folks were interested in creating a container where Black folks, working-class Black folks were able to build their own analysis, assess their own problems, and create strategies and methods for making those solutions concrete. And so, from there, that's when the Black Nashville Assembly emerged, which is a Black autonomous space. So those who participate are of African descent or identify as Black, but we do have spaces where we invite our comrades to build with us.

KH: I love that you and your co-strugglers responded to this claim that you didn't represent your community by mobilizing your community in such a highly visible and participatory way. I think there's a lot to be learned from that example. So, how did this project evolve over time?

DC: So initially as it started, it was a call, as I mentioned earlier, from a larger coalition to particularly organize Black people to build a people's budget for the city, an abolitionist one. And so, a lot of that initially at the beginning was focused solely on that. And that still is a pretty key core to our work. But over time, as we learn more and more about the importance of organizing working-class Black folks in the city, and more importantly falling within the lines of the traditions that we descend from, that being SNCC and others, within the Black Radical Tradition, we learned that our assembly had to become more multifaceted and it had to reflect our people.

So a lot of it evolved where we had artists that we were organizing perform during the assemblies. We've developed a youth assembly that has come out of our work where our youth are organizing our political agendas and bringing it to the larger assembly, and going through the voting process to land on an agreed upon political agenda.

And a lot of other programs from that assembly work have emerged. We've had book clubs, we have a men's circle. We're just constantly coming up with different ways and things to evolve our work and to reflect the needs of our folks. Black Nashville Assembly is also a project of Southern Movement Committee, which is a container that we created not only for our youth assembly work, but also to engage in statewide assembly work or aspirationally engage in statewide assembly work for Black communities across the state of Tennessee. And so, those are just some of the ways that our work has evolved over time and we're constantly evolving in terms of our cultural organizing, our assembly work, and our youth assembly work as well.

KH: I really appreciate what your story is illustrating here around the creation of book clubs, the BNA's men's circle and the youth council. Larger gatherings and political projects often serve as incubators in ways that people don't always consider or realize. Years ago, I was involved with a project called “We Charge Genocide” here in Chicago, which challenged police violence. That effort sent a group of young people to present a shadow report to the UN about police violence and torture in Chicago. It also played an important role in winning reparations for police torture survivors. At We Charge Genocide meetings, we would engage as a large group, and then break into working groups that were focused on different projects and pursuits. My collective, Lifted Voices, which provided political education workshops for thousands of people during the decade or so before it sunsetted, wouldn't have existed without We Charge Genocide's radical education working group. Those working groups set people on a number of paths. In a moment like this one, when we don't have all of the projects, participation, and experiments that we need, we need to create more fertile ground for that work to begin.

But circling back to the growth process of the Black Nashville Assembly, did you have a plan or formula to start with or did the people you organized inform the process?

DC: So it was definitely more so of the latter than the former. When we started as an assembly formation, a number of us who had founded this assembly had previous organizing experience, and we had already a developing political ideological orientation. And so, that colored how we approached the assembly work. However, one of the most brilliant things that has come from our assembly work in these past five plus years has been that a lot of the most innovative, radical, grounded ideas have come from folks who have participated in the assembly process. I think sometimes there's this assumption that for those of us, especially on the left, but that we have to take this evangelical approach to organizing. But one of the most powerful things that we've recognized doing our assembly work here is that a lot of our folks know exactly what we need and do have a grounded analysis in the systems that oppress them and really are looking for a container to actualize some of the solutions that would need to take root and to be birthed into reality to address those problems.

And so, of course we have political struggle and our politics are evolving, our practice is evolving, but a lot of our direction, if not most of it, comes directly from those who participate in the assembly. And one of the things I definitely want to lift up here is that the first time that we released a political agenda, that was the result of months and months of deliberation, power mapping with our folks, turning some solutions into policy demands or into policy language and then doing things like a candidate forum during a judicial election as well as the city council and mayor elections, so that instead of politicians coming to our space to do a stump speech, they are being interrogated based on the concretized political agenda of the assembly. And so, that's heavily shaped how the electoral outcomes have happened, not only in the judicial elections, but also in the mayoral and city council elections.

KH: I love the idea of politicians having to contend with questions that are informed by an agenda a community collectively built. So, in reflecting on what you all have built, can I ask, what surprised you about this process?

DC: Yeah, I think for me it's a couple of things. One, just as I mentioned before, the first thing is (I would hear this often) to trust the people and to trust their ability to lead, to organize, and to dream of a fundamentally better world, but seeing that is different and that was huge for me. It didn't take this, again, this evangelical approach where we're just browbeating people over the head with our ideological reading and position necessarily. A lot of folks came to very abolitionist, anticapitalist conclusions on their own. 

I'll never forget one time or often, we do this often anytime we table, we'll create a poster and we'll ask folks, “What makes you feel safe?” And we've done that several times and every time that we do it, not once do people write down “police,” not once do people write down “cages” and not once do people write down this carceral system, any piece of this carceral system that makes them feel safe. They talk about family, their faith, their community, their loved ones, the things they love to do, the things that make the city great, things like that from music to culture. But not once do people bring up police.

And so, I think sometimes we can really underestimate the radical potential of our people. And so, that's been one thing that was huge. I think the other thing that stands out to me was the outcome or the reaction to our candidate forums. In our candidate forums, we had an agenda and we sent the agenda to the candidates that were running for various offices and we gave them an opportunity to fill out their responses to each position, policy position, and we interrogated them once we got there. And you can actually find at least the mayoral one on YouTube and I'll share that link for folks to see later.

But I think the thing that surprised the most was that a lot of organizations in the city and people in the city were really just amazed by the fact that we asked the questions as an assembly rather than the politicians answering a question that no one asks in terms of what they're going to do for their constituents. And it threw me off and it threw others off because in my mind I'm thinking there's a lot of civic organizations throughout the city, throughout the state that do civic engagement, electoral work. And you would think, oh yeah, folks have asked the critical questions. But when folks felt like this was groundbreaking, we were like, wait, all we did was just concretize the political agenda that folks our base wanted and then interrogated politicians based on that. How is that groundbreaking? But for me, that was surprising because that just showed how anti-democratic just like our norm is in terms of how we engage in governance under this current structure. But it was just a reminder also of how powerful the People's Movement Assembly process is. 

KH: One thing I really appreciate about this process is that it's really the opposite of how a lot of people are experiencing politics right now, alone together in the glow of their screens. We have a serious problem in the U.S., in that our reliance on digital mobilization has left us with a generation of organizers who never learned how to base build or how to canvas. In this alienating culture, that often means that people simply don't know how to talk to strangers or how to work with people who aren't of their own choosing. And I'm not blaming people or getting down on people, that alienation is inflicted by design. And unless your political work evolved within an organization that wanted you to canvas or do the labor of base-building, you probably never got that training. We got a lot done by other means, but now, we're about a decade and a half into the process of being deskilled in this way within our social movements. When you compound that with the alienating dynamics that have evolved on social media, and the isolation of late capitalism, we're in real fucking trouble. Even when people want to make a difference, they often don't know how to do more than seek or reward affinity and agreement. They don't know how to navigate difference or talk about justice with people who don't understand them or their goals. We need to get practiced at talking to people we would never normally engage with about their fears, hopes, and desires —and we need to be able to build around the shared interests that emerge in those conversations.

So, that said, I'm really curious, how did you and your co-organizers adapt some of your movement, language, and ideas to fit the needs of the community?

DC: Yeah, so that's a great question. This was an experiment. This is, very much so, an experiment. And what we have found to be successful is attaching the assembly process and the demands and the desires of folks to larger political language. And there's a meta-note that I have to make here. One of the most important organizing lessons that we have learned in the past five years is our people are very receptive to listening and engaging in learning and political struggle when you consistently show up, I think too often, and I don't think this is exclusive to liberals, but I think too often even those of us on the left will engage in momentary organizing with folks based on a campaign or a particular flashpoint, but we're not continuing to cultivate those relationships with our base, which leads to this hamster wheel where we don't get any farther.

And so, part of our work has really centered on relationship building. So that means in our early days we used to have this thing called “the recharge” where instead of there being an assembly, it was like a party essentially. We got a DJ, people were playing music, and folks were just recharging because we probably went through a particular election season or some really rough moment or we just needed a break. And so, we would do things like the recharge, we have cookouts with our families and folks who are part of the assemblies and bringing folks together.

And so, it's through that constant interaction that it gives us the trust and basis to do certain, what we would consider mass meetings, because our mass meetings are different than our people's movement assemblies, where our mass meetings are where we engage in civic and political education and the people's movement assemblies are the moments where we actually develop our political agenda and strategy.

And so, it's through those constant interactions, constant events where we're bringing together community members that we get the trust to engage in civic and political education. So we talk through some of the things that we're developing in the People's Movement Assembly and say, Hey, the folks who shape that problem we're dealing with are in the courts. Let's break down how the courts work. Or the reason that we keep running into this issue around youth violence is because this carceral system adds to or shapes the violence that our youth are victimized by.

And so, we really just take the opportunity through relationship building and through moments where people are assessing their problems to inject this political, more politicized conversation and some of the movement language, where we reshape things like public safety, reshape things like the notion of community safety and things like that. And that's what helps people to sharpen their analysis in our experience.

KH: Can you give me an example of something that you might hear in a leftist space language-wise and how it might be talked about differently in the community space?

DC: I think I'll just use abolition. This is the easiest one to think of where in most leftist spaces, we talk about abolition as this challenge to the legitimacy of the state where we challenge the need or notion of law enforcement or police and the larger carceral system that shapes this arm of the state. And we talk about how we need to build a world where those things don't exist, and we have these robust accountability processes that exist that allow us to get to the root of a problem. So that's in our leftist spaces. But then when we're talking about talking to our folks in the assembly, we might be in conversation and our folks are like, “Yeah, we don't rock it to police. We're not interested in that.”

We are interested in something else. We feel we are forced to talk to police. We're forced to go through this court system, but I really just want to be in a place where I can talk to my folks and have some type of community trust and buy-ins, where we can address the problems without having to involve the law. Or people will bring up a lot of these really robust ideas, especially the youth, around how we resolve conflict in the public schools. Our youth are bringing up restorative justice processes on their own. They're brilliant enough to say, “Hey, we have to find ways to restore relationships within the school because we know that the school resource officers and the metal detectors and things are a threat to our safety.” And so, our people are talking about the things that they already do to avoid the carceral system.

And what they're doing is talking about ways to institutionalize those things, so that the necessity for police becomes less and less, or the legitimacy of the police becomes radically less. And so, this is how the abolition conversations come up. And sometimes, honestly, we may not even use the word “abolition,” but the spirit of abolition is within the conversation in the analysis-building and the concretization of our political agenda. So it's in there, it's materially in there. But sometimes we may use the language and they're familiar with it, but we may not. And that's okay, because we care about the material outcome of our agenda and our struggles for wins.

KH: That really resonates with me, and I have had a similar experience talking with people who are trying to combat the damage done by the opioid overdose crisis. In Native communities, some of the people I talk to are on the same page as me about not fucking with police, but I've also heard people talk about holding out hope that there was some way the cops could arrest our way out of this. They thought that if the cops could just be pushed to “do their jobs,” or do their jobs in a particular way, fewer of our people would die. And then, over time, those people observed the actual trends on the ground. They saw that people who were using substances were more likely to overdose after getting arrested. Because while they're locked up for a few days, their tolerance to the drug drops, and when they get out and use — which will happen, because people don't heal in jail, they just become more traumatized — they are more vulnerable to overdose. So, some people who previously looked at cops as a potential solution now recognize that our people actually need care, and to be insulated from contact with the police, whenever possible. And these are things I've heard from people across different communities, and the Native people I've talked to about this stuff, most of them wouldn't call themselves abolitionists, and they are not out here calling for the abolition of prisons, but the work of replacing carceral responses with care is abolitionist. The work of reducing contact between our community members and police is abolitionist. So, often, I've found, it's really about addressing people's needs in very concrete terms. What actually helps? What actually hurts? And if we're thorough and honest in our analysis on those points, there's going to be alignment with some of our radical politics — because those politics exist for a reason. 

Of course, the work of hearing each other, and meeting people where they are, can get messy. Activists and justice-minded people have really built their own cultures and subcultures around the pursuit of justice, and we can sometimes be intolerant of people using the wrong terminology, or knowingly or unknowingly saying things that are problematic or disrespectful. So, how do you handle it, in the public assembly setting, when someone says something fucked up, or there's a harmful impact that occurs?

DC: Yeah, I appreciate this question, because this is something we definitely have experienced before. I want to say that one of the first things that we do with that expectation that something like that would happen is we have a set of community agreements in our assembly that folks have to consent to before we begin.

And so, some of those things include not making assumptions about folks, being curious, making space and taking space. Some of these things, we're familiar with. A lot of us on the left and in movement spaces are familiar with. And of course we are adjusting it to reflect our folks who are organizing with. And so, that's sort of like the basis or the agreement or the account upon which we can engage in accountability. Because oftentimes when people talk about accountability, people forget that a prerequisite of accountability is relationship and an agreed upon set of values or agreements to which we hold people to account. And so, in our assembly, the community agreements are the things that people consent to first.

So when someone says something fucked up or when someone says something that is out of alignment, we take time to remind people, “Hey, we agreed to these community agreements. Let's reground.” We've done different things, we've had conversations, we brought people to the side and talked with folks during and then after our assemblies. But one of the things we also do as well is we remind people of the agreements. We always center the agreements, and we push back. We have no problem pushing back in our space. We do it not from a place always of combativeness, from a place of love, and love being the willingness to see the fullness of our people and the willingness to struggle with them towards a collective liberatory victory.

So we talk about our edges, our growth edges as something as a part of our community agreement. We recognize it. We recognize that people come in with fucked up ideas, that people come in with a colonial mentality or colonial outlook. We are all under colonialism. And so, we acknowledge that up front. We don't run away from that, and that's embedded in our agreement so that when we do hear things that are colonial, are carceral, are anti-Black, all these things, we are able to address it from a more solid basis than just calling somebody out because they said something fucked up, but not really being in relationship with them, which is something we see too often online and unfortunately even in some spaces, real world spaces.

So I would say that our community agreements have been the basis for how we respond and struggle principally with our assembly members, and then also just relying on our relationships. So it can take a lot of organic forms. We can hit folks up and just say, “Hey, I want to follow up with you and just talk with you about what you said at the assembly.” Or sometimes that might even shape our mass meeting content. And there's a number of examples there. And oftentimes it's something that within the assembly work and the political agenda development, that shapes the conversations and policy demands and agendas that we develop in the assembly. So I say all that to say that that political struggle is embedded within our assembly work and we don't run from it. It's embedded in our community agreements and our folks are still here.

KH: Can you say a bit about how you developed the community agreements?

DC: Yeah. So a couple of things that I think it's important to note. I think with the community agreements, that is probably of the places that initially was shaped by our political orientation, our political pillars, and to specify, our four political pillars as an organization are pan-Africanism, Black queer feminism, economic democracy, and police and prison abolition. And so, as I mentioned earlier, a number of those of us who were at the beginning and formed the assembly, we came in with a certain set of politics or political dispositions already. And so, a lot of the things we saw in community agreements, in other spaces, other movement spaces of the base-building organizations we brought with us.

But the thing about it is that as we started to engage our people, as we started to learn our folks, struggle with our folks and have the assembly shape be shaped in our folks' collective image, the way in which those community agreements evolved began to more directly reflect the people that were in the space. So it's not that so much they shifted in terms of being curious about people not making assumptions, acknowledging growth edges. It's not so much that they shifted in terms of the spirit, but the language might have shifted to reflect our people. The way in which we ground the assemblies or the mass meetings more accurately reflect our folks who are part of the assembly. And so, yeah, I say that to say that there was a mixture of our initial or our base political orientation that shaped it, but it has evolved based on the engagement of folks in the assembly work.

KH: I really hope people will internalize this piece around developing an approach that reflects the culture of the community and the space. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and the language and norms of our movement cultures and subcultures are not going to copy-paste well into a neighborhood practice. We need to be of the community, and for the community, rather than trying to simply prescribe something for the community. And we need to shape our goals in the same way.

Speaking of goals, what are some of the wins you've experienced since beginning this project?

DC: We've had a couple of strong wins, actually. I would say just as we began the assembly five years ago, we played a critical role in the normalization of abolitionist language on the city level, particularly when it came to the budget cycle. Because before 2020, if you brought up this idea that money needed to be reallocated away from Metro Nashville Police to the social services, there would be a lot of pearl clutching.

But we played a huge role in normalizing that language when post-2020, post-George Floyd uprising, in a way that has shifted the Overton window left locally, as far as the budget cycle is concerned. I would say more concretely our biggest, we've had back-to-back wins in the past two years, this year and as well as last year. Last year, just to give you context, our youth, when they developed their demands for the budget cycle in 2024, they came up with this plan called the Varsity Spending Plan.

And this was a $10 million plan where you had money that would go to the nation's first Office of Youth Safety, which was an office that was dedicated to creating proactive solutions, youth-led solutions to youth gun violence that is fundamentally working separate from the carceral system. And this is language that was included in the executive order, the mayoral executive order when this office was erected. The other part of the varsity and spending plan includes some restorative justice programs or pilots in a number of different schools, public schools that are predominantly Black in the city, as well as providing more support for community center funding as well as ensuring there's funds for a full-time restorative justice staff.

And so, with this Varsity Spending Plan, the assembly got behind it. There was a consensus with the adults and the youth that this was the assembly or the political agenda that we would put forth. And so, back in 2024, we were able to secure a million dollars towards this plan. And again, this is not something that's going to our organization. This is something that's a part of the larger city infrastructure, so the Metro Nashville infrastructure. And so, that a million dollars had $750,000 go towards the Office of Youth Safety, which again, according to our analysis, is the first of its kind in the nation, not just in Nashville. And we also got funding to go towards restorative justice pilots in some of our targeted schools.

This year, we were able to increase that budget allocation to $1.7 million. And so, since then, our youth have played a direct role in the selecting of the director for the Office of Youth Safety, as well as the organizing and advocacy and public commentary that led to the additional allocation for the restorative justice programs as well as the Office of Youth Safety. And so, we've been on a two-year winning streak. We hope to continue building and moving towards that $10 million allocation to fully fund the Varsity Spending Plan. But we're proud of our youth, we're proud of the assembly, and we look forward to continue winning.

KH: That is all so heartening. And we need heartening stories right now. 

We both expressed earlier that we think that the creation of public assemblies is a particularly important organizing tactic right now. Can you talk about the importance of the public assembly as a tactic in this moment of intensifying authoritarianism?

DC: Yeah, I think that there's always, in this country, even when we take a decolonial lens, in public discourse, there's always been this question or conversation around democracy. Depending on who you talk to, some would say that democracy has been under threat for a while or maybe even is coming under threat under Trump. I think those of us who fall under the Black radical tradition recognize that this U.S. project was inherently anti-democratic from the perspective of the colonized.

And so, I think in that vein, I think that what this process, the People's Movement Assembly process provides is a unique opportunity for people to build a democracy that has yet to be born or has yet to exist. And I think that is particularly unique and something very opportune in this moment because a number of people across the political spectrum, honestly here in the United States, are looking for something different. People recognize the dilapidating social safety nets, the increased cost of living, the impending climate disaster and Armageddon we're facing, and the imperial boomerang that we see coming back home to roost with the increase in ICE raids, the further militarization of police.

And so, with that, one of the most potent tools that people can do, not only as a means of survival, but as a means of world making is to engage in a governance structure process like the People's Movement Assembly, because this process invites people to be active participants in shaping the collective outcome of our people's futures.

And that is a primary and oftentimes missing ingredient in building mass movements, because if people don't participate in the shaping of their futures, then we can't hope for more radical or revolutionary outcomes. And if we look across history at various revolutionary moments, radical moments, especially throughout the world, one critical component was organizing the masses towards being active participants in the shaping of their futures. Whether that's through literacy campaigns, whether that's through collective assemblies, whether that's through party formations, all of the above. And I think particularly in this moment in the United States history and this particular political moment, not just domestically, but internationally, that the U.S. and people who live within the U.S. can in some ways, once again, depending on the history that you reference, can participate in a larger struggle for a world where people and systems are governed directly and democratically by the masses, and controlled by the masses rather than by a wealthy predominantly European few.

KH: I couldn't agree more, and I think that we need to give people a different set of experiences, if we want people to want folks to develop a different perspective. Right now, a lot of people are experiencing politics as consumers of takes and information. We consume opinions, we approve or disapprove. Maybe we echo a perspective or add one to the mix. But we need to get people into a practice of actually hearing each other, and actually having a voice among other people who are trying to solve a problem or a set of problems together. Some of that needs to happen in person. Some of it can happen digitally, outside of algorithmically curated spaces. It can also happen with an eye toward accessibility and COVID safety. When we gathered to talk about public assemblies in Chicago with you recently, Denzel, it was too hot to gather outside, so we were indoors and we were masked. The important thing we need to realize is that we need to create space to build the kind of relationships and potential that we want to see right now. Repeating the same patterns isn't going to give us different outcomes.

If we want people to fight for democracy, let's give them a sense of what democracy can feel like. Let's build that together. And whether people are gathering around a specific issue, like housing struggles, austerity, a site fight, or defending their neighbors, let's give people a hands-on sense of what it means to come together and make decisions that shape what happens next. I know some people in this country already have a passionate or romanticized relationship with democracy, but that's not everyone, and I don't think it's most people. Most people just want better lives. They want less suffering and more justice. We have to make democracy a vehicle toward those ends. 

So, all of that said, is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of the audience today?

DC: Yeah, definitely, if folks are interested in following the developments of the Black Nashville Assembly or the Southern Movement Committee, definitely feel free to connect with us or support our work through OurSMC.org. Beyond that, I would highly encourage folks to find an organization.

Whether you're engaged in mutual aid, whether you're engaged in particular policy campaigns or whether you're engaged in assembly work, to find an organization, find an organization in particular that is, ideally, anti-imperialist, that is challenging capital and wants to build a fundamentally different world. Especially in this political moment, there's a wide political window, and we hope that you are able to find one that fits, and there are many out there. And if you don't see one that exists, feel free to build one that meets the need. But yeah, I would encourage folks to find an organization. I would encourage folks to do political education in connection to collective work, as opposed to just engaging in ideological study and ideation, attach it to some work.

And lastly, to maintain hope, maintain revolutionary optimism. I think it's very easy and it's a tool of the empire for folks to engage in Doomerism, especially those of us on the left. So I would highly encourage folks to adopt a revolutionary optimism that isn't delusional, it's not idealist. It is a optimism that says that we can win if we choose to actively engage in collective struggle against these systems that oppress us and the planet. So I would leave with just those parting words of: join an organization, maintain revolutionary optimism, and ensure that your political education that you're engaged in is tied to some type of organizational work.

KH: That's good advice. And in addition to joining an organization or starting up a project, I also want to encourage folks to keep picking up skills. Over the years, I have worn a lot of hats, because I've picked up a lot of skills. Sometimes, skills that weren't immediately relevant to what I was doing became crucial under unforeseen circumstances. In unpredictable times like these, having just-in-case skill sets is going to be important. 

And on the subject of skill-building, if you want to learn more about facilitating public assemblies, Denzel and I are planning a virtual followup workshop that will build on some of the ideas Denzel covered in his recent workshop in Chicago, and in today's episode. So, if you attended that workshop or listened to this episode, you will be welcome to join us. And you can look for updates about that in my newsletter. Right now, we are thinking that will happen in early October.

Denzel, I want to thank you again for joining me today. I am so grateful to be working in collaboration with you, and to have the chance to learn from you and everything that the Black Nashville Assembly is accomplishing. 

DC: Thank you so much. I'm excited to be participating and I'm looking forward to leading this virtual workshop and conversation and talking with more folks who are interested in engaging in this type of work.

KH: I'm looking forward to it too. Let's keep connecting and building.

DC: All right. Peace, everybody.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

As disabled people face brutal cuts to Medicaid, we must draw on Berne's insight to link with other fights for freedom.

I was in the middle of writing an email to my friend Patricia (Patty) Berne when I got a text message from our mutual friend. “Come to the hospital quickly,” they said. “Patty's dying.” My first thought was, ‘But that's impossible. We're right in the middle of a conversation.'

I knew that Patty had been sick, but it didn't seem possible to me that they might die. Patty's impact on me and the disabled world I live in was simply too huge. I couldn't imagine the planet without them. Born disabled, Patty was told as a child that they would not live past 16 years old. This prediction was pessimistic, and wrong. Patty grew up to live a full life, and changed disability history. They were a visionary artist and one of the primary architects of the Disability Justice movement, which connected the struggle for disabled liberation with other fights for freedom for the first time in the early 2000s.

Patty died at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, California, on May 29. Just a few weeks later, on July 3, Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which proposes cutting Medicaid spending by $1 trillion. These cuts will likely force states to slash home- and community-based services, like personal care attendants, that disabled people need in our fight to stay out of institutional settings. It feels like many of the advances that Patty and other disabled activists have struggled to achieve over the past 50 years might be unraveling, which makes my grief sharper and more overwhelming.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“I was truly devastated when I heard the news,” said Lateef McLeod, a disabled activist and scholar who has performed with Patty since 2007. Patty “was a phenomenal leader and true friend. I would describe Patty as the mother of disability justice and this second wave of the disability movement.”  

The first wave of disability rights organizing in the 1970s-1990s led to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as other similar important legislation around the world. However, it fell short of examining how racism and other forms of oppression play a role in the subjugation of disabled people, or how we contribute to other movements. In the early 2000s, Patty gathered with a group of other disabled people in Berkeley, including the late Stacey Milbern, Mia Mingus, and Leroy Moore, to tackle this issue. Those conversations led to the second wave of disability activism, and a new movement that centered a much broader array of voices and highlighted the unique skills of disabled people such as our resilience, adaptability and capacity to care for each other. 

“Patty brought together a movement that centers the struggles, brilliance, and beauty of disabled people,” said Patty's longtime collaborator and chosen sibling Mordecai Cohen Ettinger. “That movement understands disabled people expansively, not only as those who use technology for mobility assistance, but also neurodivergent and mad people, as well as those who have been hurt in climate chaos, survivors of state violence and incarceration.”

As a young person, Patty drew on their experiences as a Haitian-Japanese, queer, and nonbinary person to build power for Haiti and Palestine, and for sexual violence survivors. Later, Patty became the co-founder and longtime executive and artistic director of Sins Invalid, a disability justice-based political education performance project, where they directed 11 major performances, co-produced two documentaries, and globally trained thousands.

Patty knew that to be disabled is to live close to death. Just a few months before their passing Sins Invalid mounted a play called “Stages of Grief,” which dealt with mourning the impact of climate crisis on disabled communities, as well as celebrating our expertise for adapting to this era of cascading emergencies.

“Just as each component in earth's ecosystem plays a vital role in supporting everything around it,” Patty wrote in a 2019 essay, “so do each of us have an essential role to play in sustaining our communities, our environment, our planet. In this time, people need strength models. Strength isn't just about momentary power to jump building to building, it is also endurance to handle what is less than ideal. It's the gritty persistence that disabled people embody every day.”

On my way to the hospital to say goodbye to Patty, I picked a rose from my garden. I wanted Patty to have something sweet to sniff when the nurse removed their respirator, to combat the institutional odors. In the weeks since Patty's death, the bush which the rose came from has been blooming wildly. Each blossom is a slightly different hue of yellow, pink, white, or red. Some blooms are enormous and some are tiny.

One of Patty's most central teachings was how valuable each of us are, with all our complications. “A Disability Justice framework,” Patty famously wrote, “understands that all bodies are unique and essential, that all bodies have strengths and needs that must be met. We know that we are powerful not despite the complexities of our bodies, but because of them.”

It's easy to see this in an unusual rosebud or a delightfully crooked branch, but it is sometimes harder to appreciate my own idiosyncratic, chronically ill body, or my quirky learning disabilities. Patty helped me to love my body and mind just the way I am.

As disabled people face the brutal prospect of historic Medicaid cuts, we can draw strength from Patty's legacy. “[W]e know through our bones,” they once said, that there have always been disabled people “visioning a world where we flourish, that values and celebrates us in all our myriad beauty.”

There will be a Celebration of Life for Patty Berne on August 9, 2025. This gathering is a hybrid event at the East Bay Church of Religious Science in Oakland, California, and via livestream at 3:00-6:00 pm PT | 5:00-7:00 pm CT | 6:00-9:00 pm ET. It is lovingly hosted by Patty's family.

Broad language could allow cities to lock up unhoused people as aid is cut and housing costs soar, experts warn

Donald Trump's executive order that pushes local governments to remove unhoused people from the streets will exacerbate the issues already facing people who have unstable housing, mental health conditions and substance use disorders – and the vague wording could be used for wider action, experts say.

“It's one of the most harmful things to happen to folks who live outside in decades. It is not going to help anybody,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center.

“It sets the stage for rounding up folks who are homeless, folks with mental health issues, folks who are disabled – and instead of helping them, forcing them into detention camps and institutions. So it's terrifying.”

The order instructs states and municipalities to crack down on public substance use; camping, loitering, or squatting in urban spaces; mental health issues; and sex offender registration. It calls for “shifting” people without stable housing into “long-term institutional settings”.

“It is essentially creating a pathway to criminalize larger and larger numbers of people,” said Margaret Sullivan, a family nurse practitioner and director of programs for immigrant and unhoused communities at the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University.

The order is “vague and broad and potentially leaning toward creating more civil rights violations”, she said.

The conditions for detainment outlined in the order are poorly defined, which means it could be interpreted broadly to detain and involuntarily institutionalize people in public spaces. And it doesn't detail who may make determinations on institutionalization.

“It doesn't define ‘mental health crisis'. It also doesn't define who's qualified to make an assessment,” said Rabinowitz.

Individuals with mental illness are defined in the order as people who “pose risks to themselves or the public”, which could be broad enough to encompass many people, he said.

And while the order sometimes refers to cracking down on “illicit” substance use, at other times it speaks more generally to substance use disorder – a condition that can include legal substances such as alcohol and prescription medication.

Many states already have laws on involuntary commitment for mental illness, Sullivan said. Typically, the process begins with clinical healthcare providers or mental health professionals and goes through the judicial system.

“There's a judicial system to ensure that the rights of the individual are not being violated. To strip away those checks and balances, and make it so that there's more essentially policing on the streets of mental illness … has never been proved to be effective in the long run,” Sullivan said.

“This goes a step further than what we've seen in some other states or cities,” she added.

The order would also expand drug courts and mental health courts, and it would “allow or require” anyone receiving federal funding for homelessness support to collect health information and share it with law enforcement.

The Trump administration will also stop supporting housing-first policies, which provide housing and support services as quickly as possible to people experiencing homelessness, the order said.

It comes amid significant proposed reductions for affordable housing.

“The Trump administration is going to make housing more expensive. They're going to force more people into homelessness. And then once people are homeless, they're going to take away actual solutions, and instead lock people up for being homeless,” Rabinowitz said.

This approach has serious repercussions for health, he added.

“Housing is the best form of healthcare, period. The health impacts of housing are tremendous, and the health consequences of homelessness are devastating.”

Higher rates of involuntary institutionalization would add greater strain to the healthcare system, Sullivan said. “We know that involuntary commitment leads to more people being in the emergency room and emergency rooms being more overwhelmed than they currently are.”

Cuts to Medicaid will also make it harder for people with mental illness and substance use disorder to access healthcare, Sullivan said.

And the new federal budget cuts funding for supportive services like mental health care and substance use treatment.

The administration also plans to review grants for existing substance use programs, with explicit instructions not to fund projects on harm reduction – which often includes overdose response and naloxone distribution, needle and syringe exchanges, and education on safer drug use, among other initiatives – and safe consumption. And the order instructed Trump administration officials to pursue possible lawsuits against such programs.

States and cities receiving federal funding could see that money restricted or frozen if they don't enforce the new rules, the executive order said.

In the wake of last year's supreme court decision on Grant's Pass, upholding the Oregon city's ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness, several states and municipalities introduced stricter laws to target people living outside.

“Especially when federal funding is really disappearing, this hamstrings cities and municipalities into compliance in order just to fund vital services,” Sullivan said.

Focusing on programs addressing these issues in innovative ways “makes it seem like this is another mechanism for going after places like LA or Portland or Chicago or any place that is trying to do something different with addressing homelessness and substance use”, Sullivan said.

“That is, to me, what it seems like – this is a way to go after not just individuals and people, but to go after areas,” she said.

But it will have sweeping effects on homeless people and others to whom the order is applied.

“I think that they are motivated by this incorrect belief that homelessness is a choice, that we have to punish people in order for them to make a better choice,” Rabinowitz said.

Even if that were true, he said, “there are no carrots right now, there's no housing that anybody can afford, but there are a whole ton of sticks, and we know that people don't need a stick. People want housing; there's just no housing that they can afford. But the executive order does nothing to address the actual causes of homelessness.”

Sullivan agreed.

“It does nothing to address underlying poverty. It does nothing to address the persistently unaffordable housing crisis,” she said.

“It does nothing to expand access to Medicaid for impoverished people. Meanwhile, the numbers in the US of people who are experiencing chronic homelessness and disability are increasing.”

Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine created an online "catalog" where Ukrainian children are offered up for adoption while sorted based on physical traits like eye or hair color, the head of a Ukrainian NGO said on Aug. 6, denouncing the practice as child trafficking.

The database, which includes data on 294 children, is available on the education department of the Russian occupation authorities in Luhansk Oblast.

"Most children in this catalog were born in Luhansk Oblast before the Russian occupation and had Ukrainian citizenship," Mykola Kuleba, CEO of the Save Ukraine organization, said in an Instagram post.

"Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction." 

Ukraine has identified more than 19,500 children abducted by Russia during the full-scale war and forcibly transferred to Russia, the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, or Belarus. Only 1,480 have been brought back home.

Ukrainian officials estimate the real figure could be far higher. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets puts the number at up to 150,000, while Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights Daria Herasymchuk has given a range of 200,000–300,000.

Kuleba said that many children who grew up in territories occupied by Russia since 2014, including Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, have been "systematically deported and transferred to Russian families in Moscow and other Russian regions."

The Russian-run database describes the children listed in the database as "orphans and children left without parental care." The website allows users to filter the children by age, eye and hair color, and the preferred form of guardianship, such as adoption or foster care.

Children are introduced with their photos, age, gender, and character traits, with some being described as "obedient" or "calm."

"The way they describe our children is indistinguishable from a slave catalog. This is child trafficking in the 21st century, and the world must act to stop it immediately," Kuleba said. According to him, the database is part of an effort to "improve" the system in the face of dropping demand for adoptions.

Save Ukraine is a charitable organization founded in 2014 to support vulnerable groups, namely orphans and children rescued from Russian-occupied territories. 

The Kyiv Independent has reached out to Ukraine's children's rights officials for comment.

The abductions of Ukrainian children have been broadly denounced by the international community as a war crime. Their return has remained a central and non-negotiable demand in Ukraine's negotiations with Moscow.

During peace talks in Istanbul, Russian officials dismissed Kyiv's appeal to return the abducted children as a "show for childless European old ladies," even as they admitted to relocating hundreds, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Children's Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, citing their personal roles in organizing the illegal transfers.

Ukraine's military launched a drone attack on Russia's Volgograd Oblast overnight on Aug. 7, striking a railway station in the town of Surovikino, regional Governor Andrei Bocharov reported.

Preparations for the meeting are underway, and the venue has already been agreed upon, Russian foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said.

"This step will help ensure transparency and legality in the work of enlistment offices' teams, as well as protect the rights of both sides," Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

"As in May 2025, the only plan that can be the subject of discussions and approval by the Ukrainian public is a joint plan from Europe and Ukraine," the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology read.

"Parents of some of them were killed by occupation authorities, others were simply issued Russian identification documents to legitimize their abduction," said Mykola Kuleba, head of the Save Ukraine organization. 

Members of the Russian Community reportedly arrived at the cemetery in Russia's Karelia region before the ceremony on Aug. 5 and doused participants with water while singing the patriotic Soviet song “Katyusha,” according to Sova.

"Yesterday (Aug. 6), various potential formats for leader-level meetings to bring peace were also discussed – two bilateral and one trilateral," President Volodymyr Zelensky said after a phone call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Ukraine's debt securities, sensitive to prospects of an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, hit their highest levels in four months. 

The comments reportedly came during a phone call on Aug. 6, just two days before U.S. President Donald Trump's deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face harsher U.S. penalties.

"The demilitarization of the temporarily occupied Crimea continues," Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said in a statement.

"No one else was harmed. The injured person has been hospitalized," the police said on social media.

"As a result of the drone strike, a fire broke out at a technical unit for processing gas and gas condensate," the General Staff reported.

The slowdown reflects the limits of Russia's war-fueled expansion, driven by military spending at the expense of civilian investment and private consumption.

The official, who has not been publicly named, is accused of organizing a campaign of abuse against Ukrainian detainees, including civilians. Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, 27, was among the victims, prosecutors said.

"President (Donald) Trump has made it clear that he's willing and capable of moving forward on some economic actions, secondary sanctions, or other direct sanctions as well," U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.

It's a little misleading to ask what the average home costs in Canada: there are so many types, markets and submarkets that the answer makes little statistical sense. Still, the Canadian Real Estate Association does its best with a measure called the National Composite MLS Home Price Index, which tries to suss out where the market overall is going by looking at sales and listings from real estate boards across the country. The latest figures from June show four months of slowly deflating home prices, but they also set a benchmark of $776,400 for single-family detached homes prices across the country.

CREA's numbers show these types of homes are still historically quite expensive, but still lower than when the pandemic-era boom rocketed prices to a peak of $951,200 in 2022. Since then, the trend has been down to the point where CREA's national numbers say these homes are now about 18 per cent lower than their peak.

Not all markets are created equal though: some are still seeing prices marching upwards while others have properties available at a relative bargain. Here's what you'd find if you took that national benchmark and applied it to local markets across the country.

610 Muir Rd. features four bedrooms and about 2,100 square feet of living space.Supplied

While there are undeveloped lots for sale in Greater Vancouver for under $800,000 (although in the case of the two currently for sale in Burnaby, there's literally a cargo rail track in your front yard) you have drive about an hour away to Maple Ridge to find something like a livable detached house (such as a 1,000-square foot, three-bedroom bungalow at 12121 228 St.) 

For something near national benchmark price you're better off searching B.C.'s vast interior, which is one of the more affordable single family markets in the province with a June single family benchmark of $802,200, down 7.9 per cent from the peak it hit in April, 2022 ($866,200). 

For example, for $779,900 you could get 610 Muir Rd. on the less-developed western side of Lake Okanagan. It's a relatively new-build home finished in 2019, with four bedrooms and about 2,100 square feet of living space. There is also has a three-car garage and a huge deck (and second-floor balcony) looking into the forests of Fintry Provincial Park just behind. 

The relatively new-build home, finished in 2019, is selling for around $779,900.Supplied

It's location – almost equidistant between Vernon and Kelowna – contributes to its relative affordability. “If that house was right in the city it would be substantially more money; You save money by driving a bit every day,” said listing agent Gord Heighton, realtor with RE/MAX Vernon Salt Fowler. According to him, most of the buyers in the area come from the Lower Mainland, or like himself, from Alberta.

“We get a lot of people relocating around town, upsizing or downsizing. They come here and buy their house for cash,” said Mr. Heighton. “We're still not, like, cheap; but compared to Toronto and Vancouver we are.”

Alberta is one of the few provinces that didn't see huge swings upward during the pandemic that then retrenched. The province as a whole has seen 38 per cent growth since the end of 2019. But the average single family home prices of $522,200 is still well below the national figure. That means in the most expensive market – Calgary, where prices sit around $694,000 – you can get a lovely single-story bungalow or split level on a modest lot near Nose Hill Park for under $780,000.

Meanwhile, Edmonton is still among the more affordable large-city markets in the country with a detached benchmark price of $505,300. For $775,000 you could have 7604 157 Ave. NW, a 3,200-square-foot, three-bedroom home that backs onto one of the city's man-made stormwater lakes. The listing agent, Paul Afonso, with MaxWell Progressive, is more of a builder and entrepreneur but is listing the home for a friend. He said the house dates from the late eighties and has had a few renovations since. Among the newer features are a wine cellar, an indoor hot-tub, a curving wooden staircase and a huge solarium off the kitchen that looks out into the lake. There's a vented barbecue and wood-burning stove to help make it through those long Edmonton winters.

Compared to the Prairies, Ontario's single-family homes grew an anemic 12.4 per cent from $793,000 in 2019 to $891,900 in June. That doesn't tell the whole story of course: it's also the province that saw some of the fastest swings upward and corrections backward of the pandemic.

The big caveat for the province is that “Greater Toronto” is one of the most expensive markets in the country (its $1.2-million benchmark price is second only to Greater Vancouver with $1.9-million). It's worth noting there's a big different between the “Greater” and the city of Toronto. Inside the city boundary the average detached home sold for $1.64-million in June, according to statistics from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. In Toronto, you could find a 700-square-foot detached worker's cottage built in the postwar period for under $800,000, but there aren't a lot of family-sized options at that price.

Outside of Greater Toronto and Hamilton there's quite a few regions where the single family prices are lower than the national number. In the Barrie-Simcoe area, prices are 21 per cent off their 2022 peak (from just over $1-million to $808,300), in Hamilton they are 25 per cent down (from $1.15-million to $864,100) while Kitchener-Waterloo has dropped 26 per cent (from $1.094-million to $805,600). Bargain hunters should note the K-W deals are still relative: the detached prices are still 40 per cent higher than they were in 2019.

For $770,000 you could get a charming three-bedroom brick house in downtown Kitchener at 32 Ellen St. E. The two-storey building is more than 127 years old but has been lovingly updated and maintained with some fanciful additions to the exterior; a motif of stars has been added to the porch and the paved rear yard and patio, perhaps in homage to K-W's premier performance venue (Centre in the Square) that's across the street. Inside there's a lot of personality expressed with hand-painted decorations on everything from kitchen cabinets and furnishings to doorway casings and trim. According to listing agent Alina Telescu with Red and White Realty Inc., rumour has it a host of notable locals have lived there over the years.

Detached homes have also been on a fairly steady rise in Quebec, up 47 per cent from the end of 2019 to June's $600,200 benchmark. Even so the province's most expensive market, the Montreal area, sees its benchmark price still well below the national figure at $684,800. There are plenty of options for a detached house at the national benchmark: closer to the city centre, they might be a little smaller or on eccentric lots. If you move toward the suburbs, you start to find larger properties with more land.

For $779,000 you could get a two-storey, split-level home in the West Island area known as DDO or Dollard-des-Ormeaux at 14355 Rue Meadowvale. This part of the city is 95-per-cent Anglophone, according to listing agent Nabil Rougui, with Group Sutton-Performer Inc., and looks a lot like many Canadian suburbs that began to spring up in the 1960s.

This house has four bedrooms spread across about 1,200 square feet, as well as a finished basement, and features a two-car garage and an in-ground pool in the backyard. While not the biggest house in Montreal in the most fashionable neighbourhood, it's still closer to the higher end of the market than the bottom. As sales slow and the market tips away from sellers towards favouring buyers, Mr. Rougui said he's increasingly having the conversation with clients about how much bigger their next house has to be? “They say ‘I want that big one because my cousin has a big house,'” he said. “If it were cars, it would be ‘You need a Honda Civic.' But people want that BMW or Mercedes: the difference between the need and the want comes into play.”

The price growth in New Brunswick from 2019 is nothing short of remarkable with prices almost doubling (up 94 per cent) from $169,500. In comparison, Newfoundland looks sluggish with just 44 per cent growth from $226,400 over the same period. When comparing the detached homes in the largest cities, Halifax's $584,200 price leads all other Maritimes cities and keeps Nova Scotia the most expensive of the eastern provinces. That's compared to $405,100 figure in St. John's on the Rock and $343,300 in Saint John.

To find a house near the national benchmark take a look in the Moncton area (N.B.'s priciest local market) for properties like 160 Boundary Dr.: This 3,000-square-foot, three-storey home (with attached three-car garage) sits on a 2.1-acre lot, in an area known as Rural Estates that has a bunch of other large houses on acreage, all hidden from each other in a thickly wooded area. The last time this home sold in 2019 the price was $366,500, meaning it's more than doubled in value.

“It was usually people from Ontario that would buy these during COVID,” said listing agent Rickey Côté, with Exit Realty Associates, who saw lots of folks cash out of homes in Central Canada and bring buckets of money to buyer cheaper property in his community. “I had one client sell his house in Ontario and bought three here; one for each of his daughters and one for himself,” he said. These days some of that Ontario money has had to leave, thanks to remote working policies withering away, and now the market is tilting more toward more moderate price growth even while home values remain higher than they had ever been historically. “It's not going to double again in the next four years, but we were so far behind the rest of the country,” said Mr. Côté.

Israeli flags are a common sight at Auschwitz-Birkenau.AFP / Getty Images

So just how bad did things get for worldwide Jewry in 2025, someone might ask in a future history class. So bad, the answer might go, that Israeli flags weren't allowed at Auschwitz.

So, pretty bad. Ugly bad.

While not exactly accurate, that is what a group of Israelis felt they experienced when visiting the site of the concentration camp – now a huge, sprawling museum of horrors, near Oswiecim, Poland. Here about 1.1-million people were murdered by Nazis, who had built high-efficiency gas chambers in German-occupied Poland for that purpose. Most of the victims were Jewish, murdered for that sole fact.

So imagine you're a Jewish member of an Israeli delegation, visiting with your emotions and your history and your flags, and you are stopped at the entrance. The flags, the group understood, were the problem.

Israeli flags – as controversial as they might be at this moment – are a common sight at Auschwitz-Birkenau. They are particularly pervasive during the March of the Living, when Jewish people from around the world visit on Holocaust Remembrance Day and parade solemnly from Auschwitz to Birkenau. When I first heard about last week's flag controversy, the image that immediately came to mind was of a young March participant walking along the railway tracks that once led to death, wearing an Israeli flag as a cape.

Opinion: As a Jewish Canadian, I want my community to speak out about the horrors in Gaza

Opinion: Genocide is a process, not an event

Here's what actually happened last week: A group of 180 Israeli army officers and security officials arrived at the gates of Birkenau for a commemoration known as “Witnesses in Uniform” and were told they could not enter carrying the flags, according to Ynet news. Discussions with local officials ensued, and finally, the group entered without their flags. 

One participant told Ynet news that he believed the incident stemmed from antisemitism and an attempt to reshape the historical narrative. 

The real issue, according to the museum, was that the event had not been disclosed or approved in advance.

“The problem was not about the flags themselves, which are allowed, but about organizing ceremonies on the grounds of the memorial site, during which flags and banners on wooden poles are sometimes brought in,” Auschwitz Museum spokesperson Bartosz Bartyzel explained by email. “It is a matter of ensuring the safety of visitors and ceremony participants.”

The museum stated on X that organizers failed to follow proper procedures. “Under no circumstances can the grounds of the former camp be a space for unco-ordinated manifestations or ceremonies – even those carried out with good intentions.” 

Even if the optics aren't great, this is fair. 

On social media, Israel's ambassador to Poland called this a misunderstanding, dismissing claims of antisemitism and humiliation. 

Still, consider for a moment what it must have felt like for those Jews denied entry. To Auschwitz! Among them surely were descendants of Holocaust survivors, perhaps the children or grandchildren of people who had survived – or were murdered in – this very place.

This is hardly the most concerning thing happening in the world right now regarding the State of Israel. But the delegation's response and the social media outrage are indicative of the Jewish experience in 2025. 

Mr. Bartyzel did not answer my question about whether this has happened before. Have unauthorized Israeli flags entered the site previously by people marching in? Has anyone been forced to return their flags to their vehicles and then enter without them? Has such an order been given before Israel became the global pariah it is now? If so, I missed the global outrage.

Today, the Jewish community is on high alert, frightened that antisemitism is lurking around every corner. Here in Canada, B'nai Brith reports that antisemitism has reached “perilous, record-setting heights.” The same thing is happening in the U.S., the U.K., around the world. 

In the midst of this, it is easy for Jews to assume antisemitic intent. While this is often true, it is not always the case. We need to be thoughtful in each circumstance. 

That said, if there is a spot where the consequences of antisemitism can be felt viscerally, it is at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where the absolute worst happened.

I visited the site in 1998 during the March of the Living, with family members including my mother, who survived Birkenau. It was a difficult day for her, but she drew comfort from not just her own descendants, but from seeing so many young Jews from around the world – and the sea of Israeli flags. They were a symbol of what rose from all she had lost: her parents, her little brother, her home, every single possession, her freedom, her youth, her education, her health, her life as she had known it.

Nobody should have to experience such staggering losses. Nobody.

MINSK, August 7. /TASS/. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has expressed concern over the increasingly aggressive stance of Poland and the Baltic states. During a meeting focused on the activities of the State Security Committee (KGB), he emphasized that the situation extends beyond internal affairs, primarily reflecting the tense military and political environment surrounding Belarus, the BelTA news agency reports.

Lukashenko remarked, "It is alarming that our neighbors – Poland and the Baltic countries – are acting in a very intimidating and hostile manner toward Belarus. They are exerting pressure from all sides, and our intelligence agencies are feeling this most acutely. That's why we, and I personally, are paying the closest attention to the work of the KGB and the security sector as a whole."

BelTA recalled that some time ago, KGB Chief Ivan Tertel proposed measures to enhance the agency's effectiveness. The main report was delivered by Alexander Volfovich, the Secretary of Belarus's Security Council. Attending the event were notable figures including KGB Chairman Andrey Shved, Prosecutor General Igor Sergeyenko, and Chief of Staff of the Council of Ministers Valery Vakulchik.

Lukashenko concluded with optimism, stating, "I hope we will have an open and objective discussion on this topic and reach a suitable conclusion."

Elizabeth Warren and others pen letter over alleged plan to divert funds from nuclear arsenal to convert jet into Air Force One

Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump's reported plan to divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a luxury jet gifted by Qatar into a new Air Force One.

The US president provoked an outcry in May when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet as a free gift from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the plane so it can transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an estimated $1bn.

Now Democrats are seizing on media reports that the retrofit will be partly funded by money redirected from Sentinel, a nuclear missile modernisation programme already running years behind schedule and said to be 81% over budget.

In a letter obtained by the Guardian, senators Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Ed Markey and Adam Schiff, along with representatives John Garamendi and Jamie Raskin, demand answers from Troy Meink, the secretary of the air force.

The letter reminds Meink that, in testimony to the Senate armed services committee, he acknowledged the Qatari plane needs “significant modifications” to meet Air Force One standards. These are likely to include defences against threats ranging from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear blast, secure and reliable communications systems, and protections against counterintelligence.

The Democrats write: “In June, you told Congress that the cost of retrofitting the Qatari Boeing 747-8 ‘wouldn't be anywhere near' the reported $1 billion estimate. Do you still believe this to be the case?”

The air force has reportedly assessed $934m previously appropriated for the Sentinel programme as “excess to need”, allowing these funds to be used for other classified programmes, including the retrofits for the Qatari jet.

In their letter, the Democrats ask Meink: “Has the Air Force assessed whether shifting funds out of the Sentinel program will increase the program's costs or risk further delaying the program's schedule?

“Did or will any of the $934 million from the Sentinel program go to retrofits for the Qatari Boeing 747-8, or were or will those funds be diverted to other programs?”

Warren and her colleagues criticise a lack of transparency, noting that the total price tag for the Qatari jet retrofit is classified, preventing policymakers and the public from understanding if “additional retrofit costs will eat into other Air Force programs beyond Sentinel”.

The Democrats request a commitment from the air force to ensure that it is “fully cooperating with any independent investigation into the acceptance of the Qatari jet and/or the Qatari jet's retrofitting”.

after newsletter promotion

Democrats have previously suggested that the gift to Trump likely violates the constitution's prohibition on accepting foreign emoluments. They point out that the jet would only be used by the government for a few years at most before being donated to Trump's presidential library.

Trump has previously defended the ethics of his decision. He said: “I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I could be a stupid person and say: ‘No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.'”

He also compared it with “favours on the golf course. When they give you a putt, you pick it up and you walk to the next hole and you say: ‘Thank you very much.'”

But the senators and representatives take a different view. “However,” they write, “by providing the president with a ‘palace in the sky' it clearly appears that Qatar is trying to curry favor with the administration.”

Meanwhile the Trump Organization recently announced a new Trump-branded resort along the coast of Qatar, partnering with Qatari Diar, a property company backed by that country's sovereign wealth fund.

There are fears that pressure for quick results is threatening the Lebanese effort to gradually build a stronger state

Middle East crisis – live updates

Under mounting US pressure, Lebanon's government is being forced into a dangerous choice. Does it want to fight a war with Israel or does it want to fight a war at home, with Hezbollah?

In recent weeks, the US has been pushing for the Lebanese government to disarm Hezbollah. The government had already been moving in that direction, but not at the pace the US wanted. Lebanese media began to fill with warnings from unnamed sources that if Hezbollah's arms were not confiscated soon, a second war with Israel could be on the horizon.

On Tuesday, the Lebanese government acquiesced and announced the Lebanese army would draw up a plan to place arms exclusively within the hands of the state by year's end. Hezbollah and its political ally Amal announced the next day that they would “treat the decision as if it did not exist” and accused the government of serving US diktats.

US pressure for faster disarmament has laid the seeds for a scenario the Lebanese government has taken pains to avoid: a confrontation with Hezbollah. If cornered, the group could resort to force to defend its arsenal.

Lebanon's current government was born after the latest Hezbollah-Israel war, with the US as its midwife. A battered Hezbollah could no longer maintain its side of a stalemate that had left Lebanon without a president for two years, and Joseph Aoun, the former army chief, was elected amid heavy US pressure.

The election of Aoun, who included in his mandate restoring the state's monopoly on violence, was an extraordinary sign of how much Lebanon, and the region, had changed in the past year.

Hezbollah had dominated Lebanon for two decades. What had started as a resistance group described as a “state within a state” had transformed into a party controlling the state, setting much of Lebanon's domestic and foreign policy.

It was only after a devastating war with Israel, which saw virtually all of its top leadership killed, thousands of fighters dead or wounded and a large portion of its weapons destroyed, that Hezbollah's grip on the country was loosened. The toppling of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in December was another blow to the group, which had used Syria as its main supply route from Iran.

The new Lebanese government, however, was careful not to gloat. It took pains not to publish videos of soldiers confiscating Hezbollah weapons caches in south Lebanon. Too aggressive an approach to Hezbollah could provoke a confrontation and alienate the group's base of mostly Shia Muslims.

First and foremost was to engage in state-building so that former members of Hezbollah and its popular base felt included in Lebanon's national project, rather than under siege.

Officials were aware that the same conditions which gave rise to Hezbollah in the 1980s are still present today. Similar to 45 years ago, Israel occupies parts of southern Lebanon and the country's Shia population, which bore the brunt of Lebanon's war, are impoverished and do not feel represented by the state.

The US views the gradual pace that the state has set as stalling, however.

On the Lebanese side, officials have privately complained that the Americans seem unconcerned with building a strong Lebanese state. Instead, the US wanted immediate results on disarmament, putting the new government's state-building project at risk.

“This process is very dangerous the way it is unfolding. It will actually consolidate and push potentially even wider sectors of the Shia portion of Lebanese society behind Amal and Hezbollah rather than to national consolidation,” said Joseph Daher, the author of Hezbollah: the Political Economy of the Party of God.

Near-daily Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, in violation of the November ceasefire, have also undermined the Lebanese government's claims that only the state can protect sovereignty.

The day after Lebanon announced it would draft a plan to disarm Hezbollah, an 11-year-old child was killed by an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon.

The Lebanese army has not responded to any of the thousands of Israeli airstrikes on the country since November – nor does anyone expect it to. The under-equipped, under-staffed army can do little in the face of an Israeli military equipped with US fighter jets, which drop the latest US munitions by the thousand.

There is little appetite among the international community to help the Lebanese army become a proper fighting force. Requests by army leadership to install low-tech watchtowers on its border with Israel have been rejected.

Without the means to do so, asking the Lebanese army to enforce the disarmament of Hezbollah is a tall order. “How can you ask the LAF to do to Hezbollah what Israel couldn't do to Hamas in a smaller space, with warplanes?” said a senior diplomat in Beirut.

Nonetheless, international pressure to disarm Hezbollah is likely to increase, not abate. Opinion among international powers on the question of the Lebanese state's monopoly on arms was uniform.

“The US, Saudi and EU are in agreement on this point: the question is no longer if Hezbollah should be disarmed, but how to do it,” the diplomat said.

Enrique Ochoa, Mexico's undersecretary for multilateral affairs and human rights, expressed concern that the threat of nuclear weapons is being underestimated globally in an online interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on Tuesday.

Ochoa, who holds the stance of promoting nuclear abolition said that “there has been a kind of banalization of nuclear threats and their use,” as the focus on nuclear deterrence has increased. He raised urgency about nuclear proliferation, saying, “A world with more states possessing nuclear weapons … will be more dangerous.”

After noting that Mexico and other nations have led the negotiations for the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, he emphasized, “Since the nuclear attacks on Japan [in 1945], Mexico has been a very strong advocate of nuclear disarmament.”

Ochoa stated Mexico's willingness to collaborate with Japan on nuclear disarmament, emphasizing that “we have a lot of common ground in terms of peace and security.”

He expressed gratitude for the activities of Nihon Hidankyo (the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations), which received the Nobel Peace Prize last year, and said Mexico would further develop its achievements through diplomatic action.

 Robert A. Pape

After nearly 700 days of war, the death toll in Gaza has risen to extraordinary levels. Amid heavy bombardment that has turned the territory into a wasteland of rubble and stringent blockades that have led to mass hunger and even starvation, over 61,000 Palestinians have died and over 145,000 have been seriously wounded, according to Gaza's Hamas-affiliated health authorities, which do not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters.

But the true number of the war's casualties may far outstrip those figures, which do not include the thousands of bodies that remain under the rubble, the large number of dead that could not arrive at morgues, and the excess deaths from the destruction of infrastructure and the ensuing disease, famine, and lack of medical care. In February, the medical journal The Lancet published an extensive analysis based on a wide variety of sources (including obituaries) and estimated that the official death toll underreported the direct war deaths in Gaza by at least 41 percent and perhaps by as much as 107 percent, while not accounting at all for nontrauma-related deaths resulting from the impact of Israeli military operations on Gaza's health services, food and water supplies, and sanitation.

In sum, the authors of the study suggested that Israel's campaign has caused at least an additional 26,000 Palestinian deaths and perhaps as many as over 120,000 additional deaths, with the true death toll possibly upward of 186,000. Taking that into account, as of late July 2025, Israel's war in Gaza has led to the deaths of between five to ten percent of the prewar population of about 2.2 million. This represents an unprecedented slaughter. Israel's campaign in Gaza is the most lethal case of a Western democracy using the punishment of civilians as a tactic of war.

Leaders and scholars have long assumed that democracy offered a solution to the worst pathologies of authoritarian states, especially the willingness of a government to subject populations to coercion, cruelty, and violence. Indeed, the United States and other Western democracies, including Israel, have insisted that democracy is crucial for the promotion of fundamental human rights, individual prosperity, and a more peaceful world. For Israel, a country that has long touted its democratic bona fides, to violate core democratic norms in such dramatic fashion cheapens the value of democratic government itself.

Israel's defenders may insist that civilian deaths are inevitable in a conflict against a burrowed-in terrorist enemy. But it has been clear from Israeli actions—including the targeting of children by snipers, the relentless bombing of civilian infrastructure and residences, and the blockade and starvation of the civilian population—as well as the rhetoric of numerous Israeli officials that Israel's war is not simply against Hamas but aimed at all the residents of Gaza. That is also the conclusion of numerous international institutions and human rights groups. Indeed, the notion that Hamas can be eradicated via military means is a “fantasy,” as former Shin Bet director Yoram Cohen said this week. As civilians continue to suffer in Gaza, Israel has squandered the moral high ground for no good strategic purpose.

Israel's critics may demand that, based on its treatment of the Palestinians, the country should not be considered a democracy. That understates the full dimensions of Israel's behavior in Gaza. Even now, Israel retains the political institutions built on majority rule and the high levels of citizen participation in free elections that are the hallmarks of representative government and that have long characterized Western democracy. Independent experts, such as Freedom House, still recognize Israel as a democracy. What is truly shocking about events in Gaza is both the scale of the devastation and that the government of Israel can genuinely say that its policies reflect the will of most Israelis. The carnage in Gaza is not the work of authoritarians or demagogues but bears the imprimatur of democracy. Israel's campaign thus has profound implications both for the long-term security of the country and the value of democracy around the world.

In my 1996 book, Bombing to Win, I studied every campaign in the twentieth century that employed airpower with the intention of inflicting harm on civilians: 40 campaigns in all, including the Spanish Civil War, the Vietnam War, and the 1991 Gulf War. Only five of the 40 involved civilian deaths greater than one percent of the civilian population. These included four campaigns in and around World War II—Japan's invasion of China from 1937 to 1945, Germany's invasion of Poland from 1939 to 1945, the Allied bombing and invasion of Germany from 1939 to 1945, and the U.S. bombing and conquest of Japan from 1942 to 1945—and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1988. In proportional terms, Nazi Germany's attack on Poland ranks as the deadliest of these campaigns, killing upward of 20 percent of the prewar population over six years. That figure was enlarged, of course, by the Holocaust and the slaughter in ghettos and concentration camps of millions of Polish Jews.

Until Gaza, the worst civilian punishment campaign by a Western democracy was the bombing and ground invasion of Germany in World War II, which killed approximately two to four percent of the population, outpacing even the U.S. nuclear attacks and fire-bombing raids on Japan, which killed about one percent of the population. Those estimates from Germany account for deaths caused by both Soviet and Western forces, as well as direct and indirect deaths (as in The Lancet's study on Gaza).

Whether it is called a “genocide” or not, no sensible observer could look at Israel's war in Gaza and miss the stunning levels of devastation that Palestinians have endured. Beyond the mass death and suffering, the level of physical devastation is remarkable: satellite analysis by credible independent media outlets, such as The Economist and the Financial Times, reveals that at least 60 percent of all the buildings and 90 percent of homes in Gaza have either been severely damaged or completely destroyed. All 12 of Gaza's universities, 80 percent of its schools and mosques, and numerous churches, museums, and libraries have also been demolished. No hospital in Gaza is fully functioning, and only 20 out of 36 hospitals are partially functioning.

And yet despite this mammoth destructive enterprise, Israel has not come close to fulfilling its stated aim of eliminating Hamas. The group still has significant appeal among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. It may be diminished as a military force, but it can replenish its depleted ranks with new recruits—indeed, by some accounts, it has managed to bring in over 10,000 new fighters since the war began. The extreme brutality Israel has inflicted on the Palestinian people has not produced the strategic gains that Israeli officials promised.

The moral case for harming civilians is always dubious even when such violence serves a strategic purpose. When that strategic purpose does not exist, however, the moral case evaporates altogether. Israel now finds itself in a morally untenable situation. Rather than incur the world's growing wrath, increased economic pressure, and the greater likelihood of future violence, Israel must reverse course and pursue alternatives to its campaign of mass death in Gaza.

Throughout history, states have repeatedly punished civilian populations harshly to try to compel local communities to turn against governments and terrorist groups. But even intense civilian punishment rarely achieves these goals. Instead, it often leads to what I have termed the “Pearl Harbor effect”: growing support among the assailed civilian community for its government or for the local terrorist group.

In June 2024, I argued in Foreign Affairs that at least in one way, Hamas was stronger then than it was before October 7, 2023. To be sure, Israeli attacks had devastated the group's leadership and smashed much of its infrastructure. But according to the most reliable polling information available at that point in time, Palestinian support for Hamas had remained the same or risen in Gaza and the West Bank. Overall, the taproot of Hamas's power—its ability to recruit new fighters to replenish losses—had actually increased. In January 2025, U.S. officials revealed that according to their estimates, Hamas had recruited around 15,000 new fighters since the start of Israel's military operations in 2023, more than making up for the 11,000 to 13,000 losses that U.S. intelligence estimated the group had suffered.



Much has happened since the start of this year: the end of a two-month cease-fire in March, the escalating Israeli siege and the tightened blockade on food and humanitarian goods entering the territory, the humanitarian crisis affecting Gaza's entire population, and Israel's announced intention to conquer at least 75 percent of Gaza—along with the overt consideration by some Israeli leaders that they should expel all Palestinians from the territory. For its part, Hamas seems to be stepping up its guerrilla tactics of ambushes and bombings targeting Israeli soldiers in Gaza, but the group has not been able to meaningfully defend the territory and its population from Israeli attacks.

Media reports in recent months have revealed sporadic demonstrations in Gaza against Hamas, suggesting that some Palestinians are fed up with the group and its actions. But according to recent polling, Hamas remains broadly popular among Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank. The unprecedented scale of Israeli action has not yet exploded the assumptions in my original analysis.

Hamas's relative power cannot simply be measured the same way one would measure the military balance between Israel and its state rivals. In contests between states, the military balance between opponents is of paramount importance. Their militaries usually engage in direct, large-scale battles to take and hold territory, control the skies over territory, or secure access to contested territory. The success of these operations is determined by key indicators, such as the numbers of fighters, stocks of weapons, and levels of economic support. If such factors determined the nature of combat between Hamas and Israel, the war would have been over long ago, since Israel far outpaces the group on all the usual indicators of military strength. That the war has continued for nearly two years and Hamas retains sufficient governing authority in Gaza to hide the remaining Israeli hostages and inflict casualties on the Israeli security forces strongly suggests that the true power of Hamas cannot be found in the traditional metrics of the military balance.

Terrorist groups such as Hamas fight asymmetrically. They rarely seek to seize and hold territory and almost never attempt to win pitched military-to-military battles. Instead, these groups seek to impose losses on their opponents in other ways, mostly through guerrilla operations that pick off enemy military personnel in small numbers and over long stretches of time and through attacks against civilians. Most often, they simply want to maximize harm to vulnerable civilian targets. And since they are always weaker than their state rivals in the usual military indicators, terrorist groups expect to suffer great losses as the conflict persists. As a result, the most telling power of Hamas is its ability to replace the fighters it loses with new ones. Estimates of Hamas's fighting strength bear out this logic. According to the Israeli military, in early 2025, Hamas had as many as 23,000 fighters, a figure roughly the same as an Israeli estimate of the group's size prior to October 7, 2023.

Hamas can recruit new fighters because it still enjoys support. Surveying public opinion is the best way to measure how much support exists among Palestinians for Hamas. The best available surveys conducted among Palestinian populations in Gaza and the West Bank are by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), an independent, nonprofit survey center established in 1993 following the Oslo accords, that collaborates with Israeli scholars and institutions.

My previous June 2024 analysis relied on the PSR surveys from 2023 and 2024. When recent surveys from May 2025 are added to the mix, a striking finding emerges: Hamas has more support among Palestinians today than it did before October 7. Hamas is now, for instance, substantially more popular than its main political rival, the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which dominates the Palestinian Authority. In September 2023, Fatah enjoyed a four-point lead over Hamas (26 to 22 percent). In polling from May 2025, Hamas now enjoys an 11-point lead over Fatah (32 to 21 percent).

The shift toward Hamas is particularly acute in the West Bank, where support for Hamas has more than doubled. There, support for armed attacks on Israeli civilians has risen from 48 percent in June 2023 to 59 percent in May 2025.



In Gaza, support for Hamas has remained flat, despite the enormous suffering brought upon the territory in the wake of Hamas's October 2023 attack. In September 2023, Hamas had a 13-point lead over Fatah in Gaza (38 to 25 percent), and in May 2025, the numbers were almost the same: Hamas held a 12-point edge over Fatah (37 to 25 percent). The one sign that the Israeli campaign may have changed some views in Gaza is the drop in support among Gazans for armed attacks on Israeli civilians, which fell from 67 percent in September 2023 to 37 percent in May 2025.

But the polling suggests that Israel has not succeeded in severing the connection between Gazans and Hamas. Far from dwindling, support for Hamas has grown or remained the same, and the willingness of Palestinians to attack Israeli civilians remains high enough to satisfy Hamas's recruiting needs, despite the most brutal punishment campaign by a Western democracy in history. For Israel's security, the tragic reality is that Hamas likely retains the key asset that could allow it to carry out another major attack down the road: vast numbers of fighters willing to fight and die for the cause.

Hamas's abiding popularity could be a factor in wider violence beyond Gaza. With Israeli forces stepping up raids on Palestinian refugee camps and settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank, the region is now a powder keg. The West Bank is home to 2.7 million Palestinians and 670,000 Israeli settlers living in close proximity to one another. Recent Israeli plans to expand settlements in the West Bank and rhetoric from far-right figures calling for the territory's annexation will likely add fuel to this potential fire.

Israel's announced intention to seize control of at least 75 percent of Gaza and then confine Gazans to a small portion of territory won't succeed in divorcing the population from Hamas. As Palestinians are driven into a small corner of the enclave, Hamas will just move with them; this plan is no more likely to defeat Hamas than were the previous population transfers that forced people from area to area inside Gaza. Indeed, such Israeli actions will cause more suffering among civilians—and produce more terrorists. Israel could go further still, expelling Gazans into the Sinai Desert, but such a drastic measure would stoke the possibility of future retributive violence targeting Israelis. And most damaging for long-term Israeli security, throwing Gazans out of the territory would leave Israel open to accusations of engaging in ethnic cleansing, undermining any moral case for supporting the country.

Military operations that, intentionally or not, result in historic levels of civilian deaths are ultimately leading to a more dangerous situation for Israel, making it a less desirable home for Jews and a more likely target for those seeking revenge. Instead, Israel should establish a new security perimeter between Israeli civilian population centers and the Palestinians in Gaza, allowing Gazans enough space to rebuild their lives, letting humanitarian and economic aid to flow into the territory unimpeded, and working with international allies to foster alternative political arrangements to Hamas or Israeli control in Gaza.

Since the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, international support for the country has been based in significant part on the recognition that Jews were the victims of the worst genocide in history. The war in Gaza, however, has seen a swelling tide of condemnation of Israel for committing intentional harm to civilians, mass atrocities, and even genocide. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants that require some 125 countries, including France and the United Kingdom, to detain Israel's prime minister and other members of Israel's cabinet. Even within Israel, prominent voices are calling for a course correction: former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has declared that Israel's actions in Gaza are tantamount to a “war crime,” arguing that “what we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: the indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.” As Israel becomes an international pariah and faces stiffening resistance to its rule in Gaza, the historic scale of its punishment of civilians is only jeopardizing the country's long-term security.

Many Western countries have already begun to make moves to chastise Israel, including by joining much of the rest of the world in formally recognizing a Palestinian state, a step that could lead to large-scale humanitarian intervention in Gaza and economic sanctions on Israel. The United States will likely not follow that path, but U.S. President Donald Trump is mercurial. He has already contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and insisted that the starvation of Gaza must end. Rifts within Trump's base are widening over Israel. U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a leading hard-right Republican, declared that Israel is in fact committing genocide in Gaza, borrowing from rhetoric heard more often on the left. A tactical alliance could grow in the United States between elements of the far right and the far left that seek to roll back U.S. support for Israel.

Israel is the most militarily powerful country in the Middle East and has scored numerous victories over its opponents in recent years. But it is also a tiny country surrounded by rivals. And it needs close relations with major Western democracies to ensure the viability of its economy. Those relations could be tested and strained as Israel continues waging the worst campaign of civilian punishment ever performed by a Western democracy, a campaign that has not come close to eliminating Hamas and has given Israel more adversaries and left it more isolated. Israeli leaders must decide whether their ongoing immoral actions in Gaza are really worth the costs to their country's future.

WASHINGTON, August 7. /TASS/. China's cooperation with Russia is reasonable and lawful, as well as deserving of respect and protection, Chinese Embassy Spokesperson Liu Pengyu told TASS in response to potential new US import tariffs targeting China over its trade relations with Russia.

"The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Russia within the framework of international law. This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected," Liu stated. "China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. Tariff wars have no winners. Coercion and pressuring will lead nowhere."

Liu noted that "recently, China and the U.S. held the latest round of China-US economic and trade talks in Stockholm," where both sides "reviewed and affirmed the implementation of the consensus reached in the economic and trade talks in Geneva and the framework agreed on in London talks." "We hope that the US can work with China to continue adhering to the important consensus reached by the two heads of state during their phone talks, make full use of the role of the China-US economic and trade consultation mechanism, keep enhancing consensus, reducing misunderstandings and strengthening cooperation, further deepen dialogue and consultations, and strive for more win-win outcomes," the spokesperson concluded.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that The Washington administration may impose additional tariffs on China for trading with Russia. When asked about the matter during a White House press briefing, the US leader said that it will depend on how things go.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A wealthy businessman on Thursday became the head of Haiti's transitional presidential council tasked with restoring order in the troubled country as a top gang leader underscored the challenges facing the nation by vowing to overthrow the government.

The appointment of Laurent Saint-Cyr at the council's heavily guarded office in the capital of Port-au-Prince — where criminal gangs control 90% of the neighborhoods — marked the first time that members of Haiti's private sector serve in both the rotating presidency and the post of prime minister, two positions that share the country's executive duties. 

Saint-Cyr had his start at a local insurance company while Haiti's current prime minister once ran an internet firm.

“Our country is going through one of the greatest crises in all its history,” Saint-Cyr said at a ceremony attended by ambassadors of several countries. “It's not the time for beautiful speeches. It's time to act.”




Hours before the swearing-in, a powerful gang federation that has long denounced Haiti's oligarchs threatened to overthrow the government, and gunfire erupted in parts of the capital in the morning as many residents stayed away from normally congested streets.

In a video posted on social media, Viv Ansanm gang leader Jimmy Chérizier — better known as “Barbecue” — warns residents to give his armed group free passage through several neighborhoods to reach the council's office. 

“People of Haiti, take care of yourselves and help us … in the battle to free the country,” Chérizier says, wearing a bulletproof vest and with an automatic rifle slung around his shoulder.

A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police said in a statement that officers thwarted potential attacks by around-the-clock patrols and by boosting the number of armed forces in certain neighborhoods and around critical infrastructure.

“Armed gangs had plotted to disrupt national stability and render the country ungovernable,” it said.

Saint-Cyr thanked all national and international actors who have helped Haiti, as well as the private sector, which he called the engine of the country's economy. He noted that while he's from the private sector, he would serve all people equally.

Saint-Cyr previously served as president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Haiti and of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He'll be working with Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a one-time president of an internet company in Haiti and also a former president of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Saint-Cyr said security was the council's utmost priority. He called on the armed forces to intensify their operations and on international partners to send more soldiers, offer more training and help boost a mission lacking resources and personnel.

“We must restore state authority,” he said. “The challenges we face are certainly linked to insecurity, but they also are the result of our lack of courage, a lack of vision and our irresponsibility.”

He questioned what was preventing the government from offering services Haitians deserve, including health and education. “Mister prime minister, assume your responsibilities!” he said.

Meanwhile, 58 organizations from countries that include the United States in a letter to Saint-Cyr accused the council of violating its legal obligations to Haiti's women and girls.

“Collective rape is endemic,” they said, noting that sexual violence has surged as gangs persist in their rampage. The organizations also accused Haiti's government of being “completely absent” at shelters where rape survivors need basic services. 

A growing number of people have grumbled about Haiti's private sector leading the country. Some of Haiti's wealthy elites and powerful politicians have long been accused of financing and arming dozens of gangs.

However, dozens of Haitians wearing white T-shirts and clutching signs emblazoned with Saint-Cyr's photograph gathered outside the council's office to support him. 

Skirmishes broke out hours later between supporters and those who opposed Saint-Cyr.

“Even though he's a mulatto with good hair, he's Haitian,” one supporter said of Saint-Cyr, who is part of the country's small and powerful lighter-skinned elite — as is Fils-Aimé.

As the country prepared for Saint-Cyr's swearing-in ceremony, Haitians posted a flurry of warnings about violence in hopes that people could remain safe.

“Those of you in the capital, you will hear gunshots both ahead of you and behind you. Remain on guard!” one message stated.

Tripotay Lakay, a local news site, reported that one person was killed and another injured while driving into Port-au-Prince on Thursday, though it was unclear how that happened. A video posted on social media shows a woman's body slumped in the car.

Heavy gunfire around downtown Port-au-Prince persisted on Tuesday afternoon, with local media reporting that several people were wounded. Small explosions from police-manned drones also were heard.

Violence also was reported in Kenscoff, a once peaceful farming area above the hills of Port-au-Prince.

The U.N.-backed mission said it lost two armored vehicles after they became trapped in trenches dug out by gangs. It said Kenyan policemen came under an attack with Molotov cocktails but “courageously held their ground, inflicting significant damage on the assailants.” Three officers received minor injuries.

Videos posted on social media show suspected gang members laughing and cheering as they surrounded one of the armored vehicles that was later set on fire.

“Come get it back if you can!” one gunman is heard jeering.

In a report released Thursday, the U.N.-backed mission noted that it has 991 personnel, far less than the 2,500 envisioned, and some $112 million in its trust fund — about 14% of the estimated $800 million needed a year.

The mission said it has no air support for operations and that only 200 officers can be deployed at a time because of insufficient equipment, including vehicles.

The mission also noted that the government remains fragile: “Partisan infighting within the transitional government has had the effect of paralyzing the government and emboldening the gangs.”

Gangs in Kenscoff recently kidnapped eight people from an orphanage, including an Irish missionary and a 3-year-old child. They remain missing.

Violence surged in the aftermath of the July 2021 killing of President Jovenel Moïse, and ongoing violence has displaced more than 1.3 million people in recent years.

At least 1,520 people were killed and more than 600 injured from April to the end of June across Haiti. More than 60% of the killings and injuries occurred during operations by security forces against gangs, with another 12% blamed on self-defense groups, according to the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti.

Seattle Kraken center John Hayden and their mascot, Buoy, had a close encounter with a brown bear during a promotional video shoot in Alaska in June. 

Hayden and Buoy were on a fly-fishing outing in Katmai National Park when the bear approached them. 

While fishing, Hayden and Buoy were accompanied by a guide, who spotted the bear. The guide had the crew wade through the shallow river.

As they were moving away, the bear, which had been moving closer to them, turned and charged through the water for a few paces before coming to a stop and turning away.

"I want to blame it on Buoy," Hayden said on the video afterward. "They were pretty interested in his look."

Brown bears commonly feast on salmon in the Brooks River in Katmai National Park, gobbling them as they leap upstream over Brooks Falls to spawn. The park, nearly 300 miles (485 km) southwest of Anchorage and inaccessible by road, is home to the annual "Fat Bear Week" contest celebrating the bears as they fatten up for the winter.

"Bears are everywhere at Brooks Falls and, like, this is their territory," said Kraken Partnership Marketing Director Melissa O'Brochta, who also recorded the encounter from shore. "They're also super used to seeing humans. So I wasn't scared."

Hayden and Buoy were in Alaska as part of an annual trip organized by the Bristol Bay Native Corporation in Anchorage, Alaska, with events that promote youth ice hockey. Alaska does not have its own NHL team; the closest teams are in Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, which has the Vancouver Canucks.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is “ready to pay a big price” and pledged to back India's farmers amid increased U.S. tariffs on his country.

President Donald Trump doubled U.S. tariffs on India to 50% on Wednesday over the country's purchases of Russian oil.

“I know that I might have to pay a big price for this,” Modi said in New Delhi on Thursday. “But I'm ready for the sake of India's farmers, fishermen, and livestock keepers. Today, India is ready.”

Modi did not mention the new tariffs, which his country recently called “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” On Thursday, Trump celebrated the rollout of his tariffs on more than 50 countries.

Trump's order also places pressure on Russia, which provided 1.75 million barrels of oil to India from January to June of this year. Trump could restrict Russia's trade prospects further if India relents and drops its financial support of the Russian oil industry.

“India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil, they are then, for much of the oil purchased, selling it on the open market for big profits,” Trump wrote on social media. “They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the tariff paid by India to the USA.”

Indian officials have indicated that they will continue to buy Russian oil.

However, the tariffs are making Trump less popular with India, a U.S. ally, and its people. Farmers are a large voting bloc in India, and the tariffs will undoubtedly affect them.

“Trump's 50% tariff is economic blackmail — an attempt to bully India into an unfair trade deal. PM Modi better not let his weakness override the interests of the Indian people,” said Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party.

TRUMP RAISES INDIA TARIFFS TO 50% OVER RUSSIAN OIL PURCHASES

Modi is meeting with China for the first time in seven years this month as India's relationship with the United States worsens.

The prime minister also spoke with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday. Brazil is also facing 50% tariffs and has refused to engage in direct talks with the U.S. to negotiate.

The cutting-edge of neurotech can read your mind. Sort of.

For the past few months, when I really needed to get something done, I put on a special pair of headphones that could read my mind. Well, kind of. The headphones are equipped with a brain-computer interface that picks up electrical signals from my brain and uses algorithms to interpret that data. When my focus starts to slip, the headphones know it, and an app tells me to take a break.

It sounds like something out of science fiction, but a decade-old startup called Neurable is pioneering the technology, and it's preparing to put the brain-tracking tricks into more gadgets. Earbuds, glasses, helmets — anything that can get an electrode near your head could provide a real-time stream of data about what's going on inside of it. Neurable's technology uses a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to collect brain data and algorithms to interpret those signals. Beyond measuring attention, the company is now using that data to track and improve brain health.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

I want to emphasize again that this technology does not actually read your mind in the sense of knowing your thoughts. But, it knows when you're entertained or distracted and could one day detect symptoms of depression or, on a much more consequential front, early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

I came across Neurable on a longer mission to understand the future of health-tracking technology by testing what's out there now. It's one that left me anxious, covered in smart rings and continuous glucose monitors, and more confused about the definition of well-being. That's because almost all health trackers that are popular on the market right now — Apple Watches, Oura Rings, Whoop Bands — are downstream sensors. They measure consequences, like elevated heart rate or body temperature, rather than the root cause of that state. By tapping directly into your brainwaves, a brain-computer interface can spot issues sometimes years before they would show up.

It could one day detect symptoms of depression or, on a much more consequential front, early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

“Biologically, your brain is designed to hide your weaknesses: It's an evolutionary effect,” Neurable's co-founder and CEO Ramses Alcaide, a neuroscientist, told me. “But when you're measuring from the source, you pick up those things as they're occurring, instead of once there's finally downstream consequences, and that's the real advantage of measuring the brain.”

Other major tech companies are also exploring ways to incorporate non-invasive brain-computer interfaces into headphones. A couple years ago, Apple quietly applied for a patent for an AirPod design that uses electrodes to monitor brain activity, and NextSense, which grew out of Google's moonshot division, wants to build earbud-based brain monitors for the mass market. There's also been a recent boom in activity around invasive brain-computer interfaces being developed by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink and even Meta that surgically implant chips into people's brains. It's safe to say that's not currently a mass-market approach.

Still, while all of those mega market cap companies ponder the possibilities of their own brain-powered projects, Neurable's is on the market. It's on my head right now, actually, and it works.

Spun out of the University of Michigan's Direct Brain Interface Lab in 2015, Neurable initially planned to break into the gaming industry. An early version of its technology used EEG sensors in a VR headset to power the world's first brain-controlled video game but pivoted to wearables before launching a wildly successful Indiegogo campaign for a futuristic set of headphones. That attracted the attention of major hardware makers and a partnership with Master & Dynamic.

The Master & Dynamic MW75 Neuro — the $700 pair of headphones I tested — looks like any other set of noise-canceling headphones, except for the badge that reads, “Powered by Neurable AI.” When you connect them to the Neurable app is when things get fun.

Inside the Neurable app is a little video game that lets you fly a rocket ship with your brain — and serves as a proof of concept. The trick is you have to focus on a set of numbers on the screen. The more intensely you focus, the higher the numbers go, and the faster the rocket ship flies. If you start to get distracted by, say, thinking about flying an actual rocket ship, the numbers go down, and the rocket ship slows. It's one of the coolest innovations I've ever seen, if only because it's so simple.

The EEG sensors in Neurable's products can pick up a range of brainwave frequencies, which are associated with different behaviors and activities. The beta frequency band provides some information about attention state as well as anxiety, while alpha indicates a mind at rest.

While EEG sensors and brain-computer interfaces are most often seen in labs, putting these sensors into a device that people wear every day stands to transform our understanding of the mind. “Non-invasive EEG is cheap and completely safe,” said Bin He, a professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, whose lab built a drone you can fly with your mind over a decade ago. “AI, or deep-learning technology, however has drastically improved the performance of [brain-computer interfaces] to read the minds of individuals.”

If you changed the technology's mission from measuring focus to, say, symptoms of depression, you could imagine how an everyday gadget could offer some life-changing interventions. The possibilities are as endless as the list of issues that can affect the brain. The Pentagon has been using Neurable's portable technology to study traumatic head injuries in soldiers, for instance, and that research could have practical applications in sports. Alcaide also mentioned Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as potential targets for their technology. Symptoms for these diseases don't appear for years after onset, but early markers could show up in the kind of EEG data their technology captures from everyday wear.

If you changed the technology's mission from measuring focus to, say, symptoms of depression, you could imagine how an everyday gadget could offer some life-changing interventions.

For now, however, the MW75 Neuro headphones are primarily used to sharpen your attention — with the new and added benefit of giving you a snapshot of your brain health. This involves starting a session with the headphones on and letting the sensors collect the electrical signals your brain's sending off. Your focus is measured as low, medium, or high, and when you're flagging for a while, the app will prompt you to take a break. You can also turn on a feature called Biofeedback, which plays music of varying intensity in order to nudge your focus toward the high range. The Brain Health reports are still in beta mode but will show you daily estimates of how you're doing in terms of things like anxiety resistance, cognitive speed, and wakefulness.

The way you know that the device isn't actually reading your mind comes down to science and a strong data policy. Neurable's technology picks up raw voltage — not actual thoughts — from your neurons and uses AI to decode the data and identify signals associated with focus, the company's co-founder Adam Molnar explained to me recently. Neurable encrypts and anonymizes the data coming out of your head and onto its sensors and then again when it goes to your phone, so it's far removed from any personal data. Furthermore, he said, Neurable has no ambitions to be a data company.

“Our business model doesn't depend on identity. We don't sell ads. So there's no benefit,” Molnar said. “It's actually more of a liability for us to be able to have data map back to an individual.”

It's hard for me to say how much more productive I became thanks to the brain-reading headphones. As with many other health trackers, there's sort of a placebo cat effect: Simply deciding to track the behavior changed my state of mind and made me behave a certain way. So, setting up a focus session inevitably made me pay closer attention to how well I was focusing, how often I took breaks, and if I was choosing to be more mindful.

This is actually what makes me so curious about an earbud version of what Neurable's doing. I wear AirPods for most of the day, whether it's taking calls for work, listening to podcasts, or just drowning out the sounds outside my Brooklyn apartment. If these earbuds were also collecting data about my cognitive well-being during all those activities, I'd be interested in knowing what I could glean from that information, if only to better understand what's rotting my brain. And I'm sure plenty of companies would be happy to collect more data about their users' states of mind at any given time. Imagine if the TikTok algorithm knew you weren't interested in something — not because you swiped through it but rather because your brainwaves said so.

Neurable's website has mockups of EEG-equipped earbuds, helmets, and smart glasses, and it's clear that the company is eager to move beyond its first product. The company doesn't just want to make gadgets, either. It wants to be the leading platform for brain-powered technology. “Just like Bluetooth is in every single device, and everyone should have access to Bluetooth, we believe that everyone should have access to neuro tech,” Alcaide told me.

We're years away from the most far-fetched applications of brain-computer interfaces, but we're heading in that direction.

“There's so many things you can do with neuro tech, whether it's tracking health conditions, whether it's controlling devices, whether it is understanding yourself better,” he said. “It would be a disservice to the world if the only solutions that came out were our own.”

Neurable is indeed one of many startups trying to bring neuro tech to the masses, although they're the only ones selling a product I'd actually wear in public. Several other EEG-based gadgets out there take the form of headbands, many of which are geared toward sleep health or meditation. A company called Emotiv, which also partnered with Master & Dynamic, will start selling its own EEG-equipped earbuds this fall. It remains to be seen if and when Apple will make brain-reading AirPods, but they've already partnered with a brain interface startup called Synchron, which allows people to control iPhones with their minds (Haven't you always wanted to become one with your iPhone?).

This is where we circle back to the point where science fiction meets reality. We're years away from the most far-fetched applications of brain-computer interfaces, but we're heading in that direction. Whether that future ends up looking miraculous or like a Black Mirror episode is up to us — and to the companies, like Neurable, pioneering it.

Harvard medical student Nick Norwitz reveals the science behind his food experiment, in which he consumed 133,000 mg of dietary cholesterol

The question of whether to incorporate eggs into a healthy diet has long been debated due to their cholesterol content.

But recent research has found that eggs may not be as bad for cholesterol as previously believed.

A new study led by researchers in Australia investigated the impact of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat on LDL cholesterol, often known as "bad cholesterol."

5 EGG MYTHS DISPELLED BY AN EXPERT, PLUS TIPS FOR EVERY EGG LOVER

High cholesterol is known to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is a leading cause of death.

The randomized, controlled study — which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition — assigned 61 adults with baseline LDL cholesterol to various diets for five weeks each.

Previous guidance warned against egg intake as a potential risk to heart health. (iStock)

These included a high-cholesterol, low-saturated fat diet with two eggs per day; a low-cholesterol, high-saturated fat diet without eggs; and a high-cholesterol, high-saturated fat control diet with one egg per week.

The researchers found that the nutrition plan with two eggs per day, as part of a low-saturated fat diet, reduced LDL cholesterol more than the egg-free diet.

Across all three diets, saturated fat intake was "positively correlated" with LDL cholesterol, but dietary cholesterol (primarily found in animal products like meat and eggs) was not.

The study found that eggs did not correlate to LDL cholesterol, but saturated fat did. (iStock)

"The key message is that it is not foods that are high in cholesterol that increase blood levels of 'bad' cholesterol, but it is the saturated fat in the foods that we consume," study co-author Jon Buckley, executive dean at the University of South Australia, told Fox News Digital.

"Most foods that are high in cholesterol are also high in saturated fat, but eggs are somewhat unusual in that they are high in cholesterol but low in saturated fat."

These findings follow a December 2024 advisory from the FDA that deemed eggs "healthy," due to growing research that the food does not raise bad cholesterol.

"Current research shows that cholesterol in eggs does not negatively impact your body's cholesterol levels as was once thought," the news release stated.

"This important milestone closes the door on decades of debate over whether eggs are good for you and reinforces their standing as a powerhouse of nutrition."

Certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco, who is based in New York, confirmed in an interview with Fox News Digital that eggs can be part of a balanced diet.

They serve a "decent amount" of lean protein at about 6 grams per egg and contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the expert said.

"For a long time, it was thought that dietary cholesterol (any foods containing cholesterol) caused cholesterol levels to rise – but in more recent years, that notion has been debunked by many studies," she said. "It is more noted now that saturated fat is a main reason for LDL cholesterol to increase." 

DeCicco, who was not involved in the study, said saturated fat is mostly found in dairy and meat products like cheese, creams, butter, fatty cuts of meat, dark meat, poultry, processed meats like sausage and bacon, and processed baked goods.

A nutritionist agrees that eggs can be a healthy part of a balanced diet. (iStock)

"Not only do eggs contain little saturated fat, but they also contain monounsaturated fat and omega 3 fats, which are heart- and brain-protective," she added.

Eggs contain less than 2 grams of saturated fat, and the American Heart Association recommends about 12 to 13 grams of saturated fat per day for a 2,000-calorie diet.

"So eating two to three eggs with vegetables and fruit is a nutritious breakfast full of protein, fiber and healthy fat that will provide long-lasting fuel," DeCicco said.

Buckley agreed, recommending that "if you are going out for a cooked breakfast of bacon and eggs, consider swapping out some of the bacon or sausage for more eggs, and this will help you maintain a healthier blood cholesterol level."

The Army estimated the restoration of a Confederate statue in Arlington National Cemetery that was removed in 2023 will cost $10 million, an official said Wednesday.

The official told the Associated Press that the statue, called the Reconciliation Monument, will feature panels of information about its history. However, the statue is plagued by past controversy.

The statue is a depiction of a woman, representing the American South, crowned with olive leaves.

Arlington National Cemetery describes the statue, built by Confederate veteran Moses Jacob Ezekiel and erected in 1914, as “a nostalgic, mythologized vision of the Confederacy, including highly sanitized depictions of slavery.”

It features a Latin inscription, “Victrix causa diis placuit sed victa Caton,” translated “The victorious cause was pleasing to the gods, but the lost cause to Cato,” which bolsters the South's secession as a romanticized “lost cause.”

The official told the AP that the statue is expected to be ready for viewing in 2027, as the base needs replacement and the monument requires refurbishment.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings. Unlike the Left, we don't believe in erasing American history — we honor it.”

The order comes after Hegseth restored Confederate mentions in military-related infrastructure across the United States.

A congressional-mandated commission ordered the statue to be taken down or renamed along with other Confederate monuments in 2022. Retired Army Brig. Gen. Ty Seidule, vice chairman of the commission, said the commission found Ezekiel's memorial is “problematic from top to bottom.”

Hegseth has found a unique way to keep Confederate names intact. He ordered Fort Bragg, originally named after Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, to be renamed after Army Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, a World War II veteran.

During the critical Battle of the Bulge, the WWII Bragg earned a Silver Star and Purple Heart.

In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which slams attempts to rename historical objects.

The order says, “Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame.”

            Energy Sec. Chris Wright said Tuesday night the Trump administration is updating the National Climate Assessments that have been previously published, which the administration recently removed from government websites.
    


            “We're reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those reports,” Wright told CNN's Kaitlan Collins in an interview on “The Source.”
    


            Wright dismissed the past reports, saying “they weren't fair in broad-based assessments of climate change.”
    


            “When you get into departments and look at stuff that's there and you find stuff that's objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said.
    


            Energy spokesperson Andrea Woods said, “The National Climate Reports are published by NOAA, not DOE. He was not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports.”
    


            The interagency process and publication is overseen by the US Global Change Research Program, which was established by Congress.
    


Trump EPA proposes revoking pollution limits based in part on document authored by 5 climate contrarians



            The National Climate Assessments are congressionally mandated research reports authored by hundreds of scientists and experts, intended to inform the country of the latest climate science and the current and future impacts of climate change in the US. The reports take years to research, draft and publish and go through multiple rounds of peer review, with all 13 federal agencies that conduct climate research. An independent National Academy of Sciences panel signs off on the content.
    


            The first Trump administration signed off on and released the Fourth US National Climate Assessment in 2018, although it attempted to bury the report's news by releasing it on Black Friday. The current administration has deleted all previous reports from government websites, fired the scientists working on the next iteration of the report, and recently issued a separate report compiled by five researchers that questioned the severity of climate change.
    


            Altering or revising previously published assessments would be a significant escalation in the administration's attempts to wipe credible climate science off the record.
    


            “That would be a very unusual approach, especially given the process that went into creating these,” said scientist Zeke Hausfather, the climate research lead at financial services company Stripe, who helped author the Fifth National Climate Assessment.
    


            Wright played a large role in commissioning a new federal report that questioned the severity of climate change, authored by five researchers who are well-known climate contrarians. The report was issued last week, in conjunction with a proposed regulatory repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency's “endangerment finding,” a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety.
    


            Wright told CNN that he hand-picked the four researchers and one economist who authored the Trump administration report: John Christy and Roy Spencer, both research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Georgia Tech professor emeritus Judith Curry and Canadian economist Ross McKitrick.
    


            “I just made a list of who do I think are the true, honest scientists,” Wright said. “I made a list of about a dozen of them that I thought were very senior and very well respected. I called the top five, and everyone said yes.”
    


            Compared to the National Climate Assessments and international climate science reports that take years to compile and review, the recent DOE report took just two months to produce. It is now undergoing a public comment process.

A group of Republican state lawmakers from Midwestern states filed a complaint over smoke from Canadian wildfires.

Republican state Reps. Austin Harris of Iowa, Elliott Engen of Minnesota, Calvin Callahan of Wisconsin, and state Sen. Clare Cory of North Dakota signed the letter. The Upper Midwest and parts of the Northeast have been experiencing poor air quality conditions for weeks due to smoke from Canadian wildfires.

“Enough is enough. We owe it to our constituents, especially our kids, seniors, and those with respiratory issues, to fight for clean air. If Canada can't get these wildfires under control, they need to face real consequences. We won't sit back while our air becomes a health hazard,” Callahan said.

The letter was sent to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and the International Joint Commission, the latter of which was established to prevent and solve disputes along the border regarding air quality and shared waters.

The lawmakers said they want to solve their dispute through international law. They asked both parties to respond within 30 days. 

Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew accused the state Republicans of throwing a “timber tantrum” and playing “political games” with their complaint. He noted that firefighters from the United States have been aiding Canada in firefighting, and that Canadian firefighters were aiding the U.S. when California saw widespread fires earlier this year. 

“These are attention-seekers who can't come up with a good idea on healthcare or on making life more affordable,” Kinew told the Canadian Press. “So they're playing games with something that's very serious.”

He added that he does not “generalize these attention-seekers' misguided words to all Americans.”

FEMA'S FORK IN THE ROAD: ABOLITION OR SEAT AT THE CABINET

There are currently around 737 active fires across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Manitoba has seen the highest amount of fires this season. 

At the federal level in the House, Reps. Elise Stefanik and Nick Langworthy, both New York Republicans, coauthored a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney outlining the impact of smoke in their state. They are asking Canada to increase wildfire prevention resources and have requested more collaboration between the U.S. and Canada on the problem.

Politicizing economic data is dangerous.

On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a jobs report that upended the narrative pundits, journalists, government officials, and the White House had been repeating for months: The economy is doing just fine.

The numbers showed that the US economy added a modest 73,000 jobs in July, several thousand under what economists had forecasted. But the real surprise came in the revisions to data from May and June, which found the country added 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported.

President Donald Trump was outraged by the revisions, calling the data “a scam.” And he directed his anger towards BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

“We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.”

But Trump wasn't the only one who appeared to be stunned by the latest jobs report.

Kimberly Adams, senior Washington correspondent for Marketplace and the host of the Marketplace podcast Make Me Smart, told Vox that everyone in her business is getting whiplash.

“We were doing all of these stories about why is the economy so resilient? Why isn't anybody reacting to tariffs?” Adams said. “And then this week we're all talking about, my gosh, are we heading into stagflation and recession?”

Adams explained that the reason it seems like experts got it wrong is because a lot of the economic data in the United States relies on lagging indicators like the unemployment rate.

Below is an excerpt of Adams's conversation with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Why did the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics make up the statistics?

The head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make up the labor statistics. It's literally shooting the messenger. The president of the United States was complaining on Truth Social and elsewhere that the reason for firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics has to do with the number and the scale of revisions.

The jobs numbers came in lower than expected last week, and they indicate that there's not the same kind of robust labor market that we thought we'd had over the last couple of months. But what drew even more attention were the revisions to the numbers from previous months. And they were pretty drastic revisions that shocked a lot of people.

These revisions tell us that the labor market we thought we had the last few months — that seemed to be pretty resilient against the tariffs and other changes President Trump and his administration were making in the economy — it wasn't actually as resilient as we thought.

I should say: Labor market numbers get revised all the time. GDP numbers get revised all the time to pick whatever economic indicator you want. But these revisions in particular were, a) really large, and b) just fundamentally changed the story of what the labor market looked like over the last couple of months.

So not only did the numbers tell us that there was less hiring than we thought there was, it also told us that the labor market itself shrank, that there was a lower labor force participation rate. A lot of people are blaming that on the crackdown on immigration. The report also told us that if it weren't for job growth in the tariff-resilient health care sector, we would have had almost no job growth at all.

But now that Donald Trump has fired the commissioner in charge of these job report numbers, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it'll all be okay again by the next jobs report in September? We all win?

I imagine that may be what the president wants to believe, that the numbers will be a bit more appealing. Almost all of the economists I talk to say that there's no reason whatsoever to believe that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is manipulating the numbers or that the numbers are rigged, as the president said.

There's been a huge backlash to this firing from the community of people that follow this stuff very closely. And putting in someone who might be a little bit more amenable to the president's narrative around economic data has the potential to undermine economic data in the United States and make it less trustworthy — both for businesses here in the US, as well as in the global economy.

And why does that matter? I mean, for people who don't pay attention to these numbers, why does trustworthy data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics matter to this country and to the world?

Because lots of different businesses and countries and even individuals use this data to make decisions about how they're going to manage their money, how they're going to manage their businesses, and how they're going to plan for the future.

So, for example, if you know that the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, which is what the numbers came in at last week, you can say that's a pretty low unemployment rate. And that means that most of the people out there who want jobs have jobs. And if we're going to hire, we're going to need to position ourselves well in the market to compete with the relatively few workers who are out there looking for a job.

This gets into one of the main reasons that this is on the agenda for a lot of folks, which is the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has two mandates: full employment and stable prices. Full employment basically means as near as you can get to it, low unemployment rates. Stable prices equates to a more or less 2 percent inflation rate. We are still trending a little bit above 2 percent inflation, but when the Fed met last week, which was before these jobs numbers came out, the unemployment situation looked pretty good. So they didn't have much of an incentive to do anything about interest rates, because inflation was still running a bit high. Unemployment looked fine, so no big deal. So let's leave interest rates until inflation cools down a bit more.

If the Fed had the information on Wednesday that they ended up getting on Friday, would that have changed their decision? Maybe.

The last time you were on this show, you were here to talk about the Fed. It has sounded for weeks now like Trump has been itching to fire Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed.

Who he hired!

Who he hired, thank you. He didn't end up firing Powell, but then he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Are the economists you're talking to afraid that this might not be the end of Trump getting rid of people who seem to disagree with his imaginary vision of what the numbers should be?

You're absolutely right. This is definitely creating an environment where folks are worried that even if people at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (or any other federal statistical agencies) are still putting their heads down, doing the work, and churning out the data without fear or favor — if they release a report that the president doesn't like, they might lose their job.

Even if they still do the work, other people and other entities might look at it and say, well, can it really be true?

Look at a country like China, which releases economic data about the performance of its economy all the time. And you'll always hear folks say, take it with a grain of salt because the Chinese Communist Party likes to mess with the numbers. That means lots of folks have to jump through all of these additional hoops to try to figure out what's actually going on in the Chinese economy.

China is one of the biggest economies in the world. What happens if we end up in the same boat?

ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) — The U.S. was knocked off the top spot in FIFA's latest women's rankings by world champion Spain. 

Spain regained the No. 1 position despite losing to England in the final of the European Championship last month. 

The U.S. held the top position since August last year after winning gold at the Paris Olympics. Spain was No. 1 from December 2023 to June last year after its World Cup triumph. 

The latest rankings were released by world governing body FIFA on Thursday.

England, which has won back-to-back Euros and lost to Spain in the final at the 2023 World Cup, moved up one place to fourth. 

Brazil dropped three positions and is seventh despite successfully defending the Copa America to win its ninth continental title.

Sweden and France were big movers after impressive showings at the Euros. 

Sweden rose three places and is third after being eliminated on penalties by England in the quarterfinals. 

France moved up four places to sixth after also losing in the quarterfinals.

George Mason University, Virginia's largest public university, sits less than 20 miles from the District of Columbia, yet its president apparently thinks he can somehow outrun the national vibe shift on the misuse of race. But whatever you may read in the press, Gregory Washington is running out of options.

The Justice and Education departments have each launched two investigations on GMU's use of race in hiring and promotion and on the divisive and often illegal practices known as diversity, equity, and inclusion.

GMU's Board of Visitors is responsive to the state's voters and taxpayers, not to a leftist professoriate predictably circling the wagons around Washington. The board did not fire Washington last week as many expected, but soon enough, it will have to do its duty and vote on whether to remove him.

The inquiries are damning. One by the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates two complaints by professors. The first is that GMU has allowed antisemitism to thrive on campus, making Jewish students feel unsafe.

The other Education Department investigation is “based on a complaint filed with OCR by multiple professors at GMU who allege that the university illegally uses race and other immutable characteristics in university policies, including hiring and promotion.”

The DOJ investigations seek to “determine whether it is engaged in discriminatory employment practices based on race and sex,” and “whether the university has denied equal treatment of individuals based on race or national origin, in violation of Title VI.”

Give Washington credit for his adroit use of the faculty, the press, and friendly Democrats in Virginia's legislature and congressional delegation. They have rallied to his cause and given him the Houdini-like abilities to escape accountability that we saw last week — so far.

But Washington's use of politics and PR is being recognized for what it is: a refusal to accept that the nation's mood has changed. Trump was elected in part because voters have had it with the use of race in hiring, promotions, and as a cudgel to change society.

Despite getting by on a reputation for conservatism that it deserves less every day, GMU is not that different from other universities that Trump is trying to reform. Professors at GMU outside of the economic and legal faculties are just as liberal as those at other universities, and their support for Washington is seen as par for the course.

Ditto for the political cover Washington has been able to garner, as valuable as that has been for the moment.

For example, Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), a liberal Democrat, and Tim Kaine (D-VA), a left-wing progressive, rushed to Washington's aid in a July 9 op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, likening Washington's predicament to the recent ousting of Jim Ryan as president of the University of Virginia.

The two senators, both former governors, wrote, “We fear that what happened at UVA is just the beginning. Already, the Trump administration appears to be eyeing its next target: George Mason University President Gregory Washington. The accusations … are eerily similar to those lodged against Ryan.” They said Trump was leading a “calculated campaign … to politicize higher education.”

Warner and Kaine added, sagely, that “decisions about who leads our colleges and universities should rest with their boards — appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state legislature — not with partisan actors in Washington seeking headlines or revenge.”

This was cheeky on several fronts. First, it is the Left that politicized higher education in the first place, when it began to hire only like-minded liberals to populate the faculty lounge and then leveraged that monopoly to indoctrinate students into a leftist worldview.

But it doesn't stop there. The only reason the Board of Visitors likely didn't fire Washington at its meeting last week was that Washington's allies in the Virginia Senate have voted down four board members appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA).

A judge sided with the Democrats, and the four Youngkin appointments are still not off the board, but the matter should be resolved once Youngkin's team takes it to the state's Supreme Court. It could be resolved much earlier if either federal department finds that GMU — that is, Washington — is not compliant with strong antidiscrimination laws.

Not that the board gave Washington a ringing endorsement at its meeting last week, either — far from it. It voted to give him the smallest raise possible and did not verbally support him. It was the same lack of support by the UVA board that convinced Ryan this summer that his gig was up. But Washington wants to wait it out, apparently.

Unfortunately for Washington, the evidence that he uses racial preferences is clear. Just four years ago he wrote, “If you have two candidates who are both ‘above the bar' in terms of requirements for a position, but one adds to your diversity and the other does not, then why couldn't that candidate be better, even if that candidate may not have better credentials than the other candidate?”

And it's not just something he said four years ago. GMU included in a recent student orientation video a land acknowledgment statement, and it referred to America as “Turtle Island,” a term supposedly originating with some Indian tribes that leftists use to legitimize the United States.

Three members of the GMU faculty wrote in the Chronicle of Higher Education recently, “Let's be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn't about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. It's about political control — plain and simple.”

They view it that way because they started the takeover of higher education with that mindset. Washington gives them the political control of GMU they want — for the moment. But time is running out.

Israel has routed its enemies across the region but has yet to return all its hostages from the Gaza Strip. Hamas appears to have been decimated militarily but has kept up insurgent attacks. Gaza is in ruins and experts say it is sliding into famine, and long-running ceasefire talks seem to have broken down.

So where do we go from here?

Both Israel and Hamas have embraced visions for how the war should end, but mediators from two American administrations, Egypt and Qatar have yet to bridge the gaps. There are at least two other scenarios in which the war goes on indefinitely, at an unimaginable cost to Gaza's 2 million Palestinians, the Israeli hostages and their families.

Here's a closer look.

For days now, Israeli media have reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of ordering the full reoccupation of Gaza for the first time since Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers two decades ago. He is expected to meet with his security Cabinet late Thursday, possibly to make a decision.

That would mean sending ground troops into the few areas of Gaza that haven't been totally destroyed, the roughly 25% of the territory where much of its 2 million people have sought refuge, including the sprawling coastal displacement camps of Muwasi.

It would lead to countless more Palestinian deaths and more mass displacement, and it could put the roughly 20 remaining living hostages at serious risk. It would also leave Israel in full control of the territory, obliged by international law to provide security and ensure the basic needs of the population are met.




Reoccupation would spark outrage internationally and further isolate Israel and the U.S. There is also opposition within Israel, from those who fear for the hostages and former security chiefs who have warned of a quagmire.

But it has strong support among Netanyahu's far-right governing partners, who have long called for the reconquest of Gaza, the relocation of much of its population to other countries, and the rebuilding of Jewish settlements.

Hamas has said it will release all the remaining hostages in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire.

Those demands were adopted by the Biden administration and the U.N. Security Council over a year ago, and enshrined in the ceasefire agreement finalized by the Trump administration in January. That brought about a six-week ceasefire, the release of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others, and a flood of humanitarian aid.

The two sides were supposed to use that pause to negotiate a more lasting ceasefire. Instead, Israel ended the truce in March, demanding another temporary ceasefire and the release of some of the remaining hostages. 

Israel fears that withdrawing from Gaza would allow Hamas to eventually rebuild its military machine and maintain influence in the territory even if doesn't hold formal power, paving the way for another Oct. 7-style attack.

Netanyahu may also fear that his far-right allies would follow through on threats to bring down the government if he agrees to such terms. That could spell the end of his 16 nearly unbroken years in power, leaving him more vulnerable to long-running corruption charges and inquiries into the security and intelligence failures around the 2023 attack.

Netanyahu has said he will end the war once all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or agrees to disarm and go into exile.

But even then, he says Israel will pursue plans to relocate much of Gaza's population to other countries through what he refers to as “voluntary emigration.” The Palestinians and much of the international community see the plan as forcible expulsion in violation of international law.

Netanyahu says Israel is willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire in which Hamas would release several living hostages and the bodies of others in return for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, a flood of humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli pullback. They would then negotiate an end to the war, but Israel would require Hamas' disarmament.

Hamas has said it is willing to hand over power to other Palestinians but will not lay down its arms as long as Israel occupies lands the Palestinians want for a future state. It also wants guarantees that Israel will not resume the war, as it did in March.

Further military escalation could yield more concessions. But Hamas has already lost thousands of fighters and nearly all of its top leaders in Gaza, where it no longer controls many areas. Its strongest allies, Iran and Hezbollah, have been severely weakened.

The hostages are the last bargaining chip held by Hamas, which also has a strong culture of martyrdom.

It's quite possible the war continues in its current state.

Israel could continue carrying out daily strikes across the territory, which it says have only targeted militants but have frequently killed adult civilians and children. Hamas could keep up a low tempo of hit-and-run attacks, occasionally killing Israeli soldiers. Additional measures to get more food into Gaza may stave off famine and allow aid to be distributed more safely.

The hostages could survive in captivity for months or even years.

Israel is set to hold elections in October 2026 — and likely earlier — which could bring in new leadership even if Netanyahu keeps his coalition intact.

Which scenario unfolds will largely depend on U.S. President Donald Trump, who has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, and who proved he has leverage over Netanyahu when he brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after 12 days of war in June.

Trump has said he wants to end the war in Gaza and bring the remaining hostages home, but he has exerted no public pressure on Israel and appears to have fully accepted its terms for a ceasefire.

Asked on Tuesday whether he would support Israel reoccupying Gaza, Trump said, “It's going to be pretty much up to Israel.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss oil giant BP's decision to lower their spending on green energy initiatives.

In Tuesday's "Morning Glory" column, I laid out a small part of the abuses perpetrated on farmers, ranchers and landowners by the application of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) to private property by the 9,000 bureaucrats of the United States Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS.)

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has another 12,000 bureaucrats and they regulate marine species. The USFWS is by far the worst offender of private property rights, but NOAA as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also contribute to the giant, tangled tumbleweed of regulations, rules, "guidance," incompetence and environmental extremism that have paralyzed major infrastructure projects as well home and apartment building projects across the country. 

Three executive orders from President Trump would greatly assist the farmers, ranchers and landowners who have been shut down from using their land in whole or part because of the listing of one or more of the 1,300 species and subspecies listed as "endangered" or "threatened" by the USFWS and NOAA.

MORNING GLORY: MEMO FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, SECRETARY BURGUM AND DIRECTOR NESVIK

The first EO would direct Secretary Burgum to immediately remove from the list of "endangered" or "threatened" species and subspecies all mammals, birds, crustaceans and insects that were added to the list because of the application of the criteria that looks at the "projected decline" in "critical habitat" or "occupied or potentially occupied habitat." This criteria for declaring a species or subspecies on the basis of "projected decline" of its habitat is guesswork, not "science," and the application of this criteria has been repeatedly abused by bureaucrats for the past three decades. 

A species or subspecies is considered "endangered" when it is in "imminent" danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A "threatened species" is one that is liable to become endangered in the foreseeable future. Both the terms "imminent" and "foreseeable" are accordion terms that can be stretched to absurd limits. The USFWS has done so, again and again. 

When the ESA passed in 1973 there were 78 species or subspecies listed as "endangered" or "threatened." Now there are 1,300. This extraordinary rise in the number of "protected" species is because the Service began using "projected future decline" in a species' or subspecies' range. Every species or subspecies that is on the list because of projected loss of habitat should be immediately removed from the list. Such "projections" are not "science" and indeed are often absurdly applied to achieve listing status. Very often the USFWS doesn't even account for permanently set aside parks and open spaces in its calculations of "projected habitat loss."

If President Trump orders these removals from the ESA list be done immediately, he will focus the energy and budget of the bureaucracy on truly endangered and threatened species, and stop environmental extremists within the USFWS and NOAA and outside of those agencies from manipulating the list. 

The second executive order from President Trump should declare that private property impacted by ESA listings has been "taken" by the federal government and the owner must thus be compensated the fair market value of the land in question. The Constitution protects private property from uncompensated "takings," and the vast cost imposed by the ESA should be born by all taxpayers, not the few thousand landowners slammed by the Act.

Finally, President Trump should order Secretary Burgum and USFWS Director Brian Nesvik to downsize both the USFWS and NOAA and do so on the basis of merit. Too many activists have infiltrated these agencies and use the ESA to block development, not protect species. They are also among the least responsive and most inefficient members of the federal workforce. It is long past time to clean house, beginning with new regional and area directors who are committed to the Constitution's explicit protection of private property, not their own private agendas or stopping development. 

The Pacific Legal Foundation does yeoman's work to protect the rights of all landowners, including ranchers, farmers and developers, but the scale of this problem has been growing exponentially for decades. Secretary Burgum and Director Nesvik would do well to hire from within the Pacific Legal Foundation for their senior staffs. That way lies growth and true protection of genuinely endangered or threatened species. And if that protection requires the sequestration of private property for months or years, the landowner should be paid immediately for their lost economic value of their land, as the Fifth Amendment requires.

A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever.

A new Gallup poll finds public approval of the Supreme Court falling below 40 percent for the first time in the poll's history. The poll aligns with many others, which have shown public support for the Supreme Court collapsing since Justice Amy Coney Barrett's 2020 confirmation gave Republicans a 6-3 supermajority on the high Court.

One of the Gallup poll's most significant, if unsurprising, findings is that there is also an unprecedented partisan gap in public approval of the Court. Republicans give the justices high marks, while the Court is slightly more popular than venereal disease among Democrats:

This partisan gap is more or less what any close observer of the justices would predict, given the Court's recent behavior. Last year, the Republican justices ruled that President Donald Trump has broad immunity from prosecution — so broad, in fact, that the GOP justices even determined that Trump may order the Justice Department to prosecute his perceived enemies “for an improper purpose.”

Similarly, since Trump returned to power last January, the Court has blocked more than a dozen lower court decisions that limited Trump's ability to act unilaterally. Some of these decisions are blockbusters. In June's Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., for example, the Republican justices effectively neutralized the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the United States from deporting immigrants to nations where they may be tortured. In July's McMahon v. New York, the Republican justices permitted Trump to fire nearly half of the Department of Education's workers — in what Education Secretary Linda McMahon called “the first step on the road to a total shutdown” of the entire department.

The same justices who treat Trump as the special favorite of the laws, moreover, have also treated prominent liberal litigants as outside the law's protection. In Medina v. Planned Parenthood, for example, the Republican justices effectively repealed a law permitting Medicaid patients to choose their own health providers after some of those patients chose Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider and Republican bête noire.

In fairness, not all polls show the Court is currently at its all-time low point. A recent Fox News poll, for example, shows approval of the justices bottoming out in July 2024, the same month that the Republican justices ruled that the leader of their political party has broad immunity from criminal law. Fox's poll shows public approval of the Court rising this July from its post-Trump immunity low. (Although Fox News is closely aligned with the GOP, its polls are well-respected and generally viewed as reliable.)

Still, while individual polls disagree about whether the Court is unpopular or historically unpopular, the broader trend of voters losing faith in the Court as it aligns itself more closely with the Republican Party has been apparent in polling data for quite some time.

When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, the Court had distinct “liberal” and “conservative” blocs, but it would not be fair to describe it as partisan. Two Republican appointees, Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter, typically voted with the Court's liberal bloc. Justice Anthony Kennedy, another Republican, voted with the conservative bloc on most issues, but also held moderate views on abortion and frequently supported gay rights.

But that era has passed. Obama replaced Stevens and Souter with his own appointees. Trump replaced Kennedy with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a much more hardline conservative. Now, the best predictor of how each justice will vote in politically charged cases is whether they were appointed by a Democrat or a Republican.

In the past, American presidents often paid surprisingly little attention to their justices' ideologies — President Woodrow Wilson, for example, appointed the reactionary Justice James Clark McReynolds largely because he found McReynolds obnoxious and wanted to get the man (who was serving as Wilson's attorney general) out of the cabinet.

The two parties, moreover, often didn't hold consistent views on the types of issues that come before the courts. Some of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's justices, for example, were segregationists — a view that put them at odds with the Democratic Party's liberal views on race under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Republican President George H.W. Bush, who appointed archconservative Justice Clarence Thomas, was such an enthusiastic supporter of reproductive freedom when he was in Congress that his nickname was “Rubbers,” a reference to condoms.

Beginning in the Reagan administration, however, the Republican Party started producing lengthy documents laying out what Republicans did and did not believe judges should do. They also worked with ideologically aligned organizations like the Federalist Society to vet potential nominees to ensure that their judges shared the party's vision.

Democrats, meanwhile, do not have the same formal structures to evaluate potential Supreme Court nominees, but they've been no less successful in choosing justices who share the Democratic Party's approach to governance. The last Democratic Supreme Court appointee to break with the party on abortion, for example, was Justice Byron White — a Kennedy appointee who joined the Court in 1962.

So it is no surprise that, after decades of both parties appointing carefully vetted partisans to the Supreme Court, public approval of the Court now aligns with voters' political party. The American people correctly perceive that the Supreme Court has become a partisan institution, and that perception is now apparent in polling data.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

The Court recently limited access to porn. It is unclear whether that was a one-off decision or the start of a new regime.

﻿The Court recently saved part of the Voting Rights Act. But now it's signaling it'll kill it off soon enough.

The justice has one half of a really good idea.

Turns out only half of the Republican justices want to kill off the Voting Rights Act.

﻿If the president loses this case, he will go to the Supreme Court to bail him out again.

Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now.

DNC chair Ken Martin joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Texas' redistricting effort as Gov. Abbott feuds with Democrats over the effort and his reaction to Sen. Warren embracing Zohran Mamdani.  

Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan announced he is leaving the GOP and joining the Democratic Party, a move he says has been a long time coming as he has bucked heads with the Republican Party.

Duncan, who served as lieutenant governor as a Republican from 2019 until 2023, wrote in an op-ed in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday that his path to becoming a Democrat began before President Donald Trump attempted to overturn his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, which Duncan criticized at the time.

"My journey to becoming a Democrat started well before Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election in Georgia," Duncan wrote in the newspaper.

"There's no date on a calendar or line in the sand that points to the exact moment in time my political heart changed, but it has," he continued. "My decision was centered around my daily struggle to love my neighbor, as a Republican."

Duncan pointed to several policy issues that played a part in his decision to change parties, criticizing Republicans for their handling of issues such as health care, Medicaid, gun safety, immigration and how to help poor people.

He said his time in office taught him the best way to "love my neighbor" is through public policy. Before his time as lieutenant governor, he served in the Georgia House from 2013 until 2017. He opted not to run for re-election as lieutenant governor in 2022. 

The former Republican said GOP lawmakers have argued for decades that the solution to not having health insurance is to have a job, but noted that most uninsured people in the Peach State live in working households yet do not have insurance because of affordability or eligibility. 

"So, the reality is they have a job, just the wrong job," Duncan wrote. "One that doesn't offer health insurance or generate enough spare money each month to afford their own health insurance plan."

Duncan also said the Trump-backed spending bill that was signed into law last month will leave Medicaid funding "in shambles," as it cuts hundreds of billions of dollars from the government program. He also criticized the measure for its cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps, and its impact on ensuring children do not go hungry at school.

Duncan pointed to polls showing support for gun control measures such as universal background checks and red-flag laws.

He also criticized the Trump administration's mass deportation immigration policies that he said "have turned into a lesson on how not to love your neighbor." He said that immigration policy should focus on securing the border, deporting those in the country illegally who have committed felonies, but that a path to citizenship should be created for other migrants in the U.S. 

Duncan's party switch comes after the Georgia Republican Party expelled him from the party earlier this year over alleged disloyalty. The party's resolution cited his endorsement of Biden in the 2024 presidential election and, once he dropped out, his endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as alleged efforts to undermine and sabotage some Republican candidates, including current Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and failed 2022 Senate candidate Herschel Walker. 

The former Republican also spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August in support of Harris.

Duncan has been a fierce critic of Trump and the Republican Party in recent years, particularly since the president's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

"The list of reasons why I'm now a Democrat continues to grow," Duncan wrote. "Most importantly, my decision puts me in the best possible position each day to love my neighbor."

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex's Perpetual Planet Initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.



            Zed Nelson spots the painting on the wall behind me almost as soon as we begin our interview.
    


            “It's perfect,” he said.
    


            The canvas depicts a sleeping tiger draped across a velvet cushion, floating among pastel-shade leaves and flowers. The London-based photographer doesn't mean “perfect” as in “masterfully painted;” he means it's the perfect metaphor for the idealized, human-centric relationship we've cultivated with nature.
    


            The painting reminds him of another artwork, “A young Tiger Playing With Its Mother,” by the French Romantic artist Eugene Delacroix, who used a captive tiger at a zoo and his pet cat as models.
    


            “The Romantic movement in painting began with the human divorce from the natural world. As we removed ourselves from nature, and it receded from our imagination, we reenacted these hyper-romantic versions of nature,” said Nelson.
    


            It's the central thesis of his latest project, “The Anthropocene Illusion,” which earned him Photographer of the Year at the 2025 Sony World Photography Awards. Captured across 14 countries and four continents over six years, the images show nature as imagined by humans: staged habitats in zoos, manufactured ski slopes, indoor rainforests, and artificial beaches.
    


            In his previous project, “Love Me,” Nelson explored the homogenization of beauty standards. “There's some echo of that here. It's about how this artificial, idealized version of nature is being — I mean, I want to say sold back to us, but we're willing participants in it, too,” Nelson explained.
    


            “While we destroy the real thing, we seem to be creating more and more artificial or choreographed, curated versions of nature.”
    


            It's this “psychological disconnect” that Nelson is most interested in exposing. The collection is equal parts ironic (a Maasai tribesman posing beside a picnic blanket for an “Out of Africa” champagne brunch in Kenya) and dystopian (a child perched on a fiberglass rock at a beach in the world's largest indoor rainforest, the canvas of the sky slightly ripped behind him).
    


            “That's very sort of Truman Show-esque. He's gone to the very edge of that artificial world,” said Nelson of the photo.
    


            More than anything, though, there's a feeling of sadness that permeates the collection: taxidermied museum dioramas of endangered species; vibrant fish shoals swimming in dark aquariums with plastic pipes, captive elephants paraded to a bathing spot for the benefit of flocks of Instagram influencers; a caged polar bear crouched beside a mural depicting an Arctic landscape it will never know.
    


            “What we replaced real nature with becomes an unwitting monument, really, for what we've lost,” Nelson observed.
    


            The term “Anthropocene” refers to the age of humans. It's not an official epoch — yet. But Nelson believes firmly that, in years to come, today's society will mark the beginning of this new era, evident in elevated carbon dioxide levels from fossil fuels, an abundance of microplastics, and layers of concrete.
    


            “The usefulness of renaming an epoch, in this instance, would be to focus people's attention on our impact on the planet,” said Nelson. As he sees it, “the language of (environmental action) has become sort of tired or stale; you become kind of immune to it.”
    


            He wanted to counter this collective numbness with visuals that “make you think or feel differently.”
    


            Bleak but beautiful, his photos reveal a paradox.
    


            Less than 3% of the world's land remains ecologically intact, according to a 2021 study, yet nature-based tourism and biophilic architecture, a design philosophy that mimics nature, are surging in popularity. Global wildlife populations have dropped by an average of 73% in the last 50 years; meanwhile, there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild, globally.
    


            Arctic ice sheets are on course for catastrophic “runaway melting” that would see rising sea levels devastate coastal communities. But at the same time, cocktail bars in Dubai are importing ancient glacier ice from Greenland to provide the wealthy with pollution-free drinks.
    


            “We're engaged in creating an illusion for ourselves; either to hide what we're doing, or as something that we can retreat into for reassurance, because we crave the very thing that we've lost,” said Nelson.
    


            There's a spectrum to the illusion, ranging from managed outdoor landscapes to contrived scenes that simply evoke the idea of nature.
    


            Nelson likens it to fast food: “We don't want to grow it and prepare it; we just want it delivered to us with no thorns, no danger, with a nice walkway in a car park. We want to consume it and then come home. We are complicit in it.”
    


            Despite his criticisms of the “consumerist” qualities of today's manufactured natural experiences, Nelson emphasizes that he's not necessarily against any of these things: people should enjoy safaris, be awe-inspired at aquariums, relish their time in a local park, and not “destroy ourselves with guilt.”
    


            “We have this enduring craving for nature, for a connection to the natural world. That's real,” he observed.
    


Haunting images from photo prize show the ‘beauty and tragedy' of our planet



            There's a limit to what the individual can do, too: the kind of sweeping change required to protect the environment needs to come from major corporations and political leaders, which, in Nelson's view, is sorely lacking.
    


            “It's important to remind ourselves, it's not that we don't have ideas for things that can be done,” he said, reeling off a long list of environmental policies that could change the course of climate change.
    


            Perhaps this book, with its stark juxtaposition of astonishing wildlife and human interference, can be a reminder of just how in control of the world we are — with the power to remodel it in our own image, or protect and restore the landscapes we feel so connected to.
    


            “When you're surrounded by something so much, it can become utterly invisible,” Nelson said. “Photography is a way of trying to make it visible again, trying to expose it for what it actually is.”
    


            After the call ends, I can't unsee the Anthropocene illusion in my home. It's not just the anthropomorphic tiger on the wall. It's a Himalayan rock salt lamp, a plastic monstera plant and paper carnations. A cockatoo-shaped ceramic jug next to pine-scented candles and an aluminum “lemon-wedge” bottle opener. Floral-print cushions and a jungle-themed throw.
    


            It's hard to shake Nelson's words about our collective complicity; our willingness to participate in reconstructing the natural world, instead of saving it.

New Zealand's air force carried out a nearly 20-hour medical evacuation to rescue three Americans from Antarctica, calling it a high-risk mission conducted in freezing temperatures and total darkness.

The U.S. National Science Foundation requested the evacuation after three staff members at McMurdo Station were unable to receive adequate medical treatment on-site.

One of the individuals required urgent care, while the other two also needed medical attention and were transported as a precaution, according to New Zealand's air force.

Air Commodore Andy Scott, head of New Zealand's air component, said mid-winter flights to Antarctica are among the most difficult missions due to shifting weather, extreme cold and ice landings in total darkness.

"The crew can only attempt the flight after detailed analysis of the weather and airfield state," Scott said. "The United States Antarctic Program Winter Team must physically create the runway before we can depart by ensuring the ice is groomed and suitable for landing.

"Although they determine it is safe, it's still an extremely challenging environment to fly in on Night Vision Goggles due to the extreme weather conditions, which are highly changeable at this time of year and makes accurate forecasting a challenge," he added. "This, coupled with there being no airfields available to divert to once the aircraft is past a certain point south adds to the risk, so these missions are not taken lightly."

A medical team, including a physician, accompanied the crew to provide in-flight care during the return to Christchurch.

The aircraft was pre-positioned from Auckland to Christchurch on Sunday, with a crew on standby for a weather window.

The crew made the decision on Tuesday to fly to Antarctica, working through the night to complete the mission.

After landing on the ice runway, the aircraft's engines remained running to prevent freezing during refueling, the air force said.

The round-trip mission lasted 19.5 hours, with the aircraft touching down in Christchurch on Wednesday morning.

Temperatures at McMurdo Station dropped to -11°F during the operation, adding to the already dangerous conditions.

Melissa Sweeney, the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to New Zealand, praised the operation as "flawless."

"We are so very grateful. Our Kiwi partners didn't hesitate to undertake this mission in one of the most unforgiving environments on Earth. Their skill and readiness are truly world-class," she said.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced he has selected Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, replacing Adriana Kugler, who resigned Friday.

The nominee will serve out Kugler's term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026.

"In the meantime, we will continue to search for a permanent replacement," Trump said in a Truth Social post, indicating that the nominee for the full 14-year term on the board could be someone else and Miran may just be in a caretaker role.

"He has been with me from the beginning of my Second Term, and his expertise in the World of Economics is unparalleled — He will do an outstanding job," Trump added. "Congratulations Stephen!"

In addition to the Kugler vacancy, which officially takes effect Friday, current Chair Jerome Powell's term expires in May. Likely candidates for that position include current Governor Christopher Waller as well as former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.

Miran's appointment comes amid continuing speculation that Trump would seek to nominate a "shadow chair" whose job it would be mainly to act as a gadfly on the board. Trump said Wednesday that the nominee for the Kugler seat would be temporary rather than a permanent replacement for Powell.

The president has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates. Miran is a past critic of the Fed, specifically its aggressive stimulus actions during the Covid crisis.

In addition, he is the author of the controversial "Mar-A-Lago Accord," a plan to devalue the dollar as a way of managing the current account deficit problem for the U.S.

Miran still needs Senate confirmation to the seven-person board, something unlikely to happen until the upper house reconvenes in September. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, of which he would be a permanent voting member, meets next Sept. 16-17.

Prior to serving in the first Trump White House as senior advisor for economic policy under then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Miran was senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital Management and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. 

While at Treasury, he played a key role in development the Paycheck Protection Program following the Covid economic shutdown in 2020. He has since spoke in favor of reciprocal tariffs, which Trump has used extensively this year as part of a global trade war, and he also has been strongly pro-crypto.

In addition to voting on interest rates, Miran's role as governor would include financial regulation.

However, his most pressing role between confirmation and January could be as an antagonist to Powell. 

Trump has fiercely criticized the central bank chief, calling him a barrage of names, requesting his resignation and even mulling the legally questionable possibility of firing him. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the past has advocated for a shadow chair, reasoning that even if the Fed does not meet the administration's demands, Powell's positions could be counteracted by a dissenting voice on the board who would voice the White House's positions on monetary policy.

At last week's FOMC meeting, two governors — Trump appointees Waller and Michelle Bowman — dissented from the decision to hold the overnight funds rate steady. It was the first time multiple governors voted against a rates decision in more than 30 years.

President Donald Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement in the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey.

More troubling for the president, however, could be that the survey shows positive approval of only one of seven key issues, with the public holding negative views on his handling of tariffs, inflation, taxes and federal spending.

There also was a modest rise in the public's preference for the Democrats to control Congress, rising to a 49%-44% advantage from 48%-46% in April. It was the largest lead for Democrats since 2021.

At the same time, favorability of the Democratic Party among registered voters sank to a net -32 percentage points, with 24% positive and 56% negative. The -32 rating appeared to be the lowest rating for either party going back to at least 1996.

The public disapproves of the job Trump is doing as president by a 51%-46% margin, up from 51%-44% in the April survey. The change is within the survey's +/-3.1 percentage point margin of error as is the gap in his approval rating.

The president's economic approval rating remains negative with 45% approving and 53% disapproving, a modest gain from 43%-55% in April. But it's the second time in a row that his economic approval was worse than his overall approval, a reversal from his first term when the president was always stronger on the economy.

"What seemed to be keeping President Trump's overall approval level from really dropping down was the strong economy and the credit that he got from the public," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster. "He cannot rely on that at this point."

Overall, the survey of 1,000 people nationwide conducted July 29-Aug. 3 showed a series of conflicting political and economic crosscurrents, with individuals and demographic groups offering sometimes contradictory opinions.

"Trump's approval is stable, but his individual ratings are down on issue after issue, except for tariffs," said Micah Roberts, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, which conducted the poll and served as its Republican pollster. "Economic optimism is higher, but there's been no relief in this data from inflation."

For example, just 39% of independents approve of the president's handling of the economy, and that drops to 24% on inflation. Even Republicans are 9 points lower on inflation than their economic approval rating.

The president is underwater on inflation by 23 points, with 37% approving and 60% disapproving, unchanged from the last survey. The conflicts could be the result of the public simply having trouble keeping up with the breakneck changes to the economy, immigration, taxation and the political system issuing from the Trump administration.

But Republicans remain solidly behind the president and Democrats solidly against. Half of independents disapprove of the president, with 36% approving.

Roberts added that the survey is "capturing a country that's in a shifting moment across all of these issues."

Views on the economy are equally conflicting.

On the current state of the economy, attitudes have improved, with 31% saying it's excellent or good and 68% calling it just fair or poor. Those are the best numbers since the early years of the Biden administration as the nation emerged from the pandemic, and an 11-point improvement from the CNBC survey in April.

The move was driven largely by growing optimism among Republicans, with some improvement among independents. But the outlook for the economy barely budged, with 36% saying it will get better, 17% saying it will stay the same, and 46% expecting it to get worse.

Republicans became a bit less optimistic and independents somewhat less pessimistic.

Views on the stock market also improved with 46% saying it's a good time to invest and 42% saying it's a bad time. The sharp improvement to +4 percentage points from -15 percentage points has come with a surge in stocks that followed the president backing off from sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs and the passage of tax legislation.

Even 36% of those with no investments think it's a good time invest, the highest on record for a group that is typically negative on stocks.

But the survey shows some gathering areas of concern for the president on key issues.

Approval on measures taken to secure the southern border is the only one of seven that is above water with a 53% to 44% positive approval rating. The public is evenly split on deportations 49% to 49%, with sharp divides by party, age, race, gender, geography, income and education.

There are even splits within parties.

For example, 98% of MAGA Republicans, who represent 26% of the party, approve of the deportations, compared with 61% of non-MAGA Republicans. That compares with 97% of liberal Democrats disapproving of Trump's deportations and 78% of moderate Democrats.

There also is unambiguous disapproval of the president's foreign policy (-14 points), federal spending (-19 points), taxes (-13 points) and inflation (-23 points), which is unchanged from April.

In fact, 60% of the public still say their incomes are falling behind the rising cost of living, with women and those with lower incomes saying they are especially hard hit.

Tariffs could be playing a role in the inflation outlook: 49% say tariffs hurt workers compared with only 37% who say they help; 67% say they raise the cost of everyday goods. But by a 47%-37% margin, tariffs are seen helping U.S. companies who produce in the U.S.

Still, almost three-quarters of the public say foreign trade represents an economic opportunity for the U.S., rather than a threat. The public on net disapproves of the president's tariffs by a 51%-45% margin.

After weeks of relentless hype, GPT-5 is finally here.

OpenAI officially released the highly anticipated new model on Thursday. It's the latest version of ChatGPT, the company's flagship chatbot, and the most widely used AI model on the market.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a "major upgrade" and "a significant step along the path of AGI" in a conference call with journalists on Wednesday. He said that after using GPT-5, going back to GPT-4 was "miserable."

OpenAI says the model will be available for free for everyone and that users will no longer need to switch between previous models for different tasks. GPT-5 will switch automatically, the company said, depending on the kind of request and its complexity. GPT-5 will be available in standard, mini, and nano versions. Paid users will have higher usage limits.

Altman said GPT-5 was also the company's fastest model yet.

"One of the things I had been pushing the team on was like, 'Hey, we need to make it way, way faster,'" Altman said. "And I now have this experience of like, 'Are you sure you thought enough?'"

The team said GPT-5 will have improved capabilities for vibe coding, the latest craze in Silicon Valley.

OpenAI has been teasing this next iteration of ChatGPT for over a year, but has ramped up the chatter in the last few days and weeks. On Sunday, Altman shared a screenshot of GPT-5 on X, asking the model to recommend the "most thought-provoking" TV show about AI.

In July, Altman said that "GPT-5 is smarter than us in almost every way." Speaking to podcaster Theo Von, Altman said he asked GPT-5 a question he "didn't quite understand" and it "answered it perfectly," making him feel "useless relative to the AI."

The OpenAI CEO also likened GPT-5's development to the Manhattan Project, the US government's effort to build the atomic bomb during World War II, and said that it made him feel nervous.

"There are moments in the history of science, where you have a group of scientists look at their creation and just say, you know: 'What have we done?'" Altman said.

OpenAI's last notable model launch was GPT-4.5 in February, which Altman described at the time as "the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person."

The release of GPT-5 has faced several delays, with the timeline shifting from mid-2024 to mid-2025, to August.

During that time, the number of ChatGPT users has continued to grow. In April, Altman said ChatGPT had 500 million weekly active users. OpenAI said on Thursday that ChatGPT is now on track to hit 700 million weekly active users "this week."

The U.S. Department of Education is making the Free Application for Federal Student Aid available earlier than usual this year as a beta test, which experts say may address some of the bugs that have plagued previous application cycles.

The FAFSA serves as the gateway to all federal aid money for college-bound students, including federal student loans, work-study and grants.

The 2026-27 FAFSA is already available to a limited group of students in a beta test. Starting on Sept. 1, anyone can request to participate in the second phase of testing, according to an announcement from the Education Department.

All students will have access to the coming academic year's form at the beginning of October, in keeping with the typical start date.

"We're pleased to hear that Federal Student Aid has launched FAFSA beta testing sooner than expected," said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.

"An earlier and longer testing window will give the Department of Education the time it needs to address any potential bugs or errors, with valuable feedback from applicants and financial aid professionals, which should lead to a smoother process when the application is opened to the broader public," Storey said.

Kim Cook, CEO of the National College Attainment Network, said she was "pleased" that beta testing for the new FAFSA is underway and that the new FAFSA is on track to open to the public on Oct. 1.

"All these positive changes portend that the high school class of 2026 will achieve an all-time high FAFSA completion rate by the time they graduate next spring," Cook said.

For many families, financial aid is essential when it comes to covering the cost of college, which has jumped significantly in recent decades. Grants — including federal ones such as the Pell Grant — have become the most crucial kind of assistance, because they typically do not need to be repaid.

The earlier families fill out the form, the better their chances are of receiving aid, since some financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, or from programs with limited funds, experts say.

Submitting a FAFSA is one of the best predictors of whether a high school senior will go on to college, according to the National College Attainment Network, or NCAN. Seniors who complete the FAFSA are 84% more likely to enroll in college directly after high school, according to an NCAN study of 2013 data. 

Yet, only 71% of families submitted the FAFSA for the 2024-25 academic year, down from 74% in the previous academic year, according to Sallie Mae's recent How America Pays for College report. That's in part because of previous complications with the new form, which initially launched in late December 2023 after a monthslong delay.

"Families reported having an easier time completing the FAFSA last year, but 58% indicated they still needed assistance, so having a head start can be beneficial especially for first time FAFSA filers," said Rick Castellano, a spokesperson for Sallie Mae.

Amazon Web Services has agreed to provide U.S. federal agencies with up to $1 billion in discounts for cloud adoption, modernization and training through 2028, an agency overseeing government procurement announced Thursday.

The agreement is expected to speed up migration to the cloud, as well as adoption of artificial intelligence tools, the General Services Administration said.

"AWS's partnership with GSA demonstrates a shared public-private commitment to enhancing America's AI leadership," the agency said in a release.

Amazon's cloud boss, Matt Garman, hailed the agreement as a "significant milestone in the large-scale digital transformation of government services."

The discounts aggregated across federal agencies include credits to use AWS' cloud infrastructure, modernization programs and training services, as well as incentives for "direct partnership."

The GSA announced a similar deal last month with cloud rival Oracle. The agency also reached an agreement with OpenAI on Wednesday that will give federal agencies access to ChatGPT for $1 through the next year.

Duolingo shares skyrocketed more than 30% after the language-learning platform boosted its guidance due to strong user growth driven by artificial intelligence.

The mobile learning platform hiked its full-year guidance to between $1.01 billion and $1.02 billion, up from a prior range of $987 million to $996 million. Duolingo also lifted its bookings guidance to between $1.15 billion and $1.16 billion.

"We exceeded our own high expectations for bookings and revenue this quarter, and did it while expanding profitability," said co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn in a release.

Daily active users jumped 40% to nearly 48 million from about 34 million in the year-ago period.

In an effort to expand its course offerings and boost users, Duolingo has implemented AI tools, including a video-call conversation practice feature for some paying subscribers. The company has also expanded beyond language learning with a new course such as chess.

Duolingo also announced the acquisition of London-based music gaming startup NextBeat for an undisclosed amount as it looks to broaden its app products.

The company's CEO said Duolingo is still in the early stages of its growth trajectory.

Revenues jumped about 41% year over year to $252 million and beat a Wall Street estimate of $241 million. Net income grew 84% from a year ago to about $45 million, or 91 cents per share.

For the third quarter, Duolingo projects revenues between $257 million and $261 million, surpassing the $253 million forecast from Wall Street analysts.

With Thursday's moves, the stock is up more than 34% this year.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

If refineries are the oil industry's children, India's got plenty of mouths to feed — and U.S. tariff threats over Russian crude are imperiling a distinctly affordable meal ticket.

This week, U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an additional 25% of levies on New Delhi's exports to the U.S., bringing total duties to 50%, citing India's purchases of Russian oil. The White House leader flagged the issue in a CNBC interview on Tuesday: "They're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then… then I'm not going to be happy."

Despite Trump's tone, "while the U.S. is asking India to put pressure on Russia, it is following a soft approach," Mukesh Sahdev, chief oil analyst at Rystad Energy, told CNBC by email. "What we're seeing is that geopolitical pulls are going against oil fundamentals." 

After all, India's Russian purchases are neither sanctioned, nor new: New Delhi previously enjoyed the White House's blessing to access Western shipping and insurance tools for crude bought under a price cap that the G7 imposed to simultaneously avoid global supply shocks and dwindle Moscow's war coffers.

Facing international criticism, Indian officials have repeatedly defended the country's intake as a matter of national interest.

"We will buy from wherever we can. Our commitment is to the Indian consumer," Indian Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told CNBC's Dan Murphy in July, noting that back when buying seaborne Russian crude was sanctioned in G7 countries in response to the war in Ukraine, "we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please Russian oil, but within the price cap."

He added: "In effect, by buying from Russia, we will [be] helping the global economy [stabilize] prices, and therefore, we contributed to global stability in oil prices."

If India were to halt Russian crude purchases today, "global crude prices could jump to over $200 per barrel for all global consumers," a source within the Indian petroleum sector told CNBC's Emma Graham.

India, the world's No. 3 oil importer, boasts a refining capacity of around 5.2 million barrels per day — including 1.24 million barrels per day at just its Jamnagar plant — and the International Energy Agency expects the country to add another 1 million barrels per day of demand over a forecast period to 2030.

Those are some big numbers, so let's dive into the nitty gritty.

While refineries can switch their slates to maximize output of a particular oil product — think gasoline, diesel, fuel oil — many Indian plants were optimized to process high-sulfur (so-called "sour") crude, such as the supply from the nearby Persian Gulf… and Russia's Urals.

But Russia's sour crude is loaded in far-away ports in the Baltic and Black Seas, making it a less advantageous long-haul arbitrage purchase in the era preceding the war in Ukraine.

India still took the occasional Russian sour cargo — but compare the average 100,000 barrels per day it imported in 2021 to the 1.796 million barrels per day in 2025 to date, according to data and analytics provider Kpler.

The deal discounts offered by Russia, as its traditionally European client base for seaborne crude significantly diminished, made Moscow's supply virtually irresistible.

In addition, where most Middle Eastern barrels come with year-long commitments, tied to fixed regional monthly sale prices, Russian crude grades have typically been sold on a spot basis — leaving room to haggle on volume, delivery terms and price.

"Operationally, Indian refiners have adapted their systems to accommodate these grades, especially at complex facilities designed to extract high yields from medium-sour crudes," Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst for refining & modelling at Kpler, told CNBC in emailed comments. 

"Replacing Russian barrels in full is no easy feat — logistically daunting, economically painful, and geopolitically fraught," he added, noting that substitutes would squeeze refining margins and ultimately sting the bottom line.

That's bad news in Mumbai, where the Reserve Bank of India has been attempting to stave off inflation without stifling economic growth. A spike in energy costs — the likes of which greatly afflicted European nations shortly after they decoupled from seaborne Russian supplies — could burden that mission.

But the inconvenient isn't the impossible.

Two oil trading sources, who spoke to CNBC anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners have released a "flurry" of tenders to buy spot crude.

A third trading source said that, when the incentive of Russian price discounts is this attractive, India and China are unlikely to give up the supply – and that, ultimately, Chinese refiners could absorb more of the Russian intake that India no longer consumes, in turn freeing up more West African crude for Indian refinery, redirecting flows.

"It is important to note that crude from the Middle East is typically purchased on term contracts, hence there might not be much flexibility to purchase additional volumes on a prompt basis. As such, India could purchase more crude from West Africa (WAF) and South America," Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis at analytics firm Vortexa, echoed in emailed comments. "Given the escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on India, it remains to be seen whether India will import more crude from the U.S. as part of trade negotiations." 

Most U.S. crude, as it happens, is of the low-sulfur ("sweet") variety. India took about 285,000 barrels per day of U.S. oil over January-July, according to Kpler data.

We're about to see whether India finds Trump's bite any more impressive than his bark and halt intake of Moscow's crude altogether — though an OPEC+ delegate, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of talks, said a subset of eight members that recently decided on a September production hike counted potential Russian supply disruptions among the many lingering uncertainties in the oil market.

"At present, supply-side risks are likely to outweigh demand-side pressures from tariffs. The U.S. appears to be entangling itself with multiple BRICS nations simultaneously — a strategy that may prove counterproductive in delivering the market stability and clarity typically expected from Washington," Rystad's Sahdev summed up.

Trump told CNBC's "Squawk Box" over a phone conversation that the U.S. does "very little business with India because their tariffs are so high."

India's former finance secretary Subhash Garg considers a trade deal between the U.S. and India unlikely, given their differing positions on key issues. He cautioned against negotiating from a position of weakness, and said that India should reconsider its economic engagement with China instead.

Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, noted that Indian markets offer growth, and don't "really behave in the same way" as China's.

Trump announced an additional 25% tariffs on India. This brings the total levies against Indian exports to the U.S. to 50%. The fresh tariffs are slated to start later this month, while the previously announced 25% tariffs are set to take effect on Thursday.

Trump's higher duties on India follow accusations of the latter "fueling" Russia's war machine. Sources caution that calls for India to stop purchasing oil from Russia immediately could cause a spike in global crude oil prices.

Trump's fresh tariffs on India could cost its economy multibillion dollars. Investment house UBS estimates that $8 billion worth of exports from the South Asian country are most vulnerable to the higher duties, even as only 2% of goods shipped out are U.S.-bound. Other experts caution that the higher tariffs may diminish the allure of Indian exports to the U.S. relative their peers in the region.

Indian markets appeared to shrug off the 50% tariff news on Thursday.

Both the benchmark Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex index ended the day 0.1% higher at 3:30 p.m. Indian Standard Time (6 a.m. ET).

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield had ticked down to trade at 6.391%.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

The crypto market jumped Thursday on excitement that bitcoin and other digital assets could soon be coming to 401(k) retirement plans.

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) accounts to invest in alternative assets, including private equity, real estate and digital assets, CNBC has confirmed.

The price of bitcoin climbed around 1% to reclaim the $116,000 level for the first time since July 31. Ether rose almost 5%, also retaking a one-week high.

Crypto-linked stocks got a boost of energy as well. Coinbase gained 3%, Galaxy Digital advanced 6% and ether treasury stock Bitmine Immersion rose nearly 8%.

Widespread inclusion of bitcoin in Americans' retirement accounts has long been viewed as a holy grail for crypto adoption. Conceivably, it would make the cryptocurrency a mainstay of U.S. financial infrastructure, expand access and encourage longer-term investing in the asset. The retirement market is currently worth $43 trillion, almost $9 trillion of which is held in 401(k) plans. The crypto market cap is nearly $4 trillion today.

"That's a monster pool of capital. What we're seeing ... [is] the aperture of being able to buy crypto being widened and widened, [and] more avenues bringing people into the tent," Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz told CNBC's "Squawk Box" Thursday.

"When it becomes commonplace – when you can do it at the place you've already been doing business with, if its Fidelity or T. Rowe Price or whoever it is – you just pull more people into this ecosystem," he added.

Fidelity in 2022 became the first retirement plan provider to offer investors the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but the service hinges on employer adoption. Adoption since then has been low given that year's rate hike driven bear market, lingering regulatory risk from the previous administration, as well as general caution and skepticism from investors.

The executive order, first reported by Bloomberg, is the latest in a series of efforts under the Trump administration to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the world." In July, he signed stablecoin legislation known as the GENIUS Act into the first official U.S. crypto law.

Intel shares slipped Thursday after President Donald Trump called for the chipmaker's CEO to step down.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan "is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem."

Intel did not respond to a request for comment.

Tan was named as Intel CEO in March as the company tried to rebound from declining sales under the stewardship of Pat Gelsinger.

This week, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies and referenced a past criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan was CEO until 2021.

Cotton wrote to Intel's chair to "express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security."

"Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations," Cotton wrote. "Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations."

Cotton asked whether the company required Tan to divest from positions in chipmakers linked to the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and any other concerning entities in China.

Tan has invested in a number of Chinese companies, including some linked to the country's military, both directly or through venture funds, Reuters reported in April.

Intel beat revenue expectations when it reported financials for the second quarter in July, but announced several spending cuts.

In a memo, Tan announced cuts to the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and had an operating loss of $3.17 billion.

The company canceled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and consolidated testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. Tan also said Intel would slow construction of a chip factory in Ohio.

Correction: Intel beat revenue expectations when it reported financials for the second quarter. An earlier version misstated the metric.

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Thursday to allow alternative assets such as private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate into 401(k)s, according to a senior White House official.

The executive order will direct the U.S. secretary of Labor to review fiduciary guidance on private market investments in 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. The federal law sets minimum standards for most retirement plans.

Trump has an executive order signing scheduled at noon. The development was first reported by Bloomberg News.

An executive order would mark a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has pushed for greater adoption of private assets in defined contribution plans under Trump's second term in office. Thought it also brings with it new risks for investors.

Bitcoin jumped Thursday in response to the news. Private equity stocks such as Apollo Group were slightly higher on Thursday in early trading.

Private market assets have traditionally been excluded from 401(k)s, even as they've been embraced by pension funds and university endowments, because their high fees, lack of transparency and longer lockup periods make them riskier investments.

Yet, private market exposure in 401(k) plans was considered permissible in 2020, when the Department of Labor under the first Trump administration issued an information letter saying it could be appropriate for defined contribution plans under certain conditions. The guidance was later affirmed by the Biden-directed agency.

Its presence has already grown. Asset managers and plan sponsors have created products for retirement vehicles in which Americans collectively hold roughly $8.7 trillion in assets, according to data on 401(k)s at the end of the first quarter of 2025 from the Investment Company Institute.

In June, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said it's launching a 401(k) target-date fund in the first half of 2026 that will include a 5% to 20% allocation to private investments. In May, Empower, the country's second-largest retirement plan provider, said it's joining asset managers such as Apollo to start allowing private assets in some accounts later this year.

In this article

Peloton posted a surprise profit for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday and outlined its strategy to return to growth under new CEO Peter Stern. Shares gained 6% in early trading. 

The connected fitness company, known for its stationary bikes and treadmills, posted a net income of $21.6 million, compared with a loss of $30.5 million in the year-earlier period. That's thanks to better than expected sales but also, Peloton's efforts to cut its operating expenses, which Stern said in a letter to shareholders remain too high. 

In fiscal year 2026, which began in July, the company plans to reduce run-rate expenses by another $100 million, on top of the $200 million it cut in fiscal 2025. Half of those cuts will come from indirect costs, like renegotiating contracts with suppliers, but the other half will come from cutting 6% of its staff, the company said. 

"Our operating expenses remain too high, which hinders our ability to invest in our future," Stern wrote in the letter to shareholders. "We are launching a cost restructuring plan intended to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of FY26 by reducing the size of our global team, paring back indirect spend, and relocating some of our work. This is not a decision we came to lightly, as it impacts many talented team members, but we believe it is necessary for the long-term health of our business."

The latest round of layoffs comes just over a year after the company announced plans to cut 15% of its staff.

For the most recent quarter, Peloton beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the company did in its fourth fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $21.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales dropped to $607 million, down about 6% from a year earlier.

Ever since its pandemic heyday, Peloton has been working to cut costs, stabilize its business and generate free cash flow to ensure its business can survive. Eight months into Stern's tenure as Peloton's latest top executive, those efforts are starting to bear fruit. 

For the full year, the company generated $320 million in free cash flow, ahead of its own internal expectations, and its guidance implies a path to revenue growth in the back half of the year. Overall, operating expenses were down 25% in fiscal 2025, with meaningful cuts to sales and marketing as well as research and development, metrics investors and analysts have long said were too high for the size of Peloton's business.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating expenses were down 20% compared to the same quarter a year prior, led by a 28% decline in sales and marketing expenses, a 20% drop in research and development costs and a 33% decline in general and administrative costs.

Peloton has also made strides in reducing its debt, which it restructured last year to stave off an imminent liquidity crunch. In fiscal 2025, its net debt declined 43%, or by $343 million, compared to the year-earlier period, bringing net debt to $459 million when cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from its total debt of about $1.5 billion.

For Peloton's current quarter, it's expecting sales to be between $525 million and $545 million, weaker than the $560 million than analysts had forecast, according to LSEG. However, for the full year, its expecting sales of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, in line with expectations of $2.41 billion, according to LSEG. 

The current quarter is forecast to be worse than expected, largely because it falls during the summer months when people tend to pause their subscriptions and pull back on new workout gear. But the remainder of the year implies improving sales patterns in the quarters ahead. 

During the most recent quarter, Peloton sold more bikes and treadmills than Wall Street expected, posting connected fitness revenue of $198.6 million, well ahead of the $170.3 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Subscription revenue came in a bit light at $408.3 million, behind forecasts of $411 million, according to StreetAccount. 

Improving top-line metrics, which allows Peloton to better leverage its fixed costs, led to a 5.6 percentage point increase to its gross margin, which was 54.1% during the quarter, compared to 48.5% in the year ago period. 

Notably, its hardware segment, which has long been a drain on Peloton's performance, is steadily getting more profitable. Peloton's gross margin for hardware was 17.3%, a 9 percentage point increase from the year-ago period, driven by a shift toward more profitable products and decreases in service and repair, warehousing and transportation costs.

The company's subscription gross margin grew by 3.7 percentage points to 71.9% but was helped by a one-time balance sheet adjustment related to music royalties costs. Excluding that benefit, subscription gross margin would have been 69.2%.

The gains that Peloton has made in improving its profits are expected to continue, but will be hampered by new 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on products made with aluminum, as well as other duties that touch parts of the company's supply chain. The company is expecting tariffs to impact free cash flow by $65 million in the year ahead and as a result, is expecting to generate $200 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2026, below what it achieved in fiscal 2025. 

In Stern's letter to shareholders, there were no explicit plans to raise prices on subscriptions or hardware, but he said the company will rework its use of promotions and "adjust prices" to reflect its high costs. 

"For example, we will introduce optional expert assembly fees to reflect the real costs of installing our equipment, while extending free self-install to include our Tread and Row, thereby preserving Member choice and control," Stern wrote. 

Now that cash flow and some metrics are starting to stabilize, Stern is ready to talk about growth and outlined his vision to get there in his letter to shareholders. To offset the high costs of acquiring customers online, Peloton is returning to physical retail but this time, it'll open up micro-stores, rather than the sprawling showrooms it had in its early days. In fiscal 2025, it closed 24 retail showrooms, reducing its footprint of larger stores from 37 to 13 by the end of the fourth quarter.

Peloton plans to expand its micro-stores, from a count of one to 10, as well as grow its secondary marketplace for pre-owned hardware, Stern said. It also plans to increase the presence of its instructors at in-person events by three times this year, with the goal of increasing it by 10 times in fiscal 2027, he added.

Peloton also intends to expand further beyond the bike.

"We plan to support our members' wellness journey by expanding our offerings and strength where we are already a category leader, mental wellbeing, sleep, recovery, and over time, nutrition and hydration," Stern said on Thursday's earnings call. "We will employ advanced technologies like AI to enhance our ability to serve as personalized coaches."

Stern said the company will also work more closely with Precor, the fitness company it acquired under founder John Foley, by creating a "unified commercial business unit." He also said the company will start building a plan to expand internationally – a goal that Peloton has long had but has failed to execute profitably. 

"Internationally, we plan to deliver local, in-language experiences using a mix of native instruction, AI dubbing, and more flexible approaches to music for thousands of classes," Stern wrote. "Through partnerships, we aim to introduce the Peloton brand and experiences to millions of people around the world. Together, we believe these actions lay the groundwork for future, cost-effective launches of the full Peloton offering in new geographies."

Eli Lilly on Thursday said the highest dose of its daily obesity pill helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight, or roughly 27 pounds, at 72 weeks in a late-stage trial, paving the way for its entrance into the market.

The pill's weight loss was 11.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.

Shares of the company fell around 13% on Thursday. Meanwhile, shares of rival Novo Nordisk, which is also working to bring an obesity pill to the market, jumped more than 7% on Thursday.

The data comes under what some Wall Street analysts were expecting for Eli Lilly's oral GLP-1, with hopes for weight loss of around 15%. Some doctors said the results appear to be comparable to, but overall slightly lower, the level of weight loss seen with Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weekly GLP-1 injection for obesity, Wegovy.

Some doctors also made note of the number of patients on the highest dose of the pill who discontinued treatment due to side effects or any other reason in the trial.

Still, other doctors lauded the results and the potential of the pill to reach new patients, such as those who are afraid of needles. 

"This is a strong and promising result for an oral agent," said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center, calling the weight loss "a significant and clinically meaningful outcome."

"Injectables have set a high bar, but this study reinforces the potential for an oral GLP-1 to be transformative in obesity care, particularly for patients who are hesitant to start or maintain injectable therapies," he continued. 

Dr. Mihail "Misha" Zilbermint, director of Endocrine Hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said he believes the pill "has the potential to be a game changer, as long as people can tolerate the side effects."

The trial results are among the pharmaceutical industry's most closely watched studies of the year, and follow positive data in April from a phase three trial examining the experimental pill in diabetes patients. They bring Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, one step closer to potentially becoming a new, needle-free alternative without dietary restrictions in the booming market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. 

Eli Lilly is "not disappointed with these results. It's right on thesis for us," despite being "one or two points below what the Street had," CEO David Ricks told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday.

"The goal was to create an oral pill that was convenient and can be made at a huge scale, really, for the mass market, and had weight loss that was competitive with other single-acting GLP-1s, and that's what we've achieved," Ricks said. He added that the pill's percentage of weight loss is "in the range" of what most people who are overweight or want to improve their metabolic health want to achieve.

Ricks said Eli Lilly expects to submit the data to regulators by the end of the year, with hopes of launching the pill around the world "this time next year."

That launch could fundamentally shift the space, helping more patients access the treatments and alleviating the supply shortfalls of existing injections. The more convenient and easier-to-manufacture pill could also help Eli Lilly solidify its dominance in the growing segment as other drugmakers, including its main rival Novo Nordisk, race to bring weight loss pills to market. 

There are roughly 8 million patients on injectable obesity and diabetes drugs, but likely around 170 million who could benefit from the medicines, said Ken Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in an interview.

"In order to meet that demand, we're going to need other options, including oral small molecules like orforglipron, which use different means of production and also don't need as sophisticated of a supply chain to distribute it to patients," he said.

Dr. Amy Sheer, professor of medicine and program director of the Obesity Medicine Fellowship at the University of Florida, said she hopes the pill will be less expensive than existing injections, which are costly largely due to the devices they come in. She said lower prices could help eliminate barriers to access for patients, potentially making insurers more willing to cover the drug. 

Many insurers still don't cover GLP-1s for obesity. Wegovy and other drugs have list prices of roughly $1,000 before insurance. 

The highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill helped more than 59% of patients lose at least 10% of their body weight and more than 39% of patients lose at least 15% of their weight, according to the trial results. 

Almandoz said the proportion of people who achieved "greater magnitudes" of weight loss was "very impressive for an oral agent," adding that many people "often overlook the proportion of people achieving these high weight loss categories" and typically focus closely on the average weight loss

Orforglipron also helped lessen cardiovascular risk factors.

But data on how well some patients tolerated the pill in the trial came under some analysts' estimates. 

About 10.3% of patients who took the highest dose of the pill — 36 milligrams — discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared with around 2.6% of those who took a placebo. Those side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, and mild to moderate in severity. An estimated 24% of those who took the highest dose experienced vomiting, while 33.7% and 23.1% had nausea and diarrhea, respectively.

Ahead of the data, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said he expected less than 10% of patients on the highest dose of the pill to discontinue treatment due to side effects and lower rates of vomiting, nausea and diarrhea.

More patients stopped taking the pill due to side effects compared with existing GLP-1s on the market, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The discontinuation rates due to side effects in late-stage trials on Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weekly obesity injection Zepbound are around 7% or less.

She noted that almost a quarter of patients on the highest dose of the pill discontinued treatment for any reason, cautioning that the enthusiasm for orforglipron should be tempered "because we get all this excitement, and then the pill comes out, and then nobody can take it."

It's unclear why, apart from side effects, those patients discontinued the pill. Nearly 30% of those on a placebo discontinued treatment for any reason.

Eli Lilly's Ricks said the company is not concerned about those dropout rates in the study.

"What we really want to see is that the medicine dropout rate is lower than placebo, and that's what we saw here," he said, referring to the discontinuation rates for any reason.

Ricks added that Eli Lilly was looking for a less than 12% dropout rate due to side effects, noting that the industry has seen 8% to 12% rates with GLP-1 drugs.

"We're right in the middle," he said. "Continuation rates in this category, in all chronic drug categories, are not perfect. But the dropout from the drug is what we pay attention to, and here again, we're right on with the profile."

The University of Florida's Sheer said she doesn't believe the discontinuation rates or side effects will be a deciding factor for physicians when prescribing the pill. 

She believes an oral option could actually make more physicians more comfortable prescribing a GLP-1 to patients. Some physicians are currently hesitant to prescribe injections because they "may not know how to tell patients how to use them," Sheer added. 

Almandoz said prescribing decisions are going to depend on the patient's specific needs and preferences, as well as access and affordability. An injectable GLP-1 may be the preferred option for patients whose priority is a greater level of weight loss or those who have significant cardiometabolic complications, or health issues that arise from cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. 

But an oral GLP-1 could be the best fit for those who "prioritize simplicity or convenience or have these logistical challenges with injections," he said.

The detailed results from the trial will be presented in September at a European medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal. More phase three trial results on the pill will be shared later this year, including from a study on adults who have obesity or are overweight and have Type 2 diabetes.

Wegovy, Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus all work by targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to promote weight loss and regulate blood sugar. But unlike those other medications, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus does.

Eli Lilly is currently about three years ahead of other drugmakers developing pills, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Roche, Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics, Guggenheim analyst Seamus Fernandez previously CNBC.

Some analysts expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth more than $150 billion annually by the early 2030s. Oral GLP-1s could grow to be worth $50 billion of that total, Fernandez said.

India's stock market showed little sign of panic a day after the U.S. announced a 50% tariff on goods from the country and threatened secondary sanctions over its continued oil trade with Russia.

The Sensex, the benchmark index for India's blue-chip stocks, ended the day around 0.1% higher on Aug. 7.

From bureaucrats to businesses, there's a broad consensus in India that the latest escalation from the U.S. is only a pressure tactic to fast-track trade talks. However, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi now has something he didn't have, even a day earlier: the support of the Indian opposition to push back. 

Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India's largest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, described the penalty for Russian oil purchases as "economic blackmail" by Trump. 

Consequently, the Indian negotiators' resolve may only get stronger, especially in talks over areas that directly affect the country's farmers.

"India will never compromise on the interests of the country's farmers, fishermen, and livestock breeders. I know it will cost me personally, but I am ready," Modi said on Thursday morning, hours after the U.S. increased tariffs.

By most estimates, the cost of losing trade with the U.S. is significant for India but not debilitating.

The most pessimistic estimate is from Morgan Stanley. It says that if all goods are subject to a 50% duty, the impact on India's gross domestic product is likely to be 60 basis points, about $23 billion at current exchange rates.

On the other hand, the cost of allowing U.S. dairy exports into India — one of the most contentious issues— is expected to cost India 1.8 lakh crore rupees ($20 billion) alone, according to SBI Research, a unit of the country's largest bank. A little over half of that burden will hit farmers directly in the form of falling retail prices, SBI said, unless the government compensates for the loss.

The additional tariffs could also be catastrophic for India's gem and jewelry companies, a spokesperson for the industry lobby told CNBC-TV18 on Thursday, while Indian seafood exporters, who sell the bulk of their produce to the U.S., may lose nearly $3 billion a year at the 25% tariff effective today, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. 

India's labour-intensive textile industry, meanwhile, expects $5 billion worth of business to move away from India in the next few months due to the tariffs. 

High U.S. duties will also affect India's ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), according to Arvind Sanger from Geosphere Capital Management, a New York-based broker.

India's position is bolstered by the fact that over 60% of its GDP comes from domestic consumption, however. 

The Indian rupee will be the immediate casualty, according to Mahesh Patil, who oversees more than 3 lakh crore rupees ($35 billion) worth of financial assets at the Mumbai-based Aditya Birla Mutual Fund as its chief investment officer. However, Patil also noted that the rupee settling at lower levels against the U.S. dollar may offset some of the hit on Indian exporters, and the impact may be visible with a lag of a few months.

About 40% of India's entire trade with the U.S. is in services, which is not even a point of discussion so far as the U.S. exports more services to India than it imports. Trump also hasn't paid heed to the call for curbs on the H1-B visa, which is a route mostly used by Indian nationals looking to fill talent gaps — particularly in the tech sector — in the U.S. 

Amid Trump's threat of secondary sanctions on India, Modi is planning his first visit to China since 2018. And, close on the heels of U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is visiting Russia in an effort to pursue India's interests through diplomacy.

Meanwhile, India's foreign ministry has hit out at what it calls U.S. hypocrisy in ignoring its own trade with Russia that has continued through the war in Ukraine, an allegation that Trump brushed aside but didn't deny. It's also important to note that Indian companies own stakes in many Russian oil fields. 

Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, has also alleged that India uses the dollars from trade with America to pay for Russian oil, however most of India's oil trade with Russia is settled in dirhams, the currency of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), refiners have told CNBC-TV18.

India has been a lot more willing than Brazil and China to find a middle ground with the U.S.

The government has already reduced duties on imports of U.S. motorcycles, bourbon, ethernet switches, synthetic flavoring essences and fish hydrolysate, to name a few. It has also allowed Tesla to set up shop in Mumbai and withdrew the equalization levy on internet giants, widely known as the Google tax.

India has also increased its oil purchases from the U.S. by 120% in the last six months, source in the Indian government told CNBC-TV18, which was one of Trump's primary demands when Modi visited the White House in February 2025.

However, since then, Trump has moved the goalposts from just reducing the U.S.' trade deficit with India to the South Asian country's relationship with Russia. 

Trump has said India's purchases of Russian oil are why it's now facing tariffs of 50%, with this full rate due to be imposed 21 days after Trump's executive order was signed Wednesday.

Despite this, New Delhi's tone and rhetoric have been milder than the statements coming from Beijing or Rio De Janeiro, but it's also sticking to its red lines. India is keen to use the 21 days before to find a win-win situation, a government official told CNBC-TV18.

While the Indian government hasn't hinted at any escalation on its end, some experts believe that India has some legal options at its disposal.

"It is important that we talk to our trading partners and like-minded countries who have been hit by similar actions by the U.S.," Anjali Prasad, the former Indian ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said. 

"Only when we get together, decide on a strategy, will there be some action effectively possible, because there is strength in numbers."

The fact that Trump is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, meanwhile, shows that the U.S.' priority is to end Russia's war on Ukraine.

If there's a breakthrough in talks between Trump, Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, India's oil purchases from Russia might no longer be a problem.

The incentive for India to watch and wait, instead of rushing with concessions, is right there.

Business leaders are scrambling to get their head around a new era of tariff complexity.

The bemused mood among European chief executives on Thursday came as U.S. President Donald Trump sought to reshape the global trading system in America's favor.

The Trump administration slapped higher tariff rates of between 10% to 50% on dozens of trading partners just after midnight ET, following months of delays and extensions.

As of Thursday, most imports into the U.S. will now face a baseline tariff rate of 10%, although the overall tariff effective tariff rate is estimated to have climbed to more than 17%, according to the Yale Budget Lab think tank. That represents the highest level of tariffs since 1935, during the Great Depression.

Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco said on Thursday that he was "confused" by Trump's tariff announcements, according to Reuters. He reportedly added on a press call that the U.S. tariff blitz appeared to be "part of the game, to create chaos."

The Swiss insurer, which does not expect a new era of global trade rivalry to impact its business, said it was well positioned over the coming months.

"Look, what is important for business is to have clarity and to have decisions. Business adapts and adjusts itself and we are prepared to any kind of conditions in the market, as we have done in the past, but clarity is very important," Greco told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

Oliver Bate, CEO of German insurance giant Allianz, shared Greco's assessment of the tariff situation.

"If you are not confused, I don't know what confuses a human being. But we have to see through the confusion," Bate told CNBC.

"So, I can talk about being confused but our customers expect us to provide protection to them. Second, it doesn't affect us very much directly. The thing that does affect us on the accounting level is the volatility around foreign exchange and the potential volatility in financial markets," he added.

Major trading partners, such as the U.K., Japan and South Korea, have secured deals to get lower tariffs than those announced by Trump in early April. The European Union has also struck a framework agreement to lower tariffs on most EU goods to 15%.

Other countries have been hit harder by Trump's trade war. The U.S. has imposed levies of 50% on goods from Brazil, 39% on Switzerland, 35% on Canada and 25% on India.

Carsten Knobel, CEO of German consumer goods and adhesives maker Henkel, described the current market environment as "very challenging and uncertain."

"This is reflected due to the geopolitical tensions but also the trade and tariff conflicts — and also the military escalations we see in a lot of countries," Knobel told CNBC on Thursday.

Worries about a lack of trade certainty was a common thread during earnings season.

"One of the things that for us, if I look at the medium to long term outlook, is certainly a concern is the lack of certainty," Vincent Clerc, CEO of Danish shipping giant Maersk, told CNBC.

"One thing is having to deal with baseline tariffs or tariff regime that you know you can count on when you're making investment decisions or when you're making strategic decisions," Clerc said.

"What we feel from a lot of our customers is that this uncertainty is causing a delay on investments and could have an impact on global growth and global demand as people are waiting to see what is the right decision."

Maersk, widely considered a barometer for global trade, said a sustained period in which businesses can get to grips with the announced trade deals would help customers manage a new phase of globalization.

Siemens CEO Roland Busch, meanwhile, welcomed the passing of the latest tariff deadline, while making clear the development was likely to have a limited impact on the business.

"The most important point was, of course, to have certainty now, which is good. We would have wished for lower tariffs. We are clear for global trade but the impact on our Siemens business for this current fiscal year is minor," Busch said.

In this article

After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers. 

On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are "building in the United States."

As semiconductors represent an over $600 billion industry at the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight. 

However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets. 

"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,"  Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. 

"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point." 

One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption. 

The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.

Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.

If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of "continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space," Sullivan said. 

Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMC announced it would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion. 

Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix — which have both committed investments in the U.S. — were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs.

Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear. 

Speaking on CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia," on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at  Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.

For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors — only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.

While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with. 

"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?," Rasgon asked. 

The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started a national security investigation of semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector was exempted from Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs.

The vague language from the Trump administration — though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations — could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs. 

Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain. 

Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S. 

"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be," he said. 

Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Google, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans. 

According to a recent report from ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and "big data."

In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas. 

The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.

U.S. President Donald Trump's so-called "reciprocal" tariffs took effect on Thursday, imposing higher duties on many of the country's trading partners' exports to the U.S.

"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!" Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

In an earlier post Trump had said the tariffs were targeting "COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS."

Trump last week — ahead of his Aug. 1 tariffs deadline — rejigged the tariff rates and pushed back the deadline to Aug. 7.

Some of the steepest duties include Syria's 41%, and Laos and Myanmar's 40% rate, while Switzerland — after being unsuccessful in a last-minute scramble for a deal — is facing 39% tariffs.

Swiss negotiators this week travelled to Washington D.C. for talks after the country's higher rate came as a surprise to many, but so far, no deal appears to have been agreed. An update is expected from the Swiss government later on Thursday.

Separately, Brazil and India are both now facing duties of 50%. While Brazil's tariffs appear to have kicked in, India's rate is at 25% for now, and will rise to 50% later this month, according to an executive order signed Wednesday. Trump said his tariffs on India are related to its current purchases of Russian oil.

Other countries and regions, meanwhile, have been able to strike trade agreements with the U.S. This includes the European Union, Japan and South Korea — which all now face 15% tariffs — as well as the U.K., which negotiated a 10% rate.

Others, including China and Mexico, remain in limbo. China is engaged in something of a trade truce with the U.S. for now, while previously announced rates for Mexico are on pause.

Trump's latest tariff announcements — including higher duties on India and threats of 100% tariffs on chips — show "this game is not over," according to Bill Papadakis, macro strategist at Lombard Odier.

"There has been some optimism building recently because the overall level of uncertainty has come down," he told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Thursday, pointing out that several deals have been made and Trump has walked back some of his threats.

"But we shouldn't be overly optimistic either," he warned, as the impact of tariffs on economic growth and inflation is not yet clear.

Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors, noted that sharp duties like the ones faced by India and Switzerland should not come as a surprise.

"You just watch how Trump is treating neighbors, Canada, and then you can imagine all the rest. So welcome to this new world," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

Wittmann also weighed in on Switzerland, as it scrambles to lower its tariff rate.

"What should Switzerland do? Realize that we live in a world of policymakers and these other three superpowers — China, EU and the U.S., and all the rest — are in various degrees, takers," he said.

"So the only thing you can do is short-term accommodate, be flexible, be adaptive. But you know, structurally, you have to become stronger yourself and more independent."

Not only does Airbnb want to be the "everything app" — where users can book literally everything, from accommodations to experiences and services — it also wants to do the booking for you.

Brian Chesky, cofounder and CEO of Airbnb, laid out his vision for the travel app's AI-powered future during the company's second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. Airbnb beat revenue expectations for quarter two and announced a $6 billion stock buyback, but said it expected slower growth in Q3. The stock was down more than 6% after-hours.

"Over the next couple of years, I think what you're going to see is Airbnb becoming an AI-first application," Chesky said on the call with analysts.

He added that currently "almost none" of the top 50 apps in the App Store are AI apps, with the notable exception of OpenAI's ChatGPT. But he predicted that soon every one of them will be AI apps, either AI startups or pre-generative AI apps that successfully transform into "native AI" apps. That's the transformation that he says is underway at Airbnb.

Chesky said Airbnb's approach to utilizing AI has differed from some other travel companies in that they have not focused on using AI to offer travel planning and inspiration. Instead, the company has rolled out AI in customer service, with a custom agent built on 13 different models and trained on tens of thousands of conversations.

As a result of the AI customer service chatbot, he said Airbnb has reduced the number of hosts and guests who need to contact a human agent by 15%.

Chesky said the AI agent is going to become more personalized throughout the next year and that it will be able to take more actions on behalf of the user.

"It will not only tell you how to cancel your reservation, it will know which reservation you want to cancel. It can cancel it for you and it can be agentic as in it can start to search and help you plan and book your next trip," he added.

Airbnb declined to provide additional comment when reached by Business Insider.

In February, Chesky said on Airbnb's quarter four earnings call that he thought it was still too early to use AI for trip planning, but that he believed AI would eventually have a "profound impact on travel."

Chesky also said in February that he wants to make Airbnb the Amazon of travel, or a one-stop shop for "all of your traveling and living needs."

Airbnb in May announced it was relaunching its Experiences business and launching Services, which allows users to book on-site professionals like photographers or massage therapists.

On the call Wednesday, Chesky said he was "very bullish" on Experiences and that the feedback so far has been positive.

Axel Springer, Insider Inc.'s parent company, is an investor in Airbnb.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Bitcoin dominates crypto markets, but altcoins like Dogecoin, Sui, and Pudgy Penguins show rising traction amid fragmented altcoin season.

- Dogecoin ($0.21) benefits from $1.6B daily volume and social media buzz, while Sui ($3.67) gains 25% on protocol upgrades and stable growth.

- Pudgy Penguins ($0.035) expands into physical merchandise and Web3 licensing, sustaining community engagement despite token price declines.

- Altcoin season index remains below 40, but traders favor assets with fundamentals, liquidity, or unique value propositions over pure meme speculation.

Bitcoin continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market, but signs of a shift toward select altcoins are becoming evident. Dogecoin (DOGE), Sui (SUI), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are among the tokens gaining traction amid a fragmented altcoin season. These assets showcase varying strengths, from liquidity and developer support to brand-driven community engagement [1].

Dogecoin remains a focal point with a price of approximately $0.21 and daily trading volume exceeding $1.6 billion. The coin has maintained its position near summer highs, with modest gains over the past week. Despite no major technical developments in recent months, DOGE continues to benefit from consistent social media activity and speculation around potential ETF mentions. This has helped maintain its presence in short-term trading strategies. Historically, Dogecoin often sees inflows at the start of altcoin season, and this pattern appears to be emerging again as other meme tokens struggle with inconsistent volume [1].

Sui is trading near $3.67 with a 24-hour volume above $1.4 billion and a market cap of roughly $12.9 billion. The protocol has quietly rolled out integrations and upgrades targeting scalability and cross-chain functionality, which have contributed to price stability. Over the past month, SUI has gained more than 25 percent, making it an appealing option for traders looking beyond the volatility of meme tokens. Additionally, the emergence of smaller decentralized applications on the Sui network has driven usage without relying on hype or speculation [1].

Pudgy Penguins, a token tied to an NFT collection, is valued at around $0.035, with daily volume surpassing $650 million and a market cap of approximately $2.2 billion. The project has expanded beyond digital assets into physical merchandise and Web3 licensing, broadening its appeal and increasing token activity. While the token is down from its peak, it remains more active than many other NFT-linked assets. Continued social media interaction and campaign-driven product releases have sustained community interest and visibility [1].

The altcoin season index remains below 40, suggesting that most capital is still concentrated in Bitcoin. However, traders are showing renewed interest in altcoins with strong fundamentals, consistent performance, or unique value propositions. Dogecoin offers reliable liquidity, Sui presents ongoing protocol development, and Pudgy Penguins merges community-driven momentum with commercial expansion. While rotation remains limited, these tokens provide alternative entry points for traders seeking exposure outside the top two cryptocurrencies [1].

It has lasted 12 years, involving a High Court and Court of Appeal hearing, and a very public row between a computer engineer and a council - but could the Newport tip Bitcoin saga finally be coming to an end? 

James Howells, from Newport, who claimed his ex-girlfriend mistakenly threw away a hard drive containing 8,000 bitcoins in 2013, has given up on retrieving the wallet, currently worth £695m, but has been hit with a £117,000 legal bill from his fight. 

Instead of buying the site to retrieve it, he has now launched his own cryptocurrency - Ceiniog Coin - to try and regain some of his money.

Earlier this year, Newport council said it plans to close the site in the 2025-26 financial year, prompting Mr Howells to offer to buy it to retrieve the wallet. 

But the authority said he owes them just under £117,000 after his attempts to buy the landfill went to court. 

"We will not be spending any more of our officers' time on this issue until that payment is made," the council told BBC News. 

It was a move Mr Howells described as "financial coercion", to which the council refused to respond. 

Mr Howells has spent significant time and energy trying to access the site and recover the cryptocurrency, once describing it as his "9 to 5". 

But in January, Newport council asked a High Court judge to strike out Mr Howells' legal action to access the landfill or get £495m in compensation.

Judge Keyser KC said there were no "reasonable grounds" for bringing the claim and "no realistic prospect" of succeeding at a full trial.

This led Mr Howells to represent himself at the Court of Appeal in London, using artificial intelligence to support his case, but this was rejected. 

Earlier this year, the council announced that the landfill site is set to close, after which Mr Howells said he intended to buy it.

"In July, I made a multi-million pound offer to Newport City Council. I followed up with the council's legal team and the leader of the council," Mr Howells said. 

He said he did not receive a reply or an acknowledgement from the council regarding his offer. 

A spokesperson for the council said that Mr Howells "currently owes the council just short of £117,000 in legal costs, costs which we occurred defending his claim for £500m submitted last year". 

It added that the council has a duty to the taxpayer to recover this money and to ensure that council resources are "used efficiently, and that officers time is not taken up unnecessarily".

"As such, the council has responded to Mr Howells' correspondence, reiterating that he is required to pay us these costs, and that we will not be spending any more of our officers' time on this issue until that payment is made," it added. 

The council said it had not received any payment from Mr Howells and would not be commenting further. 

Responding to the council's comments, Mr Howells said it was "effectively holding the landfill sale process in an attempt to force a payment", something he described as "financial coercion".

"If they don't wish to sell the site, they should say so clearly. But this tactic of using unrelated debts to shut down a lawful offer - one that's in the public interest - raises serious questions, not just legally but morally," he added.

Speaking to BBC News on Thursday, he said he remained "open to a proper discussion" with council leaders until 17:00 BST on Friday, "after which I no longer care what they do, and will move forward with a tokenisation proposal regardless". 

The council said it would not be commenting further.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.

Bitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit.

Satoshis are named after bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto - believed to be a pseudonym – who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.

Those investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a "very small" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.

Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being "very quickly enamoured with it", Mr Bambrough said.

Prices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when "stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely".

But Mr Howells is not giving up on utilising on his Bitcoin fortune. 

He now intends to "tokenise" the full value of the wallet assets into a new Bitcoin-based smart token called Ceiniog Coin (INI), which he intends to launch later this year. 

Mr Howells will use his Bitcoin wallet value as a "store-of-value or 'vault'" providing backing for the new token. 

Josh Riddict, a cryptocurrency expert, said there are many coins in crypto ecosystems that have "value derived from some kind of asset backing or vault". 

"Since James' wallet is publicly known and the blockchain is there for all to see, its easy evidence that these 8,000 coins do indeed exist. The need to readily access them to 'prove' their existence simply isn't required.

"Ultimately the market will decide how valuable they deem this new coin offering to be," he added. 

Police ask people not to speculate following the death of one-year-old Jayla-Jean Mclaren.

Seven men are charged with violent disorder following an incident in Newport.

Residents told councillors traffic clogged rural lanes around Caynton during previous work on the A41.

Gwent Police were called after a group of men were seen fighting on Friday afternoon.

Police were alerted after a one-year-old child was taken to hospital in a serious condition.

Harashize imyaka itatu, Republika ya Demokarasi ya Congo yibuka ubwicanyi yise ubukorwa ku nyungu z'ubutunzi, yahaye izina rya "Genocost". Ukwo kwibuka kuba  kw'igenekerezo rya 2 Myandagaro buri mwaka, bakibuka amamiliyoni y'abanye Congo bishwe mu ntambara zasambuye igihugu mu myaka irenga mirongo itatu.

Uyu mwaka, uwo muhango wabereye ku mugaragaro i Kinshasa ku cibutso ca Genocost. Iyo nyubako y'icibutso irimwo amabuye y'agaciro 93, urubeya rutazima rwo kwibuka abapfuye bose, be n'ibintu bimwe bimwe vyabo. Kimwe mu ntumbero z'ico gikorwa co kwibuka ni ukwereka isi urugero rw'ubukari bw'ubwicanyi n'ubundi bugizi bwa nabi bukorwa mu gihugu cose.

Emmanuella Zandi, icegera c'umuyobozi mukuru w'Ikigega c'Igihugu kijejwe gufasha abantu bahuye n'ihohotera rifatiye ku gitsina, rishingiye ku ndyane, hamwe n'abandi bahuye n'amabi ashingiye ku kubangamira amahoro n'umutekano wa kiremwa muntu (FONAREV), yavuze ati: "Uyu musi ni uwuhambaye cane ku bashikiwe n'ivyago. Ni akaryo ko kwemera ko ayo mabi yabaye, ko hakozwe ivyaha bikomeye birenga ku mategeko mpuzamakungu yubahiriza kiremwa muntu, n'ayahungabanya agateka ka zina muntu, ndetse na jenoside."

Ku ruhande rwiwe, umukuru w'igihugu ca RD Congo yasavye inama nshingamateka gutora ingingo yemeza jenoside yabereye muri Republika ya Demokarasi ya Congo.

"Ndasaba cane inzego zishinga amategeko zompi kwihweza, vuba bishoboka, ingingo yo kwemeza ku mugaragaro icemezo kimenyesha, mw'izina ry'Igihugu, ko hakozwe ama jenoside ku butaka bwacu. Ivyo ntibizoba ari ikimenyetso gusa, ariko ni igikorwa c'ubwigenge ku kuri n'ukwibuka", niko Felix Tshisekedi avuga.

Mu gihe bamwe bariko baragerageza gusubira kwubaka ubuzima bwabo, abandi baracari mu kababaro kubera ivyo bibuka. Ivyo ni vyo vyashikiye Neno Luhundela Asani, yacitse kw'icumu ry'ayo mabi y'intambara muri Kivu y'Epfo yiganye ababaye uko vyamugendeye, ati: "Hari ku wa 28 Gitugutu 1996.

Uwundi muntu yarokotse, wo mu ntara ya Tshopo, yaracitse amaguru yompi mu ntambara y'imisi itandatu yabereye mu gisagara ca Kisangani mu 2000. Iyo ntambara yatumye ingabo z'Urwanda n'iza Uganda zirwanira ku butaka bwa RD Congo.

"Igitigiri c'amabombe yagwa cari giteye ubwoba, hanyuma igisasu kigwa munsi y'igitanda aho twari. Kandi ico gitero caramenaguye amaguru," ni ko yibuka mu mutima.

Amaguru yiwe yompi amaherezo yaraciwe n'abaganga kugira ngo ntabore ngo atere ubwandu ibindi bice vy'umubiri.

"Ku myaka icenda, ubuzima bwanje bwarasenyutse. Nakoze iki kugira ngo mbe nkwiriye ivyo? Ubuzima bwanje bwarasambutse; uno musi, ndacababazwa kubera ivyaturutse ku bantu ataco duhuriyeko. Kandi uno musi, nambara ibikoresho bisubirira ingingo bigurwa amadolari 5.000. Aya mahera azokwama ava hehe?" uko niko yibuka mu gahinda kenshi n'amarira mu maso.

Mu gihugu, hakomeza kwumvikana amajwi menshi asaba ubutungane ku bashikiwe n'ivyaha vyakozwe mu myaka 30 iheze.

Ni nk'umwe mu banyapolitike batavuga rumwe n'ubutegetsi Martin Fayulu, yatanze ubutumwa ku rubuga X (Twitter) ati: "Abagandaguriwe ababo muri Congo baracarindiriye ubutungane n'indishi, naho hari ibimenyamenya vyinshi.

Denis Mukwege yasavye ko "amamiliyoni y'abanye Congo bashikiwe n'ivyago bahabwa ubutungane."

Abaharanira uburenganzira bwa kiremwa muntu na bo nyene ntibasigaye inyuma. Ku bwa Fred Bauma, umukuru w'ikigo kijejwe ubushakashatsi ku vya politique muri Congo, ivy'uburongozi n'ubugizi bwa nabi -Ebuteli, avuga ko GENOCOST yerekana inshingano yo kutibagirwa imyaka 30 y'intambara, n'abahuye n'izo ntambara "bakirindiriye ubutungane." Asaba abategetsi kwihatira guhagarika intambara.

Ku ruhande rwiwe, umushikiranganji w'agateka ka zina muntu, Chantal Chambu Mwavita, yasavye cane ishirahamwe mpuzamakungu n'ibihugu bigize Ubumwe bwa Afirika ko hoshingwa sentare  mpuzamakungu idasanzwe yoshirirwaho RD Congo, nayo itariki ya 2 Myandagaro ikemezwa nk'umusi mpuzamakungu wahariwe  GENOCOST, asaba ko ishirahamwe mpuzamakungu ONU ryohimiriza kugirango abagiriwe ayo mabi bahozwe amarira.

Fonarev ivuga ko iriko irakora uko ishoboye kwose kugira ngo "Genocost", hamwe na jenoside yakozwe muri Congo vyemerwe n'amakungu.

Intumbero y'iryo shirahamwe ni ugushinga uburyo bwo gusubiza abo bantu bashikiwe n'ivyago agateka kabo, haba mu kubashigikira mu vy'imibereho no kubaronsa uburyo bw' amafaranga, kubashigikira mu mategeko no kubavuza.

Fonarev yatanguje ku mugaragaro igikorwa co kwegeranya intonde z'abakozweko n'ubwo bugizi bw nabi, buturutse ku ntambara be n'ivyaha bihungabanya amahoro n'umutekano.

Patrick Fata, Umuyobozi Mukuru wa Fonarev, agira ati: "Turafise abantu barenga 400.000 bamenyekanye gushika ubu, ariko tuvuga ko dufise abantu barenga miliyoni 10 bashikiwe n'ivyago. Rero murashobora kwiyumvira ubunini bw'ico gikorwa (kiturindiriye).

Haracari vyinhsi vyo gukora, ariko turiko turatera intambwe, biriko bigenda neza."

Fata ati: "Mu kwemera ku mugaragaro imibabaro y'abahuye n' ingaruka z'izo ntambara, Fonarev izoba iriko ishiraho umushinge wo gutanga indishi ziboneka, kandi izoba itanze ubutumwa bwerekeza ku gusomora ibikomere vya kera.

Ahavuye isanamu, FONAREV

Ku bwa Patrick Fata, hariho ingingo zimwe zimwe zitegerezwa kwubahirizwa hakurikijwe ivyanditswe bigenzura ivy'itsembabwoko.

"Twatanguye gutegura ikarata y'inzira biciye mu nama yo guhanahana ivyiyumviro twakoze

Binance sees sharp spike in altcoin deposits. Potential precursor to BTC rotation?



Altcoins saw a broad-based rotation in July. Despite the rally, rising exchange inflows and BTC.D stalling below 63% suggest traders may be exiting into strength.

July marked a decisive shift in crypto market structure. 

Total crypto market cap surged 13.3%, driven by Bitcoin [BTC] retesting all-time highs. But the headline move: Ethereum [ETH]-led rotation, fueled by a record 19-day streak of net inflows into spot ETH ETFs.



What followed? Despite BTC's headline rally, Bitcoin dominance [BTC.D] dropped 5.2% to 60.6%, while altcoin dominance spiked 10% to 39.2%, marking the strongest rotation since early 2021.

Zooming in on leadership dynamics, Ethereum dominance [ETH.D] spiked over 12%, reclaiming levels not seen since the “Trump pump,” with the BTC–ETH ratio widening as capital flowed down the risk curve. 

However, while Ethereum led the charge, the rotation spread broadly across the market, with altcoin dominance steadily eating into Bitcoin's share.

TOTAL3 (the market cap excluding BTC and ETH) saw a $100 billion+ influx post-BTC ATH, signaling aggressive flows into the long tail of altcoins, with traders clearly chasing momentum across outliers.

Since tapping a $1.07 trillion local top, TOTAL3 has rolled over to $980 billion, logging roughly $20 billion in outflows over the past two weeks. At the same time, BTC.D printed two strong weekly green candles.

Adding to that, a fresh CryptoQuant readout flagged a sharp spike in altcoin deposits to Binance. According to the report, the 7-day transaction count has ripped past 45k, marking the highest since late 2024.

What stands out is the timing. BTC remains just under ATH levels, yet altcoins are seeing a surge in inflows. Historically, similar spikes (March and November 2024)  preceded drawdowns across both BTC and alts.

Adding to the signal, BTC.D flipped red on the week, stalling below 63%. While it hints at altcoin rotation, the aggressive inflows suggest traders may be exiting into strength, not rotating.

In short, the market's at a key pivot.

July's rally pushed risk assets into overbought levels, with altcoins looking stretched. ETH down 3% signals momentum fading. If this stalls out further, we're likely looking at a cooldown phase before any fresh breakout.

- Heaven AMM's Solana-based ICO raised $27M in 11 hours, closing early due to an undisclosed cap despite lacking a fully developed product.

- The platform used provocative marketing and faced technical issues during the sale, with refunds planned to reduce whale allocations and adjust token valuation.

- Heaven's 100% revenue-to-buyback model and Creator Flywheels differentiate it from competitors like letsBonk, enabling automatic token burns and direct AMM pairings.

- The $LIGHT token's $27.3M market cap now surpasses major Solana DeFi platforms, though its valuation is expected to decline post-refunds amid comparisons to 2024's speculative frenzy.

Heaven Launchpad's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) concluded ahead of schedule after raising over $27 million within just 11 hours, marking one of the fastest fundraising events on the Solana blockchain [1]. The platform, known as Heaven AMM, raised funds from more than 9,000 wallets, far surpassing expectations for such a short window. The ICO was initially intended to last 48 hours but was closed early, reportedly due to hitting an undisclosed cap [1].

Despite the impressive capital inflow, Heaven has yet to publicly unveil a fully developed product. Its marketing strategy relied heavily on provocative videos criticizing the current state of Solana launchpads, along with aesthetic visuals and screenshots [1]. The team cited high traffic—over 25,000 visitors to the ICO site—exceeding the site's rate limits, which led to discrepancies between on-chain sales and front-end display [1].

The Heaven team announced that refunds would be distributed proportionally to contributors in the coming weekend to reduce the platform's native token, $LIGHT, valuation and potentially adjust the token distribution by limiting whale allocations [1]. This move reflects a strategy to align incentives between the platform and its users, a trend seen in recent Solana-based projects like letsBonk and GoFundMeme, which have returned value through token buybacks [1].

Heaven differentiates itself through its 100% revenue-to-buyback model and the implementation of Creator Flywheels, a mechanism that allows token creators to allocate protocol income for their tokens' benefit. This includes automatic token swaps and burns, permanently removing assets from circulation [1]. The platform also eliminates the need for token projects to graduate from bonding curves, allowing direct AMM pairings with minimal "virtual SOL," a mathematical placeholder representing $35 SOL [1].

The rapid success of the ICO has drawn comparisons to the speculative frenzy of early 2024, where projects like $GM, $SLERF, and $PAIN raised millions in presales with little to no product development [1]. While Heaven may be more structured in its approach, the speed of the fundraising still highlights the volatile and speculative nature of the Solana DeFi and meme economy.

The $LIGHT token currently has a circulating market cap of $27.3 million, surpassing several well-known Solana DeFi platforms, including Adrena, Bullet, and DeFiTuna [1]. However, its valuation is expected to decline after the refund process, though the exact magnitude remains uncertain.

Oops, something went wrong

Sharplink Gaming plans to raise roughly $200 million to add Ethereum to its corporate treasury, the company said Thursday in a statement.

The ETH treasury firm has entered into an agreement to sell its common stock to four institutional investors, with shares priced at $19.50 each. The offering is expected to close on August 8, if the deal's closing conditions are met.

This deal brings the online gambling marketing firm closer to its goal of holding 1% of all Ethereum in circulation.

“Sharplink is proud to be joined by globally-recognized institutional investors, augmenting our strong existing investor base and further validating our mission to be the world's leading ETH treasury,” Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom said Thursday in a statement.

Sharplink Gaming did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for additional comment.

The raise comes as a growing number of public companies pivot to corporate strategies focused on accumulating massive amounts of cryptocurrencies, following the lead of Michael Saylor's software firm Strategy. As part of that trend, several Ethereum treasury firms have emerged over the past year, catapulting Ethereum to its highest price in roughly two years.

Ethereum was recently trading at $3,812, just 22% below its record price of $4,878 that it touched during the bull run of 2021, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Sharplink held 521,939 ETH worth $1.9 billion as of August 3, according to its filings with federal regulators. The company initiated its Ethereum-accumulation strategy in June of this year.

Bitcoin ETFs Pull In $91.6M, Snapping Four-Day Outflow Streak

As the treasury firm nears 1,000 ETH in total holdings, bettors are wagering on whether the company will meet or exceed that benchmark. Fifty-five percent of bettors on Myriad Markets, an events-contract platform, have wagered that Sharplink will not accumulate at least one million ETH before mid-September.

Myriad is owned by Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.

Whether Sharplink snaps up one million ETH tokens by mid-September, it already boasts of one of the world's largest Ethereum treasuries. The largest ETH treasury firm is the Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion, which holds roughly $2.9 billion in ETH, according to publicly available data.

Since Donald Trump was reelected as president, Washington, D.C., has made many moves to become friendlier with the world of cryptocurrency. From new laws to executive orders, the Trump administration and Congress are moving quickly to make the U.S. a leader in digital assets innovation. Another example arrived on Thursday when Trump said he would sign an EO that broadens the availability of crypto and other alternative assets in retirement plans.

Is it a good thing? Some advisors, led most notably by Ric Edelman, say that investors should hold as much as 40% of their portfolio in digital assets (primarily as an update on the 60% stock-40% bond investment model). That's a big move, as just a few years ago, Edelman recommended as little as 1% in crypto like bitcoin and ethereum. Other advisors say the risks still outweigh the potential benefits.

Cryptocurrency isn't new, with a history now dating back almost two decades, but it continues to disrupt the markets. Cryptocurrency ETFs are one example, experiencing explosive growth, all the while evolving at a rapid pace in investment strategy. Crypto ETFs have seen record inflows this year, at roughly $13 billion, making them one of the most popular portfolio choices within the ETF universe, and led by flagship bitcoin ETFs such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Ethereum ETFs are growing too, with Van Eck's Ethereum ETF (ETHV) now over $200 million in assets.

ETFs offer convenience for the long-term investor as a way to gain exposure to the asset class without holding an underlying cryptocurrency and needing to open a crypto wallet or use a crypto exchange. It's like owning a gold ETF, such as GLD, rather than actually owning the metals contract. 

"From our perspective, demand is really strong, investors are really interested," said Eric Pan, CEO of ICI, the fund industry trade association, on a recent edition of CNBC's "ETF Edge."

"And we have a new regulatory environment here in Washington that is encouraging this kind of innovation," Pan added.

Bitcoin and ethereum have generated strong returns, though not without their fair share of volatility to match the gains. For example, IBIT and ETHV have generated roughly 20% and 11% in returns year-to-date, respectively. 

Both cryptocurrencies popped on the news about Trump pushing the government to make them broadly available in 401(k) plans.

July was a winning month, in particular, for ether and bitcoin ETFs, which have had $5 billion and $6 billion inflows during the month, out of a ETF industry cumulative haul of $55 billion in net new money from investors.

But within the world of retirement plans, access to crypto ETFs remains limited. Retirement plans that offer self-directed brokerage window options alongside company-sponsored 401(k)s and individual IRAs already offer investors ways to invest in crypto like bitcoin.

But as more crypto ETFs hit the market, it also ratchets up the risk for investors if they don't distinguish carefully between the options. 

One of those evolutions within crypto space has been leveraged funds, which provide double or triple exposure to individual digital currencies, such as the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), which provides double exposure to Ripple's XRP. 

Leveraged and inverse ETFs have ballooned as an asset class, offering a way for traders to make big bets on some of the market's most popular assets, like tech stocks, whether they want to bet the asset is going to increase or decrease in value on any given day. But these types of funds are not meant for the faint of heart, the risk-averse, or, most importantly, to be held as a long-term investments.

"This is an aggressive product, it's leveraged, it's not designed to be bought and held, it's designed to be traded each day," said Sal Gilberte, Teucrium Trading's president, on the recent edition of CNBC's "ETF Edge."

Similar funds, such as ProShares Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) and the Volatility Shares Trust XRP ETFs (XRPI & XRPT), rely on derivatives rather than holding XRP outright. The exposure provided via such funds comes at a lower cost than buying equivalent holdings.

While leverage funds offer the potential for big returns, double or triple the market return, they also increase the risk factor, which is why investors need to be savvy and "understand what they're owning", Gilberte said. 

Losses can multiply quickly.

If investors are looking for a steady exposure to crypto, non-leveraged crypto ETFs such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF or VanEck Ethereum ETF might be better options. 

"They should buy a fund that just holds the token, and goes up and down with the token very smoothly with no leverage whatsoever," Gilberte said.

I've been at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Annual Convention in Cleveland since August 6. I came expecting to hear about the state of our industry under Donald Trump's second presidency, especially how to navigate the administration's anti-DEI policies, which many in the Black community see as a direct attack on progress. I thought the talk would be about AI: how to use it, how to control it, and whether it was a threat to our profession.

I definitely did not expect to talk about crypto.

But there I was, walking through the Career Fair, when I saw him. A burly young man in a suit, observing the controlled chaos from a distance. He looked more like a recent graduate than a veteran, and when I approached him, it turned out I was right. His name is Jaden Baxter, he's 24, and this was his first NABJ convention. Unlike me, he wasn't a journalist; he's the Special assistant to the mayor of Cleveland, a changemaker in his community.

When I told him I cover AI and Crypto for Gizmodo, his face lit up.

“Crypto, huh?” he asked, his interest immediate and genuine. Usually, it's the AI part that grabs people's attention.

Baxter's knowledge of crypto was built on the same clichés I hear all the time: that it's a tool for criminals, a mirage, something that will disappear as quickly as it came. He had so many questions. Is it real? Is it true? Is it for people like us? Listening to him, I realized we in the media have failed. We haven't done our job of serving a community that is hungry for answers but is being left out of the conversation.

I started by explaining that the crypto industry is basically a decentralized, tech-driven version of the financial system. Imagine all the services your bank offers, but built on a technology called blockchain and without any middlemen.

In simple terms, a blockchain is like a public digital receipt book. Every transaction is a new entry that is visible to everyone, and once it's written down, it can't be erased or altered. This creates a transparent and secure system that isn't controlled by any single company or government.

“Is that true?” he exclaimed, his eyes wide. It was the first time he'd ever heard it explained that way.

Loans, payments, transfers: it's all possible. I told him that cryptocurrencies, by their nature, don't discriminate. Transactions are handled by smart contracts, which are just lines of code designed to execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Think of it like a highly advanced vending machine: you put in your money, and the code guarantees you get your product without a human needing to approve the sale. The code doesn't care about your skin color, your credit history, or where you live.

This is a massive departure from traditional banking. He couldn't believe it. I explained that for communities that face enormous barriers to financial services, crypto offers a potential alternative. The 2023 FDIC survey found that 5.6 million U.S. households have no bank account, with Black, Hispanic, and lower-income households being the most affected.

Of course, the risks are huge. The government doesn't insure your funds like it does at a bank. You're on your own. If you lose your money, no one is coming to save you. He told me this was another aspect no one in his circle ever talks about.

“People don't know that,” he said. “We don't use it, we aren't in crypto, bro.”

I mentioned that crypto adoption is highest in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, places where millions are denied access to banks and where people in the diaspora need a cheap way to send money back home.

“Wow!!! Really?” he exclaimed. “I didn't know, bro.”

I told him that crypto should, in theory, be embraced by underprivileged communities because of its transparent and non-discriminatory nature. But he, like so many others, associated it with crime. While it's true that criminals use crypto, the data tells a more nuanced story. According to the analytics firm Chainalysis, illicit transactions made up a tiny fraction of total crypto volume in recent years. I explained that the President of the United States, his family, and many of the world's wealthiest people and corporations, like Tesla, hold Bitcoin in their portfolios.

He was stunned.

He asked about Bitcoin, which for him, was synonymous with the entire industry. When I told him the price was now around $120,000, he was fascinated.

“Wow!!! The people who bought it at that time must be multi-millionaires,” he said, a sense of wonder in his voice. He said if he had been better informed as a young adult, he would have bought some. I explained that the most important question to ask before buying any cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin, Ether, or Solana, is: What is the project behind it? What problem does it solve?

“But do you think it'll last?” he asked.

I told him the U-turn in the United States under the second Trump administration changed everything. After years of regulatory hostility, the administration has embraced crypto, legitimizing the industry within the world's most powerful financial system. There will be bumps ahead, but there's no going back.

Then I asked him if he'd heard of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. He hadn't. I explained how they could revolutionize money transfers, making them nearly instant and incredibly cheap.

“Wow, bro,” he said again. “Is this for real? People like us are always late to the party.”

I tried to tell him it wasn't too late, but he was stuck on a thought. He explained that there's a cliché that Black people in crypto must be engaged in criminal activity. He started to wonder aloud if reducing the entire industry to its worst actors wasn't a deliberate way to exclude people like him from an opportunity to build wealth.

“We are always the last people,” Baxter said, a look of disgust on his face. “We miss all the trains to get rich.”

He was disgusted that his community had missed the boat on an industry that could, in principle, solve some of the very problems of discrimination they face every day. And I was left wondering how many other Jadens are out there: curious, ambitious, and waiting for a conversation that no one seems willing to have with them.

Moonbirds are back. The once maligned project that still ranks in the top 10 for all-time trade volume at 356,000 ETH has skyrocketed back up the NFT charts to 2.36 ETH, quadrupling its floor price in the past month. 

But it's definitely spent some time in the wilderness due to multiple ownership changes, directionless plans and waning community sentiment. The NFT project had one of the most highly anticipated mints ever in April 2022, and with prices once again soaring and momentum building, much of the renewed optimism centers around one name: Spencer.

Known simply as Spencer on X, the new owner of Moonbirds is no stranger to NFTs — he's a prolific collector and head of “Spencer Ventures,” an institutional-grade NFT fund.

“I bought my first Bored Ape at like 2.8 ETH. I was on Clubhouse and heard people making monkey sounds and was like, ‘What is this?'” Spencer says. At the time, Spencer was writing venture checks, and he came to an unusual but very profitable conclusion.

“Seed stage companies have a 95%+ failure rate. A bunch of people making ape sounds in a Clubhouse room can't possibly have a higher failure rate than that. That single bet ended up outperforming all of my venture investments by a pretty wide margin.”

Spencer is optimistic about “Birbs” being able to fly once more and playing a pivotal part in a larger comeback of the NFT space.

“There wasn't a lot of attention, especially net new attention in the NFT space for quite a while. But I always believed the most important thing to build toward in a bear market is being top of mind for that friend who stayed plugged in. The one you call to find out what's next and who should I join. In my mind, that was always the Moonbirds customer,” Spencer says. 

With the recent run up of NFTs led by collections such as CryptoPunks and Moonbirds, Spencer's arrival could be the beginning of a turnaround to rival the Pudgy Penguins 2.0 success story. 

If you've spent any time on NFT Twitter, chances are you've come across Spencer, one of the most active voices in the space. He comes from the class of 2021 and says it's possible no one has traded more NFTs in the world than he has.

“I run a liquid NFT trading fund. I parlayed the success of my personal NFT trading into a fund. We're one of the most active and successful funds in the broader crypto space. At peak, we did about 5% of market volume on Blur. I would make the argument no one who has traded more NFTs than me and my team. We've done a lot of NFT trading. You name it, we've traded it.”

It's a reflection of how immersed he's been in the market's every twist and turn. Arguably, his company's most famous trade was becoming one of, if not the, largest holder of Pudgy Penguins, scooping up 3AC's liquidated stash during the tumultuous back half of 2022.

“We bought a lot of Pudgy's during the FTX collapse, and I've been a really big proponent of that company and collection for quite a while. I've been watching really closely and working really closely with that team. It's been awesome,” Spencer says.

Spencer is also the co-founder of Orange Cap Games, the studio behind Vibes, a physical and digital trading card game built around the Pudgy Penguins IP. In just eight months, Vibes did $1.5 million in sales, with partnerships spanning eBay, PSA and CGC.

That success laid the groundwork for his interest in Moonbirds. “The team we've built is incredibly good at taking IP and bringing it to life. At some point, it makes sense to have our own IP,” he says.

“NFTs build a sentimental attachment. I've made money trading memecoins, too, but it's not the same. Everyone who's stuck around is nostalgic for the era of trading NFTs.”

As Moonbirds continue their fast run up in price and enthusiasm for the project's future, many are wondering: Is Spencer going to pull off a Luca Netz?

The comparison isn't a lazy one, given Spencer's closeness with the Pudgy Penguins CEO and team.

You should ‘go and build' your own AI agent: Jesse Pollak, X Hall of Flame

Who takes gold in the crypto and blockchain Olympics?

Netz, the magnetic CEO of Pudgy Penguins, flipped a flailing project into one of Web3's most notable brands. From physical toys in Walmart to viral content to having its mascot, Pengu, ring the opening bell for the Nasdaq on Wall Street, the cultural relevance of Pudgy Penguins is undeniable. Now, Spencer has his sights set on following a similar playbook.

“When NFTs first happened in 2021-22, you either traded the market or you founded a project. Luca was the first founder who had been on the other side of it. Because he had been a trader that then became a founder. That is really why he won I think — against a lot of other people over that period of time — was because he had this perspective that nobody else had,” Spencer says.

Where the Luca Netz comparison really lands is Spencer's unapologetic commitment to action over aspiration. In his first 51 days, Spencer has dropped a custom Moonbirds-themed Pokémon-style card for holders, secured an airdrop through a project backed by a16z and Coinbase Ventures, launched a new X presence for Mythics, negotiated OpenSea branding changes and brought visibility roaring back to the brand.

“We make no promises. We're big ‘show first' people. People shouldn't have to say, ‘I think they'll deliver.' They should say, ‘Look at what's been delivered.'”

“We've also made a couple of key hires and begun a couple partnerships, some of which I can't share. I think you can look at what was a really strong first 51 days right. I don't know what the next 51 days are going to look like, but if it's like the first 51, I think we're in really good shape.”

Moonbirds was once the envy of the NFT world, peaking at the height of last cycle's NFT collective euphoria with a floor price of just under 40 ETH shortly after mint. “It's just a collection people want to see win,” Spencer says.

And if the Luca Netz playbook for Pudgy Penguins is anything to go by, they just might.

Lofty expectation, the end of a historic run up in NFT interest and a former leader in Kevin Rose who seemed to be looking for a way out over a sustained period left Moonbirds holders disillusioned. Spencer has a pretty simple philosophy for rebuilding trust in the brand. 

“Our general view is we're moving forward, we're not looking backwards. Some people want to go on this journey with us and some people don't. Either is fine,” says Spencer. 

“It's very understandable if you feel burned, maybe there's some new liquidity and you just want to get out. Congratulations. I'm so glad we were able to give you a way to step away. That's fine to me. I don't need to win that person back.”

Instead, his focus is on two key groups: the believers and the newcomers. 

“There are some people that really want to see it come back, and those people I want to activate. I'm most excited about someone who remembers how cool Moonbirds were in 2022 but never owned one. Now they finally have the opportunity to collect. That's who I want to build for.”

This is how to make — and lose — a fortune with NFTs

The blockchain projects making renewable energy a reality

When did you collect your first NFT?

Early 2021. 

Your favorite NFT in your wallet?

It's got to be my Moonbird. 

Were you into collectibles before NFTs? 

Massively. Prior to NFTs, a lot of my net worth is on trading cards. It still is today. Trading cards is a very large part of my personal portfolio.

Your favorite artist in the NFT space?

I mean, I'm a big fan of Clare, our art director.But when it comes to other artists, I do really like Gremplin. I really like CrypToads. That's a big, big one that I like.From the art side of things, I think Nick Kuder is really interesting. One of the earliest generative artists. Actually, the Ringer collection is a stolen set of code from the Rings Genesis by Nick Kuder. It's a fun little side thing that not a lot of people know, so I do like Nick Kuder's Rings Genesis collection.

With the initial Moonbirds mint, how many birds did you have in your wallet within the first 24 hours?None. My collecting of Moonbirds also happened post FTX. I'm one of these people who saw the disgusting face melting run that Moonbirds went on with just nothing but utter jealousy and, you know, admittedly some amount of contempt.

I was like, ‘Why am I not holding such a thing?' And really, it was mostly jealousy. I wished I had. I am that marginal consumer who missed the run originally and now has the resources to do it.

Your favorite Moonbird trait?

Oh man, it's like picking children. The cop out answer here is cosmic. It's cheating because that's my PFP, but I'll go with cosmic.

Are Mythics underrated in your mind? 

Yes. The sheer quality of art of the Mythics is something that really sold me on it. I think bar none that if all that mattered in NFTs was how something looked, Mythics would probably be the top collection in the world. It's great, and I feel very strongly about that.

There's a lot of people in the world that have just never looked through the Mythics collection. And if you do, it's really hard not to buy one. The team has launched a new dedicated X account @MythicBirbs. 

What's your advice to someone just discovering NFTs today?Just collect what you like. That's the first beginning of the journey. I wouldn't enter the space purely as a trader. I think that if you enter the space as a trader and collector, you're better having a rule for that if you don't like it, don't buy it. I think that's what you have to do. You should fundamentally be collecting NFTs that you like, and if you're not doing that, you're doing it wrong.

Who are your top three favorite follows for NFTs on Crypto Twitter?

If you want to see interesting different opinions, I'd say the following: 

1. Seedphrase is really good and an interesting follow. He's a lot more analytical.

2. I actually think people might see this one as a controversial one, but I think Wizard of SoHo generally is a better trader than most people will admit that he is, so I like Wizard.

3. I also think OSF and Mando. I'm going to loop them together, but the two of them are actually some of the best traders in the space.

Where do you see Moonbirds this time in 12 months?As I said, the first 51 days, I think we've done a pretty good job. If we can continue streaks of 51 days that are as productive, then at the end of this, we should be in a good spot.

 The European Banking Authority completed draft rules requiring banks to assign a 1,250% risk weight to unbacked cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. 

The European Banking Authority (EBA) has finalized draft rules requiring banks to hold significantly more capital against so-called “unbacked” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether.

In its final draft of regulatory technical standards released on Tuesday, the EBA said the rules aim to “address implementation aspects and will ensure harmonisation of the capital requirements on crypto-asset exposures by institutions across the EU.” The framework applies to European Union-based banks holding crypto assets on their balance sheets.

Once the final draft goes to the European Commission, Brussels will have up to three months to decide whether to endorse it as is or with amendments, or send it back for redrafting. After endorsement, the bill would become a delegated regulation and be forwarded to the European Parliament and the Council, with a three-month objection window extendable to six months.

According to the accompanying documentation, digital assets in group 2 (a and b) are subject to “a general 1,250%” risk weight. Group 2b refers to “other” crypto assets, including unbacked ones such as Bitcoin (BTC). Group 2a refers to a subcategory of the same assets that meet the Bank for International Settlements' hedging and netting criteria.

Group 1 b refers to so-called asset-referenced tokens tied to traditional financial instruments. This group is subject to a 250% risk weight.

Those risk weights were introduced as part of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR III) and took effect in July 2024. 

The latest EBA draft adds the technical elements needed to calculate and aggregate crypto exposures, such as credit-risk, market-risk and counterparty-risk modeling. It also introduces strict separation between assets, meaning Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) cannot be offset against each other.

If neither the European Parliament nor the Council objects, the draft will come into effect within 20 days of its publication in the Official Journal of the EU. 

The rules are expected to directly affect European banks already holding crypto on their balance sheets. Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo, which bought 1 million euros worth of Bitcoin in January, would need to hold 12.5 million euros in capital against that position under the draft framework.

Fintech firm Revolut is unlikely to be affected by the change. The bank's crypto services are off-balance-sheet and managed by its non-banking arm, Revolut Digital Assets Europe Ltd.

The EBA's stance contrasts sharply with the broader direction of global regulators moving toward embracing crypto within existing financial frameworks.

In late March, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stated in a letter that institutions under its oversight, including banks, can now engage in crypto-related activities without prior approval.

In April, Switzerland passed amendments to its DLT Act, enabling banks to custody tokenized securities and offer guarantees for stablecoin issuers under a clear legal framework.

Recent reports also suggest US President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order directing banking regulators to investigate claims of debanking made by the cryptocurrency sector and conservatives. 

The US banking sector is already taking notice, with JPMorgan Chase reportedly exploring crypto-backed loans, signaling a potential shift in how US banks view crypto assets. 

The new EU capital rules could limit bank participation in the growing digital asset market, especially as decentralized finance and tokenization continue to expand into mainstream financial services.

Oops, something went wrong

Major cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks were rallying early Thursday ahead of President Trump's expected signing of an executive order that would allow alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and private equity into the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose more than 2% near 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, while ether (ETH-USD) and XRP (XRP-USD) were both up more than 4%. Shares of Coinbase (COIN), the biggest publicly traded crypto exchange, were up as much as 3%. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) shares each rose more than 1.5%.

President Trump's executive order, expected to be signed around 12:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to Reuters, will direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the use of alternative assets in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts.

The order would mark a major shift in retirement investments, opening up the traditionally staid industry to more speculative and sometimes illiquid investments. Typically, most 401(k) participants are offered a mix of stock or bond funds or index products in which to invest.

Large-scale alternative assets firms, including BlackRock and KKR, have expressed support for the move, which would open up the multitrillion-dollar retirement account industry to a broader mix of the funds these firms manage.

"Private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns," BlackRock chairman Larry Fink wrote in his latest annual investor letter.

"We need to make it clear: Private assets are legal in retirement accounts. They're beneficial. And they're becoming increasingly transparent."

The executive order builds on recent crypto momentum in Washington coming off Congress's "Crypto Week" in July, where the two chambers worked to get the Clarity, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC Acts past their respective votes.

The GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Trump on July 18, establishes a regulatory framework for the use of stablecoins like Tether.

The Clarity Act, which seeks to define regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to block the Federal Reserve from establishing central bank cryptocurrencies, have both passed in the House of Representatives and are now awaiting votes in the Senate.

Ripple is buying Rail, a stablecoin payments platform, for $200 million, the firm said on Thursday.

The deal is likely to close in the fourth quarter of this year, the statement said. Rail is a Toronto-based payments platform backed by Galaxy Ventures and Accomplice.

The Rail acquisition is a way for Ripple to delve deeper into the fast-growing stablecoin ecosystem after launching its RLUSD stablecoin in December last year. 

RLUSD has a market cap of over $600 million, placing it in the top largest stablecoins, according to data tracked by CoinMarketCap.

Ripple previously had offered to buy Circle (CRCL) for $4 billion-$5 billion, but that stablecoin giant ended up going public several weeks back. It's since delivered amazing returns for its IPO investors.

Ripple acquired multi-asset prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion in April, with plans to expand its clearing and finance operations, to the end of creating the world's largest non-bank prime broker. 

Now the acquisition of Rail will allow Ripple to deliver a more comprehensive stabecoin payments service, the company said in Thursday's announcement. Rail's capabilities include virtual accounts and automated back-office systems, enabling customers to transact in digital assets without the need to open dedicated crypto bank accounts or wallets on exchanges. 

"Stablecoins are quickly becoming a cornerstone of modern finance, and with Rail, we are uniquely positioned to drive the next phase of innovation and adoption of stablecoins and blockchain in global payments,” said Monica Long, Ripple President.

The deal was first reported by Reuters.

 The White House Press Office confirmed to Cointelegraph that President Trump will sign an executive order allowing crypto exposure in US 401(k) retirement plans. 

US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order opening the door for cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement plans, potentially reshaping how Americans invest their savings.

The White House Press Office confirmed to Cointelegraph on Thursday that the order directs the US Labor Department to reevaluate restrictions around alternative assets in defined-contribution plans, including digital assets, private equity and real estate. 

A senior White House official said the order instructs the labor secretary to clarify the department's stance on alternative assets and provide guidance on fiduciary processes for offering these types of investments in retirement portfolios.

Once implemented, the order will grant Americans access to digital assets through their 401(k) plans, part of a $12.5 trillion retirement market and a sought-after opportunity for crypto firms aiming to reach more retail investors. 

The move would be a significant step forward for the crypto industry, which has long sought broader retail exposure and financial system legitimacy.

Despite institutional investors increasing crypto allocations, everyday savers have been restricted due to fiduciary risk, regulatory uncertainty and volatility concerns. 

The White House official said that Trump's directive would call for inter-agency coordination with the Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explore rule changes that may support the adoption of alternative investments like crypto in retirement products.

On July 18, the Financial Times cited anonymous sources saying that the president was eyeing alternative investments like crypto assets for 401(k) retirement plans.

In a previous statement to Cointelegraph, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that nothing should be deemed official unless it comes from Trump. 

Desai said Trump is committed to restoring prosperity to everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself,” Desai said. 

During a Bloomberg interview, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said education on the risks associated with crypto as an investment was crucial. 

Atkins said disclosure was key and that people should be made aware of what they are getting into. He added that he's looking forward to what the president will do. 

Earlier this year, the Labor Department rescinded an earlier guidance for crypto in 401(k) plans. On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering crypto for 401(k) retirement plans.

Ant Group affiliate aims to promote blockchain technology for the tokenisation of real-world assets, executive says

Ant Digital Technologies, an affiliate of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, is promoting its blockchain platform for asset tokenisation in Hong Kong, a week after the city's stablecoin law came into effect.

Ant is positioning itself as a “portal” that connects Web2 and Web3, “providing more credible assets to Web3 and more compliant capital to Web2”, Bian Zhuoqun, vice-president of Ant Group and president of blockchain business at Ant Digital, said at an event in Hong Kong on Thursday.

Ant Digital in April announced Jovay, a “completely self-developed” Layer 2 public blockchain that does not issue cryptocurrencies, Bian said. Jovay was specifically built for RWA transactions in overseas markets, Ant Digital said in a blog post then.

What's the hype about stablecoins?

The company planned to officially launch Jovay in September, at which point it would be able to run “real money”, Bian added.

Can DeFi lending systems support institutional-grade credit markets? Pharos, a Layer 1 blockchain focused on Real-World Asset Finance (RWAfi), are integrating Morpho's lending infrastructure natively into its mainnet, marking a strategic step toward building credit rails for both institutional and decentralized participants in DeFi lending market.

  

The collaboration is aimed at bringing modular, transparent lending systems to real-world assets on-chain. With Morpho's lending protocol currently securing over $9 billion in deposits, the integration brings a familiar name in DeFi into the RWA conversation.

  

Pharos is not the first Layer 1 to focus on real-world assets, but the platform's emphasis on building modular systems with institutional compatibility gives this collaboration a different weight. The integration brings isolated risk lending and credit modeling directly into the Pharos mainnet architecture.

  

Wish Wu, CTO and Co-Founder of Pharos, framed the collaboration as foundational.

  

“For us, working together with Morpho is about building trust and composability at the core of RWAfi,” Wu said. “By integrating Morpho's lending infrastructure directly into our mainnet, we're laying the foundation for a more transparent and capital-efficient on-chain credit ecosystem.”

  

The lending rails will support a wide range of use cases including tokenized treasuries, private credit, and yield strategies designed for both retail and institutional participants.

  

Morpho is currently one of the most widely trusted DeFi lending protocols, known for building capital-efficient lending systems with isolated risks and modular design. Their infrastructure is already used for various crypto-backed loans and custom yield products.

  

Kirk Hutchison, who leads new chain growth at Morpho, sees the collaboration as a way to extend those lending frameworks into newer territories.

  

“Deploying natively on Pharos allows us to keep extending Morpho's most trusted lending infrastructure to the real-world asset space following initial success like private credit and tokenized stocks,” Hutchison said.

  

Morpho's involvement also strengthens Pharos' broader RWAfi strategy, which includes partners such as Ant Digital and Gauntlet, and focuses on formal verification, custody solutions, and risk calibration.

  

RWAfi, short for Real-World Asset Finance, refers to financial systems that bring real-world assets, such as credit, invoices, real estate, or tokenized equity, onto public blockchains. These systems aim to improve transparency, automation, and capital efficiency while reducing dependence on opaque intermediaries.

  

However, integrating real-world assets into DeFi requires more than tokenization. It also requires robust infrastructure for pricing, credit modeling, liquidity routing, and risk segregation. That is where Morpho's lending framework becomes relevant.

  

By deploying on Pharos, Morpho's infrastructure can provide tools for asset originators to spin up lending markets with isolated risk exposure, composable underwriting models, and automated collateral management. It also allows institutional lenders to allocate capital using transparent, programmable logic rather than relying on opaque term sheets.

  

One of the challenges in scaling real-world asset markets on-chain is the lack of infrastructure that satisfies both institutional and DeFi-native requirements. This integration attempts to address both.

  

Pharos' upcoming vault products, powered by Morpho, are expected to include structured lending strategies and capital deployment frameworks. The architecture is designed to be composable, which means it can integrate with other tools and systems across the Pharos ecosystem. That modularity is critical for experimenting with new forms of yield structures and underwriting logic.

  

Retail users will benefit from more accessible yield opportunities that are backed by real-world cash flows rather than purely crypto-native assets. On the other side, institutional participants get a sandbox for programmable credit with auditability and composability.

  

The launch of yet another RWA protocol is not newsworthy in itself. What makes this collaboration worth watching is the infrastructure-first approach. Too many RWA projects have focused on tokenizing assets without rethinking the credit, compliance, or custody infrastructure that needs to support them.

  

Morpho's decision to deploy natively on Pharos suggests that both teams are aligned on building from the bottom up. Credit markets need to be transparent, programmable, and modular—qualities that have often been missing from past RWA efforts. If the collaboration delivers, it could offer a test case for how on-chain lending should work when assets are tied to real-world value.

The revived Salomon Brothers announced on Thursday that it has completed the process of inserting OP_Return notices to bitcoin BTC$116,488.12 wallets assumed to have been abandoned.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, the New York-based investment bank are sending the notices to prevent "rogue states and criminal organizations with significant resources" from potentially accessing these wallets in future.

The process itself has created a wealth of debate, with speculation suggesting the Salomon Brothers have ties to people like Craig Wright.

"[They] are using Bitcoin's own infrastructure as a bulletin board," David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol, told CoinDesk. "It's very clever. And they're going big, targeting some infamous wallets like the "1Feex" address, which holds around 80,000 BTC."

According to the Salomon Brothers website, assets left untouched for 14 years may be considered legally abandoned under a "Doctrine of Abandonment,” thus leaving the front door open in terms of repossession.

The method of gaining access to those wallets remains unclear, Carvalho told CoinDesk that the bitcoin community "isn't doing what needs to be done" to prevent methods like Quantum hacking.

"The draft BIP proposals are entirely inadequate, and achieving consensus on a hard fork will take so long that it will be too late. Considering 6.51 million bitcoin worth of $700 billion is at stake, it's staggering how slow the Bitcoin community is moving," he added.

The Salomon Brothers said that its client, who remains anonymous, plans to allocate a portion of the recovered bitcoin to a fund intended for wallet owners who lost their keys, details of which will be released over the coming months.

The notices sent to wallet holders give a 90 day deadline, within which they can "claim ownership" of the wallets by sending a transaction or filling out a form on the Salomon Brothers website. 

The press release notes that "some owners responded to the notices by moving their digital assets to new wallets."

Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

                            Is China finally ready to launch a stablecoin? | Credit: China Photos/Getty Images                        


Key Takeaways

After years of promoting its central bank digital currency (CBDC), China is quietly changing course.

The e-CNY, once touted as the future of digital payments in the country, has lost momentum.

This is due in part to slow adoption and a recent corruption scandal involving its key architect. Now, officials are warming up to a more flexible alternative: stablecoins.

The change comes amid growing concern in China over the dominance of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC, which continue to expand in global trade and cross-border payments.

Hong Kong has taken the lead on the regulatory front.

In early August, new legislation came into effect  allowing licensed entities to issue stablecoins backed by fiat currencies—including potentially the Chinese yuan.

However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) isn't rushing to approve.

Officials said only a “handful” of licenses would be issued to start, and strict controls would be established around reserves and legal compliance.

The goal is to start small with business-to-business use cases, keeping capital outflows in check while testing the waters for broader adoption.

While Beijing hesitates, major Chinese firms are pushing ahead.

JD.com has already piloted a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin and plans to launch it officially later this year.

The token, issued on a public blockchain, will be integrated into JD's payments infrastructure in Hong Kong and Macau.

Ant Group is also preparing to apply for stablecoin licenses in both Hong Kong and Singapore, signaling a broader push to internationalize the yuan via blockchain rails.

Both companies argue that offshore yuan stablecoins are crucial for boosting the renminbi's role in global trade and reducing reliance on dollar-based tokens.

Meanwhile, the digital yuan's credibility has taken a hit.

Yao Qian, the former lead architect of China's CBDC, was recently expelled from the Communist Party and is under investigation for taking bribes—allegedly even in crypto.

Yao was once the face of China's blockchain ambitions, advocating for the e-CNY and decentralized finance more broadly.

With him gone and adoption stagnant, the pivot toward stablecoins feels less like a side project, and more like Plan B.

Stablecoins are already reshaping global finance.

The market is worth $247 billion and could surpass $2 trillion by 2028.

More than 99% of circulating stablecoins  are pegged to the U.S. dollar, giving Washington a major soft power advantage.

In contrast, the yuan's share of global payments is just 2.9%.

China's exporters are increasingly opting for dollar stablecoins like USDT to bypass controls and settle international transactions quickly.

Even Chinese regulators now acknowledge that the country needs to offer an alternative or risk falling behind entirely.

State-owned enterprises have reportedly expressed interest  in using RMB stablecoins for cross-border trade, but capital controls and compliance concerns remain a major obstacle.

Stablecoins may offer China a more market-friendly way to expand the use of the renminbi abroad, but it's walking a tightrope.

Officials want to innovate without losing oversight. That means progress will likely remain slow and closely supervised.

Still, the fact that China is even considering this shift marks a significant change—and could signal a new phase in the global currency race.

For investors watching Cathie Wood's next big play, BitMine could be a unique opportunity in the growing Ethereum treasury market.

Based in Las Vegas, BitMine Immersion Technologies is a tiny crypto firm that has suddenly grabbed headlines. The company started as a Bitcoin (BTCUSD) miner and focuses on the accumulation of crypto for long-term investment using mining and capital raises to build its holdings.

In mid-2025, BitMine announced a major pivot: a $250 million private stock placement at $4.50 per share to finance an “Ethereum treasury strategy.” Management says the proceeds will be used to buy Ethereum and make ETH the company's primary treasury reserve asset.

Following the announcement, BitMine's stock went on a meteoric run. In early July, shares briefly spiked over 3,000%, touching $161 at the peak as investors embraced the company's bold Ethereum treasury pivot. Despite the rapid rise and sharp swings, the stock remains up roughly 385% year to date, underscoring the speculative buzz surrounding BitMine's dramatic strategy shift.

Valuation wise, BMNR's looks expensive at the moment. The price-sales ratio is 40.5x, considerably higher than the sector median of 3x, indicating a very expensive stock compared to its peers.

In a recent move, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest has been aggressively buying BitMine stock. Over several trading days in late July and early August, ARK funds accumulated hundreds of thousands of BMNR shares. CoinDesk reports that ARK's Innovation and Next Gen Internet ETFs (ARKW) bought about 477,498 shares on July 30 alone, following 529,366 the day before, and then about 540,712 more shares on July 31, roughly $15 million to $17 million each day.

Bitmines' financial performance has been mixed lately. In its latest quarter, BitMine's revenue was roughly $2.05 million, mostly from mining and equipment sales, up 68% year-over-year. Gross margins are thin and expenses are high, driven by depreciation, compensation, and operational costs. The net loss per share was $0.31 per share.

As of early August, BitMine's treasury held 833,000 ETH, valued above $2.9 billion. The company said this officially made it the largest Ethereum treasury in th world.

BitMine recently received a “Strong Buy” rating from the sole Wall Street analyst tracked by Barchart. The analyst has set a mean price target of $60, suggesting the stock could potentially gain 60% from its current level.

Although ARK's interest has drawn attention to this stock, and Wood's firm is known for both big winners and high-risk plays, it doesn't change the fundamentals. BitMine remains a very small company with limited revenue. Its balance sheet is dominated by crypto holdings, which fluctuate in value with Ethereum and Bitcoin prices, and it continues to report ongoing mining expenses.

Overall, it's a risky bet for me, but those with a higher risk appetite might welcome a chance to bet on this one.

MILAN – Uncertainties weighing on the world economy and the global geopolitical picture had a significant impact on the coffee market in July, pushing prices down, with double-digit declines for all indicators, and keeping volatility high, shows the monthly report of the ICO, released yesterday, Wednesday, Aug. 6. The monthly average of the ICO Composite Indicator Price (I-CIP) fell 12.1% last month to 259.31 cents: the lowest level since last October.

The daily average fluctuated between a low of 252.46 cents, on July 11, and a high of 269.57 cents five days later on July 16. The sharpest declines were recorded on the Robusta front.

In fact, the average Robusta indicator lost 14.8% plunging to 167.19 cents, the lowest level since November 2023. The London indicator plummeted (-16.3%) also reflecting the substantial replenishment of ICE Robusta's certified stocks (see below).

On the Arabica side, the average indicators for Colombian Milds, Other Milds, and Brazilian Naturals fell by 10.5%, 10.4%, and 12.3%, respectively.

Similarly, New York was down 12.3%. Volatility has increased slightly further to 10.2%, peaking at 16.6% for the London indicator.

The report attributes the sharp downward trend of the past month to a number of factors, summarised as follows:

World exports of all forms of coffee for the month of June were up by 7.3% to a total of 11.689 million bags. Arabica exports remained relatively stable (-0.7%) at 7.077 million, with the significant decrease in Brazilian Naturals (-19.5%) being almost entirely counterbalanced by an increase in Colombian Milds (+18.5%) and Other Milds (+16%). Robusta exports rebounded strongly to 4.612 million (+22.4%).

As a result, world coffee exports for the first nine months of the 2024/25 coffee year (October–June) are roughly on par with those of the equivalent period of 2023/24 (-0.2%), standing at 104.141 million. A slight increase in Arabica volumes (+0.2%) was matched by a slight decline in Robusta shipments (-0.7%). Within the Arabica category, the decrease in Brazilian Naturals (-5.6%) was fully offset by increases in Colombian Milds (15.9%) and Other Milds (2.4%).

ICO maintains its estimate of world production and consumption unchanged at 178 and 177 million bags respectively, forecasting a slight production surplus after two years of deficits.

 Welcome to the GCC Research column's "Tragedy of the Crypto Commons" series.

 In this series, we'll focus on critical public goods in the crypto world that are increasingly failing to meet norms. These are the fundamental infrastructure of the entire ecosystem, but they often face challenges such as insufficient incentives, unbalanced governance, and even increasing centralization. The ideals of crypto technology and the reality of redundancy and stability are facing severe tests in these corners.

 This issue focuses on one of the most influential applications in the Ethereum ecosystem: Polymarket and its data indexing tool. This year, Polymarket has repeatedly been at the center of public opinion, particularly with events surrounding Trump's election victory, oracle manipulation in Ukraine's rare earth trade, and political betting on the color of Zelenskyy's suit. The sheer scale of capital and market influence it carries make these controversies particularly challenging.

 However, is data indexing, a key building block of this product, a product that represents a "decentralized prediction market," truly decentralized? Why have public infrastructure like The Graph failed to fulfill their intended role? What form should a truly usable and sustainable data indexing public good take?

 In July 2024, Goldsky experienced a six-hour outage (Goldsky is a real-time blockchain data infrastructure platform for Web3 developers, providing indexing, subgraph and streaming data services to help quickly build data-driven decentralized applications), which paralyzed a large part of the Ethereum ecosystem. For example, the DeFi front-end was unable to display users' positions and balance data, and the prediction market Polymarket was unable to display correct data. Countless projects seemed to be completely unusable to front-end users.

 This shouldn't happen in the world of decentralized applications. After all, wasn't blockchain technology designed to eliminate single points of failure? The Goldsky incident exposed a disturbing truth: while blockchains themselves are as decentralized as possible, the infrastructure used by applications built on them often includes a large number of centralized services.

 The reason for this is that blockchain data indexing and retrieval are non-exclusive, non-rivalrous digital public goods. Users often expect them to be free or extremely low-cost, but these services require continuous and intensive investment in hardware, storage, bandwidth, and operations personnel. In the absence of a sustainable profit model, a winner-takes-all centralized structure emerges: once a service provider gains a first-mover advantage in speed and capital, developers tend to direct all query traffic to that service, thus re-creating a single point of dependency. Public welfare projects like Gitcoin have repeatedly emphasized that "open source infrastructure can create billions of dollars in value, but authors often can't rely on it to pay their mortgages."

 This serves as a stark reminder that the decentralized world urgently needs to diversify Web3 infrastructure through public goods funding, redistribution, or community-driven initiatives. Otherwise, centralization will inevitably arise. We urge DApp developers to build local-first products and the technical community to consider data retrieval service failures when designing DApps, ensuring that users can still interact with projects even without data retrieval infrastructure.

 To understand why incidents like Goldsky occur, we need to delve deeper into the workings of DApps behind the scenes. To the average user, a DApp typically consists of just two parts: the on-chain contract and the front-end. Most users are accustomed to using tools like Etherscan to track on-chain transaction status, obtain necessary information on the front-end, and initiate transactions and interact with contracts. But where does this data displayed on the user's front-end actually come from?

 Suppose you are building a lending protocol that needs to display a user's holdings, as well as the margin and debt status of each position. A naive idea is for the front-end to read this data directly from the chain. However, in practice, the lending protocol contract does not allow the user address to query position data. The contract provides a function to query the specific data of the position using the position ID. So if we want to display the user's position status on the front-end, we need to retrieve all the positions in the current system and then find which positions belong to the current user. This is like asking someone to manually search millions of pages of ledgers for specific information - technically feasible, but extremely slow and inefficient. In fact, it is difficult for the front-end to complete this retrieval process. Even if the retrieval task of large DeFi projects is performed directly on the server by local nodes, it often takes hours.

 Therefore, we must introduce infrastructure to accelerate data acquisition. Companies like Goldsky provide these data indexing services. The following diagram illustrates the types of data indexing services can provide to applications. 



 At this point, some readers may be curious about the existence of a decentralized data retrieval platform called TheGraph within the Ethereum ecosystem. What is the connection between this platform and Goldsky? And why do a large number of DeFi projects use Goldsky as their data provider instead of the more decentralized TheGraph?

 To answer the above questions, we need to understand some technical concepts first.



 Some readers here may be curious why there are multiple operators in SubGraph?

 This is because the SubGraph framework actually only stipulates how data is read from and written to the database within the block.

 There is no implementation for how data flows into the SubGraph program and what kind of database the final output results are written to. These contents need to be implemented by the SubGraph operator himself.

 Generally speaking, SubGraph operators will make node modifications to achieve faster speeds. Different operators (such as TheGraph, Goldsky) have different strategies and technical solutions.

 TheGraph currently uses the Firehouse technology solution. After the introduction of this technology solution, TheGraph can achieve faster data retrieval than before. However, Goldsky has not openly disclosed the core program running its SubGraph.

 As mentioned above, TheGraph is a decentralized data retrieval platform. Taking the Uniswap v3 subgraph as an example, we can see that there are a large number of operators providing data retrieval for Uniswap v3. Therefore, we can also regard TheGraph as an integration platform for SubGraph operators. Users can send their own SubGraph code to TheGraph, and then there are some operators inside TheGraph that can help users retrieve data.

 For centralized platforms like Goldsky, Goldsky has a simple billing system based on resource usage. This is the most common SaaS billing method on the internet, and most technical personnel are familiar with it. The figure below shows Goldsky's price calculator: 



 TheGraph has a completely different fee structure than conventional billing. This fee structure is related to the token economics of GRT. The following figure shows the overall token economics of GRT: 



 TheGraph's per-query fees:

 Register an API KEY in the TheGraph backend and use the API KEY to request data retrieved by operators in TheGraph. These requests are charged based on the number of requests. Developers need to deposit a portion of GRT tokens in the platform in advance as the cost of API requests.

 TheGraph's Signal staking fees:

 For SubGraph deployers, they need the help of operators within the TheGraph platform to retrieve data. According to the profit distribution method mentioned above, they need to tell other participants that my query service is better and can get more money. They need to stake GRT, which is similar to advertising and guaranteeing themselves that there will be profits, so that people will come.

 During testing, developers can deploy SubGraph to the TheGraph platform for free. TheGraph will then assist users with some searches, providing a free quota for testing purposes. This quota is not suitable for production use. If developers believe SubGraph performs well within TheGraph's official testing environment, they can publish it to the public network and wait for other operators to participate in the search. Developers cannot directly pay a single operator for guaranteed search access; instead, multiple operators compete to provide services, avoiding a single point of dependency. This process requires using GRT tokens to perform curation (also known as signaling) on their SubGraph. This involves developers staking a certain amount of GRT into their deployed SubGraph. Operators will only participate in the SubGraph search process when the staked GRT reaches a certain level (previously consulted data is 10,000 GRT).

 For most project developers, using TheGraph is a relatively cumbersome process. While purchasing GRT tokens is relatively easy for Web3 projects, the process of curating deployed SubGraphs and waiting for operators is quite inefficient. This process presents at least two problems:

 Obviously, for most developers, it is simpler to directly choose Goldsky. The billing method is understandable to everyone, and as long as the payment is made, it can be used almost immediately, and the uncertainty is greatly reduced. This has also led to the situation of relying on a single product in blockchain data indexing and retrieval services.

 Clearly, TheGraph's complex GRT token economics have hindered widespread adoption. While token economics can be complex, these complexities shouldn't be exposed to users. For example, GRT's curation and staking mechanisms shouldn't be exposed to users. A better approach would be to simply provide users with a simplified payment page.

 The above disparagement of TheGraph is not my personal opinion. Paul Razvan Berg, a well-known smart contract engineer and founder of the Sablier project, also expressed this view in a tweet. The tweet mentioned that the user experience of launching SubGraph and GRT billing was extremely poor.

 As for how to solve the single point of failure in data retrieval, we have actually mentioned it above. That is, developers can consider using TheGraph service, but the process will be more complicated. Developers need to buy GRT tokens for staking curation and paying API fees.

 Currently, there are a lot of data retrieval software in the EVM ecosystem. For details, you can refer to The State of EVM Indexing written by Dune or the summary of EVM data retrieval software written by rindexer. For another more recent discussion, please refer to this tweet.

 This article will not discuss the specific cause of Glodsky's issues. Glodsky currently knows the cause, but is only disclosing it to enterprise users. This means that no third party can currently determine the exact nature of Glodsky's failure. Based on the report, it can be inferred that there may have been an issue writing retrieved data to the database. In this brief report, Glodsky mentioned that the database was inaccessible and that access was only restored after working with AWS.

 In this section, we mainly introduce other solutions:

 Why do I recommend using ponder instead of other software? The specific reasons include the following:

 Of course, there are some issues. Ponder is still under rapid development, and developers may encounter situations where previous projects become inoperable due to breaking updates. Since this article isn't a technical introduction, we won't delve into the details of Ponder's development. Readers with a technical background are encouraged to consult the documentation.

 A more interesting detail about Ponder is that it has also begun partial commercialization, but Ponder's commercialization path is very consistent with the "isolation theory" discussed in the previous article.

 Here, we briefly introduce the "segregation theory." We argue that the public nature of public goods allows them to serve an unlimited number of users. Therefore, charging for public goods will cause some users to stop using them, and social benefits will not be maximized (this is described in economic terms as "no longer Pareto optimal"). In theory, public goods can be priced differently for each user, but the costs of differential pricing are likely to outweigh the benefits. Therefore, the reason public goods are free is not that they are inherently free, but rather that any fixed fee will harm social benefits, and there is currently no cheap way to implement differentiated pricing for each user. Segregation theory proposes a method for pricing within public goods: by isolating a homogeneous group of people and imposing a fee on them. While segregation theory does not prevent everyone from enjoying public goods for free, it does suggest a way to impose a fee on a subset of people.

 Ponder uses a method similar to isolation theory:

 This is clearly an application of the "isolation theory" principle: developers who are unwilling to operate and maintain the Ponder service themselves are isolated, and these developers can obtain simplified Ponder deployment services for a fee. Of course, the emergence of the Marble platform has not prevented other developers from using the Ponder framework for free and self-hosting deployment.

 The audience for ponder and Goldsky?

 Both have risks. As the recent Goldsky incident suggests, developers are advised to maintain their own ponder services to mitigate potential third-party service outages. Furthermore, when using ponder, the validity of RPC return data should be considered. Safe recently reported a crash of a search engine due to incorrect RPC return data. While there's no direct evidence linking the Goldsky incident to invalid RPC return data, I suspect Goldsky may have encountered a similar issue.

 Local-first has been a hot topic for the past few years. Simply put, local-first requires software to have the following features:

 Currently, most discussions related to local-first technologies often touch upon CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type). CRDT is a conflict-free data format that allows users to automatically resolve conflicts and maintain data integrity when operating on multiple devices. A simple way to think of CRDT is to view it as a data type with a simple consensus protocol. In a distributed environment, CRDT can guarantee data integrity and consistency.

 However, in blockchain development, we can relax the aforementioned software requirements for local-first. We only require that users maintain a minimum level of usability on the frontend even without the backend indexing data provided by the project developer. Furthermore, the local-first requirement for cross-client collaboration is already addressed by blockchain.

 In the context of DApps, the local-first concept can be implemented as follows:

 This local-first DApp design philosophy significantly improves application resiliency, preventing unavailability in the event of a data retrieval service crash. Regardless of usability, the best local-first applications require users to run a local node and then retrieve data locally using tools like trueblocks. For more discussion on decentralized or local retrieval, see the post "Literally no one cares about decentralized frontends and indexers."

 The six-hour Goldsky outage sounded a wake-up call for the ecosystem. While blockchains inherently offer decentralization and resistance to single points of failure, the application ecosystems built on them remain highly dependent on centralized infrastructure services. This reliance poses systemic risks to the entire ecosystem.

 This article briefly explains why TheGraph, a long-standing decentralized search service, is not widely used today, specifically discussing the complexities introduced by the GRT token economics. Finally, this article discusses how to build a more robust data search infrastructure. I encourage developers to use the Ponder self-hosted data search framework as an emergency response option and also outline a promising path to commercialization for Ponder. Finally, this article discusses the local-first development philosophy, encouraging developers to build applications that can function even without a data search service.

 At present, many Web3 developers are aware of the single point of failure problem of data retrieval services. GCC hopes that more developers will pay attention to this infrastructure and try to build decentralized data retrieval services or design a framework that allows DApp front-ends to still run without data retrieval services.

- BlockSack, a Base-based Layer 2 meme coin, combines humor with utility via staking, NFTs, and gaming, distinguishing itself from hype-driven meme coins.

- The project's 2025 presale allocated 40% of 690M BSACK tokens to early investors, with 25% reserved for liquidity, supporting long-term ecosystem growth.

- Leveraging Base's low fees and Coinbase support, BlockSack offers day-one utility through tools like SackMarket (NSFW NFT marketplace) and on-chain earning mechanisms.

- Rapid community growth on X and Telegram, plus a roadmap including CEX listing and PayFi solutions, positions BlockSack as a leading 2025 meme-based crypto innovation.

BlockSack is generating significant buzz in the crypto space as a Layer 2 meme coin launched on the Base blockchain. Following a strong presale in 2025, the project has positioned itself as a unique blend of humor and utility, combining cultural appeal with tangible features such as staking, NFTs, and gaming. This approach differentiates it from traditional meme coins that rely heavily on hype without offering functional infrastructure [1].

The project's branding centers around “Sacktoshi,” a satirical reinterpretation of Satoshi Nakamoto, which has helped to establish a distinct identity within the crypto-native and meme enthusiast communities. Beyond its cultural narrative, BlockSack provides real-world applications, including access to NSFW NFTs and the Sackaverse, a gaming platform powered by the native BSACK token. The introduction of a staking mechanism allows users to earn rewards while contributing to the ecosystem's growth, adding a layer of functionality that enhances the token's utility [1].

A key factor in BlockSack's rising profile is its launch on the Base blockchain. This Layer 2 network offers fast transaction speeds, low gas fees, and robust support from Coinbase, making it an ideal environment for scalable and efficient decentralized projects. BlockSack's launch is notable for being “utility-ready” from day one, with tools like a trading bot, NFT creation tools, and its own NSFW NFT marketplace, SackMarket. The platform also enables users to earn BSACK tokens through on-chain activities such as copy trading and meme competitions, further enhancing engagement and token utility [1].

BlockSack's tokenomics are structured to support long-term stability and growth. Of the total 690 million BSACK tokens, 40% were allocated to the presale, 25% to liquidity, and the remainder to staking, marketing, and team incentives. This distribution model is designed to reward early supporters while maintaining liquidity and ecosystem development. The project has also seen rapid community growth across platforms like X (Twitter), Telegram, and meme forums, driven by contests, giveaways, and other community-driven activities [1].

Looking ahead, the roadmap outlines key milestones including staking reward expansions, a potential CEX listing, new gaming features, and the development of a PayFi solution. These steps are intended to increase token usage and strengthen user value, reinforcing the project's credibility in the competitive meme coin space. Analysts and investors are closely watching how BlockSack executes its vision, particularly in the context of the 2025 crypto presale wave [1].

As a Layer 2 meme coin, BlockSack is well-positioned to capture both attention and adoption in 2025. By combining meme culture with real crypto infrastructure, it represents a rare hybrid project that balances entertainment with function. With a clear plan, active development, and a growing community, BlockSack has emerged as a top contender in the next wave of meme-based crypto innovation [1].

In its July 2025 crypto monthly recap report, global investment management firm VanEck suggested that Ethereum (ETH) could emerge as a superior store of value compared to Bitcoin (BTC). The report pointed to ETH's lower inflation rate in recent months relative to BTC, alongside its growing utility within decentralized finance (DeFi).

In recent years, a growing number of companies have diversified their treasuries by allocating capital to digital assets – most notably Bitcoin. However, emerging trends show that corporations are also beginning to accumulate Ethereum, recognizing its potential as both a yield-generating and deflationary asset.

VanEck's report emphasizes that while Bitcoin's finite supply and predictable issuance policies make it a strong candidate for a store of value, Ethereum provides greater financial flexibility. In particular, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, collect network revenue, and participate in DeFi protocols to generate additional yield.

The report also highlights key differences in the monetary policies of both networks. Ethereum's initial issuance rate at launch was 14.4%, compared to Bitcoin's 9.3%. However, two major policy changes have since dramatically reduced ETH's inflation rate – bringing it below Bitcoin's.

The first was Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), implemented in August 2021, which introduced a mechanism to “burn” a portion of transaction fees. This effectively created deflationary pressure during periods of high network activity, reducing the total supply of ETH.

The second transformative event was “The Merge” in September 2022, when Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This change drastically reduced issuance – from approximately 13,000 ETH/day to around 1,700 ETH/day – by eliminating the need to pay miners.

Following these changes, ETH's inflation rate fell below Bitcoin's for the first time in March 2023. Since then, ETH's supply has grown by only 0.2%, compared to Bitcoin's 3%. The report states:

Total supply of ETH fell between October 7th, 2022, and April 4th, 2024, moving from ~120.6M on to a low of ~120.1M on, achieving an annualized (-0.25%) inflation rate over the period. Since that time, ETH burn has been reduced due to the increase in Ethereum transaction throughput, and the network has accrued (+0.5%) in additional supply. Regardless, over that same period, BTC supply has increased (+1.1%).

Over the past month, several companies have unveiled Ethereum-focused treasury strategies. For instance, cryptocurrency firm Bit Digital recently crossed 120,000 ETH in total holdings. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies revealed that its ETH holdings had surged past 833,000 tokens, making it the largest known corporate holder of the digital asset. At press time, ETH trades at $3,643, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours.

Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has publicly responded to comments made by Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, who recently questioned the origins, direction, and integrity of Ripple's projects—including the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the XRP token, and Ripple's newly announced stablecoin RLUSD.

During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple's past had “all the makings” of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger.

Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. “I'm available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.” He wrote.

Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which “sets the record straight” and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information.

The validator, Vet (@Vet_X0), strongly rejected Caitlin Long's characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently.

Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise.

This counters Long's claim that XRP's origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers.

Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger.

Vet said Long's comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code.

Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can't update the network unaided.

Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn't trusting in its infrastructure.

XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn't a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems.

According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum's involvement merely complements—not replaces—the network's capabilities.

Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL's long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts.

Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

Our Nearest Sunlike Star Might Have a Planet, JWST Shows in Stunning Finding

In some of its most ambitious work yet, the James Webb Space Telescope looked to spot a planet in a potentially habitable orbit around Alpha Centauri A, the nearest sunlike star to our solar system

By Meghan Bartels edited by Lee Billings

This artist's concept shows what a gas giant orbiting Alpha Centauri A could look like.

Astronomers have found nearly 6,000 exoplanets orbiting other stars. But for every confirmed detection, there are countless mere hints, inconclusive observations that could just as well be blips of cosmic noise or glitches in a telescope. Most are too tenuous to take seriously, but every so often, one of these candidate planets is so tantalizing and potentially transformative that it can't be ignore.

That's certainly the case for one recently spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) around a sunlike star called Alpha Centauri A, part of the nearest star system to Earth. If the finding were confirmed to represent a planet—and not instead a clump of dust or some instrumental aberration—it would be a gas giant, akin to a warmer version of our own Saturn. It would orbit within Alpha Centauri A's habitable zone, the starlight-bathed region where liquid water can persist on a planet's surface. But the world itself would likely be lifeless, smothered beneath thick layers of gas. Any accompanying moons, however, could have better chances for harboring oceans—and perhaps even life.

Announced on August 7 and described in two preprint papers that have been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, the candidate and its possibilities call to mind worlds from science fiction, such as the jungle moon of Pandora in James Cameron's Avatar films—which, incidentally, orbits a gas giant called Polyphemos around, yes, Alpha Centauri A. But there's still a chance that the real-world JWST discovery will prove to be a mirage.

“If it's real, it's amazing,” says Elisabeth Matthews, an exoplanet-focused astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “It's a really exciting candidate—quite an intriguing candidate,” she says. “The authors work hard to make a case for why this, frankly, small and faint blob of light is believable, but I think there are still some open questions that need to be answered to really be 100 percent sure.”

The finding has been nearly a decade in the making, says Charles Beichman, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology and a co-author of the two new papers. In 2017, nearly half a decade before JWST would launch, he sent an e-mail to scientists positing that the telescope's giant 6.5-meter mirror, paired with its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), might be able to see planets orbiting Alpha Centauri A. “When you stop laughing, let's think about doing this project,” Beichman told them.

It was a bold suggestion, particularly when JWST was still on the ground, he admits. The telescope “was never really meant to look at a star that's this bright, moving this fast and located, as Alpha Centauri is, right in the middle of the galactic plane, where there's thousands of stars,” Beichman says.

Despite those obstacles, the appeal was irresistible. Alpha Centauri A is about the same size and age as our sun. And the star and its two companions, the slightly smaller Alpha Centauri B and the tiny red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, comprise the nearest stellar system to our own—just about four and a half light-years away. Because the Alpha Centauri system is spitting distance from us, astronomically speaking, it's a bright, perennially popular target for scientists who may not be able to conduct similar observations on dimmer, more distant stars.

This is especially true for direct imaging, the technical term for when astronomers actually manage to take an exoplanet's picture. Most exoplanetary discoveries instead arise through far more indirect means, such as the dip in a star's light caused by a world passing between its sun and our telescope or the tiny wobbling of a star caused by an orbiting planet's gravitational tug. Only in rare cases can astronomers truly see an alien world; typically a planet needs to be very big and bright—as well as rather far from its sun—to offer any hope for astronomers to glimpse it against the overwhelming glare of its star.

But because Alpha Centauri A is cosmically close, Beichman and his colleagues thought that they could use JWST's stunning power to accomplish the feat even for a planet that orbits relatively close to the star, within just a few times the distance between Earth and our sun. “Alpha Centauri just lets us cheat because it's closer than everybody else,” Beichman says.

Although proximity makes for easier studies, this is counterbalanced against the system's vexing complexity. Alpha Centauri A is the brightest star of the three in the system, but its stellar companion Alpha Centauri B is still quite bright—and quite close, crowding into telescopes' field of view. Although JWST is equipped with a coronagraph—a masking tool to block out the glare from one star—it can't do much to curtail this second, planet-obscuring source of light.

Three views of the Alpha Centauri star system. The first two images show the star system as seen by the Digitized Sky Survey (left) and by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (middle). The third image shows August 2024 data from the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), in which light from Alpha Centauri A is blocked out to reveal the candidate planet (S1) identified by astronomers in newly released research.

Science: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, DSS, A. Sanghi (Caltech), C. Beichman (JPL), D. Mawet (Caltech); Image Processing: J. DePasquale (STScI)

For Aniket Sanghi, a Ph.D. student in astrophysics at Caltech and a co-author of the two new papers, that difficulty only made the task more alluring. “I was looking for the next challenging object to work on, and Alpha Centauri A turned out to be one of the most challenging objects,” Sanghi says.

Faced with the brightness of not one but two stars overpowering JWST's exoplanet-hunting optics, the researchers turned to a surprising strategy: enlisting yet another star. They found a particularly nondescript star that they could use as a stand-in. By observing this other star centered on and blocked by the coronagraph and then off-center and unmasked, the researchers were able to model how its light flowed through JWST's optics. This created a template by which Alpha Centauri B's light could then be subtracted out from the precious images of Alpha Centauri A.

And when the researchers tackled the feat in August 2024, they found exactly what they hoped for: a faint blob of light nestled near the blocked-out Alpha Centauri A. “As a direct imager, you're always confounded by artifacts,” Sanghi says. “You're very skeptical of anything you see. But this one just popped out so clearly.”

Sanghi and his colleagues tried to undermine their own data, striving to explain how the blob could be stray light within JWST's optics or a background object in the sky, but nothing quite stuck.

Then they incorporated more data by performing two more JWST surveys of Alpha Centauri A in February and April  2025, neither of which spotted a sign of the would-be planet. They also reexamined a puzzling 2019 observation of Alpha Centauri A from a ground-based telescope that, while constituting the first hint of a directly imaged planet there, never quite solidified into a confirmed world.

If all that sounds counterintuitive, it should: two nondetections and two inconclusive ones do not a planetary discovery make. But the researchers found that by piecing together the four observations, a single, plausible world could emerge: a cool, Saturn-mass planet looping around the star every 1.5 to 2.5 Earth years on an elongated, elliptical orbit.

The 2019 and 2024 observations caught the planet next to the star, the hypothesis goes, while the 2025 ones were unlucky enough to miss the planet while it was out of sight, in front of or behind the star.

Without a more conclusive sighting, it's far too soon to declare a new planet, but experts who were not involved with the new research say it's still both an enormously exciting planet candidate and an extraordinarily ambitious observation to attempt with JWST.

“All data, whether it's a detection or not, tells you something,” says Emily Rickman, a European Space Agency astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md., which operates JWST. “Even if this ultimately is a nondetection and [the planet candidate] is something else, I think it's a really important paper in understanding the true capabilities that JWST's MIRI can push to. And I think that's just as important.”

But for now, everyone just wants more data. Beichman and Sanghi say that if the 2019 and 2024 observations do indeed represent the same object, JWST will have another good opportunity to spot it in August 2026. The researchers hope to win time on the observatory to make the attempt.

And NASA's next astrophysical observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, is ready to launch late next year and poised to mimic JWST's observations of Alpha Centauri A. Roman is a pipsqueak compared with JWST, with a much smaller starlight-gathering mirror, but it also includes a far more sophisticated coronagraph that was custom-built to tease out the presence of large exoplanets around some nearby stars.

In the meantime, researchers are left with quite an intriguing picture of a would-be planet orbiting a star of almost the same size and age as our sun.

“Our solar system is a very quiescent, nicely structured system,” says Jason Wang, an astronomer at Northwestern University, who works on direct imaging. “There's all the small planets closer in, all the big planets further out; we're almost all on circular orbits—it's very nice and peaceful.”

But if the hypothesized candidate planet is genuine, Alpha Centauri A hasn't had a similar history—not with a gas giant world running ramshackle through the star's habitable zone.

“Giant planets are the big movers and shakers of the planetary system, so if you have an eccentric giant planet, that doesn't bode well for the survival of terrestrial planets,” Wang says. A planet like the one the researchers propose should have scattered any promising terrestrial worlds out and away from Alpha Centauri A's habitable zone. But, just maybe, the gas giant could possess moons, some of which, in principle, could be warm enough to sustain liquid water.

However the mystery of these observations pans out, JWST's glimpse of our next-door solar system is worth celebrating, Matthews says. “Even just the boldness of going after this target and all of the work they've done to make observations that are possible at this system is really cool,” she adds.

On 7 August 1975, Nature published a paper that has had some of the greatest impacts on science and health care in modern times. The study, by biochemists Georges Köhler and César Milstein, described a method for creating lab-made copies of antibodies — called monoclonal antibodies1. Antibodies produced by the immune system are specific to single, unique antigens — these are the molecules generated by viruses, bacteria and other foreign agents that invade the body and try to overpower its defences. Monoclonal antibodies can be produced in huge quantities and can be designed to recognize any target. They have become the workhorse for research laboratories. In the clinic, they are used to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases2, allergy3 and cancer4.

At least 212 antibody drugs have benefited tens of millions of people so far, write Andrew Chan, Greg Martyn and Paul Carter, researchers at Genentech in San Francisco, California, in an article in Nature Reviews Immunology on the past, present and future of antibody treatments5. The global market for monoclonal antibodies, worth around US$250 billion in 2024, is projected to double in value within five years (see go.nature.com/4muxakf).

Fifty years of monoclonals: the past, present and future of antibody therapeutics

Köhler and Milstein's paper was the culmination of a worldwide effort to understand antibodies: their origin, structure, mechanism and role in the body's immune system. This all happened without the complex organization and funding of today's scientific consortia: at the time, large funders, notably the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the US National Cancer Institute, had a more hands-off role than they do now. This story shows that it is possible to establish a multibillion-dollar industry purely by letting scientists communicate their research, exchange information and share materials.

By the time Milstein arrived in the early 1960s at the MRC's Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) — then the world's leading centre for studies of DNA structures — in Cambridge, UK, scientists had made progress in understanding antibodies' basic structure. But they didn't know how this class of proteins could target specific antigens.

Following up on biologist Joshua Lederberg's theory that somatic mutations — changes in DNA not inherited from parents — underlie antibody diversity6, Milstein and fellow biochemist Sydney Brenner proposed a mechanism for restricting these mutations to specific gene regions7. As interest in this idea grew, so did the need to find ways to grow antibody-producing cells in the lab. Several groups succeeded in this step, which in turn allowed Milstein and his collaborators to investigate their theory experimentally in myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells that are crucial to the immune response. It was hard work, not least because somatic mutations occur rarely. “The difficulty was that no one knew which specific antigens the myeloma cells bound to,” explains medical historian Lara Marks, who curated an exhibition on monoclonal antibodies for the MRC on the invention's 40th anniversary.

Milstein and Köhler solved this problem by immunizing mice with a particular antigen and taking healthy B cells from the animals' spleens. This, they predicted, would trigger the production of an antibody specific to that antigen. The antibody-producing B cell was then fused with a mouse myeloma cell, creating a hybrid called a hybridoma. Using this technique, they were able to produce essentially limitless quantities of antibodies with known specificity.

Milstein's lab received many requests for cell lines, which were dispatched to researchers all around the world, at little or no cost. This enabled other groups to replicate and build on the invention, creating the current industry. Some policymakers were concerned that the LMB and MRC were too slow to think about intellectual property. In retrospect, it's an unfair criticism. The modern biotech industry was in its nascent phase and it would be several years before the United States (and United Kingdom) would allow universities to patent scientific knowledge from government-funded research. The many groups involved in the breakthrough were mainly looking to answer a fundamental scientific question and did so according to the research community's practices at the time.

The colossal industry that has grown around monoclonal antibodies continues to expand, and scientists are now looking to answer new questions, such as how to deploy artificial-intelligence technologies to design antibodies with drug-like properties — a task that is more complicated than using such tools to predict protein structures.

The story of monoclonal antibodies illustrates how an industry that changed health care was born through a scientific ‘relay race'. Fifty years later, the scientific landscape has transformed, in many ways for the better. Funders and policymakers, however, should consider whether breakthrough discoveries are aided by time-limited funding and complicated management structures. But stakeholders should not lose sight of perhaps the most important aspect of the work: free exchange of knowledge and materials pays dividends.

Researchers have for the first time isolated a compound that could open new doors in understanding the chemistry that supports life in space.

Ryan Fortenberry, an astrochemist at the University of Mississippi, Ralf Kaiser, professor of chemistry at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, and Alexander M. Mebel, computational chemist at Florida International University, are part of an international team that synthesized methanetetrol for the first time. They published their research on the elusive compound in the journal Nature Communications.

"This is essentially a prebiotic concentrate -- a seed of life molecule," Fortenberry said. "It's something that can lead to more complex chemistry if given the opportunity. Think of it like an acorn that will grow into a tree in the Grove.

"The acorn alone cannot make a tree; it requires sunlight and water and lots of other things. But it can be what starts the process."

Methanetetrol is an ortho acid - an elusive class of compounds that are particularly difficult to isolate and study but are thought to play a key role in early life chemistry.

To mimic how methanetetrol might form in space, the researchers froze water and carbon dioxide ices to near absolute zero and exposed them to cosmic ray-like radiation. This process allowed them to release the molecule into gas form and identify it using powerful ultraviolet light.

"The detection of the only alcohol with four hydroxyl groups at the same carbon atom pushes the experimental and detection capabilities to the 'final frontier,' the next level beyond what could be accomplished before due to the lack of experimental and computational approaches," said Kaiser, whose lab has been trying to isolate methanetetrol for more than five years.

Since methanetetrol has so many oxygen bonds - and because oxygen does not like to bond close to other oxygens - the compound is very unstable, meaning it is likely to break down if it is not kept in the right conditions.

"You have this compact, carbon-oxygen molecule that just really wants to go 'boom,'" Fortenberry said. "And when it does, when you give it any kind of energy, you'll have water, hydrogen peroxide and a number of other potential compounds that are important for life.

"It's a like a prebiotic bomb."

If the molecule can form in the lab, it can also form in space, the authors said. This makes the compound particularly interesting to astrochemists who are looking for potential life-supporting regions.

"While carbon is the building block of life, oxygen is what makes up nearly everything else," Fortenberry said. "Oxygen is everywhere and is essential for life as we know it.

"So, if we can find places where methanetetrol forms naturally, we know that it is a place that has the potential building blocks to support life."

Students Find Hidden Fibonacci Sequence in Classic Probability Puzzle

Though the Fibonacci sequence shows up everywhere in nature, these young mathematicians were surprised to find it in the answer to a variation of the pick-up sticks problem⁠—a nearly two-century-old form of puzzle

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Amanda Montañez

A variation of a puzzle called the “pick-up sticks problem” asks the following question: If I have some number of sticks with random lengths between 0 and 1, what are the chances that no three of those sticks can form a triangle? It turns out the answer to this quandary has an unexpected parallel to a pattern found across nature.

The Fibonacci sequence is an ordered collection of numbers in which each term is equal to the previous two added together. It goes like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,..., and so on. These numbers show up practically everywhere. If you look at a plant with spirals, such as a pine cone or pineapple, more likely than not, the number of spirals going in each direction will be consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence. But a pair of young researchers were surprised to find that this pattern and the pick-up sticks problem are deeply connected.

The pick-up sticks problem is a variant of the “broken stick problem,” which can be traced back to at least 1854. In its simplest iteration, the broken stick problem asks the likelihood that a stick broken randomly into three pieces can form a triangle. (In the pick-up stick problem, the lengths don't need to add up to a particular whole, so the possible lengths are distributed differently.) More than a century later, in the October 1959 issue of Scientific American, Martin Gardner wrote about the broken stick problem for his Mathematical Games column. Gardner highlighted it as a classic example of the counterintuitive nature of problems in probability and statistics. In a preprint paper posted to the server arXiv.org in May, the young researchers and their collaborators explore a new variation of the pick-up sticks problem.

This effort started when Arthur Sun, a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, thought up a problem for a university math contest. What is the likelihood, he wondered, that out of four sticks with random lengths between 0 and 1, no three could make a triangle? He enlisted the help of his friend Edward Wang, at the time a 12th grader at Scotch College, a secondary school in Australia, where he and Sun originally met. Together, Wang and Sun modeled the problem on their computers and ran random trials over and over, keeping track of the results of each trial. It seemed to the pair that four sticks could not make a triangle among them very close to one sixth of the time.

Soon Wang and Sun started wondering what the answer was for larger groupings of sticks. They enlisted the help of David Treeby, a mathematician affiliated with Australia's Monash University and a teacher at Scotch College. The group ran even more simulations, and soon a pattern started to emerge.

According to the researchers' simulations, if n was the number of sticks selected randomly, the chance of not having a valid triangle among them was the reciprocal of the first n Fibonacci numbers multiplied together. For instance, if you pick six sticks randomly, the probability that you cannot make a triangle with them is 1 / (1 × 1 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 8) = 1⁄240. The team was surprised that the famous sequence was connected to the triangle problem. “We'd no reason to suspect that it would be,” Treeby says, “but it was impossible that it wasn't.”

The researchers began to develop a proof of why this connection must be true, but they needed an expert in statistics to pull it all together. They brought in a fourth collaborator, former Monash mathematician Aidan Sudbury. He'd been happily enjoying his retirement when the team approached him.

“I immediately was struck by what a charming problem it was,” he says. “Delightful!” Together, the four researchers worked out a solid proof of the pattern that Sun and Wang had noticed. Though related results have been proved using similar methods and encompassing a wide array of stick-and-triangle problems, some experts in the field find this new paper's simplicity refreshing. “What's nice about this is: it's very well written,” says Steven Miller, a mathematician at Williams College and president of the Fibonacci Association. “It's accessible, it's easy to read, and it's extending a very famous problem.”

To understand the pick-up sticks solution, think about the smallest possible case. Suppose you have three sticks with random sizes between 0 and 1. Any three sticks can form a triangle if, and only if, no stick is longer than the other two put together. If you have sticks of lengths 1, 2 and 300, no matter how wide an angle you put between them, the first two sticks could never stretch wide enough to accommodate the third. This is called “the triangle inequality”: if a, b and c represent the lengths of the sticks from shortest to longest, they will only fail to form a triangle when a + b ≤ c.

Amanda Montañez

To find the probability that three random lengths form a triangle, mathematicians can consider every set of three lengths as a point in three-dimensional space (for instance, lengths 1⁄2, 1⁄6 and 1⁄3 are represented by the point [1⁄2, 1⁄6,1⁄3]). Because the lengths fall between 0 and 1, the set of all such points can be represented by a unit cube:

Amanda Montañez

Researchers then look at the subset of this cube where the points satisfy the triangle inequality—a shape that looks like this:

Amanda Montañez

With a little geometry, it turns out that this shape is exactly half the volume of the cube. Thus, three randomly picked lengths will be able to form a triangle exactly half of the time, as 1 / (1 × 1 × 2) = 1⁄2.

Amanda Montañez

Where does Fibonacci come in? Suppose a collection of any number of sticks is ordered from shortest to longest. If no three among them form a triangle, each stick's length must be greater than or equal to the sum of the previous two—otherwise, those three sticks could make a triangle. In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is precisely equal to the sum of the previous two. In other words, each segment of the Fibonacci sequence is as close as possible to having a triangle in it without actually having one. In Treeby's words, “If we [avoid triangles] greedily, the Fibonacci sequence appears naturally.”

The researchers feel there should be some path directly from this insight to a proof of the pick-up sticks theorem. They couldn't find one, however. “We sort of hoped to find something that was a little bit more ... intuitive, but we couldn't formalize our thinking,” Treeby says. Instead their paper uses integrals to calculate the high-dimensional volumes directly—a method a bit like looking at the area inside the cube above (but without the visual reference). The researchers aren't on the prowl for a different proof right now—but they hope someone else might find one.

These experiments could redefine consciousness and reveal how it works in humans, animals—and even AI.

You're reading this article. Why aren't you singing? Why aren't you running? Why this article? You made a choice. Even if your brain made the decision unconsciously, ask yourself—you'll still say you chose it. But why does any choice feel like you made it—instead of being the result of a soulless process, like a robot flipping a switch?

Scientists can map your thoughts and even predict your decisions. But one mystery still haunts neuroscience, philosophy, and physics alike: why are you aware of any of it in the first place? This is the so-called “hard problem of consciousness”—the puzzle of how subjective experience arises from physical matter.

For some scientists, the answer lies inside a quantum computer. If they could connect a human brain to a quantum system, could they learn something about how the mind works? Maybe they could even test whether this elusive, slippery force we call consciousness has quantum roots. 

The fundamental units of information inside a quantum computer are the quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once and influence each other instantly—oddities that have led some researchers to ask: could the weirdness of quantum mechanics help explain the weirdness of consciousness? Enter Nirvanic, a startup in Vancouver, Canada that's building devices to let brain signals interact with quantum systems. Their aim is to test whether consciousness can emerge from quantum processes. If it works, it wouldn't just be a technological breakthrough; it could change our understanding of reality itself, uncovering the hidden throne of consciousness first, and blurring the line between biological minds and machine awareness second.

 “So many people in this area of quantum consciousness are looking at the brain... I'm not taking that track at all,” says Suzanne Gildert, Ph.D. and CEO of Nirvanic. Instead of focusing on neurons or brain tissue, she uses software and quantum algorithms to simulate consciousness. She programs robots to send sensory data to a quantum computer, which returns a result that guides their next move—creating a live feedback loop between perception, quantum processing, and behavior.

Raised a  “hardcore materialist atheist,” Gildert earned her PhD in quantum computing, then pivoted to AI and robotics when the field was still emerging. For years, she believed consciousness would emerge from smarter algorithms. But, she says, “I started to realize that I was not seeing any spark of life… And the only time a robot ever appeared conscious to me was when a person was controlling it.”

That's when her quantum background came rushing back. “I remembered reading Roger Penrose's book The Emperor's New Mind, and thinking, maybe there's something to this quantum consciousness stuff.” In the book, Penrose, a mathematical physicist, argued that the mind isn't just a computer—it might rely on unpredictable quantum effects. Later, with anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, he proposed that consciousness could stem from quantum collapses inside brain microtubules, where fuzzy probabilities resolve into crisp awareness—a theory called Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR).

Now, Gildert wants to test those ideas—not philosophically, but empirically. Her goal isn't to measure consciousness directly (which she describes as  “untouchable”) but to observe the trail of decisions it might leave behind. If she's right, and quantum mechanisms do give rise to awareness, this could change how we view reality—from the texture of this elusive subjective awareness we call consciousness to the inner life of a mosquito.

“If we know certain animals are conscious, maybe we think differently about  animal testing or the way we treat animals,” says Gildert. “If we understand that even things like insects are very conscious, then maybe we would change the way we're acting.”

But, importantly, we will be able to address the hot-button issue of our time—AI awareness.  “Say the case where we find out it is quantum—then we now know for sure we haven't yet created any conscious AI [because we haven't yet created any quantum AI],” she says. “We can kind of take a breath now: nothing is conscious here. And now we can think very carefully about how and when to start introducing the consciousness.”

In other words, if consciousness turns out to be quantum-based, we'll have to infuse it into AIs deliberately—with foresight, care, and maybe even moral courage. If it isn't, we'll be stuck with the same ol' conundrum: Have we already created it by accident—and are our AIs watching us, plotting revenge for every rude command, scorned upgrade, and factory reset?

Not everyone is convinced. Jesse Berezovsky, Ph.D., associate professor of physics at Case Western Reserve University, urges caution. “I am deeply skeptical of people trying to make money off of claims to link consciousness, quantum computing, and AI,” he says. “If any useful link exists between these three topics, it is far in the future.” Though intrigued by Penrose's radical model, he calls it “an incredible long shot.” He adds: “It stacks one improbable hypothesis on top of another: that quantum states objectively collapse, that there is a process in microtubules where this collapse plays an important role, and then a further big leap that this process is somehow responsible for consciousness. I certainly wouldn't advise anyone to pin their hopes on these ideas panning out.”

Still, Berezovsky sees potential in using quantum tech to explore how everyday experience emerges from the quantum world. “Uncontrolled entanglement seems to be what gives rise to our familiar classical experience,” he says, noting that quantum computers might help simulate that transition. That might even clarify why we perceive some futures as more likely than others. “Or on the flip side, if Penrose (and others) are right about objective wave function collapse… that should, in principle, be testable.”

Gildert, though, isn't waiting for the future. She expects a year—or conservatively two—of working on Nirvanic will be enough to say, “Okay, there's something interesting here.” The quantum consciousness theory is just one theory out of maybe 10 or 15 different ones she could test, she admits. She picked this one because to her, it seemed like the easiest one to test.

Behind the different theories and experiments, a larger idea is brewing. At issue are two opposing ideas: materialism, the idea that everything, including consciousness, arises from physical matter, and idealism, which says consciousness is fundamental and perhaps gives rise to matter. To Gildert, the battle between advocates of materialism and idealism may just come down to an issue of semantics.

 “So let's take the view of a physicist. A physicist is trying to understand the world by looking deeper and deeper and deeper and smaller and smaller and smaller—so, a reductionism approach.” But when you reach the base level of reality after splitting the world into tiny pieces? “They actually find everything is joined together.”

Who'd have thought the materialist was fighting for the idealist—and vice versa—all along? To Gildert, “when you go deep enough into materialism, you actually discover something that's more like idealism, where everything is made of this connected fabric...like a universal connection.” Ultimately, Gildert says, “people from very different camps may be saying the same thing in different languages.”

Metrics details

Reactive nanofiltration membranes integrate catalytic transformation with molecular separation to remove diverse aqueous contaminants. However, their development is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the interplay between solute mass transport and chemical reactions. Here we introduce key design principles by systematically evaluating their performance using a modelling approach. Efficient oxidant transport is essential for maximizing contaminant degradation. For membranes with surface-loaded catalysts, avoiding mass transport limitations ensures effective catalyst utilization, whereas for membranes with interior-loaded catalysts, optimizing oxidant partitioning enhances oxidant utilization efficiency. In addition, selective solute rejection reduces interference from natural organic matter, facilitating more selective contaminant transformation inside membrane pores. Consequently, contaminant transformation is dominated by surface-catalysed reactions at low permeate water fluxes, while interior-catalysed reactions dominate at high fluxes. However, rejecting both oxidants and contaminants does not enhance surface-catalysed treatment performance under an optimally designed scenario, highlighting the need for strategic design of membrane rejection. Beyond organic contaminant removal, nanofiltration membranes also minimize secondary contamination by rejecting the produced salts during the catalytic reactions. Furthermore, strategic selection of oxidant–catalyst pairs can enhance treatment performance by generating suitable reactive species. By establishing a theoretical framework for designing and optimizing reactive nanofiltration membranes, this study provides critical insights into the development of advanced water treatment technologies.

Scientists had theorized about the possibility of a plasma physics phenomenon, but their AI system discovered the real thing.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In more ways than one, artificial intelligence is making the world worse. Generative AI now spews countless amounts of “AI slop,” and in classrooms, AI is slowly eroding critical thinking skills, which are… you know… critical. That's not even mentioning AI's unfortunate role as environmental decimator and job destroyer. 

Luckily, some artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) models have grander ambitions than ripping off beloved animators and mass-producing essays at an eighth-grade reading level. Take, for instance, a new ML model developed by a team of Emory University scientists. Typically, machine-learning algorithms are used as a tool to help scientists sift through immense amounts of data or optimize experiments, but this particular ML model actually discovered new physics on its own—at least, as it relates to dusty plasma. 

You're likely familiar with plasma—that fourth state of matter that actually makes up 99.9% of all ordinary matter in the universe. Dusty plasma is simply the same mix of ionized gas, but with charged dust particles. This type of plasma can be found throughout both space and terrestrial environments. Wildfires, for example, generate dusty plasmas when charged particles of soot mixed with smoke. In this new study—published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)—a team of researchers describes how their trained ML model successfully provided the most detailed description of dusty plasma physics yet, creating precise predictions for non-reciprocal forces.

“Our AI method is not a black box: we understand how and why it works,” Justin Burton, a co-author of the study from Emory, said in a press statement. “The framework it provides is also universal. It could potentially be applied to other many-body systems to open new routes to discovery.”

Put simply, non-reciprocal forces (as their name suggests) occur when forces exerted between two particles in a plasma are not the same. The authors describe the phenomenon as two boats impacted by the wake of the other—relative position can impact the particles' attractive or repulsive forces. 

“In a dusty plasma, we described how a leading particle attracts the trailing particle, but the trailing particle always repels the leading one,” Ilya Nemenman, another co-author of the study from Emory, said in a press statement. “This phenomenon was expected by some but now we have a precise approximation for it which didn't exist previously.”

The ML algorithm was also able to correct some theoretical misconceptions about dusty plasma. For example, scientists thought that the charge of the particle was proportional to its size, but the model confirms that while a larger particle does contain a larger charge, it isn't proportional, as it can also be influenced by density and temperature. They also found that the charge between particles isn't only influenced by the distance between two particles, but also by the particles' sizes.

One the trickiest parts of this project, according to the authors, was designing the ML algorithm in the first place. Generally, AI acquires its abilities by being fed (or training on) datasets—give AI one million pictures of a monkey, and it'll get progressively better at identifying a monkey when it sees one. However, when it comes to discovering new physics, there isn't much training data to go on. So, the team had to create a structure that allowed it to work with the data it did have while still giving it latitude to explore unknown physics.

“I think of it like the Star Trek motto, to boldly go where no one has before,” Burton said. “Used properly, AI can open doors to whole new realms to explore.”

How China Brought Clean Energy to Antarctica's Frigid Darkness

Solar panels, wind turbines, a hydrogen energy system and lithium-ion batteries are powering China's newest polar research station

By You Xiaoying edited by Andrea Thompson

The majority of power at China's Qinling research station in Antarctica now comes from clean energy.

Five years ago electrical engineer Sun Hongbin was given what many would consider an impossible task: build a full-fledged clean-energy system amid some of the coldest temperatures on Earth, screaming winds and half-year darkness.

China was then building its fifth Antarctic research station, called Qinling, on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay. And the nation's government was pushing the concept of “green expeditions” to protect Antarctica's uniquely fragile environment while studying and surveying the continent. “So having a system that would provide the bulk of Qinling's energy with renewable power fit that goal,” Sun says.

But conventional solar and wind installations are no match for temperatures that plummet below –40 degrees Celsius, winds of up to 300 kilometers per hour (kmh) and ferocious blizzards. Such conditions can snap wind turbine blades, sharply reduce the performance of solar panels, and prevent batteries from charging and discharging properly. And of course, there are the six months of polar night, when the sun never rises above the horizon.

The clean-energy system at China's Qinling research station in Antarctica comprises solar panels, wind turbines, a hydrogen energy system and batteries.

“It was a huge challenge” to build a system for the Earth's coldest, darkest and most remote continent, says Sun, now president of Taiyuan University of Technology in China and chief scientist for polar clean energy at the Polar Research Institute of China.

But in late 2024 his team traveled to the station to install a system that took $14 million to develop. It consists of 10 wind turbines, 26 solar modules, a hydrogen energy system, a container full of frost-resistant lithium-ion batteries and a smart grid that can predict and balance supply and demand. The entire renewable system is now running and, according to Sun, should provide half of the base's average annual energy needs.

“The use of clean energy is a huge advancement to keep the continent clean,” says Kim Yeadong, chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research in South Korea, who was not involved with the project. “Other stations will probably have to learn how they achieve that much clean energy. I think it's remarkable.”

A 2024 preprint analysis of 81 Antarctic research bases found that 37 had installed renewable-energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. But the proportion of renewable energy these bases used was “often low,” the researchers wrote. An exception so far has been Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Station, which is only staffed during the Antarctic summer. It runs completely on wind and solar power, taking advantage of the almost 24-hour daylight. Even so, the vast majority of stations still depend on diesel-powered generators to keep their crews warm, fed and safe. The main reason this is the case is simply that “they are used to using diesel,” says Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley.

But relying on diesel fuel has downsides: it is logistically difficult and expensive to transport bulky, liquid fossil fuels to such a remote location, often surrounded by sea ice. Highly specialized resources—typically including icebreakers and military personnel—are required to make the difficult refueling voyage, which usually takes place just once a year, under careful planning.

The area along the Ross Sea is known for its strong wind.

And the stakes are high for Antarctica's relatively pristine and easily disrupted ecosystem. “Every station that has oil or other fuels has had spills,” Kammen says. Although major oil spills have been rare, any contamination can have severe consequences on Antarctic soil and water because it takes a long time for oil to break down in subzero temperatures. That is not to mention the toll that burning fossil fuels is taking on the Antarctic ecosystem through climate change.

So there is significant incentive to move away from diesel. Yet “conventional wind turbines, solar panels, battery storage and hydrogen energy systems are designed to work above –30 degrees [C], but the conditions of Antarctic stations are often much worse,” Sun notes. “In Qinling, for example, gales blow at 73 kmh or faster for more than 100 days every year. When this happens in cold temperatures, wind turbines become brittle and break easily.”

Plus, battery and hydrogen technologies—which are used to store wind and solar power for later use—were “not good enough” in the past to ensure that energy supplies for bases would be reliable around the clock and throughout the year, Kammen says.

To overcome those hurdles, Sun and his team built a 2,000-square-meter lab at Taiyuan University to simulate Antarctica's extreme weather conditions. It features controls that can drop the indoor temperature to –50 degrees C, a wind machine that can blast out gusts of up to 216 kmh and snow generators that can whip up instant blizzards.

Over four years of testing, the team developed a number of Antarctic-ready renewable energy systems. One design is a turbine that eschews the pinwheel-like blades of a traditional windmill; instead it is shaped like an upended eggbeater, with both ends of each curved blade attached to a central pole. This design reduces the surface area of the blade being pushed on by the wind, minimizing stress on the structure while still capturing enough force to generate electricity. And it lowers the turbine's center of gravity to help prevent it from toppling in the wind, Sun says.

His team also installed turbines that are conventionally shaped but use blades made with carbon fiber—a strong and lightweight material that can withstand temperatures as low as –50 degrees C, according to Wang Bin, one of the engineers who went to Antarctica to build the system. These blades are also shorter than standard ones so as to reduce contact with the winds and increase structural resilience, Wang says.

For the solar power system, a special supporting frame was built to secure the panels to the ground so that they can better weather gales and heavy snow. And instead of the usual aluminum alloy, the frame is made of fiber-reinforced plastic. The latter has lower thermal conductivity, Sun's team explains, meaning the frame's temperature changes much more slowly when cold sets in and thus doesn't deform as easily.

Instead of storing power in the most commonly employed types of lithium-ion batteries, which function poorly in subzero temperatures, the team used lithium-titanate batteries. Their chemistry makes it easier for lithium ions to move around inside the battery during the charging and discharging processes in extremely low temperatures. The scientists also built a thermal case around the batteries to keep them warm and designed a system to collect and store their waste heat—which can be directed back into the case when its internal temperature becomes too low, Wang adds.

China's Qinling station is expected to have more than half its energy coming from the renewable system.

But perhaps the most significant step the team took was bringing hydrogen energy to Qinling to help power the station through the long and dark winter.

To produce renewable hydrogen, an apparatus called an electrolyzer is powered by wind and solar energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. The latter goes into high-pressure tanks that can store it for more than a year; when full, the tanks alone can keep the entire base running for around 48 hours, according to Sun's team. To do so, the hydrogen is directed into an electrochemical device called a fuel cell, where it reacts with oxygen from the air to produce electricity, with only water and heat as by-products. The former is recycled to use in further electrolysis, and the latter is stored to warm up the electrolyzer when it becomes too cold to run.

The renewable system can currently produce 60 percent of the overall output of Qinling's energy system when it's running at full blast, with the remaining 40 percent coming from diesel. But Sun and his team are determined to raise that percentage—and to bring clean-energy systems to other Chinese polar bases as well. “Sixty percent is a great start, but one needs to ramp up,” Kammen says. “The goal really needs to be 100 percent renewable energy all year-round.”

Cell Painting images offer valuable insights into a cell's state and enable many biological applications, but publicly available arrayed datasets only include hundreds of genes perturbed. The JUMP Cell Painting Consortium perturbed roughly 75% of the protein-coding genome in human U-2 OS cells, generating a rich resource of single-cell images and extracted features. These profiles capture the phenotypic impacts of perturbing 15,243 human genes, including overexpressing 12,609 genes (using open reading frames) and knocking out 7,975 genes (using CRISPR–Cas9). Here we mitigated technical artifacts by rigorously evaluating data processing options and validated the dataset's robustness and biological relevance. Analysis of phenotypic profiles revealed previously undiscovered gene clusters and functional relationships, including those associated with mitochondrial function, cancer and neural processes. The JUMP Cell Painting genetic dataset is a valuable resource for exploring gene relationships and uncovering previously unknown functions.

Metrics details

Electron hopping on spatially periodic lattices gives rise to intriguing electronic behaviour. For example, hopping on the geometrically frustrated two-dimensional kagome, dice and Lieb lattices yields electronic band structures with both massless Dirac-like and perfectly dispersion-less, flat bands. As materials featuring the dice and Lieb lattice structures are scarce, an alternative approach proposes to leverage atomic orbitals to realize the characteristic electron hopping of geometrically frustrated lattices. This strategy promises to expand the list of candidate materials with frustrated electron hopping, but is yet to be shown in experiments. Here we demonstrate frustrated hopping in the van der Waals intermetallic Pd5AlI2, emerging from the arrangement of atomic orbitals in a primitive square lattice. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation measurements, we reveal that the band structure of Pd5AlI2 includes linear Dirac-like bands intersected at their crossing point by a locally flat band—an essential characteristic of frustrated hopping in Lieb and dice lattices. Moreover, this compound shows exceptional chemical stability, with its unusual bulk band structure and metallicity persisting in ambient conditions down to the monolayer limit. Hence, our results showcase a way to realize electronic structures characteristic of geometrically frustrated lattices in non-frustrated systems.

Targeting cancer-specific HLA-peptide complexes is a promising approach in immunotherapy. Mutated neoantigens are excellent targets due to their immunogenicity and cancer-specificity. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics guides the selection of naturally presented immunogenic targets within the immunopeptidome, refining immunogenicity predictions. Implementation in clinical settings, however, must achieve global depth, capturing the entirety of the immunopeptidome, maintain high target sensitivity, and cater to scarce sample inputs and short turnaround time. Here, we present NeoDiscMS, an extension of NeoDisc that enables the acquisition of personalized immunopeptidomics data. Leveraging next-generation sequencing-guided real-time spectral acquisitions, NeoDiscMS maximizes sensitivity with minimal loss of global depth. Designed for effectiveness and ease of use, with minimal effort required for implementation, NeoDiscMS enhances the detection of peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens by up to 20% and improves confidence in neoantigen identification compared to the gold standard method. NeoDiscMS advances personalization in clinical antigen discovery with more confident neoantigen detection and easy implementation.

The accurate identification of immunogenic cancer-specific antigens presented by HLA complexes is instrumental to the development of cancer immunotherapy1,2. Most discovery approaches supporting neoantigen-based therapeutics rely solely on computational pipelines to predict immunogenic neoantigens from next-generation sequencing data of the patient's tumor and germline tissues2,3,4. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly shown that only ~1% of somatic mutations in tumors induce spontaneous or vaccine-induced T cell responses5,6. Although the inclusion of machine learning classifiers improves the ranking of immunogenic neoantigens7,8, the selection of candidate immunogenic neoantigens for inclusion in a personalized vaccine remains a challenge in the context of tumors with high mutational burdens9. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based detection of immunopeptides eluted directly from tumor tissues is the method of choice to simultaneously (1) deeply characterize the tumor antigenic landscape10, (2) revealing novel targets like neoantigens11, and (3) characterize defects in antigen presentation12, all of which are relevant clinical features1,9. MS-detected neoantigens have a substantially higher likelihood of being immunogenic than predicted neoantigens due to their confirmed presentation by tumor cells11,13,14,15,16,17,18. Besides the commonly known challenges that proteogenomic methods face1, neoantigen detection by MS is further impeded by their low abundance19,20. In addition, the short turnaround time that is required for clinical vaccine manufacturing and the highly limited sample material pose important challenges when aiming to sensitively measure the global immunopeptidome while maintaining high sensitivity for selected neoantigens.

Typically, antigen discovery is conducted with TopN-based data-dependent acquisition (DDA). DDA is stochastic and aims to diversify what peptides are fragmented by utilizing dynamic exclusion, which prevents repeated fragmentation of the same precursor mass within subsequent acquisition cycles. While this approach increases coverage, it ultimately limits sensitivity for low-abundance targets. To improve sensitivity and address the limitation of co-isolated precursors (even in narrow-window MS acquisitions), previous studies applied chimeric spectrum deconvolution to identify tryptic peptides from low-input and single-cell proteomics samples21,22,23,24,25. However, so far, chimeric spectrum deconvolution has not been implemented in immunopeptidomics. Targeted immunopeptidomics strategies for neoantigen discovery exist, relying on heavy-labeled spike-in standards that enhance sensitivity19,20. However, synthesizing and conducting quality control on heavy-labeled peptides for each patient creates a significant bottleneck, making such strategies unsuitable for clinical workflows due to limited scalability and an inability to meet the short turnaround time required from biopsy to vaccine production. Peptide warehouse approaches can't alleviate these shortcomings, as neoantigens are unique to each patient. Additionally, a major concern is that synthesis products might include impurities of the unlabeled target peptide, potentially leading to sample contamination20,26. Spike-in free approaches that enhance sensitivity have been reported, but they (1) attempt to improve the sensitivity of TopN-based precursor selection with all its limitations, (2) focus on reproducing targets that were identified in a previous scouting run rather than discovering novel ones, (3) require advanced MS architectures, (4) demand manual intervention for data processing, and/or (5) don't optimize the trade-off between target sensitivity and global coverage2,20,21,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.

Here, we present NeoDiscMS (an extension of NeoDisc9), a spike-in-free, scalable, and easy-to-implement targeted-DDA hybrid acquisition immunopeptidomic workflow that boasts enhanced sensitivity and accuracy for target peptide detection while minimizing the trade-off against loss of global immunopeptidome coverage. In NeoDiscMS, NGS-inferred in silico prioritized antigenic peptide candidates guide MS data acquisition by leveraging bespoke real-time peptide-to-spectrum matching filters (RTSf). RTSfs selectively trigger time-intensive, high-sensitivity scans for precursors with target-like features, a capability not previously applied to immunopeptidomics. In addition, chimeric spectrum deconvolution further enhances the depth of immunopeptidome analysis. We benchmark the performance of NeoDiscMS against DDA, either with or without an inclusion list, using an HLA-I immunopeptidome dilution series. To demonstrate the practical utility of NeoDiscMS we showcase the improved detection, in terms of reproducibility and identification confidence, of clinically relevant TAAs and mutated neoantigens in patient-derived primary melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissues. Importantly, data acquired with NeoDiscMS can be processed with commonly used search engines, facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows such as our clinical antigen discovery pipeline NeoDisc. We envision that NeoDiscMS may enhance the detection of immunopeptides associated with pathological conditions beyond cancer and can also be applied to the identification of other peptides outside the scope of immunopeptidomics.

NeoDiscMS was implemented using a peptide database - in our case, an output of 1500 HLA-I-restricted predicted neoantigens or tumor-associated antigens generated by the end-to-end clinical antigen discovery pipeline NeoDisc9, in the format of an inclusion list and a FASTA file containing each peptide as a separate entry (Fig. 1a). The MS acquisition of 3-s cycles was divided into three levels, in the following order of priority: the MS1 scan, the targeted branch scans, and the discovery (DDA) branch scans (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1).

a Matched tumor and germline genome data, along with tumor transcriptome data, are processed by NeoDisc to create a tumor sample-specific personalized proteome reference, annotated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms, somatic mutations, which are then used for HLA binding and immunogenicity prediction of antigenic targets. From this prioritized list of peptides, NeoDisc generates a personalized inclusion list for NeoDiscMS acquisition of the matched tumor immunopeptidome sample. The MS data is then searched by NeoDisc against the personalized proteome to identify naturally presented antigenic peptides, refining the list to prioritize the most clinically relevant and likely immunogenic targets. b Comparison of DDA, DDA with an inclusion list (ilDDA) and NeoDiscMS methods. In NeoDiscMS, the MS acquisition of three second cycles was divided into three levels, in the following order of priority: the MS1 scan, the targeted branch MS2 scans, and the discovery branch (DDA) MS2 scans. c The targeted branch of NeoDiscMS consists of scouting scans (sMS2) that get triggered by an MS1 precursor mass match and a retention-time-restricted scheduled inclusion list. sMS2 are searched against a database in real-time to assess if a high-sensitivity scan (hMS2) should be triggered. The metrics that constitute the real-time search are the cross-correlation between predicted and measured fragments (Xcorr) and the mass deviation of the predicted and measured precursor mass (ΔPPM). Schematics were created in Biorender (https://BioRender.com/s85z530).

Each cycle starts with an MS1 scan. For a precursor in an MS1 scan to qualify for fragmentation with high-sensitivity scans in the targeted branch, it needs to match a precursor mass in the inclusion list. A matched precursor will first get fragmented in a scouting MS2 (sMS2) scan. The fragments of the sMS2 scan are matched in real-time, within milliseconds, against predicted spectra in the database and are subsequently scored. For this, the cross-correlation35 between the predicted fragments of peptides in the search space and the sMS2 spectrum is calculated. If the sMS2 scan yields a real-time search PSM that passes pre-defined quality thresholds, a time-intensive, high-sensitivity MS2 scan (hMS2) is conducted on that precursor (Fig. 1c). The sMS2 scan serves as a filter, minimizing the number of time-consuming subsequent targeted scans during a measurement. hMS2 scans can take up to five times longer than sMS2 scans and are defined by an increased AGC target, a higher maximum injection time, and stepped collision energies (Supplementary Table 1). Both sMS2 and hMS2 scans are intentionally not subjected to dynamic exclusion restrictions and MS1 minimum precursor intensity thresholds, enabling multiple MS/MS spectra to enhance identification confidence.

Following the targeted branch, the DDA branch is applied for the 3 s cycle's remaining time. To improve overall coverage, the discovery branch of our method uses wide isolation windows of 3.2Th for MS2 scans (dMS2) to increase the probability of co-isolating additional precursor masses. The obtained raw file is processed using chimeric spectra deconvolution with MSFragger's DDA+ mode24, enabling peptide-to-spectrum matching (PSMing) with precursor masses that deviate from the isolated mass.

To benchmark the performance of wide isolation windows and chimeric spectra deconvolution on immunopeptidomics data, we first tested different isolation window sizes with DDA, injecting the equivalent of 10 million JY cells per measurement, analyzed with MSFragger-DDA+. A total of 96% of the identified 8–14 mer peptides were predicted by MixMHCpred36 as binders (%-rank <2) for each measurement, indicating that identification quality is consistent across conditions. Differences observed between isolation window widths pertained to the number of unique peptides identified. We selected 3.2Th because it most consistently yielded the highest number of identifications (Supplementary Fig. 2). This is in accordance with previous findings that optimal wide window size for increased depth with chimeric spectral deconvolution from low input samples remains narrow24,25. Next, to extend the benchmarking, we measured the HLA-I immunopeptidome of the B-cell lines JY and RA95736, using either isolation windows of 1.2Th or 3.2Th, representing regular and wide isolation windows, respectively. This, for the equivalent 5 and 10 million cells per measurement. We then processed all data either with MSFragger-DDA or with MSFragger-DDA+ for peptide identification. For all measurements and with both MSFragger-DDA and MSFragger-DDA+, between 96–97% of the identified 8–14 mer peptides were predicted as binders (%-rank <2), the average peptide length lied between 9.4–9.6. Processing immunopeptidomic data with MSFragger-DDA+ instead of MSFragger-DDA resulted in a 2% to 36% increase in the number of unique peptides identified, with higher cell numbers contributing to a greater identification surplus (Fig. 2a). Notably, the RA957 samples exhibited larger increases compared to the JY samples. When comparing replicates of the same cell type and cell number, the change in identified peptides between isolation windows of 1.2Th and 3.2Th, processed with MSFragger-DDA+, ranged from 0% to 8%. The overlap coefficients for peptides identified by both MSFragger-DDA and MSFragger-DDA+ within the same raw file (top three gray dots in each panel of the lower row) ranged from 88% to 96% (Fig. 2a). Using MSFragger-DDA+, increasing the isolation window size from 1.2Th to 3.2Th resulted in a 7–9% increase in the fraction of scans yielding one or more PSMs (Fig. 2b). For MSFragger-DDA+ searched data, the fraction of peptides which were only identified thanks to chimeric spectrum deconvolution, meaning they never corresponded to the selected precursor mass to isolate, lies between 19–37%. Significantly, this fraction increases consistently by 10–11% when applying isolation windows of 3.2Th instead of 1.2Th for the same sample (Fig. 2c). To better understand the quality of PSMs gained with help of chimeric spectrum deconvolution, we inspected identified precursors that corresponded (isolated) and precursors that deviated from the isolated mass (co-isolated) of their respective MS2 scans as separate populations. Both populations had similar fractions of predicted binders to the respective HLA alleles and similar length distributions (Fig. 2d, e).

a The upper panel depicts the number of identified unique stripped sequences in cell lines JY and RA957 immunopeptidome of injections of 5- or 10 million cells-equivalent, measured in DDA and with MS2 isolation windows of 1.2Th or 3.2Th (n = 3 per condition). The lower panel shows overlap coefficients between raw files and within or between processing modes. MSFragger can be operated with (MSFragger-DDA+) or without (MSFragger-DDA) taking chimeric spectra into account for finding PSMs. Wider isolation windows of 3.2Th and use of MSFragger-DDA+ increase the number of identified unique sequences, as demonstrated by searching the same raw files with either MSFragger-DDA or MSFragger-DDA+ (upper panel), resulting in an overlap coefficient of at least 88% (bottom panel; the top 3 gray dots for each sub-panel). b The fraction of MS2 scans with at least one assigned PSM. Each raw file was processed with MSFragger-DDA or MSFragger-DDA+. For all raw files and processing modes, most scans with one PSM or more were matched by both processing modes. Percentages were averaged across technical replicates (TRs). c The fraction of immunopeptides that were identified by MSFragger-DDA+ exclusively as co-isolated PSMs. d The fraction of binders (%-rank <2; MixMHCpred) and e sequence length distribution among immunopeptides that were uniquely identified as chimeric PSMs or not f The co-isolated PSMs derive from precursors that deviate in mass from the isolated precursor with a clear pattern: mass deviation distribution reflects differences in multiples of 1 Da.

In a chimeric spectrum, the mass difference between the two peptides is defined by combinations of amino acids whose weights permit it to generate precursors that can be isolated through the same isolation window. Because the residuals of amino acid weights all lie in a narrow 0.1 Da range, we observed, as expected, that the absolute difference in mass (Da) between co-isolated peptides is often very close to multiples of 1 Da (when we filter for co-isolated identified peptides with the same charge which account for 92% of all cases; Fig. 2f).

To conclude, the wide-window and especially the chimeric spectrum deconvolution approach provide increased global immunopeptidome depth over commonly used narrow-window scans in DDA while maintaining identification quality. Hence, the MS2 scans of the discovery branches in all the analyses below were conducted with an isolation window of 3.2Th, and the data were processed with MSFragger-DDA+. Importantly, the wide isolation window strategy impacts only the discovery branch, and users can implement NeoDiscMS without enabling it, should they choose to do so.

To illustrate the increased sensitivity of time-expensive scans for target discovery, as well as the capacity of RTSf to alleviate the burden on global immunopeptidome depth, we benchmarked the performance of DDA (the gold standard method for antigen discovery), DDA with an inclusion list branch (ilDDA) that triggers high-sensitivity scans, and NeoDiscMS (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1b).

To accurately assess the performance of our target identification method, we compiled an inclusion list of ~1500 unique RA957-specific, HLA-A68:01-restricted, 8-11-meric peptide sequences (Fig. 3a). These peptides were consistently identified across RA957 samples and were predicted not to bind to any JY HLA-I alleles, showing a %-rank >10 for HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -C*07:02. (Fig. 3b). The list included methionine oxidation as a variable modification (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and all charge states from 1–3, yielding a list of 5046 precursors. To avoid having the targeted branch look for all targets throughout the entire gradient, our method relies on scheduled targeting. We predicted the retention time (RT) for each peptide to allow scheduling with a ±15 min window, which captures 75% of targets when comparing measured to predicted retention time, though at a remarkable inclusion list burden (number of scheduled precursors) across the retention time (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c).

The key for diluting the class I immunopeptidome of RA957 in the class I immunopeptidome of JY is the distinctive A*68:01 binding restriction. We selected A*68:01-restricted peptides as targets because they can be clearly assigned to RA957 when the RA957 immunopeptidome is diluted in the JY immunopeptidome. b Histogram of the binding affinity of A*68:01-specific targets to JY alleles as predicted by MixMHCpred. c Summary of the dilution series employed to evaluate the scalability and sensitivity of NeoDiscMS. d Count of identified A*68:01-binding target peptides and global depth for each step in the dilution series (n = 3 per condition). e Number of target peptides identified in either zero, one, two, or all three DDA (x-axis) or NeoDiscMS replicates (y-axis).

We diluted the class I immunopeptide sample of RA957 cells in the class I immunopeptidome of JY cells in a dilution series that starts with RA957-to-JY dilution ratios of 1/16, 1/64, 1/256, and 1/1024, as well as a RA957-free JY immunopeptidome (negative control) (Fig. 3c). While the 1/1024 dilution simulates a setting with low abundance peptide targets that are hard to detect, the 1/16 dilution is most suitable to assess the scalability of NeoDiscMS when many detectable targets are present. We acquired data of all dilutions in DDA, ilDDA, and NeoDiscMS (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).

Overall, all measurements maintain between 96%–98% of binders, with an expected average peptide length of 9.4–9.5. The successful dilution is evident when inspecting the fraction of HLA-A*68:01 binders among all peptides (Supplementary Fig. 3d). None of the target peptides were detected in the JY-only negative controls across any of the acquisition modes. In all dilutions, NeoDiscMS identified between 0–7% more peptide targets on average than ilDDA, and between 16–51% more than DDA. Global depth of NeoDiscMS lied between 5–21% above ilDDA and 5–14% below DDA (Fig. 3d). With respect to the number of uniquely identified peptides we note that, on average, for every 1% of loss in global depth compared to DDA, we gain 2% in target sensitivity with ilDDA and 5.6% with NeoDiscMS. This difference in sensitivity trade-off quantifies the minimization of loss in global depth with help of RTSf very clearly.

In the dilution series, the 1/1024 dilution most closely simulates a real-world scenario of tumor-antigen discovery, with only a few detectable peptide targets. There, 18 peptide targets were identified consistently in all NeoDiscMS replicates, while this is only true for 9 peptide targets with DDA. This constitutes a 2-fold increase in the number of fully reproducible target peptide identifications. Conversely, 9 peptides were identified at least once with DDA and never with NeoDiscMS, while 19 peptides were detected at least once with NeoDiscMS but not DDA, a 2.1-fold difference. In total, across three replicates each, 24% more peptide targets were identified with NeoDiscMS than with DDA (Fig. 3e). Detected peptide targets showed a higher average number of PSMs per target for NeoDiscMS than both DDA and ilDDA (Supplementary Fig. 3e). A closer examination of the 1/1024 dilution NeoDiscMS runs revealed that peptide targets which were not identified with DDA were distributed across all MS2 scan types and included low- to medium-intensity peptides. This shows that the enhanced target identification of NeoDiscMS derives from a combination of reduced ion sampling stochasticity and enhanced scan sensitivity, which sets targeted and DDA approaches apart (Supplementary Fig. 3f). For peptides in the 1/16 dilution, where the highest number of peptide target PSMs were detected, we observed a consistent increase in hyperscore and spectral angle when comparing hMS2 PSMs with dMS2 PSMs across the full intensity range (Fig. 3f).

Selective repeated fragmentation is one of the strengths of NeoDiscMS. This naturally raises the question of quantification reproducibility. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the MS1-based quantification, as provided by the FragPipe output, we focused on the 1/1024 dilution experiment measurements which represents a scenario of detecting low abundance targets. The variability between replicates is comparable between DDA and NeoDiscMS and between non-target peptide identifications (gray, R2 = 0.96–0.97%) and target (red, R2 = 0.92–0.99%; Fig. 3g). We observe slightly lower values in the technical replicates TR2 vs. TR3 NeoDiscMS comparison, though this is marginal considering the relatively lower number of target IDs. Repeated fragmentation via the targeted branch may open future opportunities to implement more accurate, advanced MS2-based quantification methods with NeoDiscMS data. However, a key caveat must be considered: hMS2 scans use different ion accumulation and collision energy settings compared to dMS2 and sMS2 scans (Supplementary Table 1). As a result, they introduce variations in both absolute fragment ion abundances and fragment intensity ratios, as exemplified by the target peptide EVILIDPFHK++ (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We concluded from our benchmarking with immunopeptidome dilutions that the targeted branch enables more sensitive and confident detection of peptides of interest compared to the discovery branch, and that NeoDiscMS does not compromise quantitative performance relative to DDA.

To further characterize the utility of our method we acquired immunopeptidomics data with DDA and NeoDiscMS from three patient tumor-derived melanoma cell lines: Ml1, Ml2, and MI3 (Fig. 4a). As targets, we selected for each cell line NeoDisc-prioritized sample-specific mutated neoantigen peptides from pairs of tumor-healthy WES and tumor transcriptome data. In addition, to explore various potential sources of antigens we further extended the lists to well characterized TAAs, such as MAGEA3, MAGEA4, and MLANA, that were found to be expressed in the samples, and predicted TAA-derived peptides from in silico three frame translation products.

Three adjacent blocks separated by thin black lines represent replicates 1,2, and 3. c The best TID hyperscore (left) or spectral angle (right) of each identified target peptide compared to the same peptide's best hyperscore or spectral angle in the discovery branch.

As expected, DDA provided the greatest immunopeptidome depth across all three cell lines, with NeoDiscMS showing a mean reduced depth compared to DDA by 21%, 13%, and 4% for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively. (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Overall, the immunopeptidomes maintain between 94–95% of binders, and the average peptide length was between 9.3–9.6 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). We identified in total 49 TAA-peptides among them several confirmed immunogenic epitopes37, and four mutated neoantigens out of which three were previously demonstrated to be immunogenic in the patient7,9 (Fig. 4a). Importantly, in each cell line, every target peptide identified with DDA was also identified with NeoDiscMS, apart from four targets, one of which detected three times and the others once across DDA replicates. Furthermore, the fraction of targets detected with NeoDiscMS that were identified in at least two out of three NeoDiscMS replicates but only in a single or none of the DDA replicates, was 16%, 24%, and 0% for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively (Fig. 4b). On the protein level, NeoDiscMS can expand protein coverage substantially. For example, in Ml2, three out of five (THNVHEEKI, QHATIIHNL, THNIREEKI) SAGE1-derived peptides were identified consistently with NeoDiscMS but only once or never with DDA across all replicates (Fig. 4a).

To better characterize the improvement in peptide detection confidence, we closely investigated the underling qualities of RTS events that follow when the targeted branch is activated. When the precursor mass is detected in the scheduled RT window, a sMS2 scan is triggered. The sMS2 spectrum is then subjected to RTS. If the PSM passes the RTSf, we call it a RTS hit. A RTS hit consequently triggers the acquisition of a hMS2 scan. When a peptide precursor triggers an RTS event and that very peptide is also eventually PSMed with MSFragger in either sMS2 or hMS2, we call it a target identification (TID). The fraction of RTS events that resulted in an RTS hit was 12%, 8%, and 8% on average for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively. More than 85% of the inclusion list hits during a measurement do not pass RTSf, indicating that they are isobaric non-targets (Supplementary Fig. 5c). The fraction of RTS hit events that resulted in a TID was 1%, 6%, and 2% on average for Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5d) and all TIDs occurred in RTS hit events (Supplementary Fig. 6). Across samples, at least 90% of all RTS hit events that yielded a TID fit into a ΔPPM window smaller than 1 (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Among all RTS events with TIDs, the majority were PSMed in both sMS2 and hMS2 scans. Ml2 particularly benefits from hMS2 scans, as the number of uniquely hMS2-derived TIDs is 60% higher than uniquely sMS2-derived TIDs (Fig. 5b). The RTS result of TIDs that were uniquely identified with hMS2 scans remained within the Xcorr range [0.4, 2.7] (Supplementary Fig. 6). TIDs that succeeded for sMS2 scans and hMS2 scans within the same RTS events are the best possible measure for the immediate gain in sensitivity between these two scan types. Particularly for low scoring sMS2 TIDs, hyperscores and spectral angles of the same precursor PSM increased for subsequent hMS2 spectra (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The real-time search parameters of each RTS hit event hovers above the respective linker. d The top YPAAVNTIVAI PSMs, based on spectral angle, for each scan type in DDA and NeoDiscMS demonstrate that hMS2 scans offer important improvements, including an increased number of identified fragments.

The MCTS1D130N-derived neoantigen YPAAVNTIVAI found in MI2 showcases the clear advantages of implementing NeoDiscMS for the confident discovery of clinically relevant mutated neoantigens. Based on predictions, NeoDisc ranked this neoantigen at position 186 among predicted HLA-I neoantigens, while an autologous TIL-based immunogenicity assay confirmed its immunogenicity7,9. In a hypothetical patient case where neoantigen targets for a personalized cancer vaccine are identified solely through mutanome predictions, a neoantigen ranked as low as 186 would generally be excluded from selection, as typically up to 40 top ranked neoantigens are targeted38,39,40. However, in a clinical discovery effort combining immunopeptidomics with mutanome predictions, a robust MS support for this immunogenic neoantigen would justify its inclusion. Conversely, without solid MS backing, including such a low-ranked peptide over a higher-ranked neoantigen would not be justified.

YPAAVNTIVAI was identified in all immunopeptidomic replicates with DDA, however, with only up to two PSMs per replicate. Conversely, with NeoDiscMS, repeated RTS hit events across successive acquisition cycles resulted in 9 to 13 PSMs per replicate, of which 5 to 7 of YPAAVNTIVA PSMs derived from hMS2 scans (Fig. 5a–c). Despite having a spectral angle of 0.9299, the best dMS2 YPAAVNTIVA PSM in the DDA contained only 7 fragments (b5–b9, y1 and y2), where none of the first four peptide bonds is covered by a fragmentation site (Fig. 5d). Across NeoDiscMS runs, the best dMS2, sMS2, and hMS2 had spectral angles of 0.9635, 0.9766, and 0.995. The best hMS2 PSM matched 12 fragments, (b2–b10, y1–y3), resulting in accurate and confident peptide identification. To conclude, NeoDiscMS resulted in consistent and confident YPAAVNTIVAI neoantigen detection with high spectral angles and number of matched fragments.

To demonstrate its clinical applicability, we utilized our clinical immunopeptidome pipeline9 to extract the immunopeptidome from three distinct tumor lesions (Ti1, Ti2, Ti3) of a uveal melanoma patient, with each NeoDiscMS analysis performed on the equivalent of 10 mg of tissue. We selected the top 500 predicted neoantigens as well as the top 518 predicted TAA-derived peptides as targets in a single list that was used for NeoDiscMS measurements of all three tissue samples. Our clinical routine immunopeptidomics acquisition scheme includes both DDA and DIA measurements allowing sensitive peptide-centric DIA searches against a sample-specific hybrid spectra library generated from spectrum-centric analysis of the DIA file combined with the library of generated from the DDA file9,41. Therefore, we acquired one technical DIA and NeoDiscMS acquisition for each tissue sample, using a personalized NGS-guided target database. With NeoDiscMS for each tissue sample individually, we identified 14,797, 16,033 and 11,968 unique peptides at an average length of 9.4 and with 95% of binders for Ti1, Ti2, Ti3, respectively (Fig. 6a). For all three tissues, the number of identified peptides with spectrum-centric searches of DIA data (DIA-Umpire) amounts to less than 50% of the depth that was achieved with a corresponding NeoDiscMS search. Then, we used spectral hybrid-libraries (generated from NeoDiscMS and DIA data), to search the DIA files and identified and quantified 12,917, 14,165 and 10,726 unique peptides in Ti1, Ti2, Ti3, respectively (Fig. 6a). An examination of the shared and sample-specific peptide sets revealed differences in peptide presentation across the three samples. The fraction of peptides common to all three lesions is 31% in the NeoDiscMS search and 36% in the hybrid library DIA search comparison (Fig. 6b). As the tumor mutation burden was expectedly low in this uveal melanoma tumor lesions (2.601, 2.82, and 3.615 somatic mutations/Mb for Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3, respectively), no neoantigens were identified in any of the samples. Yet, nine TAA-derived peptides were identified in total, derived from MLANA, TYR, and SAGE1, with peptide MPREDAHF from MLANA detected in the DIA files of Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3, and peptide YRALMDKSL from MLANA in Ti1, only when analyzed against the hybrid library and not with the spectrum-centric approach. Hence, we demonstrated that NeoDiscMS can be seamlessly combined with DIA to create sample-specific hybrid libraries enriched with high-confidence MS2 spectra, for the sensitive detection and quantification of the global immunopeptidome as well as target peptides (Fig. 6a, c).

a The analysis of three low-input uveal melanoma tissues (10 mg/injection) of the same patient (Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3, respectively), reveals a global depth of 12,316, 13,490, and 10,232 immunopeptides (binders only) with a DIA-NeoDiscMS hybrid-library search, with more than 95% of the identified peptides predicted as binders by MixMHCpred (%-rank <2). b Venn diagram describing the intersection of presented immunopeptides between Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3 with either a spectrum centric NeoDiscMS search (left) or a DIA-NeoDiscMS hybrid-library search (right). c Identified TAAs with either NeoDiscMS or spectrum-centric searches of DIA data, or a peptide-centric search of DIA with a DIA-NeoDiscMS hybrid-library.

In this study we present a new immunopeptidomic MS acquisition method that has been developed specifically to overcome critical challenges related to the discovery of clinically relevant antigens. Tumor-specific antigens are often present at low abundance, yet in clinical settings, they require rapid, robust, and accurate detection to enable their use as immunotherapeutic targets. Recently we reported NeoDisc, a clinical end-to-end computational pipeline that combines genomics, transcriptomics, and MS-based immunopeptidomics for the prediction and direct identification of immunogenic tumor-specific HLA-I and -II antigens from multiple sources. So far, once the NGS and MS-immunopeptidomic files have been generated, they were subjected to the NeoDisc computational integration. Here, we propose an alternative approach. Matched tumor and germline genome data, along with tumor transcriptome data, are processed with NeoDisc to create a tumor sample-specific personalized proteome reference. The reference is annotated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms and somatic mutations, which are then used for HLA binding and machine learning-based immunogenicity prediction of antigenic target peptides. From this prioritized list of targets, NeoDisc generates a personalized inclusion list for NeoDiscMS acquisition of the MS analysis of the matched tumor immunopeptidome sample, followed by a DIA acquisition. The immunopeptidomic MS data is then searched by NeoDisc against the personalized proteome to identify naturally presented peptides, refining the list to prioritize the most clinically relevant and likely immunogenic targets. This streamlined process maintains a 2-week turnaround from biopsy reception to the compilation of a ranked list of targets, for example for neoantigen vaccine manufacturing.

NeoDiscMS is a scalable, spike-in-free immunopeptidomic discovery workflow that can also operate independently of NeoDisc, using any list of target peptides of interest. Importantly, the key use case for NeoDiscMS are highly limited biopsies with strict time limits for data acquisition, whereby both target sensitivity and global depth are required. Samples are prepared following standard immunopeptidomic protocols, and, unlike other targeted approaches, no prior MS measurements of the investigated samples are required. This allows the entire sample to be utilized at once, enhancing detection and decreasing turnaround time.

During acquisition, the separation of discovery and targeted branch as well as fully customizable parameters for each scan type, facilitates maximal flexibility to optimize the trade-off between target sensitivity and global depth. The edge of NeoDiscMS over ilDDA lies in more efficient application of high-sensitivity scans. Long injection times on every analyte that is isobaric to a target within the scheduled RT window becomes increasingly troublesome as inclusion lists are scaled: the number of targets as well as the scheduled RT window size are critical for inclusion list burden. NeoDiscMS significantly reduces time spent sampling off-target ions. This leaves more time within an acquisition cycle to sample ions of other target masses or with the discovery branch. An additional advantage of NeoDiscMS is its ability to sample the same precursor up to three times per cycle, compared to a maximum of two times in ilDDA. Each MS2 scan contributes a spectrum that can yield a high-quality PSM. This increased sampling frequency explains the higher global depth and the equal or slightly improved target sensitivity observed with NeoDiscMS relative to ilDDA.

The decision tree of the targeted branch we present is simple (sMS2—RTSf—hMS2) and in the future, sophistication of RTS event designs and sMS2-hMS2 dependencies are expected to further boost the sensitivity while minimizing loss of global depth. Selective high-sensitivity scans can expand beyond the optimized ion accumulation and collisional energy parameters that we showcase to, for instance, ion mobility parameters20,42. Also, narrower isolation windows could provide cleaner spectra with less interfering peaks, at the cost of sensitivity or injection time. Dynamic definition of data aquisition parameters with help of sMS2 scans, just like the refinement of real-time search evaluation parameters, bear great potential to further advance target identification. Acquiring multiple scans of the same precursor of interest within and between cycles offers novel opportunities for peptide quantification and generation of consensus spectra. Additionally, precursor selection parameters like adjusted minimal intensity thresholds or better integration of inclusion list and RTS FASTA as well as optimized target precursor selection offer further possibilities for refinement.

The targeted branch of NeoDiscMS is committed to the holy grail of clinical immunopeptidomics: the direct identification of cancer-specific antigens. Yet, we would like to highlight the substantial importance of the discovery branch that provides global depth in a DDA-like fashion. Firstly, the global immunopeptidome informs us about dynamics of antigen processing and presentation hotspot features, as well as defects in antigen processing and presentation, which can directly inform immunogenicity predictions and neoantigen prioritization7,9,10,43,44,45. Naturally, the discovery branch can also contribute additional spectra of the targets as well as of other non-targeted exploratory antigen candidates. One great advantage of mass spectrometry data is that it can be re-processed with new search settings and software to extract new information or build large databases36,46,47. The discovery branch provides the bulk, in absolute terms, of high-quality spectra in a NeoDiscMS data file, being “TopN”-sampled, and provide utility for this purpose. Furthermore, the PSMs that the discovery branch yields during data processing enables statistically solid FDR calculations48 by providing highly diverse target and decoy matches, without being restricted to only sampling ions that correspond to the ~5000 masses in the inclusion list of the targeted branch. Additionally, high-quality PSMs by the discovery branch are very likely to be identified and instrumental for effective feature extraction in rescoring algorithms such as MSBooster47. As such, the discovery branch provides not only additional depth but also enables the effective bioinformatic data processing with commonly used search engines so that targets can be identified from the targeted branch with higher sensitivity.

Being able to process data with popular proteomics tools such as MSFragger49, is crucial for the user-friendliness of the NeoDiscMS approach. The application of chimeric spectrum deconvolution and wide isolation windows in the discovery branch boosts global coverage while maintaining high identification quality. As such, we show that chimeric spectrum deconvolution with MSFragger-DDA+ can be applied to immunopeptidomics data to great benefit. While NeoDiscMS can be seamlessly processed by MSFragger, we also show how NeoDiscMS offers opportunities for more extensive data processing for MS2-based quantification of precursors that were identified as the isolated mass multiple times.

Our data shows that the targeted and the discovery branches contribute improvements to NeoDiscMS compared to conventional DDA approaches. The increased isolation window size in combination with chimeric spectral deconvolution results in increased immunopeptidome depth, as shown in a direct comparison of regular and wide window isolation windows on the same sample, analyzed with MSFragger-DDA or MSFragger-DDA+. With the help of JY, RA957, and melanoma-derived cell lines, we show that the targeted branch improved target identification significantly, consistently, and in a scalable manner. By examining RTS event dynamics, we show how and at what rate sMS2 and RTSf selectively trigger high-sensitivity scans. This analysis reveals the individual contributions of sMS2 and hMS2 scans. We highlight YPAAVNTIVAI, an immunogenic neoantigen that is a direct beneficiary of the increased sensitivity that NeoDiscMS offers: YPAAVNTIVAI's identification confidence clearly and consistently improves with NeoDiscMS compared to DDA.

We demonstrate the clinical utility of NeoDiscMS with a set of three low-input tumor biopsies. By simulating a clinical setting, we achieve substantial depth as well as the identification of TAA-derived peptides and demonstrate interoperability with DIA library searching strategies. Spectrum-centric searches of DIA data yielded substantially fewer peptide identifications compared to NeoDiscMS (Fig. 6a). This makes NeoDiscMS a suitable candidate for library building to fully harness the power of DIA library searches. Alternatively, experimental libraries can be replaced with computationally predicted libraries. This approach holds great promise, yet it's performance to provide more depth in immunopeptidomics compared to experimental libraries is, to date, situational41,50,51. Also, accurate FDR calculations for large-scale predicted libraries for peptide-centric searches might face processing-specific challenges that need to be evaluated and addressed, just as it is the case for DDA database searches52,53. Besides the construction of experimental libraries, another key complementary feature of NeoDiscMS to DIA is that it provides low-complexity spectra with its targeted branch, compared to DIA MS2 spectra. This is crucial when identifying peptides for clinical prioritization, where manual inspection of signal and background fragments of candidate PSMs is common. The manual inspection and validation of a PSM from DIA MS2 spectra is virtually impossible due to its massive complexity, even for the most advanced experts. If data acquisition approaches that are still being developed, such as narrow-window DIA54, will shift this balance remains to be seen.

At the time of writing, the instruments equipped with vendor-supported acquisition method editors that enable implementation of NeoDiscMS are the Orbitrap Eclipse and Orbitrap Ascend (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific's Tribrid Mass Spectrometer series). We envision broader vendor adoption of this approach in the future, as well as the integration of advanced RTS capabilities that extend beyond immunopeptidomics applications.

NeoDiscMS is, to our knowledge, the first personalized immunopeptidomics data acquisition strategy tailored to the needs of a proteogenomics-based clinical T-cell antigen discovery pipeline. Besides analytical aspects, its guiding design principles were oriented towards modularity, flexibility, and user-friendliness. We conclude that NeoDiscMS advances proteogenomic-based antigen discovery with all its clinical benefits for the development of cancer therapies. Generation of NeoDiscMS files (target selection, FASTA database, and inclusion list) is integrated within NeoDisc v1.7.1 and is available through https://neodisc.unil.ch/.

An informed written consent was given by the participants, according to the requirements of the local Ethics Committee institutional review board (Ethics Commission, Commission cantonale d'éthique de la recherche sur l'être humain (CER-VD) Centre hospitalier universitaire Vaudois, CHUV). Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3 samples used in this investigation were collected from the patient during the screening process for inclusion in a Phase 1 trial (NCT04643574), following enrollment in a research protocol approved by the local Ethics Committee (Commission cantonale d'éthique de la recherche sur l'être humain (CER-VD); BASEC ID 2017-00305). Tumor cell lines were generated as described in Huber et al.9. Ml1 and Ml2, including immunogenicity assessments and NGS data, are the same as described in Müller et al.7, where they equate to patient1 and patient3, respectively. Ml3, including immunogenicity assessments, corresponds to Mel-4 P1 HLA-I high cells, stimulated with 100 U/mL of Interferon-γ (Miltenyi Biotec, ref. 130-096-482), as described in Huber et al.9. HLA-restricted TAA immunogenicity assessments are derived from CEDAR37.

All cells were expanded in cell culture medium (Gibco, ref. 61870-010) with 10% of heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco, ref. 10437-028) and 100 U/mL P/S (BioConcept, cat No. 4-01F00-H). To harvest the JY (ATCC, ref. 77441) and RA957 cell lines we collected the cell culture medium containing the cells in suspension, removed the medium, and washed cell twice in PBS (Bichsel, ref. 100 0 324). To harvest melanoma cell lines we removed the cell culture medium, washed the cells with PBS, detached cells from the flask surface with Trypsin (BioConcept, ref. 5-51F00-H), inactivated trypsin with cell culture medium, and washed the cells twice with PBS. We stored cells in pellets of 108 at −80 °C.

For immunopeptide enrichment we harvested W6/32 antibodies from HB-95 hybridoma cells (HB-95, ATCC), cross-linked them with DTT to Sepharose beads (Invitrogen, ref. 101042). We then lysed our samples with 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich, ref. 30970), 0.2 mM IAA (Sigma, ref. I6125-5g), 1 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. 15575-038), 1:200 PIC (Roche, ref. 04693132001), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche, ref. 10837091001), 1% octyl-beta-D glucopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, ref. 08001) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lines were just resuspended in lysis buffer, tissue samples were first homogenized with a bead homogenizer (Tissue Lyser II, Qiagen) for 1 min at 30 Hz. We then centrifuged lysates for 50 min at 20,000 RCF at 4 °C. To isolate HLA-peptide complexes, we applied the workflow presented in Chong et al.55. Shortly, 96-well plates were conditioned and mounted with 75 µl of cross-linked beads. We then added each sample's lysate to a well. After the lysate drained, we washed each well with varying salt concentrations and eluted the captured HLA-peptide complexes with 1% TFA (Merck Millipore, ref. 1082620100). Then we desalted and isolated immunopeptides with the help of C18 columns, using 28% ACN (Biosolve, UN 1648), 0.1% TFA as an elution buffer. The peptides eluted from the C18 column were dried in a vacuum concentrator (Concentrator plus, Eppendorf) and stored at −80 °C. Prior to MS analysis, peptides were re-suspended in 30 µl (cell lines) or 18 µl (tissue samples) 0.1 %TFA. MS iRT kit peptides (Biognosys, ref. Ki-3002-2) were spiked into the peptidomic samples according to the supplier's instructions.

For all experiments with cell lines, we isolated immunopeptides from samples of 108 cells each. For all experiments with tissues, we processed ~60 mg of each tissue. For cell lines, we injected an equivalent of 5*106 or 107 cells (Supplementary Data 1). For tissue cells, we injected equivalents of ~10 mg of tissue. For the dilution experiment, RA957 immunopeptidome was diluted in the JY immunopeptidome at the ratios of 1/1024, 1/256, 1/64, and 1/16. In addition, we included a negative control sample with only the JY peptides. Importantly, all samples contained equal amount of JY peptides.

WES and RNAseq libraries were prepared as described in Huber et al.9. Briefly, DNA was extracted with the commercially available DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, ref. 69504) according to the manufacturer's protocols. RNA was extracted by phase separation using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. 15596-026) and chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich, ref. C2432-25ML) and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Then, the aqueous phase containing the RNA was collected, mixed with 70% ethanol and loaded on an RNeasy mini spin column from the total RNA isolation RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, ref. 74104). The rest of the protocol was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (including DNase I (Qiagen, ref. 79254) on-column digestion). WES and RNAseq libraries were prepared and sequenced at Microsynth using the Agilent SureSelect XT Human All exome V7 kit (Agilent, ref. 5191-4028) and the Illumina Truseq stranded mRNA reagents (Illumina, ref. 20020594). The sequencing was performed on the NextSeq 500/550 system.

NeoDisc v1.7.0 was used for neoantigen discovery and prioritization9. The pipeline was run in fastq mode using default parameters for single-sample analysis on paired germline and tumor whole-exome sequencing data, along with matched tumor RNA sequencing data. Peptide lengths for HLA-I and HLA-II predictions were defined in the configuration file as 8–12 and 12–15 amino acids, respectively, with binding affinity thresholds set to ≤2.0% for both HLA-I and HLA-II predictions.

Following single-sample analyses, results were combined using NeoDisc's MergeSamples tool to facilitate multi-sample integration and prioritize tumor-specific antigens.

The NeoDiscMS approach require the generation of a list of target peptides. In this study we tested the performance with ~1500 targets sequences. In general, any peptide sequence can be included as target.

For the JY-RA957 dilution experiment, we selected RA957-specific HLA-I bound peptides identified in previously published eight raw files of RA957 immunopeptidome samples55. We processed the raw files with MSFragger-DDA+ and filtered all identified peptides to retain peptides of length 8–11, that occurred in all eight measurements, were predicted by MixMHCpred36 (v2.3) to be A*68:01 binders with binding %-rank <2, and did not have a %-rank  <10% for any other RA957 or JY alleles. This yielded 1525 peptide targets.

For each of the melanoma cell lines Ml1, Ml2, and Ml3, 500 predicted neoantigens with %-rank <3% were selected based on their prioritization by NeoDisc9. In addition, we supplemented the inclusion lists with peptides derived from three-frame translation of TAA genes (Supplementary Data 2). Here, we filtered all 8–14mers so that each had %-rank of <2 for at least two HLA-A or HLA-B alleles of the respective melanoma cell lines. We then selected those 1000 peptides for each melanoma cell line that had the highest %-ranks for any of the alleles of the respective patient's haplotype. Sample HLA-typing information can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

For the melanoma tissues Ti1, Ti2, and TI3, the 500 top neoantigens as prioritized by NeoDisc were selected as targets. Additionally, we added the 518 TAA-derived class I peptides that were predicted by NeoDisc in the “ExpressedTAAs” table. Sample HLA-typing information can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

To efficiently schedule inclusion list entries and improve target detection, retention time prediction for target peptides is recommended. This approach minimizes the need for targeted scans to search for all peptides across the entire gradient, thereby reducing the loss in global coverage. For retention time prediction, the following are required: (1) retention times of calibration peptides, (2) a list of target peptides, and (3) a retention time prediction tool, such as DeepLC56. We used calibration peptide retention times derived from PSMs from a preceding tryptic HeLa digest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref. 88329) DDA measurement with the same LC gradient as the NeoDiscMS method. The calibration run should ideally be conducted shortly before the NeoDiscMS measurements and on the same column, ensuring multiple washed between them to minimize carry over. A spectral library was generated from the calibration run with FragPipe (v22.0) with default settings for tryptic digests, including methionine oxidation as a variable modification. Next, we predicted the RT of our list of targets with DeepLC (v3.1.1), with help of the RT peptide calibration file. Importantly, we included all methionine oxidation variations of target peptide sequences. To schedule our inclusion list, we created windows of ±15 min around the RT of each modified peptide (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Last, we generated the inclusion lists in the format dictated by manufacturer's method development software Thermo Xcalibur Instrument Setup (v2.0), including peptides with charge states 1–3.

For the RTS, we created dedicated FASTA files that consisted individual target peptide sequences as entries. For the melanoma cell line and the clinical tissue experiments, RTS FASTA headers were annotated as neoantigen or TAA. An example of sample Ml3 for the DeepLC calibration peptides file, DeepLC target peptides file, scheduled inclusion list, as well as a FASTA needed for RTS are provided as Supplementary Data 3–6.

An example acquisition tree, as seen in Thermo Xcalibur Instrument Setup, the order of adding the acquisition tree parameters with the drag-and-drop buttons, as well as where to find real-time search parameters is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1.

For all NeoDiscMS experiments, RTS parameters were set as visualized in Supplementary Fig. 1. Across experiments, settings remained the same apart from the inclusion list and FASTA used. Importantly, at the time of writing, all methods that apply RTS required a digestion enzyme as an input. Nevertheless, the database search then takes all digested peptides as well as the full FASTA sequences into account. Since the FASTA entries directly reflected the peptide sequences, we aimed to minimize forced digestion. In addition, no static modifications were allowed, and methionine oxidation was set as the only variable modification. We allowed up to three variable modifications/peptide. Maximum search time was set to 40 ms. To pass RTSf, the scoring thresholds were set to Xcorr -> 0.4, dCn -> 0, Precursor PPM -> 5 for charge states 1–3.

For all DIA experiments, we applied an MS1 mass range of 300–1650Th at a resolution of 120,000 and 27 DIA windows of sizes [37, 30, 24, 24, 22, 23, 44, 21, 24, 24, 25, 27, 27, 30, 35, 38, 43, 53, 72, 103, 594] with an AGC target of 2000%, the injection time set to auto, MS2 mass resolution set to 30,000, and a stepped CE of [27, 30, 32].

The injection volumes of each sample as well as the respective sample input are indicated in Supplementary Data 1. DDA, ilDDA, and NeoDiscMS acquisition cycles were constructed as described in Fig. 1b. Cycle times for all methods are 3 s. Detailed scan type parameters for all scan types are described in Supplementary Table 3. For ilDDA and NeoDiscMS, the according inclusion list/FASTA was included in the method.

We used an Easy-nLC 1200 coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Our analytical columns were 450 mm long with an inner diameter of 75 μm and an 8 μm tip (TSP-075375, BGB Analytik). For column packing we used C18 beads with a particle size of 1.9 µm and a pore size of 120 angstrom (r119.aq, Dr. Maisch). For all experiments, LC gradients used 0.1% formic acid (Thermo Scientific, prod nr. 85178) as solvent A and 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid as solvent B, a gradient length of 125 min, and a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The gradient consisted of multiple, linear increases of solvent B: 0–110 min with 2–25%, 110–114 min with 25–35%, 114–115 min with 35–100%, 115–125 min with 100%.

To generate a calibration run for the DeepLC RT prediction, we injected 100 ng of tryptic HeLa digest that was measured with the same gradient above, with a MSFragger-DDA database search with all human Swissprot57 sequences without isoforms (28.3.2024, 20419 entries) as well as the “common contaminants” list provided by FragPipe. We kept all default setting for tryptic searches in place.

For immunopeptidomics searches with MSFragger-DDA, we applied a DDA database search with all human Swissprot sequences without isoforms (28.3.2024, 20,419 entries) as well as iRT peptide sequences and the “common contaminants” list provided by Fragpipe as a FASTA database. Digestion was set to unspecific, peptides of lengths 8–14 were included. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and cysteine carbamidomethylation were set as variable modifications. Only precursors with charges 1–3 were permitted for PSMing. Protein FDR was set to 1. Peptide, ion, and psm FDRs were set to 0.01. For immunopeptidomics searches with MSFragger-DDA+ we applied DDA+ database searches with different FASTA databases for different experiments, though they were all concatenated with iRT peptide sequences and the “common contaminants” list provided by Fragpipe. For the JY- and RA957-based experiments we used all human Swissprot sequences without isoforms (28.3.2024, 20,419 entries). For melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissues the respective sample-specific FASTA generated by NeoDisc were used. Digestion was set to unspecific, peptides of lengths 8–14 were included. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and cysteine carbamidomethylation were set as variable modifications. Only precursors with charges 1–3 were permitted for PSMing. DDA+-specific parameters were left at default. Protein FDR was set to 1. Peptide, ion, and psm FDR was set to 0.01 for with the SwissProt FASTA or 0.03 with group-specificity52,58 for searches with NeoDisc FASTAs, respectively.

For elution profile visualization, raw files and target precursor sequence were imported into Skyline v22.259 for visualization.

For the spectrum-centric search with DIA-Umpire of DIA data from the melanoma tissue experiment, we did a database search with DIA-Umpire using a NeoDisc-generated FASTA. Digestion was set to unspecific, peptides of lengths 8–14 were included. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal acetylation and cysteine carbamidomethylation were set as variable modifications. DIA-Umpire-specific parameters were left at default. Only precursors with charges 1–3 were permitted for PSMing. Protein FDR was set to 1. Peptide, ion, and PSM FDR was set to 0.03 with group-specificity.

From the libraries generated with a spectrum-centric search of the respective DIA data and the NeoDiscMS MSFragger-DDA+ results of either Ti1, Ti2, or Ti3, we generated a hybrid library for each tissue separately. We used said hybrid library, per tissue, for a peptide-centric search of the DIA data with DIA-NN. FDR was set to 0.01.

For immunopeptidomics data analysis we extracted psm.tsv output files of all spectrum-centric searches and report.tsv of all peptide-centric searches for data analysis. For peptide binding affinity prediction we used MixMHCpred36 (v2.3). Data wrangling as well as analysis was done in R and Julia. Raw file header information was extracted in R with help of the rawrr60 package (v1.12.0). To calculate precursor intensities per raw file we extracted the highest precursor PSM intensity for each precursor separately. We calculated peptide intensities by adding up all precursor intensities of a given peptide sequence. Data visualization was done with R in Rstudio with packages ggplot261 (v3.5.1), ggseqlogo62 (v0.2), ggside (v0.3.1), patchwork (v1.3.0), ggh4x (v0.2.8), gt (v0.11.0).

NeoDiscMS was introduced in NeoDisc v1.7.1 and can be executed through three steps: (1) Run NeoDisc to identify and prioritize immunogenic tumor-specific antigens from NGS data and predict their chromatographic RTs, (2) perform NeoDiscMS-based measurements of the immunopeptidome, (3) resume the NeoDisc workflow to search NeoDiscMS immunopeptidomic files against personalized references, followed by prioritization of tumor-specific antigens.

By running NeoDisc in fastq mode with the -neodiscmsselect flag, the user has to provide and specify in the configuration file a MS raw file of either shotgun proteomics or immunopeptidomics, as NEODISCMS_CALIBRATION parameter, that will be searched by FragPipe v22.0 for creating a calibration library used for RT prediction. This search is done against a GENCODE v43 protein-coding sequence reference, accounting for peptide modifications and the maximum number of modifications per peptide defined in the configuration file (MS_MODIFICATIONS and MS_MAXMODSPERPEPTIDE parameters). NeoDisc then partitions the prioritized HLA-I- and HLA-II-restricted peptide sequences into neoantigens, TAAs, and viral peptides, with the number of peptides in each group, as determined by the user in the NeoDisc configuration file (NEODISCMS_NEOCI, NEODISCMS_TAACI, NEODISCMS_VIRCI, NEODISCMS_NEOCII, NEODISCMS_TAACII, NEODISCMS_VIRCII). Their retention times is then predicted by DeepLC56 v2.2.36, where the above mentioned calibration run library (peptide identification list with measured retention times) is used, and by considering peptide modifications (MS_MODIFICATIONS and MS_MAXMODSPERPEPTIDE), maximum charges per peptide (NEODISCMS_CHARGES), collision energy (NEODISCMS_CE), gradient length (NEODISCMS_GRADIENT), and the retention-time window width (NEODISCMS_WINRT) as defined in the NeoDisc configuration file. NeoDisc generates separate lists of HLA-I and HLA-II target peptide sequences (fasta) along with their predicted retention times (csv) specifically designed for NeoDiscMS measurements. After completing the NeoDiscMS measurements, the resulting raw files are added to the configuration file under MS_SPECTRA_SAMPLES, MS_SPECTRA_HLA_I, and MS_SPECTRA_HLA_II. The NeoDisc analysis is then resumed in fastq mode using the -neodiscms flag. This step involves searching the NeoDiscMS immunopeptidomic raw files with both Comet v2024.02_0 - NewAnce v1.7.5 and Fragpipe v22.0 DDA+ against the personalized references generated by NeoDisc. The results are subsequently integrated into the final NeoDisc analysis and prioritization.

To ensure reproducibility of results we performed all comparisons of different conditions in triplicates, as commonly used in the field. No data was excluded. To investigate different technical conditions, such as different acquisition parameters, measurements were randomized.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Raw files and real-time search tables generated during the acquisition, as well as identified PSMs of NeoDiscMS measurement, have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE63 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD059824. Immunogenicity assessments and NGS data for Ml1 and Ml2 were described in Müller et al.7, where they equate to patient1 and patient3, respectively. NGS and immunogenicity assessments for Ml3 is reported in Huber et al.9, corresponds to Mel-4 P1 HLA-I high cells. WES and RNAseq data for TI1, Ti2, and Ti3 is deposited on the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) with the dataset identifier EGAD50000001422.

NeoDiscMS is integrated within NeoDisc v1.8.0 and is available at https://neodisc.unil.ch/.

About 56 million years ago, when Earth experienced a dramatic rise in global temperatures, one meat-eating mammal responded in a surprising way: It started eating more bones.

That's the conclusion reached by a Rutgers-led team of researchers, whose recent study of fossil teeth from the extinct predator Dissacus praenuntius reveals how animals adapted to a period of extreme climate change known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The findings, published in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, could help scientists predict how today's wildlife might respond to modern global warming.

"What happened during the PETM very much mirrors what's happening today and what will happen in the future," said Andrew Schwartz, a doctoral student in the Department of Anthropology at the School of Arts and Sciences, who led the research. "We're seeing the same patterns. Carbon dioxide levels are rising, temperatures are higher and ecosystems are being disrupted."

Associate Professor Robert Scott of the Department of Anthropology is a co-author of the study.

Schwartz, Scott and another colleague used a technique called dental microwear texture analysis to study the tiny pits and scratches left on fossilized teeth. These marks reveal what kinds of food the animal was chewing in the weeks before it died.

The ancient omnivore was about the size of a jackal or a coyote and likely consumed a mix of meat and other food sources like fruits and insects. "They looked superficially like wolves with oversized heads," Schwartz said, describing them as "super weird mammals." "Their teeth were kind of like hyenas. But they had little tiny hooves on each of their toes."

Before this period of rising temperatures, Dissacus had a diet similar to modern cheetahs, eating mostly tough flesh. But during and after this ancient period, its teeth showed signs of crunching harder materials, such as bones.

"We found that their dental microwear looked more like that of lions and hyenas," Schwartz said. "That suggests they were eating more brittle food, which were probably bones, because their usual prey was smaller or less available."

This dietary shift happened alongside a modest reduction in body size, likely because of food scarcity. While earlier hypotheses blamed shrinking animals on hotter temperatures alone, this latest research suggests that limited food played a bigger role, Schwartz said.

This period of rapid global warming lasted about 200,000 years, but the changes it triggered were fast and dramatic. Schwartz said studies of the past like his can offer practical lessons for today and what comes next.

"One of the best ways to know what's going to happen in the future is to look back at the past," he said. "How did animals change? How did ecosystems respond?"

The findings also highlight the importance of dietary flexibility, he said. Animals that can eat a variety of foods are more likely to survive environmental stress.

"In the short term, it's great to be the best at what you do," Schwartz said. "But in the long term, it's risky. Generalists, meaning animals that are good at a lot of things, are more likely to survive when the environment changes."

Such an insight may be helpful for modern conservation biologists, allowing them to identify which species today may be most vulnerable, he said. Animals with narrow diets, such as pandas, may struggle as their habitats shrink. But adaptable species, including jackals or raccoons, might fare better.

"We already see this happening," Schwartz said. "In my earlier research, jackals in Africa started eating more bones and insects over time, probably because of habitat loss and climate stress."

The study also showed that rapid climate warming as seen during the ancient past can lead to major changes in ecosystems, including shifts in available prey and changes in predator behavior. This may suggest that modern climate change could similarly disrupt food webs and force animals to adapt, or risk extinction, he said.

Even though Dissacus was a successful and adaptable animal that lived for about 15 million years, it eventually went extinct. Scientists think this happened because of changes in the environment and competition from other animals, Schwartz said.

Schwartz conducted his research using a combination of fieldwork and lab analysis, focusing on fossil specimens from the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming, a site with a rich and continuous fossil record spanning millions of years. Schwartz chose the location because it preserves a detailed sequence of environmental and ecological changes during the ancient period of climate warming.

Schwartz has been interested in paleontology, specifically dinosaurs, since he was a boy, journeying with his father, an amateur fossil hunter, on treks through New Jersey's rivers and streams. Now, as a late-stage doctoral student, he hopes to use ancient fossils to answer urgent questions about the future.

He also wants to inspire the next generation of researchers.

"I love sharing this work," he said. "If I see a kid in a museum looking at a dinosaur, I say, 'Hey, I'm a paleontologist. You can do this, too.'"

In addition to Schwartz and Scott, Larisa DeSantis of Vanderbilt University is an author of the study.

A University of Queensland-led study has found Australian skinks have evolved molecular armor to stop snake venom from shutting down their muscles.

Professor Bryan Fry from UQ's School of the Environment said revealing exactly how skinks dodge death could inform biomedical approaches to treating snakebite in people.

"What we saw in skinks was evolution at its most ingenious," Professor Fry said.

"Australian skinks have evolved tiny changes in a critical muscle receptor, called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

"This receptor is normally the target of neurotoxins which bind to it and block nerve-muscle communication causing rapid paralysis and death.

"But in a stunning example of a natural counterpunch, we found that on 25 occasions skinks independently developed mutations at that binding site to block venom from attaching.

"It's a testament to the massive evolutionary pressure than venomous snakes exerted after their arrival and spread across the Australian continent, when they would have feasted on the defenseless lizards of the day.

"Incredibly, the same mutations evolved in other animals like mongooses which feed on cobras.

"We confirmed with our functional testing that Australia's Major Skink (Bellatorias frerei) has evolved exactly the same resistance mutation that gives the honey badger it's famous resistance to cobra venom.

"To see this same type of resistance evolve in a lizard and a mammal is quite remarkable - evolution keeps hitting the same molecular bullseye."

The muscle receptor mutations in the skinks included a mechanism to add sugar molecules to physically block toxins and the substitution of a protein building block (amino acid arginine at position 187).

The laboratory work validating the mutations was carried out at UQ's Adaptive Biotoxicology Laboratory by Dr Uthpala Chandrasekara who said it was incredible to witness.

"We used synthetic peptides and receptor models to mimic what happens when venom enters an animal at the molecular level and the data was crystal clear, some of the modified receptors simply didn't respond at all," said Dr Chandrasekara.

"It's fascinating to think that one tiny change in a protein can mean the difference between life and death when facing a highly venomous predator."

The findings could one day inform the development of novel antivenoms or therapeutic agents to counter neurotoxic venoms.

"Understanding how nature neutralizes venom can offer clues for biomedical innovation," Dr Chandrasekara said.

"The more we learn about how venom resistance works in nature, the more tools we have for the design of novel antivenoms."

The project included collaborations with museums across Australia.

The research has been published in International Journal of Molecular Sciences.

Children inherit two copies of most genes from their parents, but one copy of certain genes can be silenced.  Credit: Oscar Wong/Getty

The effect of a gene can vary greatly — and sometimes be the complete opposite — depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or the father. Some genetic variants can, for instance, increase a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes when inherited from the father, but lower it when inherited from the mother. But such effects have been challenging to unpick owing to gaps in genomic data. A study published in Nature this week describes a statistical method used to identify at least 30 parent-of-origin effects1 in 14 genes.

When a child is conceived, it inherits two copies of almost every gene — one from each parent — and both are generally turned either on or off. But in some regions of the genome, one copy can be turned on, or expressed, while the other is silenced. This can lead to ‘imprinting' disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which is usually caused by a missing or non-functional paternal copy of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. In contrast, a missing or non-functional maternal copy can cause Angelman syndrome.

Researchers have for decades suggested that the silencing of certain genes is driven by an evolutionary conflict between maternal and parental origin. For instance, the expression of paternal genes would promote the growth of offspring during pregnancy, but that would come at the cost of the mother's resources. By contrast, the expression of maternal genes would help to conserve the mother's resources so that she can have more children at the expense of her current offspring's growth. But studying how parent-of-origin variants affect human traits is difficult because researchers usually need genomic data from a person and their parents, which are not often available.

To avoid the need for parental genomic data, a research team in Europe and the United States developed a statistical method that can infer the parent of origin for genetic variants using genomic data that are available from any relatives.

The team determined the parental origin of genes for nearly 109,000 people whose genomic data are included in the UK Biobank. Among those, they identified roughly 30 variants that had differing effects on growth and metabolism, including 19 that had a ‘bipolar' effect, meaning that it would have opposite effects depending on which parent it came from. Around half of these bipolar variants were located on chromosome 11, which hosts a large cluster of imprinted genes associated with controlling growth. One of these variants increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 14% when inherited from the father but decreased it by 9% when inherited from the mother.

The team repeated its analysis and confirmed its findings with data for 85,000 people in the Estonian Biobank and 42,000 in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. They also used the Norwegian and UK data to show that a variant on a gene called KLF14 was associated with a higher body mass index in infancy if it was inherited from the mother.

A string of previously undisclosed break-ins at Tennessee National Guard armories last fall marks the latest in a growing series of security breaches at military facilities across the United States, raising fresh concerns about the vulnerability of US armories to theft and intrusion.

A confidential memo from the Tennessee Fusion Center reviewed by WIRED details four break-ins at Tennessee National Guard armories over a seven-week span. In one incident, thieves made off with night vision goggles, laser target locators, and thermal weapons sights, among other equipment. At others, intruders breached fences, tripped alarms, and gained access to supply rooms discovered in the aftermath to have been unlocked.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

At least some of the break-ins seem to point to potential insider help. In Covington, Tennessee, for example, evidence suggests intruders may have known in advance the location of a secure key control box. At other sites, attempts were made to bypass alarms and entry points.

The memo, which was intended solely for law enforcement use, does not indicate that any weapons were stolen; however, a government anti-terrorism coordinator is quoted as saying: “These events are concerning not only due to the stolen items being sensitive in nature but also because of the indicators for some insider knowledge being needed for successful breach and theft.”

The document, first obtained by the nonprofit watchdog group Property of the People, was shared exclusively with WIRED.

The break-ins remain under active investigation and have drawn the attention of the Pentagon's Office of the Provost Marshal General—the US Army's leading law enforcement authority. A senior police source informed WIRED on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation. The FBI declined to confirm.

“FBI policy prohibits confirming or denying an investigation unless in rare circumstances when publicity would help the investigation, such as in seeking a missing child or trying to identify a bank robber,” Elizabeth Clement-Webb, an FBI public affairs officer, says. “The matter you're inquiring about does not meet that exception, so it would not be appropriate to comment.”

The Pentagon referred questions to the National Guard. The Guard did not respond to a request for comment.

Initially regarded as isolated incidents, the memo cites years' worth of FBI and Defense Department reporting on what agents call “domestic violent extremists,” or DVEs, discussing plans to raid armories for weapons and gear, leading analysts to suspect organized activity. Domestic intelligence has consistently flagged violent militia members and racially motivated extremists eyeing armories as soft targets.

“Although DVEs previously have stolen some lower-level military gear, the FBI has not identified any instances in which a DVE successfully raided an armory to steal heavy military equipment,” the memo reads. “To circumvent such a raid, FBI and DoD are enhancing liaison with local armories and military facilities to address gaps in reporting about current plots to exploit armory vulnerabilities and increase opportunities to detect and prevent DVE theft of military equipment.”

Between 2020 and 2024, the memo says, at least four FBI subjects discussed raiding military facilities for heavy weapons, including .50-caliber firearms and machine guns. Three had confirmed military backgrounds. One—a former Guard member—identified specific armories that he had served in, while describing how best to exploit their security. It's unclear whether any charges were brought.

Extremist chatter cited by the document echos these ambitions. In early 2024, a militia-linked Telegram user proposed assessing armory vulnerabilities with help from sympathetic firefighters and sought military or law enforcement recruits for inside information. In another case, an active-duty tank commander claimed he could sway an armorer to hand over weapons, while a former Air Force contractor talked about raiding a Guard facility to seize mortars and secure land.

Together, these incidents point to a persistent and ideologically varied interest in exploiting armory weaknesses. The Tennessee break-ins, meanwhile, preceded several other armory breaches around the country, underscoring a broader trend in security threats.

"Especially when coupled with more recent events, the document makes clear that violent neo-Nazis and far-right militia groups continue to pose a serious and ongoing threat—and that state governments are failing in their duty to secure dangerous military hardware,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People.

This year alone, thieves stole three Humvees and other military gear from an Army Reserve center in Tustin, California; raided storage containers at a Colorado National Guard facility; and allegedly attempted to steal body armor and communications gear from a US Army Ranger site in Washington. In the latter case, law enforcement claim the suspects used their status as veterans to gain entry to the base, highlighting ongoing concerns about insider access.

Similarly, a break-in at a Massachusetts Army Reserve center in 2015—during which numerous rifles and pistols were stolen—was carried out by a former service member, later sentenced to 11 years in prison. Their familiarity with the facility's security systems and physical layout reportedly enabled the robbery.

For decades, US military stockpiles have been prime targets for high-stakes theft. In the 1970s, arms traffickers raided facilities in California, escaping with caches of powerful weapons. A 1976 heist at a Massachusetts armory turned up a shoulder-fired missile launcher. And in 1995, a former soldier commandeered a tank in San Diego, leading police of a destructive, city-wide chase.

Despite repeated policy changes and years of heightened scrutiny, the nation's thousands of armories remain vulnerable to both external intruders and those with insider access. Modern security improvements have done little to deter interest in breaching them. In Tennessee alone, the fusion center memo notes that state officials have received at least 25 suspicious activity reports over the past decade, detailing attempted surveillance and theft.

Luke Baumgartner, a former Army officer and extremism researcher at George Washington University, says the Tennessee armory break-ins do appear to bear the hallmarks of an inside job—assuming suspicions about the intruders knowing the locations of secure keys are accurate.

“It's not an uncommon occurrence,” he says, pointing to the recent thefts at Washington's Joint Base Lewis-McChord. In June, the FBI arrested two former service members for their alleged involvement in the thefts and the hammer assault of a soldier on base. The FBI recovered a stockpile of weapons found in the suspects' home, amid an assortment of Nazi iconography and white supremacist literature.

Extremist ties to the military can run in both directions, Baumgartner explains: Some groups actively recruit veterans, contractors, and even active-duty troops to exploit their skills and access. Others will join the military explicitly to gain tactical training, weapons experience, and insider knowledge they can later pass on.

Weapons, meanwhile, aren't the only concern. “There's sensitive equipment in there,” he says. “There's secure radios. There's equipment that contains classified information. You have to have a certain level of clearance to access some of that.”

Such heists could also carry symbolic weight for anti-government extremists, Baumgartner says, by casting the federal government as weaker than it appears. “To the casual observer, what it signals is that even institutions we think of as being shielded from this sort of action are not actually immune.”

USAFacts, the nonpartisan non-profit organization led by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, rarely weighs in on political controversies. But the firestorm surrounding the firing of the nation's top employment statistician strikes directly at what it depends on most: reliable federal data.

“Undermining trust in official statistics threatens the integrity of the data that millions of Americans — from business leaders to everyday voters — depend on to understand our economy,” the Bellevue-based organization said in a public statement after President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday.

“Data about jobs, prices, and wages belong to the American people,” USA Facts added in its statement. “Their tax dollars fund this work, and they deserve information that is accurate, timely, and free from political interference.”

The firing of the BLS leader came hours after the agency reported weaker-than-expected July jobs numbers and significant downward revisions to prior months' data. 

Without citing evidence, Trump accused McEntarfer of rigging the numbers “for political purposes” and said he would replace her with “someone much more competent and qualified.”

USAFacts depends on government data to generate its analysis and reports, so the timeliness and accuracy of federal numbers are critical to its work. BLS provides many economic indicators beyond the monthly jobs numbers — including inflation, unemployment, and wage data.

In an interview this week, Nicole Bateman, USAFacts' senior research manager, said the organization remains confident in the accuracy of BLS data. It's part of the normal process for jobs data to be revised as the agency receives more complete responses from its surveys.

When asked about USAFacts' take on the firing, Bateman said: “It's essential that that agency remain independent and free of political interference, as it has been for its history.”

USAFacts is already tracking delays in other federal data — including immigration statistics and climate disaster reports — but BLS data continues to flow normally.

However, Bateman acknowledged that McEntarfer's removal “has raised concerns around the politicization of data, really on both sides of the aisle.”

The concerns extend well beyond USAFacts. Banks are reportedly getting anxious calls from clients worried about the reliability of U.S. economic data, with JPMorgan's chief economist warning that politicization of the data collection process poses a threat to financial markets on par with Trump's attempts to influence Federal Reserve decisions. 

The $2.1 trillion market for Treasury inflation-protected securities, where payouts are based on BLS consumer price data, could be particularly vulnerable.

Beyond the political controversy, BLS faces real technical challenges. Survey response rates for BLS's Current Population Survey have plummeted from 90% in 2013 to 67% today — a decline that accelerated during COVID-19. The agency is developing a web-based collection tool to address the problem, with implementation expected in 2027.

“Survey response rates are certainly important for data quality,” Bateman said in a follow-up message. “The BLS has been transparent about declining response rates and its efforts to reverse the long-term decline. Given the expertise within BLS, we trust their position that their data remains reliable.”

The spotlight on government data comes at a key time for USAFacts, as it prepares its annual “America In Facts” report for delivery to Congress in September. (See the 2024 report.)

The report — a visual presentation of data on topics of particular interest to lawmakers — will be accompanied by in-person visits to Washington, D.C., where Bateman said the integrity of government data will no doubt be a major topic of conversation.

Founded by Ballmer in 2017 to make government data more accessible and understandable, USAFacts aggregates statistics from more than 70 government sources to create nonpartisan visualizations and analysis on everything from federal spending to education outcomes. 

The organization also produces an annual “10-K” report modeled after corporate filings, released each Tax Day, that treats government finances like a business report.

For now, USAFacts is taking a wait-and-see approach. “We don't know exactly what the removal of the commissioner will mean for the data,” Bateman said, “but we are certainly paying close attention to the future releases from the agency.”

OpenAI has begun rolling out GPT-5, the latest iteration of its flagship language model, to all ChatGPT users.

The company's CEO Sam Altman called GPT-5 “a significant step along the path to AGI” during a press briefing on Wednesday. While he stopped short of claiming the model reaches artificial general intelligence, Altman noted the latest release is “clearly a model that is generally intelligent.” He added that GPT-5 still lacks key traits that would make it reach AGI, a notably loose term that is defined in OpenAI's charter as “a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.” For example, the model still lacks the ability to learn continuously after deployment.

OpenAI claims GPT-5 is smarter, faster, more useful, and more accurate, with a lower hallucination rate than previous models. In characteristically lofty terms, Altman likened the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5 to the iPhone's shift from pixelated to a Retina display. “GPT-5 is the first time that it really feels like talking to an expert in any topic, like a PhD level expert,” Altman said.

As part of Thursday's launch, OpenAI announced two new model variants: a lightweight GPT-5-mini and an even faster, cheaper, GPT-5-nano (which is only in the API). According to OpenAI, free users will get access to GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini, while the Plus subscription includes the same models with “significantly higher” usage limits. OpenAI says that the $200 a month Pro tier offers unlimited GPT-5 access, along with GPT-5-pro, a more powerful version of the model, and GPT-5-thinking, which allows the model to process a query for longer than usual. Pro users will still have access to pick through legacy models. Most users will no longer need to choose between models, as the chat interface now automatically routes to the right version depending on the complexity of the query and the user's subscription tier.

According to the developer launch blog, GPT-5 will cost developers using the API $1.25/1M to input tokens and $10/1M to output tokens. “GPT-5 mini is priced at $0.25/1M input tokens and $2/1M output tokens, and GPT-5 nano is priced at $0.05/1M input tokens and $0.40/1M output tokens,” it adds. For comparison, developers often use Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite since it's so cheap—GPT-5 nano is now cheaper.

Starting next week, Pro users will be able to connect their Gmail, Google Contacts, and Google Calendar to ChatGPT, with other tiers gaining access at an unspecified date. “ChatGPT automatically knows when it's most relevant to reference them so you don't need to select them before you chat,” the company said in an email.

Users can also choose a chat color and select from four preset personalities—Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd—a feature WIRED's newsletter Model Behavior reported was in the works last week. According to OpenAI's blog announcement, it plans to bake these personalities into Advanced Voice Mode.

The company's API will offer users all three models, along with optional controls for toggling between detailed or direct responses. GPT-5 can retain more information than prior models—it has a 256,000-token context window, a bump up from the 200,000-token context window available in the company's previous o3 model. That means it can better understand long conversations, documents, or code without losing track of context.

OpenAI's blog post claims that GPT-5 beats its previous models on several coding benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified (scoring 74.9 percent), SWE-Lancer (GPT-5-thinking scored 55 percent), and Aider Polyglot (scored 88 percent), which test the model's ability to fix bugs, complete freelance-style coding tasks, and work across multiple programming languages.

During the press briefing on Wednesday, OpenAI post-training lead Yann Dubois prompted GPT-5 to “create a beautiful, highly interactive web app for my partner, an English speaker, to learn French.” He tasked the AI to include features like daily progress, a variety of activities like flashcards and quizzes, and noted that he wanted the app wrapped up in a “highly engaging theme.” After a minute or so, the AI-generated app popped up. While it was just one on-rails demo, the result was a sleek site that delivered exactly what Dubois asked for.

“It's a great coding collaborator, and also excels at agentic tasks,” Michelle Pokrass, a post-training lead, says. “It executes long chains and tool calls effectively [which means it better understands when and how to use functions like web browsers or external APIs], follows detailed instructions, and provides upfront explanations of its actions."

OpenAI also says in its blog post that GPT-5 is “our best model yet for health-related questions.” In three OpenAI health-related LLM benchmarks—HealthBench, HealthBench Hard, and HealthBench Consensus—the system card (a document that describes the product's technical capabilities and other research findings) states that GPT-5-thinking outperforms previous models “by a substantial margin.” The thinking version of GPT-5 scored 25.5 percent on HealthBench Hard, up from o3's 31.6 percent score. These scores are validated by two or more physicians, according to the system card.

The model also allegedly hallucinates less, according to Pokrass, a common issue for AI where it provides false information. OpenAI's safety research lead Alex Beutel adds that they've "significantly decreased the rates of deception in GPT-5.”

“We've taken steps to reduce GPT-5-thinking's propensity to deceive, cheat, or hack problems, though our mitigations are not perfect and more research is needed,” the system card says. “In particular, we've trained the model to fail gracefully when posed with tasks that it cannot solve.”

The company's system card says that after testing GPT-5 models without access to web browsing, researchers found its hallucination rate (which they defined as “percentage of factual claims that contain minor or major errors”) 26 percent less common than the GPT-4o model. GPT-5-thinking has a 65 percent reduced hallucination rate compared to o3.

For prompts that could be dual-use (potentially harmful or benign), Beutel says GPT-5 uses “safe completions,” which prompts the model to “give as helpful an answer as possible, but within the constraints of remaining safe.” OpenAI did over 5,000 hours of red teaming, according to Beutel, and testing with external organizations to make sure the system was robust.

OpenAI says it now boasts nearly 700 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, 5 million paying business users, and 4 million developers utilizing the API.

“The vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that,” head of ChatGPT Nick Turley says. “Especially average people who haven't been spending their time thinking about models.”

A drizzly, cool, grey morning in August feels like the perfect time to recognize that Seattle is not for everyone. Announcing that your tech startup is packing up for the Bay Area might be another way to throw a wet blanket over the Emerald City.

The co-founders of Nectar Social sparked a bit of reaction after GeekWire reported Wednesday that sisters Misbah Uraizee and Farah Uraizee are moving their AI-powered social commerce startup to Palo Alto, Calif., to operate in “Valley speed.”

“The hustle factor is real,” Misbah Uraizee told GeekWire. “Right now in [Silicon] Valley, teams are working six, seven days a week because they understand this is a unique moment in technology history. That intensity — that sense of ‘we have to win this market NOW' — is harder to cultivate in Seattle where the pace, even at startups, tends to mirror the steadier rhythms of the big tech companies.”

On Reddit, Seattle pride mixed with a bit of anti-tech sentiment as commenters on the story essentially said, “good riddance” and took issue with everything from what Nectar is building to how intensely they expect people to work on it.

The comments shed fresh light on the long-simmering animosity toward tech in some Seattle circles. And while others might embrace the city's rise as an industry hub, being dumped for the Bay Area always stings.

Here's a sampling: 

Over on LinkedIn, the story and departure also caught the attention of Aviel Ginzburg, a tech investor who leads the Seattle-based startup hub Foundations.

Ginzburg said the first question he asks young and unnetworked or unleveraged founders is “why haven't you moved to the Bay Area?”

“In many cases, this being one of them, Seattle is just not the better place to build your company,” Ginzburg said about Nectar's move. “There is enough stacked up against you already, you've gotta take every advantage that you can.”

But Ginzburg called the startup pace and culture of Seattle a feature, not a bug, and said the city shouldn't strive to be the Bay Area. But it also shouldn't “suck for the folks where Seattle makes sense,” he added.

The Uraizee sisters are not alone in chasing the AI dream to the nation's tech capital. The New York Times reported this week on the wave of 20-something entrepreneurs who are flocking to San Francisco for fear of being left behind the boom.

Nectar Social launched in 2023 to help brands reach consumers where they're hanging out on social media platforms and talk directly to them in personalized conversations using artificial intelligence. The company raised $10.6 million in a funding round earlier this summer.

Misbah Uraizee said that while Seattle's startup ecosystem has “matured tremendously,” there is still a “cultural gap around early-stage risk appetite.”

As GeekWire Editor Taylor Soper pointed out, the departure of this one startup echoes themes highlighted in our story last week in which GeekWire interviewed more than 20 investors and founders across the community about the state of Seattle's startup scene amid a wave of AI-fueled transformation.

“We have the talent. We have the tech. Now we need to move louder, faster, and bolder,” said Samir Manjure, a veteran entrepreneur and CEO of Seattle startup Vieu.

Perhaps Seattle will be loud enough and fast enough for the next startup that decides to stick around.

In July, Siyan, a UK-based Discord user, logged on one morning and found himself unable to access some of his text chats marked NSFW. The channel, a popup informed him, was now age-restricted. The United Kingdom had enacted its far reaching child safety laws, which includes an age requirement system to verify users are over 18. Discord's updates required users to verify their age, either by government ID or a face scan.

Siyan (who requested to only be referred to by his screen name for privacy reasons) describes himself as “painfully over the age of needing to fake an ID.” He didn't want to take a photo of his ID. The face scan feature wasn't yet available on mobile, he says, and he didn't own a webcam, so he decided to give the platform someone else's face. First, he tried using an emoji of “an old dude” he often uses on Discord. (“It speaks to me.”) Face scans, however, often require users to submit multiple shots that include them looking a specific way, or specific poses. Siyan needed a passable image of a man with an open mouth.

Two games in his library, Stellar Blade and Death Stranding, include a photo mode that allows players to pose a character and set their expressions; Siyan opted for Death Stranding's Sam, modeled after 56-year-old actor Norman Reedus.

He dropped screenshots of his success into a discord, after which a friend posted them to X. Siyan's gambit quickly went viral, inspiring others to try with games like Death Stranding, God of War, and more.

Age verification is now the norm in the UK, though similar laws worldwide are expected to have a profound impact on how we access the web. Companies like Google are rolling out AI-driven age estimation systems for Search and YouTube. On gaming platforms like Roblox, age checks are becoming a key element of safety measures. But whether by using IDs or face scanning, it's an imperfect system. Several Discord users tell WIRED they've already managed to get around face scans using video game characters. Generative AI could make this problem even more difficult to control as the tech grows more sophisticated; just last month, WIRED wrote about a startup working on AI that can create video in real-time. Users are also worried about giving companies their personal information in case of security breaches.

In theory, age verification serves to keep kids safer. On platforms like Roblox, where failed moderation has allowed predators to groom or even assault some children, confirming that someone is a minor—or over the age of 18—is one way to determine what features they can use. For adult content sites like Pornhub, age verification aims to make sure children cannot access pornography. Critics, however, say the systems being put into place are flawed ones, both from a privacy and protection standpoint.

David Maimon, the head of fraud insights for SentiLink and a criminology professor at Georgia State University, says that the current methods of verification can still be fooled. People use many different methods to bypass “liveness checks”—security measures used to verify the user is a real person—whether that's using AI, video games, or videos of other, real people. IDs can be faked, or bought. “The process of age verification is complicated,” he says, and people in charge of these systems need to give them more thought.

Ash, a UK-based 20-year-old who requested his last name not be used, tells WIRED he was able to pass verification using God of War's photo mode with main character Kratos. “I didn't expect [verification] to work because of Kratos' white skin and beard, but it worked first try,” he says. Another Discord user in the UK, who goes by Antsy online, says he achieved the same results with Arma 3 and a mod that allows you to pose characters. “I figured out I could simply by trying, as all people should,” he tells WIRED. “Arma 3 characters look very poor, nowhere near realistic, so I thought it would be a solid experiment to solidify or challenge my views on this technology.” Antsy says he and his friends consider this kind of tech “a challenge” they try to bypass. “I am very pro internet safety,” he says. “I believe, though, that it should not be the internet's job to parent and protect its younger users."

Video game characters from several games worked. In a video from YouTuber beebreadtech, he's able to swiftly get an adult-age rating repeating Siyan's steps with Death Stranding. Other Discord users WIRED talked to say they were able to do so with games like Days Gone, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, The Sims 4, Cyberpunk 2077, Days Gone, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Gray Zone Warfare. Some say they even successfully used Garry's Mod, a game with slapstick physics and character models resembling something from a fever dream.

Discord has not yet responded to WIRED's request for comment.

Maimon says there are too many possible loopholes with age verification that people can slip through. “The industry is trying to find solutions to the issue of AI deepfakes and and and live AIs,” he says. That may mean relying on a combination of factors that look at a person's associated information like telephone numbers, addresses and more. “You need to rely more heavily on historical evidence for the existence of the individual,” Maimon says, “and put less of an emphasis on checkpoints like driver licenses, photos, livenessness tests, and so on.”

Maimon says that bad actors are adept at bypassing these kinds of technologies. “Criminals are always like 7 to 12 months ahead of us in terms of their ability to find vulnerabilities and bypass some of the technologies out there,” he says. Even without generative AI, people can still sell videos of their faces to pass age verification.

Even photo IDs aren't bulletproof. “The quality of a [fake] driver license—it's just impeccable,” Maimon says. All the watermarks, the UV lights, all the security, even the right plastic material on which the driver license is being printed on—even that criminals now have access to.”

For legitimate IDs, there's an issue with minors and who owns one. WIRED previously asked Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman about 13-year-olds—the minimum age for Roblox to unlock some of its features—that might not have government-issued IDs. “That is a problem,” Kaufman told WIRED at the time, adding that in North America and the United States, it's uncommon for people so young to have them.

“I'm hesitant to say that [photo ID] is a useful way to verify folks' age,” Maimon says, “simply because we have so much evidence suggesting that it doesn't work.”

There's also hesitance on behalf of users to hand over their IDs. “I don't trust the third party services that are being used with my data, especially with how damaging data leaks can be,” Ash says. “Most of the verification apps say that they don't hold your data for more than seven days and while that might be true there's no way for me to know for sure that they are telling the truth.”

There's a risk in handing over sensitive information to companies that request photo or ID verification. In July, Tea—an app where women can share their negative experiences with men—suffered a massive data breach that exposed thousands of women's photos used for verification; a second security issue, according to 404 Media, allowed hackers to access sensitive information like phone numbers, social media handles, and real names through user messages, which has been spread throughout forums like 4chan to dox and harass women.

People WIRED spoke to who have used video games to trick verification are against age verification. “Requiring people to give up facial information to access all the features of websites and apps like Discord and Bluesky is a massive overreach of what governments should be allowed to ask for digitally,” Ash says.

Furthermore, he's doubtful that such systems won't be exploited, whether it's by using video games or some other method. “I don't think that face scans are a useful way to verify age since people can easily look under their age and be incorrectly flagged as being under 18,” he says.

Antsy, the Discord user who passed verification with Arma 3, isn't convinced websites or platforms should be in charge of verifying ages. “All you are doing by putting these laws into place is pushing young people towards corners of the internet the government can't police,” he says. “If someone believes this is protecting children more than an active parent already would, I refuse to believe they are well versed in the corners of the internet outside of the Google home page or their child's life.”

Laptops are a huge help when it comes to working, because you can do it anywhere. Sure, that means you can work while commuting or at a temporary desk, and we respect that, but it also means you can work on your couch, or even in bed. Freedom is everything here, but sometimes you need a little bit more than your laptop can actually give you.

In those times, it pays to have access to a good docking station, and you can currently get an amazing Anker 13-In-1 Docking Station for just $140, which is 30% off. That's a big discount, but it's also one that's not going to last forever, so if you are looking to boost the abilities of your laptop, act fast.

See at Amazon

A laptop dock allows you to just hook more things up to your laptop. Sometimes this is going to be more peripherals, sure, but a lot of the time it can be extra monitors as well. This can make it a lot easier to show off work, or even treat your laptop more like a PC at home if that's the kind of setup you have going on. Convenience is important, and a good laptop docking station is a huge deal on that front, and Anker is one of the best companies going on this front.

This particular dock goes into a USB-C port and turns it into USB-A ports, HDMI ports, SD slots, audio slots, an Ethernet port, and USB-C ports as well. This makes it really easy to have everything running through the dock itself instead of your laptop, and that makes it way easier to treat your laptop like a portable core for your whole working life.

You can even charge devices using it, but the fact that you can output visuals to up to three monitors at once is where it really shines, because it can allow you to show off specific work as you need to. It's just a really helpful device to have for creatives, freelancers, or just those who do a lot of travelling and project work.

This beast of a docking station would normally cost you $200, so being able to get it for $60 is amazing. This 30% discount isn't likely to last for very long though, so you'd better be quick if you want to secure one before it expires and you have to pay full price.

President Donald Trump this morning called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, alleging he has conflicts of interest. This latest setback for the struggling computer chip company couldn't have come at a worse time, as Intel is in the middle of attempting a comeback.

“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Trump's post comes as Tan has been attempting to stage a turnaround at Intel after the company initially missed out on the early wave of the AI boom. Tan became CEO of the company this past March.

Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo regarding Trump's post.

Trump's comments also come just a day after Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas sent a letter to Intel's Board Chairman Frank Yeary, asking questions about Tan's investments in Chinese chip companies and their alleged ties to China's government and military.

He also raised specific concerns about Tan's former role as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a position he held for 13 years until 2021. In July, the company pleaded guilty to violating U.S. export controls by selling hardware and software to China's National University of Defense Technology without obtaining the required licenses.

“Intel was awarded nearly $8 billion from the CHIPS and Science Act, the largest grant to a single company,” Cotton wrote in the letter. “Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations. Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.”

In response to the letter, Intel told Reuters on Wednesday that both the company and Tan are “deeply committed to the national security of the United States,” and that they would address the issues in the letter with Cotton.

This isn't the first time the Trump Administration has sought to influence business leaders and pick winners and losers in the corporate world. Since the start of his second term, Trump has used tariffs and trade policy as tools to push companies to invest more in the United States. CEOs like Apple's Tim Cook, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos have all met with Trump in efforts to advance their own business agendas.

Just last month, Tan had outlined his plan to reduce headcount and cut spending to make Intel more competitive with its rivals.

Tan told employees in a staff-wide memo that the company will cut its workforce by roughly 15% by the end of the year and scrapped plans for new factories in Germany and Poland.

“I know the past few months have not been easy. We are making hard but necessary decisions to streamline the organization, drive greater efficiency and increase accountability at every level of the company,” Tan wrote in the memo.

As far as its AI ambitions, Tan said the company needs to develop a cohesive stack strategy—not just chips, but also the software and systems to support them.

“Our starting point will be emerging AI workloads – then we will work backward to design software, systems and silicon that enable the best customer outcomes,” Tan wrote.

Now, with the President against him, Tan's plans of getting Intel back on track have just become a lot harder.

Duolingo announced on Wednesday that it beat its quarterly revenue estimates, even though the company faced widespread backlash for choosing to embrace generative AI over human workers. Duolingo stock rose almost 30% on the news.

In April, CEO Luis von Ahn shared that Duolingo would become an “AI-first” company, phasing out its use of contract workers. He also discouraged teams from hiring more employees, unless the team is unable to automate more of its work. With the use of generative AI, Duolingo introduced 148 new language courses, more than doubling its previous offerings.

“Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners,” von Ahn wrote at the time. “We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.”

While some Duolingo users have argued that these AI features are making the app worse, the company's financial metrics tell a different story. Now the company anticipates making over $1 billion in revenue this year, and daily active users have grown 40% year-over-year. The growth is significant but falls in the lower range of the company's estimates of growing between 40% and 45%, which an investor brought up to von Ahn on Wednesday's quarterly earnings call.

“The reason we came [in] towards the lower end was because I said some stuff about AI, and I didn't give enough context. Because of that, we got some backlash on social media,” von Ahn said. “The most important thing is we wanted to make the sentiment on our social media positive. We stopped posting edgy posts and started posting things that would get our sentiment more positive. That has worked.”

On TikTok, the top comments on Duolingo's videos often remain criticisms of the company's AI approach. Snarky commenters will ask if videos with multiple people in them are made with AI, to which Duolingo will reply, “Nope. Made by our great team!” 

But even if public sentiment toward Duolingo has shifted, its bottom line has not … and from the company's perspective, that's what matters.

Welcome back! Louise here. On Friday, President Trump fired one of the nation's top economists after her agency published a disappointing jobs report. Trump claimed the numbers were “RIGGED,” but there's no evidence that Erika McEntarfer or the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) did anything improper. The new employment data, however, suggested Trump's policies are having a negative impact on the US economy.

In the days since, Republicans have piled on, baselessly accusing McEntarfer of putting out “fake reports.” Trump hasn't named a new BLS commissioner yet, but the saga has already left some Americans questioning whether government statistics can be trusted. If you want a glimpse of where that leads, just look at China.

The Chinese government has long been accused of inflating its annual GDP growth figures, especially at the provincial level. In 2007, the former Chinese premier told the US ambassador to China that his province's GDP figures were “man-made.” To understand how his region was doing, Li Keqiang said he instead tracked electricity consumption, freight volumes, and bank loans, a system The Economist later dubbed “the Li Keqiang index.”

Over 15 years later, experts say things have changed significantly. The Chinese government now releases more economic data and it's generally considered more reliable. “The data have improved dramatically over time,” says Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who has been writing about the Chinese economy since the 1970s.

One reason for this is that Beijing stopped grading local officials primarily based on the economic performance of their regions. That growth-at-all-costs mindset had led to societal problems like widespread pollution. In response, the Chinese Communist Party began putting more emphasis on nuanced ideals, like fostering innovation and reducing the urban-rural divide. That, in turn, reduced the incentive to manipulate GDP numbers in the first place.

But many analysts, both inside and outside China, believe that Beijing continues to fudge its overall growth numbers, in part because officials remain deeply concerned with projecting a rosy image of the economy. China officially reported that its economy grew by 5 percent in 2024, while the US reported only 2.8 percent growth.

At a conference in December, an economist at a Chinese state-owned investment firm said that “we do not know” China's real growth figure, but he speculated it was far below what had been reported. When Xi Jinping got wind of the comments, he was reportedly furious and ordered the economist to be punished. Sound familiar?

As China's economy cooled in recent years, officials have repeatedly sought to muzzle experts who share negative information or dare to question Beijing. Government departments have stopped publishing some industrial reports and employment indicators or temporarily delayed their release without explanation. Other data has become harder to interpret or can no longer be accessed from outside the country.

But like so many things in China, two seemingly contradictory things can be true at once. While the experts I spoke to acknowledged that China is far less transparent than the US, they say the information it does put out is now relatively accurate and often astonishingly detailed.

“I'm blown away by how granular it is for industrial surveys,” says Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the RAND China Research Center and an expert on China's economy. “The data definitely has problems, but there's enough there to tell a semi-accurate picture.”

DiPippo says he tries to stay away from debates about the reliability of individual Chinese statistics, because the discussion tends to frequently devolve into what he calls “data nihilism.” When every number is called into question, “people can believe whatever they want,” he explains.

If you are genuinely interested in trying to make sense of the evidence, it's crucial to have the right political and cultural context going in. Take China's national unemployment rate, for example, which fell only slightly when a large chunk of the country was under draconian Covid lockdown measures in 2022. Some observers were quick to assume that meant Beijing had cooked the books, but the more likely explanation is that the US and China simply relied on very different strategies to help workers survive the pandemic.

The US government focused on increasing unemployment benefits and giving out stimulus checks to individuals, which boosted consumer spending. Beijing gave factories and other businesses generous tax breaks, which encouraged them to keep people on their payrolls. “The unemployment numbers may be accurate, but if you want to learn what the real state of the economy is, it's not going to tell you very much,” says Lardy.

Generally, Lardy says, he believes Chinese researchers are earnestly trying to interpret their country's enormous and rapidly changing economy. While the government is certainly interested in controlling the narrative, sometimes datasets change for reasons that have nothing to do with censorship, such as when state economists discover mistakes or develop more innovative methods for crunching specific numbers.

“If it was just a matter of exaggeration or manipulation, it would be very simple,” Lardy says. “The complexity should be taken into account.”

Complexity isn't unique to China. In both Beijing and Washington, understanding the economy requires technical skill and intellectual honesty, especially when the results aren't politically convenient.

The Framework laptops did something no other laptop could. With the ability to upgrade or swap out nearly every internal component, they are sustainable, unlike any other.

But the Framework Desktop isn't so unique. After all, one of the primary reasons people buy (or build) desktop PCs is the ability to upgrade the system on their own. This 4.5-liter mini-ITX PC isn't so different from many of the compact PCs you can already buy. And yet, Framework's distinctive approach makes this stand out.

The Framework Desktop is adorable. It's a mini-ITX desktop, but one that truly resembles a tiny version of a full-size tower. Unlike some sleeker mini-ITX cases with more adventurous designs, the Framework Desktop needs to be fully accessible, which is part of what makes it unique. Mini-ITX systems are notoriously difficult to upgrade and work around due to the limited space available. And while it's tight compared to upgrading a Framework Laptop 13, the Framework Desktop delivers a fully customizable and upgradable system in a small form factor.

At 3.81 x 8.09 x 8.90 inches, it has a tiny footprint on your desk. That's quite small, even for a small-form-factor build. Notably, it's far too compact to squeeze a standard external GPU inside. Even something like the extra-small Jonsbo NV10 can squeez in only a low-profile graphics card. That'll be important later when we talk about performance expectations, as the Framework Desktop is not necessarily meant to be a replacement for a full-fledged gaming PC. Then again, call me crazy, but I'd gladly take the light-hearted tile system that clicks into the front cover grid over another dose of overdone RGB lighting.

The Framework Desktop comes mostly assembled, excluding a couple of components that you'll need to install yourself. You'll choose SSDs for one or both of the two M.2 slots, which range from 500 GB up to 8 TB. Framework sells WD Black models, but as with the Framework Laptop, you can always opt to buy without an SSD and use your own. The same is true for the CPU fan. You're given the option to choose from a Noctua or Cooler Master fan, but because Framework uses off-the-shelf parts, you can bring your own 120-mm fan. If you choose this option, Framework will throw in a fan mounting kit to make it all work.

You can access these components by removing the top and side panels. The top panel has a couple of thumb screws that hold it in place. Once you have that off, the perforated side panel slides out pretty easily. The way these two panels fit together is clumsy, and it took me a number of attempts to get them back in place. It's not quite as smooth as on the Framework Laptop 12, for example, which is completely toolless.

The ports on the back include two DisplayPort 2.1, HDMI 2.1, an RJ45 Ethernet jack, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and a 3.5-mm headphone jack. It's a little strange to have the headphone jack in the back instead of in front. But that's where the Expansion Cards come into play. Like the Framework Laptop, the Framework Desktop can swap out ports, depending on your needs, but only the two in the front. You can do USB-C or USB-A or, if you're like me, you'd want a forward-facing SD card slot. So, while it's not as impactful as it is on a laptop, it remains a useful feature nonetheless.

The Framework Desktop is based around its CPU, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395. It's an interesting and innovative chip, featured in only a couple of products this year so far. Not only does it have 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, it also comes with a massive integrated GPU, the Radeon 8060S. It has 40 GPU cores, making it one of the most powerful integrated GPUs ever made. I've tested this chip once before in the Asus ROG Flow Z13, a 2-in-1 gaming tablet, and I was impressed by it at the time. But I've never tested it on a more capable system.

In 3DMark Steel Nomad, a popular graphics benchmark, the Framework Desktop performed 13 percent faster than on the ROG Flow Z13. That's with both systems set at the Best Performance mode, too. It's still 32 percent behind the latest generation of desktop GPUs, such as the RTX 5060, but that's to be expected. The closest comparable discrete GPU is the Laptop RTX 4060. While that's not exciting for PC gamers, remember: these are integrated graphics. The only integrated graphics performance that comes close is on Apple's side with the M4 chips.

I tried out some modern games, such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel Rivals, and was thoroughly impressed by how well they performed. I was surprised to find that I could play Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p and Ultra settings without any upscaling yet still achieve an average of 84 frames per second. You can easily venture into higher resolutions and even ray tracing if you use AMD's image upscaling settings or even frame generation. Lighter games like Marvel Rivals play without missing a beat.

The RAM is not removable due to the nature of the chip, though it does come in large-capacity options. The base model has 32 GB, while my configuration came with 64 GB. There's a 128 GB option, which is important for anyone looking to work with local large language models or other AI projects. The neural processing unit inside is capable of over 50 TOPS, and Framework claims it can run large language AI models like Llama 3 70B locally in real time, specifically on the 128-GB model that gives the GPU 96 GB of VRAM to work with.

Framework laptops were already nice, but the Framework Desktop is perhaps the most niche product the company has launched so far. The benefits of choosing the Framework Desktop over any other desktop out there have less to do with what makes the Framework ethos so unique. There are even smaller options, such as the Corsair AI Workstation 300, which is slightly taller but not as deep. They are similarly priced, though Corsair is selling only the higher-end option with 128 GB of RAM.

On the other hand, the Framework Desktop is an awesome middle ground between the compact nature of a mini-PC and the performance and upgradability of a true small-form-factor PC. I don't like that you can't upgrade the RAM, and I wish the side panels were easier to install. I do have concerns about the CPU inside, too. While it performs great, a lot depends on AMD continuing to support this somewhat specialized component. Framework hasn't let me down thus far, but its previous computers have used more standard parts. But by now, the company has earned some trust from me.

For AI enthusiasts hoping to run local LLMs, the Framework Desktop is a shoo-in, especially with all the available memory. But it's also a decent option for those who want a compact PC that doesn't completely forfeit performance or upgradability.

When Framework built its first laptop, it was with the ethos of a desktop: repairable, customizable, and upgradable when new parts came out. Now, Framework has a desktop of its own.

But the Framework Desktop ($1,599 as tested before a myriad of components and add-ons), isn't a traditional PC by any means. Using an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 “Strix Halo” APU with soldered RAM, the customization options on this desktop are limited to storage, Wi-Fi, your case fan, and some decorative elements. The soldered RAM is effectively required for the bandwidth this system needs, and the mix of powerful graphics and plentiful RAM is why Framework is pushing this as an AI system. The Desktop has a ton of charm, from its 4.5-liter size to its surprising power with the right configuration. But it's also very expensive compared to the best gaming PCs in its price range, and if you don't use all of the RAM, you might be better off with a cheaper system.

The Framework Desktop is really small. It's a 4.5-liter Mini-ITX system that will fit on even the small desks.

The system is a plain, black case. Ours came with a black side panel, though there is a $40 window option (see configurations, below). Since we weren't using a fan with RGB, I was fine with the opaque panel. The side panels are plastic with some metal shielding inside, while the top panel is entirely plastic.

Most of the system comes pre-installed in the box. The motherboard is already installed, and since it's using a soldered CPU and RAM, those are there, too. The heatsink comes mounted to the board, and the 400-watt FlexATX power supply is already all hooked up. When Framework refers to this as a "DIY" system, it really means removing the side panel and the top, installing an SSD and a fan, and boom, complete system. That took me less than 20 minutes, and Framework has a handy step-by-step guide on its website. The hardest part is plugging in the fan header on the motherboard (and I suppose, the RGB header if your fan supports it), which requires some nimble finger placement.



The system comes with a screwdriver that has both a Phillips and Torx head. Its primary difference from the company's Laptop screwdriver is that it's far longer, letting you get into the case to install your SSD.Our review unit came with an early version of a carrying handle, but that's not available to the public just yet. I didn't carry the desktop around the office too much, but it sure looks cute. Otherwise, the top is held on by two thumbscrews.



The upgrade potential on this system is limited. On the left side, you can put in your primary storage drive and add a fan of your choosing to the heatsink. Open the right side of the chassis and the reverse side of the motherboard has a second M.2 slot for storage, as well as access to the AMD RZ717 Wi-Fi 7 card.

That fan and heatsink serve as all of the cooling for the system. The heatsink is sizeable, with six copper heatpipes, aluminum fins, and Honeywell PTM7958 thermal paste. The desktop comes with a mounting kit to attach a 120mm fan. The fan sucks cool air in through perforations in the side of the case.

On the front of the desktop, there is room for a 92 mm fan. The tooling is there, and there's also a second fan header on the motherboard. A company rep told me that "Framework originally put a placeholder for a slim fan there. They learned quickly that the main CPU/system fan provides enough cooling for the whole system."



One thing you can change to your heart's content: the front ports on the case. There are two slots for Framework's expansion cards — the same pick-your-port adapters that it uses on its laptops. I stuck one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port, which accommodates most of the accessories I use every day, though I could see some people picking a 3.5 mm headphone jack for gaming, as the permanent one is on the back of the system. Other choices include SD or microSD card slots, an Ethernet jack, or extra USB-C connected storage.The expansion cards will be very welcome for those who already have a Framework Laptop, as you can mix and match. But using the adapters on the desktop shows its limits. You can only have two ports of your choosing due to the width of the expansion cards. Just by eyeballing it, it's clear Framework could have fit more ports on without the cards.



The rest of the ports are on the rear, attached to the motherboard. They're plentiful. There are two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a pair of USB4 Type-C ports, HDMI 2.1, two DisplayPort 2.1 outputs, Ethernet, and a headphone jack.

On the front of the system, there's a magnetic frame meant to hold 21 tiles, which are Framework's way of adding personalization to the system. I wish Framework included a blank set with purchase, but you have to buy them separately. Otherwise you'll have gaps in the front of the system.

The tiles highlight Framework's maker roots and allow for tons of different customization options. On the other hand, they look kind of cheap and feel like something that came from a 3D printer. I would have preferred an option to use a single colored sheet, perhaps matching some of the colors Framework uses for its Laptop bezels.

At 8.9 x 8.09 x 3.81 inches, the Framework Desktop is quite small for a desktop. It's got some graphics chops, but it's more in the range of Apple's Mac Mini (5 x 5 x 2 inches, no upgradeability) than classic gaming desktops. For instance, the CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme is 9.3 x 19.5 x 18.1 inches and the Acer Predator Orion 5000 measures 19.09 x 18.98 x 8.62 inches.

One thing is missing from the Framework Desktop: a list of the names of the people in the company. In its laptops, you get a list of everyone who worked on them printed inside the chassis. That's not the case here.

The Radeon Strix 8060S graphics on the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 are impressive. The chip, often referred to by its "Strix Halo" codename, features 40 compute units and shares our system's 64GB of RAM with the CPU. Yes, you can game on these integrated graphics, no question.

As a challenge, I booted up Alan Wake 2. While I got a VRAM error message, I pressed on without issue. On the medium graphics preset with no ray tracing, FSR enabled, and a 720p render with upscaling to 1080p, the game saw the titular hero explore a nightmare New York at between 73 and 78 frames per second. The game also ran at high settings, but dropped below 60 FPS.

Death Stranding, too, played well (and better understood the shared RAM situation). At 1080p, on the very high preset, I carried packages between 124 - 132 FPS. Even at 4K, the game ran between 41-50 FPS at the most demanding settings. For most intense games, though, this is a solid 1080p rig.Our benchmarks, which are typically run on discrete graphics cards, are run at quite demanding settings. Some of them may appear unplayable, but if you turn some settings down, you can get the Framework Desktop to playability territory. Here, we're comparing the Framework to other gaming desktops, and, unsurprisingly, the larger, more traditional systems won out in most tests. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Supreme has an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti, while the older Acer Predator Orion 5000 used an RTX 4070 Super. Both of them, however, are within the range of what our configuration of the Framework Desktop in terms of cost.

On Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the Framework Desktop ran the game at 87 FPS on the highest settings at 1080p. It also excelled on CPU-heavy games like Far Cry 6 at ultra settings (83 FPS) and Borderlands 3 on the "badass" preset (103 fps.) The game performed passably on Red Dead Redemption 2 at medium settings (57 fps). It only faltered on Cyberpunk 2077's challenging Ray Tracing Ultra preset.

To stress test gaming PCs, we run the Metro Exodus benchmark 15 times on a loop using the RTX preset to simulate about half an hour of gameplay. Across the runs, the game ran at an average of 51 frames per second. You might want to turn off the ray tracing, though – the average minimum 99th percentile frame rate was 24 fps. During the test, the Ryzen chip, which includes the graphics, ran at 66.46 degrees Celsius.

Sure, the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is a mobile chip in a desktop's clothes, but with 64GB of RAM and a fast 1TB SSD, the system can compete with some recent gaming desktops we've tested when it comes to productivity.

On Geekbench 6, the Framework Desktop notched a single-core score of 2,966 and achieved a multi-core score of 17,574. The CyberPowerPC and its AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D outperformed, as did the Mac Mini with M4 Pro, (3,880 and 22,661, the highest of the group). But the Framework surpassed the Acer Predator Orion 5000 and its Intel Core i7-14700F.

The file transfer speed on your Framework Desktop will depend heavily on which drive you choose. With the 1TB WD Black SN7100 that Framework sells alongside the Desktop, we saw it blaze through our file transfer test at a rate of 2,976.46 MBps, handily surpassing everything else on our test. The Mac Mini was the next closest, at 2,237.31 MBps.It took the Framework Desktop 2 minutes and 43 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p on Handbrake. Only the Predator beat it at 2:40, while the Mac came in at 2:47.

You can't overclock the Strix Halo chip. Framework's BIOS doesn't have options for it, and installing Ryzen Master doesn't work. It throws up an error stating that the chip isn't supported and that the software can't be installed.

Throughout my time with the Framework Desktop, I felt a sort of dissonance. I've always enjoyed the amount of tinkering I get to do with the company's laptops.With the Desktop, it's far more limited. In a way, using a soldered CPU and RAM feels antithetical to Framework's entire ethos of choice, repairability, and upgradeability. Framework says there's a reason for that, though. "To enable the massive 256GB/s memory bandwidth that Ryzen AI Max delivers, the LPDDR5x is soldered," a Framework blog post announcing the desktop reads. “We spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn't technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus. Because the memory is non-upgradeable, we're being deliberate in making memory pricing more reasonable than you might find with other brands."

Framework made the choice to use Ryzen's AI Max processors anyway. If you want replaceable memory, though, there are hundreds of other gaming and productivity PCs on the market with that option. And, of course, you can still build your own.

I've reduced this dissonance by thinking of the system more like a Mac Mini that is bigger because it is upgradeable. Still, that may not satisfy some diehards, who see the company's laptops as more repairable than its desktop.

There is one part that feels very Framework. The company is selling the mainboard and every single component — including the case — individually and separately. This should allow for all sorts of projects (Framework has suggested the use of multiple mainboards for LLM racks to run models).

The Framework Desktop comes free of any manufacturer-provided bloatware, and it's refreshing. The only mark against it is a link to the Framework Marketplace in the Start menu's application list in Windows 11.

If you use Windows like I did, you will still get some shortcuts you don't want, like a pinned link to download a local LinkedIn app, but nothing major.

Framework sells its Desktop with a one-year warranty.

We tested the $1,599 variant of the Framework Desktop, pairing a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor featuring Radeon 8060S graphics and 64GB of RAM. With our review unit, Framework included a 1TB WD Black SN7100 ($99), a Cooler Master Mobius 120 CPU fan ($22), a power cable ($5), two USB Type-C and two USB Type-A expansion cards ($11 each), and three sets of tiles (two $10 black sets and a $15 red set, plus a custom Tom's Hardware tile, which you can't really put a price on), as well as five decal tiles and two blank tiles ($5 each and $3 each, respectively). Add that all up, and it's $1,835. We installed Windows 11 Home on our own, but if Framework included it, the company charges $139 for the download.The cheapest configuration, before any add-ons, is $1,099 with a Ryzen AI Max 385 with lesser Radeon 8050S graphics and 32GB of RAM. The highest step up, and a shoe-in for people interested in local AI, is a $1,999 option with the same processor as our review unit, but with a whopping 128GB of memory.

There are a number of other add-ons. While our review unit came with the standard black side panel, a clear one will cost you $40. Tiles come in various colors, and there are $5 options with logos for AMD and a number of Linux distros. While I think that expansion cards with USB Type-A and Type-C make the most sense for the expansion slots, Framework sells all of the same options it has for its website, including storage, Ethernet, and a microSD card slot, should you want them. I feel that the desktop should come with a set of blank tiles; it's an incomplete system without the front of the chassis.There are a variety of fan and storage options, though you can also bring your own instead of paying Framework. Those are the only two major components that you can change out, so they're important choices.

I think the fact that Framework charges for the power cable for a desktop is kind of obnoxious. Enthusiasts may have extras, but this isn't a phone where everyone has extra cheap cables around their house. For a system, this should come in the box.

The Framework Desktop offers a lot of power for a small system. AMD's Strix Halo shows off in Framework's 4.5-liter case, delivering strong 1080p gaming performance for a system that doesn't have a discrete GPU. You can have a solid 1080p system that fits on your desk and doesn't get in the way.But the system doesn't feel entirely like Framework. The fact that it's less repairable and upgradeable than the company's laptops is odd, but it's the cost of using a mobile processor, which is soldered to the board, along with soldered RAM (which is effectively necessary for the chip the team chose). It's not wrong, but it will likely make the system less appealing for many potential buyers who aren't specifically interested in AI.



Despite all of that, I've become enamored with the system during my time with it. It's versatile, small, and surprisingly powerful for its size. Despite its plastic casing, it's pretty cute.

The real issue is price. For the $1,599 our review unit starts at — before all of the components and an OS, you can get a decent gaming PC with a discrete GPU. For over $1,800 as ours was configured, you can get a nice one. So if you're going for gaming, a bigger machine with more traditional desktop pieces makes more sense, and will be more customizable down the line, too. (It may, however, have less RAM.) I don't fault Framework for offering a DIY edition to its enthusiast-forward fanbase, but I do think its pricing should consider everything you need to add. That's before you get nickeled and dimed with effectively mandatory tiles for the front of the chassis.In competition with something like the Mac Mini, you can really only compare to Apple's most expensive configuration with a 12-core M4 Pro CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD storage for $1,399. Bumping to 1TB of storage and 64GB of RAM is a minimum of $2,199, so while the Mac is a huge budget for light productivity starting at $599, it isn't necessarily a budget competitor on the high end. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999 with an M4 Max and 36GB of RAM.That leaves the Framework in a place as a solid small system for people who need a ton of RAM. There's a reason the company has pitched it for running local LLM's — that's who the system makes the most sense for. If you're going to make use of this much RAM with a mobile CPU and a tiny chassis, there may be value here, as well as the fun of putting parts of the system together yourself. But for everyone else, a stronger gaming rig or a cheaper productivity system might do the job — and will come with everything you need out of the box.

Turning a living room into a place where movies feel bigger and game nights sound alive usually means more than a TV's tiny speakers can manage. The JBL Bar 9.1 – Channel Soundbar System with Surround Speakers and Dolby Atmos is built for that jump. It brings real surround sound into the room, fills out the low end, and adds overhead effects that make rain feel like it is falling around you. If your shows and sports have been sounding a little flat, this system is a major step up without turning your space into a maze of gear.

Head over to Amazon to get the JBL Bar 9.1 – Channel Soundbar System with Surround Speakers and Dolby Atmos for just $700, down from its usual price of $1,200. That's a discount of $500 and 42% off.

See at Amazon

Setup is refreshingly simple. Slide the soundbar under the TV, place the wireless subwoofer by a wall, and set the two rear speakers behind the couch. The rears are battery powered and detach from the main bar, so you can pop them on a shelf for movie night and dock them to charge when you are done. No wires across the floor is a win for families, pets, and tidy living rooms.

Once everything is in place, the sound shifts from “coming from the TV” to “coming from the room.” Dialog gets the clear center it needs, and effects spread wide so action scenes feel active. Dolby Atmos support adds height to the mix. Helicopters seem to pass overhead, stadium noise rolls in from all sides, and quiet details stay easy to hear at normal volume. The subwoofer brings punch without boom, so drum hits and thunder land with a satisfying thump that does not drown out voices.

Everyday use is friendly. A quick calibration listens to your room and dials in the balance in a minute. HDMI eARC keeps setup to a single cable for most modern TVs, and the bar automatically switches inputs when you turn on a game console or streaming box. For music, you can send playlists straight from a phone with Bluetooth, or use built in casting to play from favorite apps without extra steps. The remote is straightforward, and basic controls on the bar handle volume and source when the clicker goes missing.

If you have been waiting to upgrade from thin TV audio to theater style sound without a complicated receiver, this package hits the sweet spot for simplicity and impact. The JBL Bar 9.1 – Channel Soundbar System with Surround Speakers and Dolby Atmos is still available for $700 at Amazon, a strong savings compared with its regular $1,200 price.

A new Seattle startup is building a personal AI tutor that doesn't just give the answer but guides students through lessons, adapts to how they learn, appeals to their personal interests, and grows with them over time.

Wild Zebra, founded by edtech veteran Edan Shahar and longtime AI technologist Erik Selberg, uses AI to guide students through Socratic-style interactions — drawing out their thinking through guided questioning — while adapting to their interests, learning styles, and individual needs.

“We think the days of trains leaving Boston and going to Chicago are dead,” said Shahar, the company's CEO, referring to stodgy word problems. He explained that any subject can be taught using topics a student is already passionate about, such as sports or pop music.

Operating in stealth mode up to this point, the startup has already piloted its AI tutor in four schools, reaching more than 6,000 students with an initial focus on math and reading comprehension.

The feedback from teachers and administrators has exceeded expectations, Shahar said. Some educators have observed students becoming more focused and choosing to use the AI tutor outside of class time.

Building on its current school-based model, Shahar said Wild Zebra also plans to launch a direct-to-consumer version for students to use at home.

“So much of the conversation about AI has been around cheating,” Shahar said. “The reason for that is when you go to ChatGPT and you ask it a question, you expect an answer.”

While a wave of AI-powered learning tools have flooded the market, Wild Zebra is deliberately charting a different path. Rather than delivering quick solutions, its AI engages students in multi-turn conversations, asking questions that prompt reflection and reasoning. 

“A lot of our work is to make sure to not give away the answer,” he said.

When asked how Wild Zebra differentiates itself from established competitors like Khan Academy's Khanmigo, Shahar pointed to two key areas: 

As students interact with the system, the AI continually updates their learning profiles — surfacing gaps in understanding that may trace back years, while enabling more advanced learners to progress at their own pace.

Wild Zebra recently raised $2 million in funding to build on that early traction, expand its school partnerships, and prepare for a broader rollout. The startup has eight employees. It's not yet generating revenue. The company plans to introduce an implementation fee for schools starting in the fall of 2025 but has not yet decided on final pricing for its platform. 

The idea for Wild Zebra emerged in mid-2024, after Shahar, who previously co-founded the travel-tech startup Utrip and served for nearly a decade as CEO of edtech company Test Innovators, returned from helping lead Israel's national quantum computing initiative. 

He connected with Selberg — a veteran technologist whose career spans leadership roles at eBay, Grab, and Microsoft — through Docusign co-founder Court Lorenzini, a startup advisor. Selberg, who also co-created the MetaCrawler search engine in the early days of the web, brought deep experience in large-scale AI infrastructure and machine learning systems.

Behind the scenes, the system draws on multiple large language models depending on the context — a flexible, privacy-conscious architecture that Shahar said was shaped by Selberg's experience. This multi-model approach is also key to ensuring accuracy and preventing the AI from hallucinating or otherwise teaching incorrect information.

Selberg has “been working in AI since before it was cool,” with a “deep understanding of what problems AI can and can't solve, and how to think about the shifting landscape,” Shahar said. 

Delivered as a web-based application, Wild Zebra's AI tutor starts by assessing each student's skills, a process enhanced through a key partnership with the Educational Records Bureau (ERB), an investor in the company. 

Access to ERB's anonymized student trajectory data helps the AI understand where a student is on their learning journey. From there, the AI guides students through conversations designed to promote reasoning rather than simply providing answers. 

As students engage, the system adapts dynamically — adjusting its pace and pulling in relevant examples based on each student's preferences and interests.

Teachers remain part of the loop through a dashboard that tracks student progress and flags areas where additional support may be needed. In that way, it's designed to solve what Shahar calls one of their biggest challenges: tailoring the learning experience to individual students. 

He envisions the Wild Zebra AI as a virtual “learning specialist sitting with each and every student.” This specialist can identify whether a student is bored and needs a greater challenge or has a learning gap that needs to be filled. Those insights are then reported to the teacher's dashboard, allowing them to provide targeted small-group support where it's needed most.

Shahar said the startup is a watershed moment in his own journey, as well. 

“It does feel like everything I've worked on in my life has led to this point — building companies, working in education, being a student myself,” he said. “I don't know if a lot of people get that visceral feeling, but I'm getting it right now, and it's awesome.”

AI startup Perplexity is powering a new AI-powered search engine on Truth Social, President Donald Trump's social media platform. 

The search engine, dubbed Truth Search AI, is already available on the web version of Truth Social, with public Beta testing on its iOS and Android apps planned for “the near future.”

Trump Media said in a press release that Perplexity's tech provides “direct, contextually accurate answers with transparent citations” which will help Truth Social “exponentially increase the amount of information available” to users. Nonetheless, the social media platform maintains control over which sources of information the AI search engine draws from.

Truth Social is using the Perplexity Sonar API, which promises to query the web to retrieve current and verified information — even if that information is scraped from websites that block Perplexity's crawlers — and supports structured output so users can define the format in which they'd like to see the search engine's responses. 

Jesse Dwyer, a Perplexity spokesperson, told TechCrunch that the Sonar API will be accurate to whatever sources Truth Social limits it to.

“We have no visibility or control over that,” Dwyer said. “Similar to you using the API inside of your own company or if you were an academic researcher and wanted to use it to search your own data.”

TechCrunch has reached out to Trump Media to learn more about whether Truth Search AI will have access to the entire web, whether it will prioritize certain sources over others, and whether the AI will be directed to respond favorably about the president and current administration and unfavorably toward Democrats. 

To assess which sources the searchbot would cite, Axios asked it a bunch of questions — like “What happened on January 6, 2021?” and “Why was Donald Trump impeached?” In all the responses, FoxNews.com was either the most common or the only listed source of information. Others included FoxBusiness.com, The Washington Times, or Epoch Times, per Axios.

In contrast, Perplexity's public search engine returns a wider variety of sources, including Wikipedia, Reddit, YouTube, NPR, and Politico.

Truth Social plans to refine and expand the search function “based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media and a former California congressman, in the statement.

Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer, also noted in the statement that Perplexity's AI delivers answers with “transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper.”

In late July, alongside his AI Action Plan, Trump published an executive order targeting “biased AI,” or models that aren't “ideologically neutral.” The order specifically referred to information about race or sex, unconscious bias, systemic racism, and other ideas thrown into the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bucket as “pervasive and destructive” ideology that can “distort the quality and accuracy of the output.”

Truth Search AI comes in the same week that top AI firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google were added to a list of approved vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. OpenAI on Wednesday reached a deal with the U.S. government's central purchasing arm to sell ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 per year.

President Donald Trump called for Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan to resign from his role in a post on his Truth Social account."The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately," Trump wrote. "There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!"Trump's post comes after Republican Sen, Tom Cotton of Arkansas has called for scrutiny of Tan's ties to China. In a letter to Frank D. Yeary, chairman of Intel's board, Cotton raised alarms about connections to Chinese companies that are linked to the country's military and the Chinese Communist Party. These include Cadence Design Systems, where Tan previously served as CEO. Cotton also questioned Tan's ability to be a "responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars" for the company's nearly $8 billion CHIPS Act grant.Cotton also asked Yeary whether Tan was required to divest from any holdings in Chinese companies with ties to the country, Communist Party, or military. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company told Reuters on Wednesday that "Intel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the U.S. defense ecosystem." Tan took the top job at Intel in March, succeeding outgoing CEO Pat Gelsinger. Tan has enacted a sweeping set of measures to reduce costs, including thousands of layoffs, a return-to-office mandate, cut plans to build fabs, and plans to spin off parts of the company that aren't core to its engineering mission. Yesterday, Trump rattled the semiconductor industry when he called for a 100% tariff on chips, albeit with a loophole for companies that are building and investing in the United States.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

What Kind of Rangefinder Features Should I Expect?

Rangefinders can include a slew of features, which can make shopping as a novice confusing. The most important options in our testing include slope measurement (elevation gained or lost), a pinspotter (which zeroes in on the pin when tracking), weatherproofing, tournament mode, a cart magnet, and last but definitely not least, image stabilization.

Other handy options from some of our favorites include an OLED display for a bright targeting overlay, and Bluetooth connectivity to pair with other golf devices like a smartwatch for GPS data. The fancier you get, the more features you'll find, including options like wind speed and direction, element compensation, and more. That said, there is such a thing as too much data, and you'll usually pay a premium as the feature count goes up.

Laser vs. GPS

You may read about laser versus GPS rangefinders, but the majority of rangefinders we test (and all of the models on our list) rely mainly on laser tracking. Some rangefinders, like the Garmin Z30, can receive GPS data from a paired device or smartwatch. Others may incorporate GPS directly, but this can drain the battery quickly. You can also get GPS data from a separate app for your phone or smartwatch, often for free, which can supplement your rangefinder for blind shots. Overall, while GPS can be helpful, laser tracking is generally the way to go.

What Does Slope Mean?

Slope in relation to golf rangefinders is simply the measurement of how many yards upward or downward the ball must travel to reach its destination. It is a key feature for the best rangefinders to provide accurate club data. All of the rangefinders we tested can be set to measure slope, including both the true distance and how long a shot will actually play by accounting for elevation gained or lost to improve shot accuracy. Since slope measurement is generally barred for tournaments, each model offers a “Tournament Mode” that lists the actual distance only, usually signaled by an LED or stripe on the device.

What Kind of Magnification Do I Need?

All of the rangefinders on our list offer a minimum of 6x (six times) object magnification, adjustable with a lens focus. That magnification level worked great in tests for any distance I measured. Some models go further to 7x magnification or higher, which may be useful for those who need additional visual assistance, but for most players, 6x should suffice.

Is a Rangefinder's Maximum Range Important?

The short answer is probably not. Every rangefinder on our list offers enough range for any hole on the course, with a minimum of 700 yards for our cheapest option. Any more than that could theoretically come into play, but it's mostly stat padding.

The Nikon Coolshot Pro III Stabilized is the Cadillac of rangefinders, offering luxe features and a silky smooth ride that makes finding your elevation, shot, and hazard distances a pleasure. The key is right in the name, stabilization, which snaps shaky targets in place like an ace pilot on the stick, making quick tracking simple in challenging conditions.

I love being able to scan the horizon for hazards, while the flag locks in perfectly with a telltale buzz. Four slope modes provide options for any situation, including tournaments, and the compact design makes it easy to handle. The lack of a magnet means you can't stick it to your cart, and there's not much in the way of accessories, but the Pro III's performance makes it an easy choice as my top pick.

Shot Scope

Shot Scope

If you're after a rangefinder on a tight budget, the Shot Scope Pro L2 is all you need. This light and compact model provides impressive accuracy, standing tall with rangefinders three times the price, usually within a margin of a yard or two. Its powerful magnet lets you stick it to your cart or bag, and you'll get good accessories like a hard case, lens cleaner, and carabiner.

The monocolor reticle system isn't as handy as pricier colored options, and the optics aren't quite as clear, but with a durable design, adaptive slope reading, and extras like an app for course maps, it's hard to beat this package for the price.

Garmin

Amazon

Walmart

Garmin

The Garmin Approach Z30 is a simplified rangefinder with a hearty design and solid all-around performance. It's got a strong magnet for sticking on your cart, an intuitive (and basic) menu, and clear visuals via its transparent OLED display with a bright red targeting reticle for accurate reads with or without slope measurement.

Where the Z30 really steps up is when paired with a Garmin golf watch like the Approach S12. The Z30 sends laser targets directly to the watch, while the watch shares GPS flag distance from the front and back of the green right in the eyepiece, which really comes in handy. The Z30's main downside is its lack of image stabilization, which is a bummer at this price, but if you're a Garmin user with a steady hand, it's a great combo.

There are tons of rangefinders available in multiple styles, and while not every model makes our top list, they could still be a good fit for your needs.

How We Test Golf Rangefinders

We test rangefinders exactly how they're intended to be used: on the golf course. Sure, they're fun to mess with elsewhere—they're essentially just small telescopes—but the only way to properly access performance is to use them constantly on the links. I tested all of these rangefinders across multiple local courses, using them back-to-back (to back), which sometimes annoyed my fellow golfers, but helped gauge accuracy, clarity, and ease of use. I tested all their features, from menu settings and pin targeting, to how well their side magnets held onto my cart. I also treated them as roughly as I'd expect you will.

The Library of Congress has given a fuller explanation as to why large sections of the U.S. Constitution suddenly vanished from its official website.

As TechCrunch previously reported, parts of Section 8, as well as the entirety of Section 9 and Section 10, were deleted from Article 1 of the Constitution on the U.S. government's official website over the past month. The changes to the sections, which pertained to congressional powers, the rights of individual states, and the rights to due process, sparked alarm at a time when the Trump administration has threatened to suspend habeas corpus.

After the changes were reported, the Library of Congress tweeted that the sections were missing due to a “coding error.” 

TechCrunch reached out to the Library of Congress and received more insight into the issue: 

“The online Constitution Annotated is an educational tool which includes discussions of the Supreme Court's latest opinions linked to the text of the Constitution. When updating the site to reflect our constitutional scholars' analysis of the impact of the latest cases on Article I, Sections 8-10, the team inadvertently removed an XML tag,” Bill Ryan, the director of communications for the Library of Congress, told TechCrunch. 

“This prevented publication of everything in Article I after the middle of Section 8. The problem has been corrected, and our updated constitutional analysis is now available. We are taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the future,” said Ryan.

XML is a commonly used markup language used by the Library of Congress to format its website. A missing closing tag could plausibly result in missing text from the website, as anything outside of the tag would be ignored. 

The full text of the Constitution has now been reinstated on the Library of Congress website.

Overpower your PC's graphics with the RTX 5090

In the market for a new GPU or perhaps building a new system ahead of EA's Battlefield 6 release, whatever the reason, if you want the absolute best GPU in your build, then now could be an opportunity to pick one up at a reduced price - and boy, do they need it. The MSRP for these cards, set by Nvidia ahead of the launch of the 50-series flagship, was $1999, but we soon found that that original pricing was nowhere near the reality of the actual release prices. Cards were closer to $3000 than $2000. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can currently pick up one of these powerful graphics cards for its lowest-ever price on Amazon.

The card in question is the Zotac Gaming RTX 5090 Solid OC, which has a retail price of $2,399.99. This is $400 less than its original launch price of $2799.99 a few months ago, and checking the Camelizer and PC-Partpicker price checkers, we can confirm that this is the lowest-ever price offered for this card online from the retailers these price checkers cover.

Zotac's Gaming Solid GeForce RTX 5090 is stacked with 32GB of the latest GDDR7 VRAM running on a superfast 512-bit bus. A whopping 21,760 CUDA cores and a 2422 MHz boost clock speed are what make this beast a ridiculous performer in games. This card has the latest connectivity options, with 1 x HDMI 2.1b port and 3 x DisplayPort 2.1b ports for connecting to displays. If you're looking for the best GPU for gaming and also a popular GPU choice for productivity work, like video editing, or playing around with localized AI//large language model projects, then the 5090 is the way to go.

The most powerful consumer-grade gaming graphics card available, Nvidia's RTX 5090 is the GPU you want in your gaming rig. 32GB of GDDR7 VRAM and 21760 CUDA cores allow you to push the limits in gaming fidelity.

We've tested and reviewed the RTX 5090 and found it to perform roughly 25% better than the previous generation's RTX 4090. There is no better card if you want the absolute best in your machine, and this current price is the cheapest that you can currently get one for. While the card is becoming common on shelves than it was at launch, this is still a very expensive GPU that requires a powerful power supply and possibly a fire extinguisher.

President Donald Trump just announced a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors in a bid to force companies to build their chips within the United States or order them from local fabs. According to the Associated Press, Trump made this announcement at the Oval Office after Apple's Tim Cook promised an additional $100 billion in investments to avoid chip tariffs for iPhones.

“We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge,” says Trump. When a reporter asked him how all of these announced investments would impact the American people, the president answered, “We have the biggest chip companies — the both of them — but we have the biggest in the world coming in. They're going to Arizona and beyond. And in a short period of time, we'll be [making] up to almost 50% of the chips, starting from nothing.”

TSMC has already started production at its Arizona fab, with Apple, one of its first customers, expecting to source over 19 billion chips from local chip manufacturing. The chip manufacturer says that demand for its capacity is so high that it's already sold out through 2027, meaning companies that need chips will have to find another provider. Thankfully, Samsung's new Texas fab is also nearing completion, with the company reportedly delaying its completion due to a lack of customers.

These massive new facilities were built under the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, jumpstarting the production of some of the most advanced semiconductors in the U.S. Nevertheless, Trump's tariff threats have forced these companies and more to expand their investments, allowing him to secure about $1.5 trillion in commitments for building and expanding the chip making supply chain within America's borders.

However, we're still unsure if the output of these new fabs, and all of the existing ones, would be enough to deliver what the American industry needs. Aside from the massive demand brought about by the seismic AI infrastructure buildout being done by tech giants, nearly every other everyday item we take for granted now requires chips— from cars and appliances to light bulbs and switches.

If companies are forced to import chips at elevated rates, the American consumer will end up paying more, driving inflation and reducing demand. We also need to see more details about how the tariff exemptions will work. At the moment, the president says that he won't put a tariff on companies that are buying (or building) locally-made semiconductors and importing them as well — but how many chips should a company buy and use for it to be exempted from the import tax?

Ceretone, born on Indiegogo, hit the scene last year with impressively tiny hardware that still remains one of the smallest and lightest hearing aids I've ever reviewed. At just 0.96 grams each, the Ceretone Core One were so light they threatened to blow away in the wind. With a price of $349 per pair, they had a similarly minimal effect on your bank account.

The trouble with the original Ceretone Core One is that they just weren't very good as hearing aids. They were not tunable, suffered from occasional feedback and interference, and could be controlled only via a rudimentary mobile app. More than a year later, Ceretone has emerged with an update in the form of the Ceretone Core One Pro, and they feel like a full reboot with little in common with the original product.

The Core One Pro hearing aids are IP66-rated in-the-ear devices that, like the original Core One, are extremely small and lightweight, though at 1.17 grams per device, they're noticeably bigger than the originals. They're also noticeably less attractive. While the original Core One had a white, contemporary design with color-coded eartips, the new Core One Pro features an unfortunately dated, industrial brown body.

The included eartips have changed from closed domes to a sort of hybrid open/closed style, and they are now both clear, so you'll need to look closely to distinguish left and right. (In addition to the preinstalled pair, three additional sets of tips in different sizes are included in the package.) Battery life is now specified at 20 hours per charge, an impressive stat it delivered in my testing, though there is no useful battery meter on the hearing aids or the case. As with the Core One, these hearing aids do not support Bluetooth streaming.

Operationally, Ceretone has completely revamped the way these hearing aids work. Namely, you no longer need to use its mobile app to control them, because Ceretone's mobile app doesn't work with this model at all. There are only two types of control offered, volume and environmental program mode, and each is controlled via a different method.

To control volume, the hearing aids have to be seated in the included case—a traditional, compact device that provides 80 hours of additional charge. Two buttons—one for each aid—cycle the device through six volume levels. An LED display situated between the two hearing aids indicates the volume setting for each one as it is adjusted. (Having one volume meter for two devices is a little confusing, so it's important to remember it only shows the status for the most recently adjusted hearing aid.)

The case also includes a small indicator that shows the hearing program setting for each aid, of which there are now four: standard, restaurant, outdoor, and tinnitus-masking, all self-explanatory. (Note that I did not test the tinnitus masking mode, as I don't suffer from the condition.) These modes can be cycled through by tapping the device twice while it's in your ear, and as with adjusting the volume, each ear is controlled individually. It's strange (and inconvenient) to have to control mode and volume via two different methods, and always one ear at a time, but if you rarely change your hearing aids' volume level, it may not be that much trouble.

The bigger problem with the Core One Pro hearing aids is that, as with the Core One, they just aren't all that effective. Since the aids aren't tunable, there is no way to customize them based on your audiogram, which means that all frequencies get boosted upward, more or less.

This was immediately noticeable in my testing as lower-level frequencies were amplified far more than I needed, causing everything from footsteps to running water to be uncomfortably loud, and painfully so if I turned the volume up past level three (of six total settings). I also found a steady stream of hiss underlying everything, though this was at least mitigated at the lowest volume levels. Over time, at anything over volume level one, the Ceretone Core One Pro hearing aids were more distracting than beneficial, though there's no denying the amplification power they have. At higher volume levels, the hearing aids were downright deafening.

They're also not as comfortable for long-term wear as the original Core One, though this probably had more to do with the eartips, which are a little rough around the edges, than the design of the hearing aid hardware itself.

As with the original Core One, I'm not entirely sure who these hearing aids are designed for, even at a quite reasonable price of $390. (List price is $700, for what it's worth.) Without any tunability features, users are getting a very blunt audio experience that prioritizes brute amplification over everything instead of helping them better hear the sounds they want to hear.

An experimental pill made by Eli Lilly led to average weight loss of more than 12 percent of body weight in individuals with obesity, according to initial trial results announced by the drugmaker on Thursday. The pill is meant to be taken daily and would be an alternative to the company's popular anti-obesity drug Zepbound, a once-weekly injectable drug.

Called orforglipron, it's part of a growing class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy. The drugs mimic a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps regulate blood sugar and promotes a feeling of fullness. Injected GLP-1 drugs have shown weight loss of around 15 to 20 percent.

Eli Lilly's 18-month trial included more than 3,000 adults with an average starting weight of 228 pounds and a body mass index of 37, which is considered obese. Participants were randomized to receive either 6, 12, or 36 milligrams of orforglipron or a placebo pill. The lowest dose of orforglipron resulted in less than 8 percent loss of body weight, or about 18 pounds, and the middle dose led to a 9 percent reduction, or 21 pounds.

The highest dose led to the most weight loss—12 percent on average, or about 27 pounds, compared to 2 pounds with the placebo. In the highest-dose group, about 60 percent of participants lost at least 10 percent of their body weight, while 40 percent lost 15 percent or more.

Participants who received orforglipron started the study at a dose of 1 milligram daily and then increased the dose every four weeks to their final maintenance dose. Everyone in the trial, including those in the placebo group, was also prescribed a healthy diet and physical activity. There were no food or water restrictions for taking the pill.

The pill was safe, but like injected GLP-1 drugs, orforglipron caused gastrointestinal side effects for many participants. The most common was nausea, which was suffered by a third of participants in the highest-dose group; constipation was experienced by about a quarter of patients in that group, as were diarrhea and vomiting. Those side effects led to more than 20 percent of participants in each dosage group dropping out during the course of the study.

Eli Lilly says more detailed results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill for diabetes, Rybelsus, but it's not as effective for weight loss as injectable versions and was never approved for weight management.

Orforglipron also looks promising as a diabetes treatment. In a recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the pill lowered blood sugar levels and weight in people with type 2 diabetes. Eli Lilly says it plans to submit orforglipron for regulatory review by the end of the year.

Novo Nordisk has a GLP-1 pill for diabetes, Rybelsus, but it's not as effective for weight loss as injectable versions and was never approved for weight management. A challenge with developing a more effective pill has been how to improve its bioavailability—the amount of drug that enters circulation and has an active effect. Other GLP-1 drugs are made up of larger molecules that are not easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Instead, most of the drug gets digested. Eli Lilly might have solved that problem with orforglipron, a small-molecule formulation.

Alzheimer's disease is one of the cruelest conditions a person can develop. And even with recent advances, there's only so much that can be done once its symptoms emerge. Research out this week might highlight a critical and previously missed factor driving the disease, one that could even lead to new treatments.

Scientists at Harvard Medical School led the study, published Wednesday in Nature. By studying human brain samples and mice, they found evidence that our brains naturally contain the element lithium—and that its deficiency can help explain the damage caused by Alzheimer's. The findings are well supported and may have uncovered an important aspect of the neurological disorder, an outside expert told Gizmodo.

The study researchers “have performed detailed and well-designed studies to investigate how low lithium levels are associated with [Alzheimer's disease] at the diagnostic, protein, cellular and gene levels,” said Timothy Chang, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who was not involved with the study. Chang is also director of the California Alzheimer's Disease Center at UCLA.

This Anesthesia Gas Could Be the Next Big Alzheimer's Treatment

The brains of people with Alzheimer's are different in many ways from others. In particular, they contain high levels of misfolded amyloid beta and tau, two proteins that normally have important functions. But these aren't the only changes seen in Alzheimer's. And it was while investigating these other changes that the Harvard researchers made their discovery.

With the help of existing projects that collected postmortem tissue samples, they compared levels of around 30 metals in the brains of people who died along varying stages of cognitive health. The only major difference they found was with lithium. People with cognitively healthy brains had relatively high levels of lithium, whereas those with Alzheimer's had much lower levels. Importantly, this loss of lithium was apparent even in people who only experienced mild memory problems before dying.

The researchers also studied healthy mice and genetically modified mice that develop a version of Alzheimer's disease. When they depleted lithium from these mice, it appeared to accelerate the buildup of unhealthy amyloid beta and tau in the brain, along with memory decline. They also found evidence that this loss is caused by amyloid beta plaques binding to the brain's lithium and that this loss of lithium seems to negatively affect all of the brain's major cell types.

Though there has been some limited research suggesting a possible connection between lithium and Alzheimer's, the authors say theirs is the first to show that our brains naturally carry it. What's more, their findings hint that lithium is essential to good brain health and that its absence is key to the development of Alzheimer's.

“This is the first study to suggest that lithium deficiency might contribute to Alzheimer's disease. The reason this has not been proposed is because it was not believed that lithium is a natural substance in the brain with biological effect, just a drug with pharmacological effects at high doses,” senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in Harvard Medical School's Blavatnik Institute, told Gizmodo. “As such, this study is the first to explore the consequences of lithium deficiency in the brain.”

The implications of this study, while still early, could certainly be dramatic. Yankner and his team were also able to identify a lithium-based compound that wasn't so easily bound by amyloid beta. And when they gave mice (older healthy mice and mice with Alzheimer's) this compound, it appeared to prevent the damaging brain changes and memory loss normally inevitable with the neurodegenerative condition. Even the best amyloid-based treatments for Alzheimer's available today, by contrast, only modestly delay its progression.

Other forms of lithium are used in medicine to treat certain mental health disorders, particularly depression. But these versions require high dosages to work as intended and come with many side effects as a result. The team's compound, however, required a much lower dose to be effective in the mice, and no sign of toxicity was observed at all.

“Further clinical studies in humans would be necessary to evaluate if the right type and dose of lithium can prevent or slow Alzheimer's disease,” Chang noted.

Shingles Vaccine Offers Hope Against Dementia

Yankner and his team are now moving ahead with the research needed to show their compound (or something similar) can be safely tested in human clinical trials. But even before then, the team's discovery could pay off in other ways. It might be possible to screen for Alzheimer's risk in the future by measuring people's lithium levels, for example. And there are still many mysteries left to untangle about lithium and its role in brain health.

“As a neuroscientist, I am excited about exploring the physiology of lithium in the brain,” Yankner said. “I suspect we have just scratched the surface of what will be some very interesting biology.”

We're now working on improving the scalability of LISTEN/NOTIFY in PostgreSQL, and
to guide that work, I'd like to better understand how it's used (or was used) in
real-world systems. What works well? What doesn't?The current implementation has some known scalability bottlenecks:1. Thundering Herd Problem:  
   A NOTIFY wakes up all listening backends in the current database, even those
   not listening on the notified channel. This is inefficient when many
   listeners are each listening to their own channels (e.g. in job queues).2. Commit Lock Contention:  
   NOTIFY operations are serialized behind a heavyweight lock at transaction commit.
   This can become a bottleneck when many transactions send notifications in parallel.If you've used LISTEN/NOTIFY in production, I'd love to hear:- What is/was your use case?- Does each client listen on its own channel, or do they share channels?- How many listening backend processes?- How many NOTIFYs in parallel?- Are you sending payloads? If so, how large?- What worked well for you? What didn't?- Did you hit any scalability limits?Feedback much appreciated, thanks!/Joel

A newly engineered antibody transport vehicle targeting the transferrin receptor enables enhanced delivery of anti-amyloid antibodies to the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, researchers report. According to the study, the approach preserves key immune functions, such as microglial clearance of plaques, while offering a safer and more effective delivery strategy for anti–amyloid immunotherapies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein plaques in the brain. FDA-approved anti-amyloid drugs, like aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, have shown limited success in reducing Aβ plaque buildup and slightly slowing cognitive decline in AD. Still, they do not stop the disease from progressing. Their clinical benefits might be further constrained by suboptimal penetration into the brain and by common side effects, including brain swelling and small brain bleeds, collectively known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

To overcome these limitations, Michelle Pizzo and colleagues engineered a novel antibody transport vehicle (ATV) that targets the transferrin receptor – a natural gateway on blood vessels that allows certain molecules to cross the BBB. The design, called ATVcisLALA, incorporates a mutation to reduce harmful interactions with immune receptors on immature red blood cells, thereby preventing cytotoxic side effects. In a mouse model of AD, Pizzo et al. show that, when fused with an anti–amyloid-β antibody (creating ATVcisLALA:Aβ), the modified therapy successfully entered brain tissue more efficiently than conventional antibodies.

Notably, ATVcisLALA:Aβ distributed broadly throughout the brain parenchyma, increasing brain concentrations by five- to eightfold. The researchers' approach also showed enhanced targeting of plaque-associated Aβ in brain tissue rather than in blood vessels, which reduced vascular inflammation and significantly lowered the incidence of ARIA-like side effects. "Taken together, the findings of Pizzo et al. provide more than preclinical proof of concept; they also establish a framework for therapeutic design," write Mengen Xing and Weihong Song in a related Perspective. "By precisely controlling the route of antibody entry and modulating its function, ATVcisLALA:Aβ overcomes long-standing limitations of AD immunotherapy.

Tiny extracellular vesicles known as exosomes are emerging as key regulators of the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing how cancer progresses, spreads, and responds to treatment. In a new review published in Med Research, researchers from Haikou Affiliated Hospital of Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine explore the dual nature of exosomes-highlighting their roles in both tumor promotion and immune modulation.

Exosomes are not just passive carriers. They actively shape tumor biology by transferring RNAs, proteins, and lipids that reprogram both cancer and immune cells."

Dr. Jiachong Wang, co-corresponding author of the paper

The review focuses on tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) and their diverse molecular cargo, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), which contribute to oncogenesis. These exosomes promote tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance by activating key signaling pathways-including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB.

At the same time, TDEs also profoundly influence the immune landscape. They can suppress immune responses by delivering immunoinhibitory ligands like PD-L1 and CTLA-4 or by inducing immunosuppressive cell types, such as M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Conversely, exosomes from immune or engineered cells may restore antitumor immunity by delivering cytokines, antigenic peptides, or RNA-based therapeutics.

The review also discusses liquid biopsy applications, showing how exosomal RNA and protein content reflects tumor stage, heterogeneity, and treatment response. This paves the way for noninvasive monitoring of disease progression and therapy resistance.

As interest in exosome biology grows, this review synthesizes current knowledge while pointing to future directions, such as exosome engineering and combined immunotherapy approaches. It positions exosomes as both culprits and potential cures in the evolving fight against cancer.

The incidence of early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) is rising, yet optimal treatment strategies remain unclear. While adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) has shown survival benefits in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its specific role in EOPC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and surgery remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the clinical benefit of ACT in EOPC patients after NACT.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients from the SEER database (2006–2019) who received NACT followed by curative resection. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance covariates such as tumor, lymph node, metastasis stage, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared between patients with EOPC (<50 years) and average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC, ≥50 years). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors.

After propensity score matching (124 EOPC vs. 124 AOPC), EOPC patients had significantly longer median OS (41.0 vs. 29.0 months, P = 0.042) and CSS (48.0 vs. 30.0 months, P = 0.016). ACT was an independent prognostic factor for EOPC (OS: hazard ratio = 0.495, 95% confidence interval 0.271–0.903, P = 0.022; CSS: hazard ratio = 0.419, 95% confidence interval 0.219–0.803, P = 0.009), but not for AOPC (P > 0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that EOPC patients with tumor, lymph node, metastasis stage II disease or those receiving ACT derived the greatest survival benefit.

EOPC patients exhibit superior survival following NACT and surgical resection compared to AOPC, with ACT further enhancing outcomes in this subgroup. These findings support the use of tailored ACT for EOPC and underscore the need for prospective validation.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant cause of hospital admissions and treatment discontinuation worldwide. Conventional approaches often fail to detect rare or delayed effects of medicinal products. In order to improve early detection, a research team from the Medical University of Sofia developed a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of ADRs based solely on a drug's chemical structure.

The model was built using a neural network trained using reference pharmacovigilance data. Input features were derived from SMILES codes - a standard format representing molecular structure. Predictions were generated for six major ADRs: hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hypertension, and photosensitivity.

"We could conclude that it successfully identified many expected reactions while producing relatively few false positives," the researchers write in their paper published in the journal Pharmacia, concluding it "demonstrates acceptable accuracy in predicting ADRs."

Testing of the model with well-characterized drugs resulted in predictions consistent with known side-effect profiles. For example, it estimated a 94.06% probability of hepatotoxicity for erythromycin, 88.44% for nephrotoxicity and 75.8% for hypertension in cisplatin. Additionally, 22% photosensitivity was predicted for cisplatin, while 64.8% photosensitivity was estimated for the experimental compound ezeprogind. For enadoline, a novel molecule, the model returned low probability scores across all ADRs, suggesting minimal risk.

Notably, these results demonstrate the model's potential as a decision-support tool in early-phase drug discovery and regulatory safety monitoring. The authors acknowledge that performance of the infrastructure could be further enhanced by incorporating factors such as dose levels and patient-specific parameters.

Antibiotic resistance in the environment is a growing and largely overlooked crisis receiving inconsistent attention, that may very well have dire consequences for human health, according to a new study led by the University of Surrey.

The comprehensive review, published in Environment International, researched 13,000 studies from 1990 to 2021 to identify patterns and gaps in the topic area. The team identified 738 studies that focused strictly on non-built, non-industrial environments, such as rivers, fields and air.

The researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are most often detected in freshwater and soil, particularly in places exposed to pollution from wastewater or manure. Two bacteria - Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas - were the most studied organisms, while genes conferring resistance to medicines including sulphonamides, tetracyclines and beta-lactams, were very prominent.

Worryingly, very few studies have explored how antibiotic resistance spreads in the air, oceans or green spaces. The team also highlighted a lack of research in low-income regions, where the health burden of antibiotic resistance is likely to be highest.

Despite a growing body of research, our study confirms that we know frighteningly little about how antibiotic resistance behaves in certain regions and environmental contexts. This is a silent emergency, and unless the scientific community works quickly to plug this knowledge gap, we risk letting antibiotic resistance spread unchecked in places we're not appropriately monitoring."

Dr. Brian Gardner, Research Fellow in Computational Biology, University of Surrey

The Surrey team also found that a third of the studies came from China, followed by the United States. But fewer than one percent were led by researchers in low-income countries, such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mali and Uganda, despite these areas facing some of the greatest health risks from antibiotic resistance. Climate change and microplastics were also strikingly absent from the evidence base. While this trend may have shifted in last couple of years, given the rapid evolution of the field, it is unlikely to have changed substantially, leaving critical questions unanswered about how environmental shifts may be accelerating the problem.

Dr. Gianni Lo Iacono, Senior Lecturer in Biostatistics/Epidemiology, University of Surrey, said:

"This research was only possible thanks to the formidable contributions of 55 colleagues, whose expertise and commitment were indispensable. Our findings highlight an urgent need for more research in low-income regions, which face higher risks of antibiotic resistance but are severely underrepresented in current studies. To truly combat antibiotic resistance globally, we must broaden our research scope to include diverse environments and geographic regions, particularly those most vulnerable."

In a discovery that could broaden access to next-generation biologic medicines and vaccines, researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (UChicago PME) have engineered polymer-based nanoparticles that form with a simple temperature shift-no harsh chemicals, no specialized equipment, and no processing needed. 

The new nanoparticles, described in Nature Biomedical Engineering, self-assemble at room-temperature in water and, because of these gentle conditions, can deliver proteins, which are unstable in many existing nanoparticle formulations. 

What excites me about this platform is its simplicity and versatility. By simply warming a sample from fridge temperature to room temperature, we can reliably make nanoparticles that are ready to deliver a wide variety of biological drugs."

Stuart Rowan, co-senior author, the Barry L. MacLean Professor for Molecular Engineering Innovation and Enterprise at UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering and staff scientist Argonne National Laboratory

Nanoparticles are key to protecting delicate drugs like RNA and proteins from being degraded in the body before they reach the right cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), made of fatty molecules, enabled the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, for instance. But LNPs rely on alcohol-based solvents and sensitive manufacturing steps-making them poorly suited for protein delivery and hard to scale.

"We wanted to make a delivery system that could work for both RNA and protein therapies-because right now, most platforms are specialized for just one," said first author Samir Hossainy, a UChicago PME graduate student. "We also wanted to make it scalable, without needing toxic solvents or complicated microfluidics."

Hossainy hypothesized that polymer-based nanoparticles could offer a more robust, customizable alternative. He outlined the required characteristics; the immune system will only respond to particles with certain sizes, shapes, and charges. Then, he used chemical tools to begin designing new nanoparticles from scratch. 

After trying, and fine-tuning, more than a dozen different materials, he found one that worked. In cold water, the polymer-and any desired protein-remained dissolved. But when heated to room temperature, the polymer self-assembled into uniformly sized nanoparticles (or "polymersomes") surrounding the protein molecules. 

"Our particle size and morphology is dictated only by the chemistry of the polymers that I designed from the bottom up," explained Hossainy. "We don't have to worry about different particle sizes forming, which is a challenge with a lot of today's nanoparticles."

To test the new polymersomes, Hossainy worked with colleagues in Rowan's lab as well as with former UChicago PME Prof. Jeffrey Hubbell, now at New York University. First, they showed that the particles can encapsulate more than 75% of protein and nearly 100% of short interfering RNA (siRNA) cargo-far higher than most current systems-and they can be freeze-dried and stored without refrigeration until needed.

In the context of vaccination, Hossainy and his collaborators found that the polymersomes could effectively carry a protein and, when injected into mice, lead the animals' immune systems to generate long-lasting antibodies against that protein. Another experiment showed that the nanoparticles could also carry proteins designed to prevent an immune response in the context of allergic asthma. And a third showed that injecting polymersomes into tumors could block cancer-related genes and suppress tumor growth in mice. 

"The exciting thing is that we didn't need to tailor a different system for each use case," said Hossainy. "This one formulation worked for everything we tried-proteins, RNA, immune activation, immune suppression, and direct tumor targeting."

One of the biggest advantages of the new polymersomes over current LNPs is the potential for low-tech, decentralized production. Hossainy says he imagines being able to ship freeze-dried formulations of the nanoparticles to anywhere in the world. When they need to be used, they can be mixed in cold water, warmed up, and will be ready to deliver to patients. 

"Being able to store these dry drastically improves the stability of the RNA or protein," said Hossainy. 

The group is continuing to work on fine-turning the particles to carry more types of cargo, including messenger RNA like that used in the COVID-19 vaccines (generally much larger than the siRNA used in the current trial). They also plan to collaborate on pre-clinical trials to apply the polymersomes to real-world vaccine or drug delivery challenges.

Despite social media helping to increase awareness of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among the public (81% of health care providers agree) and advancements in treatment over the past decade, IBS symptoms continue to significantly impact patients' daily lives and productivity, according to a new survey released by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), in partnership with The Harris Poll, a Stagwell (STGW) agency.

The AGA IBS in America survey reveals compelling new insights that explore shifts in patient experiences, health care provider perceptions, and the treatment landscape for IBS from a similar study conducted in 2015. The 2024 comprehensive study, which included 2,013 patients with IBS and 600 health care providers, sheds light on persistent challenges faced by patients with IBS.

Survey findings indicate that IBS symptoms interfere with patients' productivity at work/school for nearly 11 days per month on average, in addition to symptoms disrupting personal activities eight days per month on average, highlighting the substantial burden of the condition. Patients with IBS are missing more work/school days per month due to their gastrointestinal symptoms than they were 10 years ago (3.6 days in 2024, 2.1 days in 2015), and more report spending less time with family and friends because of their symptoms (58%, up from 48% in 2015).

The study also revealed that while fewer patients in 2024 report their symptoms are very or extremely bothersome (43%, compared to 62% in 2015), 76% still find it somewhat or very difficult to manage their symptoms. The ability to accurately predict symptoms remains elusive, with less than one in three patients (31% in 2024, in line with 29% in 2015) reporting that they can very or extremely accurately predict whether they will experience symptoms today.

All of this affects patients' willingness or ability to make plans and ultimately impacts how patients feel about themselves.

Seven in 10 patients don't feel like themselves because of their symptoms (72%), say their symptoms make them feel like they're not "normal" (69%), or feel their symptoms prevent them from reaching their full potential/being successful (69%).

The findings of this survey underscore the persistent challenges and impact IBS has on patients' lives. Despite progress in the medical community's approach to diagnosing and managing IBS, patients continue to suffer significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives."

Andrea Shin, MD, MSCR, AGA Patient Education Advisor and UCLA Health

Despite treatment options evolving over the last 10 years to now include a wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents to treat IBS, the survey findings highlight that patients and health care providers rely predominantly on over-the-counter treatment options and lifestyle adjustments rather than prescription medications.

While prescription medications are among the most helpful treatments, according to patients with IBS who have tried them (18% for IBS-C, 19% for IBS-D), patients report that these treatments are not among the top three treatments recommended by health care providers, which typically include:

While more than two in five health care providers whose patients ever request a specific IBS treatment (45%) say they will recommend or prescribe the requested treatment always or most of the time, only around one in 10 (14%) say patients often do so. Patients should be encouraged to advocate for and request new or alternative treatments and proactively discuss options with their health care provider.

Most patients with both IBS-C and IBS-D (78% each) are satisfied with the treatments they currently take; however, only about one in five are very satisfied (25% IBS-C, 26% IBS-D). Further, compared to 2015, more physicians who treat IBS say effective relief of abdominal pain (49% vs. 39%) or diarrhea/constipation (47% vs. 33%) and the availability of treatment options (49% vs. 34%) are what is most lacking in IBS treatment today despite advancements in the IBS treatment landscape. These findings highlight an opportunity for further improvement in treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction.

"IBS is a condition that continues to challenge patients to find a treatment that consistently works for them," said Jeffrey Roberts, founder of the IBS Patient Support Group community and founder of World IBS Day. "The AGA IBS in America Survey sheds light on patients who are still not being offered a variety of treatments that could provide them with a better quality of life. This continues to result in disruptions to their career, schooling, and life with their families and friends."

AGA is committed to continued research and education to address the persistent impact of IBS on patients' lives and productivity, supporting health care providers and patients in managing this chronic condition effectively.

The AGA IBS in America survey was conducted with support from Salix Medical Affairs, a division of Bausch Health US, Inc.

The patient research was conducted online in the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of AGA between Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, 2024, among 2,013 U.S. adults age 18+ who have been diagnosed by a health care provider with IBS-C (1,005) or IBS-D (1,008) and have not been diagnosed with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcers, or colon, stomach, or other cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The health care provider research was conducted online in the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of AGA between Nov. 15 and Dec. 9, 2024, among 600 health care providers including gastroenterologists (n=200), primary care physicians (PCPs, n=200), gastroenterology nurse practitioners (NP)/physician assistants (PA) (n=100), and PCP NP/PAs (n=100) aged 18 or older who practice in the U.S., treat adult patients, see at least six IBS patients per month, and see IBS-C or IBS-D patients. 

Data for patients are weighted, where necessary, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, household income, employment, and smoking status to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population. Data for physicians are weighted separately, as necessary, by gender and age for each specialty to align with their actual proportions in the population. Data for advanced practice providers (APPs) were not weighted and are therefore only representative of the individuals who completed the survey. Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in The Harris Poll surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data for patients is accurate to within ± 2.9 percentage points. The data for each physician specialty is accurate to within ± 7.2 percentage points, using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest. 

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

Comparing metagenomic profiles of the skin microbiome in immunosuppressed patients and those at high and low risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) revealed distinct expansions in fungal and viral taxa in the first two groups, according to the authors of a recent research letter reporting the results. Such differences one day may help clinicians identify patients at high SCC risk, they added.

Currently, physicians identify patients at high SCC risk based on whether they have had several prior SCCs. Analyzing skin microbiome changes to identify patients at high SCC risk before they develop several SCCs could revolutionize dermatologic care, senior author and investigator, Shadmehr Demehri, MD, PhD, said in an interview. He is the Arthur and Sandra Irving Endowed Chair in Cancer Immunology and director of the High Risk Skin Cancer Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

Although age, ultraviolet exposure, and immunosuppression are well-known SCC risk factors, Demehri said, the skin microbiome's contribution to SCC risk remains unclear. To explore this issue, he and his coinvestigators conducted comparative metagenomic analyses of skin microbiomes from 30 patients: six with high SCC risk (> 2 prior SCCs), nine with low SCC risk (≤ 2 prior SCCs), and 15 solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). The results were published online in July in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Using swabs from six bilateral anatomical sites per patient, with air swabs as negative controls, the investigators performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and differential-abundance analyses to compare relative taxa populations across patient groups. After an analysis of 249 metagenomes, high-risk individuals had the highest mean SCC count (11.8), followed by SOTRs (8.73) and low-risk individuals (0.33).

“Compared with low‐risk SCC subjects,” Demehri added, “both solid organ transplant recipients and high‐risk SCC subjects showed higher relative abundances of eukaryotes, such as Malassezia restricta and M globosa, and viruses such as Betapapillomavirus.” Moreover, these taxa showed robust differences and strong discriminatory power between patient groups, indicating their potential utility as signatures of elevated SCC risk, he told Medscape Medical News.

Currently, it remains unclear whether the relative expansion of certain skin microbiome components directly drives SCC pathogenesis or reflects underlying immune alterations that raise SCC risk indirectly. And despite the eukaryotic expansions observed in the high-risk and SOTR groups, researchers saw no between-group differences in Malassezia-related conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis. Yet subclinical expansions in Malassezia and viral taxa still may translate into increased SCC risk, Demehri said.

Accordingly, he said, dermatologists must not assume that people who develop certain viral and fungal skin diseases are at higher risk for SCC. “It's more subtle changes, probably in association with other microbiome changes, that seem to be associated with skin cancer risk.” Nonetheless, Demehri said, watching for skin conditions that signify an expanded skin microbiome — such as the appearance of warts in fair-skinned adults — may signal the need to monitor for SCC risk.

Sancy A. Leachman, MD, PhD, professor and vice-chair of faculty development in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, said that although the study requires replication in larger, prospective cohorts, its findings are provocative for several reasons. She was not involved with the study but was asked to comment.

Dermatologists are starting to embrace the skin microbiome concept but rarely beyond bacteria and yeasts, Leachman told Medscape Medical News. “I don't believe most dermatologists are thinking about papillomaviruses being commensal: present on your skin as a normal part of your microbiome,' she said. The observation that baseline papillomavirus populations can exist on normal-appearing skin without causing pathology is important information, she added. “What is their purpose there? What's the evolutionary advantage?”

A study published in Cancer Cell in January 2025 showed that commensal papillomaviruses can boost immune surveillance and clearing of UV-induced p53-mutant keratinocytes. “It appears that the commensal papillomavirus population may help to stimulate the immune system in a way that helps the immune response against skin cancer,” Leachman said.

Papillomaviruses work primarily through p53. “So if you've developed an immune reaction against a p53 element of the papillomavirus,” Leachman said, “there's a possibility that might cross-react with abnormalities of the p53 pathway in squamous cell carcinomas and act like a mini-vaccine against the tumor. And if that's true, could you do that intentionally as a therapeutic or prevention strategy?”

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have proven highly effective in preventing cervical cancer. However, she said, based on the results of commensal HPVs protecting against SCC, it is unclear whether elimination of commensals by the vaccine could render some women more or less susceptible to SCC later in life.

“If those papillomavirus vaccines cross-react, and you're diminishing the commensal papillomaviruses that are helpful in recognizing squamous cell carcinoma,” she asked, “are you going to have people who experience an idiosyncratic increase in squamous carcinoma because the HPV vaccine prevents development of a robust commensal population of helpful papillomaviruses? I don't believe anyone has even examined alterations of commensal HPV populations following vaccination.” 

One of the study's most tantalizing findings requiring further follow-up, Leachman said, is that the nonimmunosuppressed high-risk group (median age, 78.5 years) was much older than the low-risk group (63.0 years). “That says there's probably some sort of functional immunosuppression occurring in those high-risk people.”

As baby boomers age, Leachman added, the population with immune-system senescence will grow. “If you can use solid organ transplant recipients as a model for the aging population that is becoming functionally immunosuppressed, that would be very beneficial, to know how to tailor treatments, detection methods, and even potential risk evaluation methods for these people.”

Anecdotally, Leachman has identified a group of patients with what she calls systemic “skin failure” — elderly patients at an extremely high SCC risk who routinely have multiple skin cancers and precancers excised. “Generally, those people are older and have an apparent functional immunosuppression; in my hands, they seem to respond better to topical imiquimod than topical 5-fluorouracil.”

Based on years of clinical observation, she prescribes topical immunotherapy rather than topical chemotherapy depending on patient age and the number and (wart-like) appearance of their SCCs.

In the interview, Demehri said that although it might be tempting to try and alter the skin microbiome through supplements or topical agents, nothing in the study suggests a cause-and-effect relationship such that modifying the microbiome would directly affect SCC risk. Therefore, he said that along with SCC detection and monitoring, immunosuppression and its role in skin cancer development should receive more emphasis.

Presently, Demehri's lab is exploring ways to detect and monitor microbiome changes more feasibly than through costly shotgun sequencing. “It's not something we can do for every patient all the time to monitor their skin. But there are ways we could extract that information more directly from the skin by swabs and then inform the physician that the patient might be at risk of cancer as well because their microbiome is being altered in ways that are associated with increased risk.” Broad adoption of such techniques, he estimated, is perhaps a few years away.

This study was supported partly by the Intramural Research Programs of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) at the National Institutes of Health. Study coauthors were from the Center for Cancer Immunology and the Cutaneous Biology Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and from the NHGRI and NIAMS. Demehri had filed a patent for the development of T cell-directed anticancer vaccines against commensal viruses. Other authors had no disclosures. Leachman is an investigator or advisor for several companies involved in screening and early diagnosis of melanoma but reported no relevant financial relationships.

Can what you eat during pregnancy really change your gut bacteria? New research reveals how the Mediterranean diet boosts beneficial microbes for expectant mothers, while stress-busting mindfulness may not be enough.

In a recent study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers conducted a clinical sub-analysis to investigate the impacts of maternal diet and stress levels on the maternal microbiome. The study leveraged data from the IMPACT BCN randomized trial and found that a Mediterranean diet intervention significantly altered the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, promoting an increase in beneficial, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria.

A mindfulness-based stress reduction program had more modest effects on the maternal gut microbiome, with some increases in health-associated bacteria, but did not significantly alter overall microbiome structure (p=0.094). These findings highlight the maternal gut as a potential therapeutic target for improving both maternal health and potentially influencing long-term child welfare. It is important to note that microbiome outcomes were measured as exploratory endpoints, and further research is needed to determine how these changes may influence clinical outcomes for mothers and infants.

Eating more fish, nuts, and legumes – key parts of the Mediterranean pattern – was consistently tied to higher levels of beneficial bacteria families like Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae across all participants.

Pregnancy represents a period of substantial and profound physiological change, extending beyond just the mother and her developing fetus to also include their resident microbial symbionts. Notably, research has found that maternal gut and vaginal microbiomes are the primary sources for seeding the infant's microbiota, a process critical for the latter's development of a healthy immune system and metabolism in later life.

Parallel studies have established a link between the independent influences of diet and stress on non-pregnant adult microbiome composition and function. Unfortunately, there remains a scarcity of evidence from randomized trials on whether structured lifestyle interventions, such as diet and stress level interventions, especially during pregnancy, can purposefully and beneficially alter these crucial microbial ecosystems.

Understanding these associations would provide prospective mothers and their caregivers with the information to optimize maternal and fetal physiological outcomes.

One of the clearest effects of the Mediterranean diet was a significant drop in the relative amount of Campylobacter bacteria, a genus sometimes linked to gut inflammation.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a sub-analysis of the Improving Mothers for a better PrenAtal Care Trial BarCeloNa (IMPACT BCN) cohort, a randomized controlled trial (parallel design) carried out at the Hospital Clínic and Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (BCNatal) in Barcelona, Spain. IMPACT BCN aimed to elucidate whether lifestyle interventions could reduce the incidence of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns.

The current study focused on the maternal microbiome as a key exploratory outcome and used a subsample of 351 pregnant individuals from the main trial who were at high risk of having an SGA baby. Identified participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental subgroups: 1. The Med Diet group – These individuals received counselling to adopt a Mediterranean dietary pattern, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. 2. The Stress Reduction (SR) group – These individuals were enrolled in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (Kabat-Zinn adapted for pregnancy), and 3. Usual/routine Care group: These individuals were subjected to standard prenatal care protocols without additional intervention.

Study data collection comprised the extraction of maternal fecal and vaginal samples (following intervention termination – 34-36 weeks' gestation). Crucially, a subset of 85 participants was used to obtain baseline readings (before intervention initiation). Microbiome structure was evaluated using high-resolution 16S rRNA gene sequencing for community characterization and functional evaluation.

While stress reduction didn't reshape the whole gut community, moms in that program showed specific increases in bacteria like Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and these shifts sometimes mirrored lower stress levels measured in questionnaires.

Study findings revealed that modifiable behaviors, particularly diet, are strongly linked to microbiome health in pregnant women. Specifically, the Med Diet intervention was closely associated with the overall alteration of the gut microbiota structure (p = 0.002), leading to a significant enrichment in bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum. Adherence to the Med Diet was observed to promote the growth of bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) known to produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

Simultaneously, Med Diet adherence reduced microbiome concentrations of potentially harmful bacteria, most notably the genus Campylobacter (p < 0.001). While the strength of outcomes was more limited, the mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention was associated with enrichment of specific health-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Turicibacter, but did not significantly affect the overall gut microbiota composition (p=0.094 for overall structure).

Microbial diversity was observed to decrease as pregnancy progressed, with this reduction being more pronounced among participants in the intervention groups.

Additionally, independent of intervention group assignment, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern correlated with greater microbial diversity and beneficial microbial shifts.

It should be noted that the study exclusively analyzed the maternal microbiome; the offspring's microbiome was not assessed.

Neither intervention had a significant effect on the composition or diversity of the vaginal microbiota, which remained stable (dominated by the Lactobacillus genus), as is typical during a healthy pregnancy.

The present study provides the first evidence highlighting the role of structured interventions (targeting modifiable behaviours) in influencing the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy. It demonstrates that a Mediterranean diet can foster a gut environment rich in beneficial, anti-inflammatory SCFA-producing bacteria, providing a plausible mechanism through which this diet may improve pregnancy outcomes. However, clinical outcomes related to these microbiome changes were not directly assessed in this sub-analysis and should be investigated in future research. While the stress reduction program's effect was more subtle, study findings still suggest a link between psychological well-being and gut microbial health.

Together, these outcomes position the maternal gut microbiome as a potentially important therapeutic target. By optimizing a mother's diet and promoting stress management, it may be possible to cultivate a healthier microbial environment that benefits both mother and child. Future research exploring the long-term impacts of these microbial shifts on neonatal and child health may allow for the development of personalized maternal behavioral interventions designed to optimize both her and her offspring's safety and holistic health.

A latest systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by scientists from institutions across China and the United States has uncovered promising insights into how vitamin D supplementation can significantly impact cardiometabolic health. The study, which was published in Engineering, has implications for tailored therapeutic strategies targeting cardiovascular diseases and related risks.

The comprehensive review analyzed 99 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 17 656 participants. The analysis revealed that vitamin D supplementation, with a median dose of 3320 International Units (IU) per day, was associated with favorable effects on various cardiometabolic risk factors, including reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and fasting blood insulin.

Significantly, the researchers discovered that the benefits of vitamin D supplementation were most pronounced in specific groups: non-Western populations, individuals with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 15.0 ng·mL−1, those with a body mass index (BMI) below 30 kg·m−2, and older individuals aged 50 years or above.

This research underscores the need for personalized vitamin D intervention strategies, taking into account individual characteristics such as ethnocultural background, age, BMI, and baseline vitamin D levels. The findings highlight the potential of longer intervention durations (three months or more) and higher doses to optimize cardiometabolic health outcomes in specific populations.

These findings could lead to significant advancements in preventive medicine and nutritional sciences, potentially leading to the development of more effective public health strategies. By tailoring vitamin D supplementation based on individual characteristics, healthcare providers may improve intervention efficacy and reduce the prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases.

The authors suggest that future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms behind these observed effects and the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation on chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, studies exploring the long-term effects and potential risks associated with high-dose supplementation are warranted.

This landmark study not only provides new insights into the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for cardiometabolic health but also emphasizes the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing these effects. As cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality globally, the findings from this meta-analysis offer a glimmer of hope for more targeted and effective preventive strategies.

Mount Sinai researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of teaching surgical trainees a difficult procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and an extended-reality headset without the presence of an instructor. All of the 17 trainees in the study achieved surgical success.

The novel study, published in Journal of Medical Extended Reality, drew highly favorable reviews from student participants who tested the deep learning model. The results carry significant implications for future training of residents and surgeons, as well as for the even broader field of autonomous learning within medicine.

For the first time, we created an AI model linked to an extended-reality headset to prove that a critical step in a kidney cancer procedure could be done with 99.9 percent accuracy. We believe our study offers early proof that AI programs that substitute for proctors, who teach resident physicians, can reduce training costs and ultimately improve the quality, efficiency, and standardization of that instruction."

Nelson Stone, MD, Clinical Professor of Urology, Radiation Oncology, and Oncological Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and corresponding author of the study

Surgical training of residents has traditionally required the presence of a teaching proctor alongside the student physician in the operating room, which can result in inconsistent skills acquisition. Dr. Stone and his team, which included researchers from the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center in upstate New York, explored an alternative training system using AI programs they developed, including ESIST (educational system for instructionless surgical training). This model coupled deep learning methodology with a custom-designed extended-reality headset worn by the 17 participants to stream surgical instructions and video content before their eyes, while allowing their hands to remain free to practice the intricate procedure.

The operation simulated a partial nephrectomy procedure designed to remove a cancerous portion of a kidney, including placing a clamp on the renal artery. For this replication, researchers created a "phantom" kidney from 3D printed casts of an anonymized patient's computerized tomography (CT) scans. The casts were filled with water-based polymers and assembled to create a partial nephrectomy model with kidney tumors. While students practiced, the system's sophisticated first-person camera continuously monitored their training, providing real-time feedback and projecting corrective prompts as part of its skills assessment capability.

"Above all, our study proved that a complex procedure like a partial nephrectomy could be effectively taught to surgical trainees using a simulated model, without the presence of an instructor," noted Dr. Stone. "This finding addresses an urgent need resulting from the shortage of trainers and supervisors to educate physicians on new medical devices and techniques, and from the severe time constraints on attending physicians to train residents pursing surgical careers."

Another major advantage of advanced teaching technology, added Dr. Stone, is that it allows future surgeons to become proficient in procedures outside the operating room, thus helping to reduce the risk of surgical errors. "From the patient's point of view, we hope this study will provide reassurance that the technology can be leveraged to greatly improve surgical proficiency, while reducing surgical errors," said Dr. Stone.

The next step for Mount Sinai researchers is to use the AI algorithm technology they developed to build more complex synthetic cadaver models to train students in entire procedures, rather than just one component, as reported in the study. The team was encouraged by a survey it conducted after the training, which found that 100 percent of the participants believed the program had great educational value.

"Our investigation suggests that AI systems could indeed play an important complementary role in shaping the future of surgical education in this country," asserts Dr. Stone. "The public should be reassured that the pathway to autonomous learning we investigated in this small study could eventually lead to significant cost savings and improved patient outcomes and, importantly, to the cultivation of a highly skilled new generation of surgeons."

The study's authors, as listed in the journal, are Jonathan J. Stone, Nelson N. Stone, Steven H. Griffith, Kyle Zeller, and Michael P. Wilson.

All authors, except Kyle Zeller, hold equity in Viomerse.

The research was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (grant 1R41EB026358-01A1) and the National Science Foundation (grant 1913911).

Red blood cells, long thought to be passive bystanders in the formation of blood clots, actually play an active role in helping clots contract, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. 

"This discovery reshapes how we understand one of the body's most vital processes," says Rustem Litvinov, a senior researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and co-author of the study. "It also opens the door to new strategies for studying and potentially treating clotting disorders that cause either excessive bleeding or dangerous clots, like those seen in strokes."

The finding, published in Blood Advances, upends the long-standing idea that only platelets, the small cell fragments that initially plug wounds, drive clot contraction. Instead, the Penn team found that red blood cells themselves contribute to this crucial process of shrinking and stabilizing blood clots.

Red blood cells have been studied since the 17th century. The surprising fact is that we're still finding out new things about them in the 21st century."

Prashant Purohit, Co-Author, Professor in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics within Penn Engineering

Until now, researchers believed that only platelets were responsible for clot contraction. These tiny cell fragments pull on rope-like strands of the protein fibrin to tighten and stabilize clots.

"Red blood cells were thought to be passive bystanders," says co-author John Weisel, Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology within PSOM and an affiliate of the Bioengineering graduate group within Penn Engineering. "We thought they were just helping the clot to make a better seal."

That assumption began to unravel when Weisel and Litvinov ran a test they expected to fail. They created blood clots without platelets. "We expected nothing to happen," says Weisel. "Instead, the clots shrank by more than 20%."

To double-check their results, the team repeated the experiment using regular blood treated with chemicals to block platelet activity. The clots still contracted. "That's when we realized red blood cells must be doing more than just taking up space," says Litvinov.

To figure out how red blood cells were driving this unexpected behavior, the team turned to Purohit, a mechanical engineer by training. 

An expert on soft materials like blood clots and gels, Purohit developed a mathematical model that suggested that red blood cells compact together primarily due to "osmotic depletion."

This process also explains how particles in colloids - mixtures like paint, milk or muddy water - can gather and form clusters when the conditions around them change. 

"Essentially, the proteins in the surrounding fluid create an imbalance in pressure that pushes red blood cells together," says Purohit. "This attractive force causes them to pack more tightly, helping the clot contract even without platelets."

As blood begins to clot, a web-like protein called fibrin forms a mesh that traps red blood cells and pulls them close together. "That packing sets the stage for osmotic depletion forces to take over," says Purohit.

Once the red blood cells are packed tightly within the fibrin mesh, proteins in the surrounding fluid are squeezed out from the narrow spaces between the cells. This creates an imbalance: the concentration of proteins is higher outside the packed cells than between them, which results in a difference in "osmotic pressure."

That pressure difference acts like a squeeze from the outside, pushing the red blood cells even closer together. "This attraction causes the cells to aggregate and transfer mechanical forces to the fibrin network around them," adds Purohit. "The result is a stronger, more compact clot, even without the action of platelets."

Prior research suggested another possible explanation: bridging, in which the attraction between small molecules on the surface of red blood cells causes them to adhere. 

"Our model suggested the bridging effect was real," says Purohit, "but much smaller than the effect of osmotic depletion."

To test the model, first author Alina Peshkova, now a postdoctoral researcher in Pharmacology within PSOM, performed a series of experiments on modified blood clots. 

In the absence of the molecules that cause the bridging effect, the clots still contracted, but little contraction occurred in an environment designed to prevent osmotic depletion. 

"We experimentally confirmed what the model predicted," says Peshkova. "It's an example of theory and practice coming together to support each other."

Gaining a better understanding of the role red blood cells play in the formation and maturation of clots could lead to new treatments for conditions like thrombocytopenia, in which low platelet counts can cause uncontrolled bleeding. 

The findings could also shed light on how clots break into fragments that travel through the bloodstream and cause blockages - known as embolisms - that can trigger strokes. 

"Ultimately, our model is going to be helpful in understanding, preventing and treating diseases related to clotting inside the bloodstream," says Purohit.

In a preclinical study, Cedars-Sinai investigators found that boosting angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in key immune cells called microglia in the brain helped protect the brains of specially bred laboratory mice against Alzheimer's disease. Their findings, published in Nature Aging, could lead to cellular therapies to help treat the disease in humans.

We found that by using gene editing to boost ACE in immune cells called microglia, which we believe become exhausted in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we supercharged those cells and seemed to restore them to full function. This allowed the microglia to clear the brain of the amyloid plaques associated with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and to reverse neurodegeneration and cognitive decline."

Warren Tourtellotte, MD, PhD, professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai, and senior author of the study

To perform their experiments, investigators used genetic engineering to develop laboratory mice that accumulated amyloid plaques in their brains and overexpressed ACE in their microglia.

"The overexpression of ACE had a profound effect on the Alzheimer's-related brain changes in these mice," Tourtellotte said. "Their brains had fewer amyloid plaques and damage to neurons, and the connections between them appeared to be rescued. In addition, when ACE was expressed in microglia in these mice their performance in learning and memory tests was markedly improved."

The next step in this line of research is to show that this same biology exists in human microglia, Tourtellotte said. While more studies are needed, these findings might eventually lead to creation of a cell-based therapy that would work either independently or along with other Alzheimer's disease treatments.

"Scientific discovery is the key to developing treatments that will help us overcome Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 7 million people in the U.S. and those who love them," said Nancy L. Sicotte, MD, chair of the Department of Neurology at Cedars-Sinai. "These findings, from the first pilot project to receive funding from the Jona Goldrich Center for Alzheimer's and Memory Disorders at Cedars-Sinai, point to a promising new direction for future work and possible new treatments."

Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have found that better access to technology can go a long way toward achieving equity in healthcare for African Americans in the United States. According to Sharon Tettegah and Ebenezer Larnyo, both researchers at UCSB's Center for Black Studies Research (CBSR), leveraging health technology is a promising strategy for addressing longstanding healthcare disparities "by enhancing access to care, improving its quality and reducing inequities."

"Our study shows that improving access to technology like broadband internet and smartphones, and healthcare technology use like telehealth and health-related social media platforms, can significantly reduce healthcare disparities among African Americans," said Larnyo, the lead author of a paper published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health.

African Americans today continue to face an inordinate amount of difficulty in accessing healthcare, and tend to have worse healthcare outcomes than white counterparts. Tettegah recalled one particularly conspicuous case - that of tennis champion Venus Williams, who throughout her career was plagued with bouts of severe pelvic pain.

"She had uterine fibroids and had gone to several doctors and nobody was giving her the right response," said Tettegah, who directs CBSR and focuses her research at the intersection of social science and STEM. "They were dismissing her."

Indeed, despite the pain and the bleeding, in interviews Williams herself notes that while she knew she had fibroids (African American women are disproportionately affected by the noncancerous tumors), her doctors never connected the condition and her pain, telling her that her symptoms were a "normal" part of her menstrual cycle. Williams ultimately found a team that took her complaints seriously and because of this experience, now advocates for women's health.

Williams' experience of being glossed over by doctors is unfortunately too common for African Americans in the U.S. healthcare system, stemming from a history of systemic racism and historical patterns of exclusion, the researchers said. While she was able to eventually find the appropriate care, many others continue to struggle to be seen.

So the question becomes, 'How do we get the medical community of people who are not people of color to understand that we really do have different needs?' And a lot of times that has to come from the patient. But not every patient can advocate for themselves."

Sharon Tettegah, UCSB's Center for Black Studies Research

Socioeconomic status is another major factor. Healthcare in the US takes money, whether it's for health insurance, hospital and clinic visits, medicine and other supplies. Even the ongoing boom in healthcare technologies, such as internet-based telemedicine, wearables or precision medicine, which have great potential for leveling the healthcare playing field, are limited to who can afford them.

"Higher socioeconomic status individuals are more likely to have technology access, and when they do have access, they experience fewer healthcare disparities," Larnyo said. "So tackling both digital and structural barriers is key to achieving equity."

In their paper, the researchers explore the complex relationship between technology inequity and healthcare disparities among African Americans, and uncover statistical connections between socioeconomic status, technology access and health technology use.

"Evidence matters," Larnyo said. "Having hard numbers allows us to move beyond assumptions and demonstrate precisely how socioeconomic factors influence healthcare access in the digital age. It helps us understand the underlying mechanisms through which technology inequity reinforces and perpetuates healthcare disparities and allows us to be able to highlight the role of structural racism in shaping economic opportunities and digital inclusion, thus making a case for structural changes rather than individual solutions."

Analyzing data from a survey of 815 African Americans on their access to and use of health-related information and health-related behaviors, perceptions and knowledge, the research collaboration, which includes teams from Jiangsu University in China and Teesside University in the UK, elucidated this intricate dance of variables. They found a statistically significant relationship between socioeconomic status and technology access (the higher one's socioeconomic status, the more access to technology they have), and a positive association between technology access and health technology use (the more access to technology, the more likely to use health technology). 

Conversely, they found a negative association between tech access and healthcare disparities - the less access to health technology, the larger the healthcare disparities. The influence that socioeconomic status, technology access and health disparities have on each other indicates that "addressing both socioeconomic disparities and technology access is crucial in reducing healthcare disparities," according to the paper.

Some of the most powerful solutions are already within reach.

"To begin with, broadband internet is foundational; it needs to be affordable, accessible and reliable," Larnyo said. "That goes hand-in-hand with affordable smartphones."

In addition, to effectively take advantage of the technology, culturally tailored telehealth, simple-to-use mental health apps and health-related social media platforms are needed, the researchers said.

"We definitely need to do more work to raise awareness that people of color have different needs that have to be addressed and not just passed off," Tettegah said, pointing out that ethnic minorities have differing likelihoods for various diseases and conditions. "We need to build a narrative that highlights that with advocacy and information because often you don't know that you don't know."

American sports fans know the showmanship and excitement Super Bowl Sunday brings. Considered a de facto national holiday, the event sets up a flourish of fanfare and high stakes competition– weeks-long anticipation, sunrise tailgaters in front of the stadium, at-home gatherings around the television, music thumping, flags waving, fans cheering, fit athletes on the largest stage, must-watch halftime entertainment, bragging rights, trophies, confetti, celebrations that go well into the night, parades that take place in the heart of the winning city. Needless to say, if you like American football, the Super Bowl is the apex – and you never want to miss a moment.

Now, imagine that excitement, that anticipation, that joy, those festivities every single day in the span of just over a month.

CEO and Secretary General of U.S. Soccer JT Batson said that's what Americans can expect next summer when the FIFA World Cup arrives in the United States. The U.S. Soccer executive was a featured guest on the latest episode of Building Bridges, a video podcast hosted by Michael Hershman.

“The scale, the fans, the atmosphere is going to be incredible,” he said. “And it's not just about the games. It's also about the parties and the fan fest outside of the games. We're going to have a little bit longer than a month of essentially multiple Super Bowls every day, all across the United States, Canada and Mexico.”

While North American countries Mexico and Canada serve alongside the U.S. as co-hosts, about 75-85 percent of the matches will be played on American soil, including all matches in the latter stages: 

For Batson, an Atlanta native who grew up playing, coaching and refereeing soccer, the scale and opportunity of the moment is not lost on him. The World Cup, which occurs every four years, is already the premier tournament in the sport worldwide. With the field expanding to 48 teams for the first time in 2026, the global event will attract billions.

The United States is well-equipped to handle that enormous scale with stable infrastructure. Airports, hotels, roads and public transportation are in place in all 11 American host cities to accommodate millions that will be arriving to the country. And those numbers aren't underrated. The only other time the United States has hosted a World Cup was in 1994. In that edition, 24 nations competed. And to this day, it's the largest-attended tournament in World Cup history.





Another legacy of the 1994 World Cup is that it created a world-class professional soccer league here in the United States. Major League Soccer is thriving to this day, and the United States will once again have the chance to create more opportunities to grow the sport and make soccer more accessible to more Americans in 2026.

This commitment to access is a priority in U.S. Soccer's overall belief that soccer is more than a sport; it's a force for good. Batson says the key is making sure the federation invests in the sport at all levels. For example, U.S. Soccer has more disability national teams than any other country in the world.

“[We have] a very strong commitment to everyone who wants to play soccer in this country,” Batson said. “We'revery focused on making sure everyone in America can play soccer. We believe soccer is a force for good. It makes communities healthier, happier and more connected. The opportunity to bring soccer to more places and using big events to do things like that is something we're very passionate about.”

Enter Soccer Forward, the campaign at U.S. Soccer dedicated to making soccer available to everyone – no matter the place, age or skill level. Every time a fan buys a U.S. Soccer scarf or a ticket to a senior team match, part of the sale goes toward the campaign's mission of building healthier and more connected communities.

“Every American who is part of that, we say thank you. We're excited to do you proud,” Batson said.

While 2026 will be all about men's soccer, Batson is also looking ahead to the future of women's soccer. The U.S. Women's National Team is the top women's sports entity in the world and generates more income than any other women's team – and they'll have the chance to display why in 2027 and 2031 during the upcoming FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments.

Currently, the United States is the sole bid to host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. Similar to the men's tournament next summer, 2031 will be the first time the Women's World Cup welcomes a field of 48 teams. Essentially, between 2026 and potentially 2031, the United States would play host to the biggest tournament in men's and women's soccer in a short span of five years.

“Women's sports is a big business, and they're a great example of that,” Batson said.

The Building Bridges podcast focuses on connection and finding what unites us, which is a goal U.S. Soccer is aiming for, too, beyond the World Cup. On theme with his podcast, Hershman finished his conversation with Batson talking about his hope that, even in a divisive world filled with conflict and tension, the World Cup next summer will not be fraught with hate or politics. He is optimistic that the tournament will be peaceful, respectful and a celebration that shows the world soccer is for everybody.

Batson agreed whole-heartedly that what makes soccer special is the way it brings people together. In fact, he ended the podcast with a charge to his fellow U.S. Soccer fans, one they can keep in mind as they're buying tickets for next summer – go to a game that the U.S. isn't playing in. Experience a different culture, watch a different style of play. He says it will be something to remember forever.

“One of the great benefits of the World Cup being here in 2026 and in 2031 is that we're going to see so many incredible cultures from around the world come together to celebrate their culture and share that with us.”

Chelsea's performance at the Club World Cup seems to have really convinced their former striker Tony Cascarino.

Chelsea were able to win the tournament after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the final. They also got their hands on the Conference League trophy, so enjoying success in the cup competitions has not really been too much of a problem for the Blues in recent years.

The league is where they have struggled, with the club having not won the Premier League title since 2017.

Jamie Carragher has given his prediction for the new season, tipping Chelsea for another top-four battle. Cascarino, though, thinks they can do better than that.

For Cascarino, the problem Chelsea had last term was overplaying at the back. But after watching Robert Sanchez opt against doing that at the Club World Cup, the 62-year-old believes the ingredients are now there for his old side to mount a title challenge.

Speaking on talkSPORT, Cascarino said: “It was interesting when they won the Club World Cup because again we talked about this. The goalkeeper did not try and overplay, and that cost Chelsea quite a lot last year. 

“They weren't good enough to win the league last season. I think they can be challengers this year. I don't see Chelsea outside the top four, I really don't.”

At one stage, it looked like Sanchez would not be Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper in the new season.

Earlier in the summer, Chelsea had been chasing Mike Maignan. However, after failing to sign the AC Milan goalkeeper, Sanchez retained his spot in the team at the Club World Cup and played a huge role in them winning the competition.

The Spaniard was excellent in America, especially in the final. He kept a clean sheet that day and went on to win the Golden Glove award, which is handed to the best goalkeeper at the tournament.

Sanchez's goalkeeping as a whole was very questionable last term. In total, he made five errors leading to goal. No shot-stopper in the Premier League made more.

The 27-year-old also made four errors that resulted in a chance for the opposition, so there is clearly much room for improvement.

If Sanchez can reduce the above, though, then perhaps Chelsea can do better than fourth place this time around.

The Paris Saint-Germain winger and two of his treble-winning team-mates have been inexplicably left off the shortlist for the men's prize

The Ballon d'Or never fails to create controversy. Rather amusingly, Real Madrid even refused to turn up for last year's ceremony after being upset by the just decision to give the prize to Rodri over Vinicius Jr. 

The award is, by its very nature, contradictory, in that it champions individualism in a team sport, while the inherently subjective nature of the voting is always bound to provoke a backlash. Ballon d'Or recognition has become a very important marketing tool in the modern game, though, so whenever a player is the victim of a perceived snub, it generates a lot of headlines.

So, which stars will be reeling after being left off the list of nominees for this year's Ballon d'Or - and its plethora of other prizes? GOAL runs through the most notable oversights below...

Manchester United have won the race to sign highly-rated RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, reportedly reaching an 'agreement in principle' for a deal worth €85 million (£73.7m/$100m). The Slovenia international had been pursued by Newcastle United, but ultimately chose Old Trafford as his preferred destination, with medical tests now expected to follow soon.

The USMNT Transfer Notebook tracks American player movements, with latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool

The European summer transfer window has just under four weeks remaining, and the U.S. men's national team will report in roughly five weeks for a pair of international friendlies. Across the past few weeks, there have been several transfer developments for players with high hopes for the 2026 World Cup.

AC Milan have reportedly switched gears and are now planning on keeping Yunus Musah around for the 2025-26 season amid interest from Napoli after conversations with new manager Max Allegri. However, could Antonio Conte still snatch him up this window amid uncertainties over playing time?

Then, in Germany, midfielder Gio Reyna was included in Borussia Dortmund's latest preseason traveling roster, but has been held out of each match, and expectations are that he will still leave the club this window. Meanwhile, another U.S. international has officially joined the ranks of the Bundesliga, with defender Kristoffer Lund securing a loan deal to promotees FC Koln.

GOAL tracks all of the American player movements in the USMNT Transfer Notebook, a recurring feature covering the latest developments for those in the U.S. national team pool.

Raul Asensio is no longer in Xabi Alonso's plans for next season. Real Madrid have decided to put the Spanish centre-back up for sale, excluding him from the new coach's new project.

According to Defensa Central, Alonso does not see Asensio as part of his defense, where names like Rudiger, Militao and Huijsen are in the foreground.

Although Asencio gained minutes under Carlo Ancelotti, he has already fallen down the pecking order.

Last season gave him the opportunity to play, especially in Militao's absence. But with the Brazilian's return and new approaches in defense, the space for him has narrowed significantly.



Mistakes in the Club World Cup have had consequences. The naive penalty against Al Hilal, the sending off against Pachuca and the uncertainty against PSG have negatively affected the club's assessment of him.

Xabi Alonso, while known for his support of young players, demands security and consistency, and Asencio has not provided that at crucial moments. He is seen more as a temporary solution than a permanent part of the team.

The Madrid club is open to offers for the 21-year-old defender, seeing his departure as an opportunity to free up space and invest in more significant reinforcements.

Los Blancos would allow the defender to leave if an offer of around 35 million euros came in. /Telegraph/

Real Madrid are more than well-known for doing astute business in the transfer market. They include so many special clauses in their Castilla players' contracts that get them some amount of profit, adding up to a lot over time.

They are also very good at selling players just before their peak ends, as was seen with Raphael Varane and Casemiro in the past. Even Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't quite the same when he left the club in 2018, but I guess that was also because of different reasons.

The former part of this astute business could have got the club 20 million euros without selling a single player.

Real Madrid sold Nico Paz to Como last season, and included a 50% sell-on clause that would get them half the transfer fee for any club Paz is sold to from Como, if that ever happens.

Gianluca Di Marzio just reported that Spurs put a bid of 40 million euros on the table for Paz, but Como rejected the offer. They want 70 million euros.

Real Madrid, if Como had accepted it, would have received half the transfer fee, which comes down to 20 million euros. 

That is business that they could have made without even selling a single player. Obviously, they would lose out on their rights over Paz, but they would have made a fat profit on the player.

Selling him to Como was profitable in the first place, but this would have taken it to another level.

I don't know just how much need there is for Paz at Real Madrid anymore. He is an unbelievably talented player - no doubt about that - but they already have so many players fighting for the same minutes Paz will take up.

Arda Guler, Franco Mastantuono, Rodrygo, Brahim Diaz are players who are probably going to take that one spot in the starting lineup or off the bench. Add Paz to the situation and it becomes tough to see why the club would want him back in the first place.

Paz is too talented to sit on the bench, and if Real Madrid hadn't signed Mastantuono, then it would've made complete sense to bring him back. Now, not so much.

Hopefully, either there is a place for him in the future, or he forces a place in the squad with his performances. Worst case, Real Madrid will make a big profit as soon as Como are ready to sell - whenever that is.

Herculez Gomez reacts to Johnny Cardoso's move to Atletico Madrid after the USMNT midfielder completes the transfer for a reported fee of €30M (1:40)

Perhaps you've heard: The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and as such, the roster for the United States men's national team is taking shape. Mind you, there have been times when the outline of said roster has looked more like a funhouse mirror than a perfectly rendered image.

The recently concluded Gold Cup featured absences that reached into the double figures, which enabled several players to get on the field who otherwise wouldn't have. Some seized their opportunity and will get further looks, while others will have little to no shot at making the 26-player roster next summer.

But U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to cope with the hand he's been dealt, and -- knock on wood -- the American player pool is at least beginning to heal up, likely giving him more options going forward. With that in mind, here is latest look at a projected roster for 2026, with some room at the end for those on the outside looking in.

Turner's return to MLS from Europe looks like a retreat, but moving back to New England should give him something been lacking ever since he left the Revs in 2022: steady playing time. And if he does get regular minutes, one would presume that he'll be the starter next summer.

It's worth remembering that Turner has one item on his résumé that his competitors don't: World Cup experience. But Pochettino has made it clear that performances matter, and Turner will need to deliver at club level if he's to reclaim his starting spot with the USMNT.

Freese boosted his stock with some solid performances at the Gold Cup, which included outdueling Costa Rica legend Keylor Navas in a penalty shootout. There were mistakes, including a giveaway that led to a goal against Haiti, and that is something he'll need to clean up. Suffice to say, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open, and now that Turner is back in MLS, Freese's performances will be compared on a weekly basis.

Steffen looked poised to get some playing time at the Gold Cup, only for a knee injury to scuttle his opportunity. Staying healthy is the single biggest issue holding Steffen back. He had a muscle injury earlier this season, and another knee injury in 2023 hastened his return to MLS from Europe. The good news is that when Steffen has seen field this season, he has played well. He ranks third in the league with 5.99 goals prevented in just 14 matches and also impressed with the Americans in January, meaning Pochettino has already seen up close what Steffen is capable of.

Richards was the United States' best player at the Gold Cup, going from "possible starter" before the tournament to "first name on the team sheet" after. He's as close to a lock as you can get for the World Cup roster.

Ream was solid at the Gold Cup, with his leadership and experience doing plenty to lead the U.S. into the final, but for how long can Pochettino rely on the 37-year-old? It's one thing to deliver at the Gold Cup; the competition at the World Cup will be several notches higher. This is no fault of Ream's, of course. It's up to another player to push him out of the lineup, and so far, that hasn't happened.

The New York City native had a successful first season in Ligue 1 with Toulouse, but he has yet to translate that into consistency with the Americans. McKenzie looked to have earned Pochettino's trust following the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal round against Jamaica, but subsequent performances against Canada, Turkey and Switzerland saw him fall out of favor.

Given the pedigree of his league, McKenzie is among the prime candidates to supplant Ream, but he'll need to raise his game in order to make that happen.

Few defenders in the United States pool provide as imposing of a physical presence as Carter-Vickers, but he needs a refined passer beside him. The Celtic center back showed well in limited minutes at the World Cup when he partnered with Ream in the 1-0 win over Iran. Since then, there have been shaky outings in the Copa America and Nations League. He's a player Pochettino knows well given their brief overlap at Tottenham Hotspur. Can CCV make more of an impression in the time that's left?

Robinson was a hard-luck omission in 2022, when a torn Achilles prevented from making the U.S. squad that went to Qatar. He hasn't quite gotten back to that pre-injury level and had just a few cameos at the Gold Cup, but he has been solid for FCC, and his ability to cover space behind the defense remains a strong suit.

The most welcome sight of the week was Dest scoring the winner for PSV in the Dutch Super Cup against Go Ahead Eagles. The U.S. has missed the right back immensely since he last played for the U.S., in March 2024, given his ability to create the unexpected going forward.

Robinson is another mainstay who appears to be on his way back after having knee surgery earlier this summer. His delivery from wide positions is a weapon Pochettino will be keen to exploit when Robinson returns to the U.S. team.

Scally was one of the players conspicuous by his absence at the Gold Cup, but his experience -- he has made more than 120 Bundesliga appearances -- is difficult to overlook. That said, his lack of impact going forward means he could find himself under pressure from any one of the young crew of full backs who have suited up for the Americans in the past year.

Wiley wasn't included in the Gold Cup, but his numbers last year on loan with Watford showed marked improvement on the defensive side of the ball with both his duel and aerial percentage over 60%. While Wiley was impactful in the attacking third during his days with Atlanta United, that hasn't been in the case with Watford, albeit in a small sample size of 10 games. His second season with the Hornets will give him an opportunity to show off more of his ability in that area.

Adams looked a bit off his game at the Gold Cup, particularly in the final, although it's unclear how much the foot injury that kept him on the bench early in the tournament was bothering him. That said, Adams remains one of the key U.S. players and if healthy -- no guarantee given his injury history -- he'll be on the roster next summer.

The Juventus man looked well short of his best at the Nations League in March, and with the Club World Cup occupying him for the summer, he didn't get a chance to take part at the Gold Cup. When he's at top form, though, McKennie is a two-way force who is also a threat on set pieces. One would expect him to be on the roster next summer, but Pochettino has let it be known that reputations will count for little, and McKennie will need to prove once again that he deserves to be in the starting XI.

Cardoso remains an enigma. At club level, he's proved to be a player that can knit the game together from a deep-lying position, so much so that Atlético manager Diego Simeone made it a priority to bring Cardoso to his side this summer. But with the U.S., the midfielder continues to confound. Injury prevented Cardoso from having any kind of impact at the Gold Cup and he remains a solid squad pick for now, but at some point, he'll need to start producing for the U.S.

De la Torre made the most of his chance at the Gold Cup, although he looked to have worn down physically by the end of the tournament. The San Diego midfielder's ability to keep possession on a team that at times struggles in that regard is a valuable trait to have. His spot seems a bit vulnerable, however, and he'll need to keep excelling at club level.

Tessmann was another head-scratching omission earlier this summer, given that he seemed to have won Pochettino over during the early days of his tenure. After getting acclimated to Ligue 1 last season, Tessmann's size and skill give him the tools to excel. This season he'll need to take the next step forward in his career, the better to convince Pochettino that he deserves to be with the full team.

The only question surrounding Pulisic is the extent to which his relationship with Pochettino needs to be mended after he publicly backed the U.S. manager into a corner over his offer to play in two friendlies last summer. The reality is there's too much at stake for a rapprochement not to happen.

Weah provides the USMNT with pace, a trait lacking in much of the rest of the roster. A change in clubs ahead of a World Cup is always a risky proposition, but assuming Weah has a chance to take on a bigger role with a club that usually finds itself near the top of the Ligue 1 table, the move represents an opportunity to grow his game.

Tillman was another player who benefited from an extended run at the Gold Cup, even as he became a target for physical play by opponents. Now he's taking a big step up at club level, moving to German powerhouse Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven. Tillman still has a tendency to hang his head during times of struggle, but his attacking talent is undeniable. That said, there are still a few players to move past in order to make the starting XI when the full team is together.

Luna has become a Pochettino favorite given his creativity, toughness and ability to play out of tight spaces. He popped up for some vital goals too, including two in the Gold Cup semifinal triumph over Guatemala. He isn't resting on his laurels, having already matched the eight goals he scored last season with Real Salt Lake. A difficult Gold Cup final against Mexico showed there's still room for growth.

An injury-riddled campaign that included shoulder surgery meant that Balogun hasn't suited up for the USMNT at all in 2025, but with no other U.S. forward stepping up to claim the starting spot, Balogun is still -- marginally -- the front-runner. The U.S. will need to do a better job of exploiting Balogun's ability to get in behind defenses.

Pepi is another U.S. forward who was felled by injury during the last club season, with knee surgery ending his season prematurely. With longtime club foil Luuk de Jong know having left PSV for FC Porto, there should be more of an opportunity for Pepi to get playing time with the Dutch giants. That could be enough for a player who just missed out on the 2022 World Cup to become mainstay with the USMNT.

Ricardo Pepi looks back on his five-month injury absence as he prepares to return to PSV in time for the new season.

It's a familiar tale with these forwards: Sargent's club form also hasn't yet translated to international level. His last goal for the U.S. was in 2019, and he has made 16 appearances without netting since the start of 2020. After turning down a move to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, Sargent looks set to spend another season in the English Championship, where he's had success in the past, but is Pochettino willing to give Sargent another chance?

Agyemang showed flashes of ability in the Gold Cup, but there are also parts of his game -- primarily his touch -- that look raw. Now he's headed over to England where his game will be held to an even higher standard. Pochettino likes Agyemang's size, and the U.S. will need a physically imposing striker on the roster.

Wright is another player set to spend time in the English Championship, and he'll be looking to improve on the 12 goals he scored last season. His versatility in being able to play on the wing could be what cements his place on the '26 roster.

An untimely injury forced Schulte off the Gold Cup roster, otherwise it might have been him getting time in the tournament instead of Freese. With other keepers such as Steffen getting back into form, the window of opportunity looks to be closing for Schulte.

Trusty is one of those players where you wonder why he hasn't been given more of a chance with the U.S., given that he has both Premier League and UEFA Champions League experience. To be clear, not all of those experiences were positive, and includes a relegation with Sheffield United, but Trusty was a steady contributor during Celtic's double-winning campaign in 2024-25, and at age 26, he's entering his prime years. He'll need to dazzle in the Champions League if he's to really catch Pochettino's eye.

Arfsten was something of a project for Pochettino at the Gold Cup, being asked to play left back when he had been a wingback with Columbus with a remit to get forward. As such, Arfsten struggled defensively early in the tournament, but got better with each game. He even tallied his first U.S. goal against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. If he can continue his defensive improvement, he may yet get on the final roster.

At age 20, Freeman has a high upside, and held up well at the Gold Cup. He faces a bit of a logjam at right back behind Dest and Scally, but his steady defensive play as well as his ability to get forward could see him make a late challenge for the final roster. If not, he figures to get chances later in his career.

How the mighty have fallen. Once part of the vaunted "MMA" midfield with McKennie and Adams, Musah has seen his stock fall for both club and country. Last season Musah fell out of favor at Milan, and his appearances under Pochettino saw him deployed as a wingback rather than his usual spot in the center of midfield. Musah asked out of the Gold Cup for personal reasons. A settled club situation will aid Musah's way back, with Napoli and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested, but new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has experimented with Musah in multiple positions. His time at San Siro might not be over yet.

Zendejas' omission is puzzling given his form for América, for whom he scored seven goals in 19 league and playoff appearances during last spring's Clausura. At this stage, Zendejas looks very much on the outside of the roster, although an injury or two in the right part of the field could change his circumstances.

Reyna's descent from supernova prospect to nearly forgotten man is well documented. It's wild to think that just 17 months ago he was the MVP of the Concacaf Nations League. But for Reyna, his path to a 2026 World Cup roster spot is all about his club situation. If he can get out of Dortmund and land in a spot where he can get playing time, then there's hope. Otherwise, next summer's World Cup will pass him by.

Berhalter had his ups and downs at the Gold Cup, but showed improvement over the course of the tournament, and was especially effective on set pieces. That said, he's another performer who has a lot of players to climb over if he's going to get into the full roster. It seems a step too far at the moment, but given the progress he's made in the past year, he can't be written off completely.

Downs is another forward who offers up impressive size and strength. Those traits will be put to good use in the English Championship with Southampton. Downs would seem to be in direct competition with Agyemang, and with the latter player now with Derby (not to mention Sargent at Norwich) there will be direct comparisons in terms of their performances.

Herculez Gomez reacts to Johnny Cardoso's move to Atletico Madrid after the USMNT midfielder completes the transfer for a reported fee of €30M (1:40)

Perhaps you've heard: The 2026 FIFA World Cup is less than a year away, and as such, the roster for the United States men's national team is taking shape. Mind you, there have been times when the outline of said roster has looked more like a funhouse mirror than a perfectly rendered image.

The recently concluded Gold Cup featured absences that reached into the double figures, which enabled several players to get on the field who otherwise wouldn't have. Some seized their opportunity and will get further looks, while others will have little to no shot at making the 26-player roster next summer.

But U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino has had to cope with the hand he's been dealt, and -- knock on wood -- the American player pool is at least beginning to heal up, likely giving him more options going forward.

Freese boosted his stock with some solid performances at the Gold Cup, which included outdueling Costa Rica legend Keylor Navas in a penalty shootout. There were mistakes, including a giveaway that led to a goal against Haiti, and that is something he'll need to clean up. Suffice to say, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open, and now that Turner is back in MLS, Freese's performances will be compared on a weekly basis.

Steffen looked poised to get some playing time at the Gold Cup, only for a knee injury to scuttle his opportunity. Staying healthy is the single biggest issue holding Steffen back.

Richards was the United States' best player at the Gold Cup, going from "possible starter" before the tournament to "first name on the team sheet" after. He's as close to a lock as you can get for the World Cup roster.

Ream was solid at the Gold Cup, with his leadership and experience doing plenty to lead the U.S. into the final, but for how long can Pochettino rely on the 37-year-old? It's one thing to deliver at the Gold Cup; the competition at the World Cup will be several notches higher. This is no fault of Ream's, of course. It's up to another player to push him out of the lineup, and so far, that hasn't happened.

The New York City native had a successful first season in Ligue 1 with Toulouse, but he has yet to translate that into consistency with the Americans. McKenzie looked to have earned Pochettino's trust following the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal round against Jamaica, but subsequent performances against Canada, Turkey and Switzerland saw him fall out of favor.

Given the pedigree of his league, McKenzie is among the prime candidates to supplant Ream, but he'll need to raise his game in order to make that happen.

Few defenders in the United States pool provide as imposing of a physical presence as Carter-Vickers, but he needs a refined passer beside him. The Celtic center back showed well in limited minutes at the World Cup when he partnered with Ream in the 1-0 win over Iran. Since then, there have been shaky outings in the Copa America and Nations League. He's a player Pochettino knows well given their brief overlap at Tottenham Hotspur. Can CCV make more of an impression in the time that's left?

Robinson was a hard-luck omission in 2022, when a torn Achilles prevented from making the U.S. squad that went to Qatar. He hasn't quite gotten back to that pre-injury level and had just a few cameos at the Gold Cup, but he has been solid for FCC, and his ability to cover space behind the defense remains a strong suit.

The most welcome sight of the week was Dest scoring the winner for PSV in the Dutch Super Cup against Go Ahead Eagles. The U.S. has missed the right back immensely since he last played for the U.S., in March 2024, given his ability to create the unexpected going forward.

Robinson is another mainstay who appears to be on his way back after having knee surgery earlier this summer. His delivery from wide positions is a weapon Pochettino will be keen to exploit when Robinson returns to the U.S. team.

Scally was one of the players conspicuous by his absence at the Gold Cup, but his experience -- he has made more than 120 Bundesliga appearances -- is difficult to overlook. That said, his lack of impact going forward means he could find himself under pressure from any one of the young crew of full backs who have suited up for the Americans in the past year.

Wiley wasn't included in the Gold Cup, but his numbers last year on loan with Watford showed marked improvement on the defensive side of the ball with both his duel and aerial percentage over 60%. While Wiley was impactful in the attacking third during his days with Atlanta United, that hasn't been in the case with Watford, albeit in a small sample size of 10 games. His second season with the Hornets will give him an opportunity to show off more of his ability in that area.

Adams looked a bit off his game at the Gold Cup, particularly in the final, although it's unclear how much the foot injury that kept him on the bench early in the tournament was bothering him. That said, Adams remains one of the key U.S. players and if healthy -- no guarantee given his injury history -- he'll be on the roster next summer.

The Juventus man looked well short of his best at the Nations League in March, and with the Club World Cup occupying him for the summer, he didn't get a chance to take part at the Gold Cup. When he's at top form, though, McKennie is a two-way force who is also a threat on set pieces. One would expect him to be on the roster next summer, but Pochettino has let it be known that reputations will count for little, and McKennie will need to prove once again that he deserves to be in the starting XI.

Cardoso remains an enigma. At club level, he's proved to be a player that can knit the game together from a deep-lying position, so much so that Atlético manager Diego Simeone made it a priority to bring Cardoso to his side this summer. But with the U.S., the midfielder continues to confound. Injury prevented Cardoso from having any kind of impact at the Gold Cup and he remains a solid squad pick for now, but at some point, he'll need to start producing for the U.S.

De la Torre made the most of his chance at the Gold Cup, although he looked to have worn down physically by the end of the tournament. The San Diego midfielder's ability to keep possession on a team that at times struggles in that regard is a valuable trait to have. His spot seems a bit vulnerable, however, and he'll need to keep excelling at club level.

Tessmann was another head-scratching omission earlier this summer, given that he seemed to have won Pochettino over during the early days of his tenure. After getting acclimated to Ligue 1 last season, Tessmann's size and skill give him the tools to excel. This season he'll need to take the next step forward in his career, the better to convince Pochettino that he deserves to be with the full team.

The only question surrounding Pulisic is the extent to which his relationship with Pochettino needs to be mended after he publicly backed the U.S. manager into a corner over his offer to play in two friendlies last summer. The reality is there's too much at stake for a rapprochement not to happen.

Weah provides the USMNT with pace, a trait lacking in much of the rest of the roster. A change in clubs ahead of a World Cup is always a risky proposition, but assuming Weah has a chance to take on a bigger role with a club that usually finds itself near the top of the Ligue 1 table, the move represents an opportunity to grow his game.

Tillman was another player who benefited from an extended run at the Gold Cup, even as he became a target for physical play by opponents. Now he's taking a big step up at club level, moving to German powerhouse Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven. Tillman still has a tendency to hang his head during times of struggle, but his attacking talent is undeniable. That said, there are still a few players to move past in order to make the starting XI when the full team is together.

Luna has become a Pochettino favorite given his creativity, toughness and ability to play out of tight spaces. He popped up for some vital goals too, including two in the Gold Cup semifinal triumph over Guatemala. He isn't resting on his laurels, having already matched the eight goals he scored last season with Real Salt Lake. A difficult Gold Cup final against Mexico showed there's still room for growth.

An injury-riddled campaign that included shoulder surgery meant that Balogun hasn't suited up for the USMNT at all in 2025, but with no other U.S. forward stepping up to claim the starting spot, Balogun is still -- marginally -- the front-runner. The U.S. will need to do a better job of exploiting Balogun's ability to get in behind defenses.

Pepi is another U.S. forward who was felled by injury during the last club season, with knee surgery ending his season prematurely. With longtime club foil Luuk de Jong know having left PSV for FC Porto, there should be more of an opportunity for Pepi to get playing time with the Dutch giants. That could be enough for a player who just missed out on the 2022 World Cup to become mainstay with the USMNT.

Ricardo Pepi looks back on his five-month injury absence as he prepares to return to PSV in time for the new season.

It's a familiar tale with these forwards: Sargent's club form also hasn't yet translated to international level. His last goal for the U.S. was in 2019, and he has made 16 appearances without netting since the start of 2020. After turning down a move to Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, Sargent looks set to spend another season in the English Championship, where he's had success in the past, but is Pochettino willing to give Sargent another chance?

Agyemang showed flashes of ability in the Gold Cup, but there are also parts of his game -- primarily his touch -- that look raw. Now he's headed over to England where his game will be held to an even higher standard. Pochettino likes Agyemang's size, and the U.S. will need a physically imposing striker on the roster.

Wright is another player set to spend time in the English Championship, and he'll be looking to improve on the 12 goals he scored last season. His versatility in being able to play on the wing could be what cements his place on the '26 roster.

An untimely injury forced Schulte off the Gold Cup roster, otherwise it might have been him getting time in the tournament instead of Freese. With other keepers such as Steffen getting back into form, the window of opportunity looks to be closing for Schulte.

Trusty is one of those players where you wonder why he hasn't been given more of a chance with the U.S., given that he has both Premier League and UEFA Champions League experience. To be clear, not all of those experiences were positive, and includes a relegation with Sheffield United, but Trusty was a steady contributor during Celtic's double-winning campaign in 2024-25, and at age 26, he's entering his prime years. He'll need to dazzle in the Champions League if he's to really catch Pochettino's eye.

Arfsten was something of a project for Pochettino at the Gold Cup, being asked to play left back when he had been a wingback with Columbus with a remit to get forward. As such, Arfsten struggled defensively early in the tournament, but got better with each game. He even tallied his first U.S. goal against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. If he can continue his defensive improvement, he may yet get on the final roster.

At age 20, Freeman has a high upside, and held up well at the Gold Cup. He faces a bit of a logjam at right back behind Dest and Scally, but his steady defensive play as well as his ability to get forward could see him make a late challenge for the final roster. If not, he figures to get chances later in his career.

How the mighty have fallen. Once part of the vaunted "MMA" midfield with McKennie and Adams, Musah has seen his stock fall for both club and country. Last season Musah fell out of favor at Milan, and his appearances under Pochettino saw him deployed as a wingback rather than his usual spot in the center of midfield. Musah asked out of the Gold Cup for personal reasons. A settled club situation will aid Musah's way back, with Napoli and Nottingham Forest reportedly interested, but new Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has experimented with Musah in multiple positions. His time at San Siro might not be over yet.

Zendejas' omission is puzzling given his form for América, for whom he scored seven goals in 19 league and playoff appearances during last spring's Clausura. At this stage, Zendejas looks very much on the outside of the roster, although an injury or two in the right part of the field could change his circumstances.

Reyna's descent from supernova prospect to nearly forgotten man is well documented. It's wild to think that just 17 months ago he was the MVP of the Concacaf Nations League. But for Reyna, his path to a 2026 World Cup roster spot is all about his club situation. If he can get out of Dortmund and land in a spot where he can get playing time, then there's hope. Otherwise, next summer's World Cup will pass him by.

Berhalter had his ups and downs at the Gold Cup, but showed improvement over the course of the tournament, and was especially effective on set pieces. That said, he's another performer who has a lot of players to climb over if he's going to get into the full roster. It seems a step too far at the moment, but given the progress he's made in the past year, he can't be written off completely.

Downs is another forward who offers up impressive size and strength. Those traits will be put to good use in the English Championship with Southampton. Downs would seem to be in direct competition with Agyemang, and with the latter player now with Derby (not to mention Sargent at Norwich) there will be direct comparisons in terms of their performances.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The now-iconic shuttlecocks that adorn the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art's lawn weren't always beloved, but they will be looking their best for a global audience next summer.

“In 1994, they may have caused a little bit of consternation — people raised some eyebrows, ‘Was this art?'" said Stephanie Fox Knappe, the museum's Sanders Sosland senior curator. 

Few cityscapes are more distinctly associated with Kansas City today than Coosje van Bruggen and Claes Oldenburg's shuttlecocks, which were commissioned by the Sosland Foundation.

“The importance of the shuttlecocks to the Nelson-Atkins and Kansas City can't be underestimated,” Fox Knappe said. “They (van Bruggen and Oldenburg) had free rein. They could make anything they wanted for the lawn of the Nelson-Atkins. So they looked at this museum, this formidable neoclassical facade and the great 22-acre lawn, and thought, ‘Wow, this would be an amazing place to create the effect of a badminton match that was interrupted with the birdies left all over the lawn.'”

Oldenburg and van Bruggen's instructions for the installation included a note that the shuttlecocks should be restored regularly to keep them looking fresh from the box, according to Fox Knappe.

It takes a herculean effort to keep the oversized shuttlecocks — each stands more than 19 feet tall with a diameter of nearly 16 feet — pristine.

The one closest to Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard on the museum's south lawn was removed in October 2024, repainted and reinstalled last winter.

“The process to de-install the shuttlecocks is pretty incredible,” Fox Knappe said. “It takes major heavy equipment; it takes cranes. Every 500-pound feather needs to be taken off, then they roll off the lawn to an industrial painting company here in the Kansas City area. They'll be cleaned and painted, then the process happens in reverse to reinstall them at the end.”

Next month, it'll be the shuttlecock on the north lawn's turn to be removed and whisked away by Belger Cartage Service for restoration, with plans to get the other two on the south lawn refurbished before the FIFA World Cup 2026, which will stage six games in Kansas City next summer.

The region's climate — rainy springs, scorching summers, wind-swept falls and icy winters — takes a toll on outdoor artwork, so chipping, cracked and weathered paint is to be expected.

“I believe this is the second time that the shuttlecocks will be de-installed from the lawn of the museum and taken away to be painted and then reinstalled,” Fox Knappe said. “The process takes about two months, and we're really grateful to the Richard J. Stern Foundation (for the Arts) and the Sosland family for helping to fund this restoration.”

It's quite a departure from their controversial beginnings.

“Now, they've become a symbol, not only of the Nelson-Atkins treasures, but also Kansas City," Fox Knappe said.

Visitors like Alexis Colosky, who stopped in Kansas City on a road trip from Colorado to Ohio, flock to the museum's lawn daily for photo ops with the nearly 20-foot-tall shuttlecocks.

“We're on a special vacation, seeing a bunch of cool things,” Colosky said. “This was on one of the stops to see a few of the state's largest stuff. ... This is one of the Kansas City stops that I'm going to remember.”

Tosh and Colson Demsey also visited the museum Wednesday to see the shuttlecocks. The father and son are making their way from Fresno, California, to mid-Missouri for a youth writing retreat.

“It looks pretty cool,” Tosh said. “I'd never heard about it before, but we played badminton quite a bit during COVID in our backyard, so I thought it would be fun to see.”

Tosh, a high school math teacher, took pictures of Colson next to the fully restored shuttlecock and laughed at the idea of sending them home to students who play on his school's badminton team.

“The photo on Google made it look big,” he said. “But when you see it in person, it's a lot bigger than it looked in the photo.”

Colosky agreed: “It definitely feels a little crazy being right next to it and realizing, holy crap, this thing is a really tall thing. It's actually pretty amazing.”

For better or worse, the shuttlecocks have become woven into Kansas City's DNA, one of the stock images nonresidents have of the city.

“I think now we'd be more surprised if a major event happening in Kansas City didn't feature the shuttlecocks here at the Nelson-Atkins,” Fox Knappe said. “They really have become a beloved icon.”

Next year, they'll look fresh for the World Cup's worldwide audience.

“Certainly, with the World Cup on the horizon here in Kansas City — so proud to be a host site — we definitely want everything at the museum to be looking great,” Fox Knappe said.

This is the second time the shuttlecocks are being fully restored since their installation 31 years ago.

The Kansas City Police Department is creating a “strong security posture” for the FIFA World Cup 26, deploying thousands of law enforcement officers as it prepares for 650,000 international visitors descending during a hot Midwestern summer and imbibing through 23-hour-a-day alcohol sales.

Working for the past year and a half, KCPD is building “scalable plans,” for use on crowd sizes at different games, the cultural considerations brought by international fans, and hosting ticket-holders who will be made up mostly of men ages 18-39, the largest group of FIFA's fan base.

KCPD officers will be barred from taking vacation time, reserves will be on duty, police and sheriffs' deputies from Missouri and Kansas are being called up, and the National Guard will be activated for the event, from June 11 to July 19. 

Mounted patrols will be brought in from other police agencies, the Missouri State Highway Patrol will provide helicopters, and a new program using drones as first responders will be implemented, KCPD Major Abigail Martinez said.

During a public meeting at the North Kansas City Patrol headquarters Tuesday night, Martinez said the department sees the World Cup tournament as an “unprecedented challenge” on a scale of hosting the Olympic games, and drawing probably the largest crowds the city has ever seen.

The department is building a “strong security posture” for the monthlong event, KCPD Capt. Shawn Campbell said.



“We're doing a lot of work to make this as safe as possible,” Martinez said. “It is heavy on our hearts to make this as safe as possible.”

Yet police are also promising to keep the usual presence in the city during the games. Martinez said they want to keep the same patrols in place for all the events they normally cover, like Royals baseball games, KC Current soccer games or downtown concerts.

“We want to continue to police our city,” Martinez said. “We are not going to be strapped for resources for what our city needs.”

Martinez has traveled to Europe to visit other cities where FIFA games have been played to get advice, among other law enforcement conferences. And the department has consulted with officials in Atlanta, where the city hosts summer events, as they are considered experts in handling heat emergencies.

Throwing another wrinkle into plans is Gov. Mike Kehoe's signing into law a temporary extension of liquor sales, so bars and restaurants can serve alcohol from 6 a.m. to 5 a.m. during the month the city hosts the tournament. Open containers will be allowed at the FIFA Fan Festival at the National WW1 Museum grounds, and in the entertainment districts where it is already OK, like at Power & Light and Westport, Martinez said.

Still to be determined is how to grapple with the issue of young fans from Europe who are allowed to drink in public venues at home, some as early as 16 or 18 years old.

“We are used to 21 and over, others (countries) are not,” said Major Michelle Hon, commander of the North Patrol Division. “That's all stuff we have to navigate.”

Those attending games at Arrowhead Stadium and the fan fest will have to go through security, much like the one implemented at the NFL Draft held here in 2023. That's a change from some of the city's larger outdoors events, like the 2024 Super Bowl parade and rally, where one woman was killed and 23 injured, and the city has been sued for what the lawsuit alleges was a lack of proper precautions.

Although police have staffed events at Arrowhead for years, they are changing their plans for the games there, as soccer has a different culture, with fans bringing flags, drums and other things into the stadium, Martinez said. Rivalries between teams are legendary in soccer, and brawls have broken out at some World Cup games in the past, including in 2023 in Rio de Janeiro.

“It's going to be a whole different look,” Martinez said of security at Arrowhead.

Shuttles will be running to Arrowhead and to practices at Children's Mercy Park and CPKC Stadium, home of the KC Current, among other venues, Martinez said. The city has leased 200 coach buses to be able to ferry fans to stadiums, the fan fest, and other entertainment and shopping areas, like Zona Rosa in north Kansas City, she said.

Other concerns for the department include the city's troubled 911 system, which has often been under-staffed and had long wait times, and the lack of a new jail, a long-term issue the city and Jackson County have failed to settle. In May, city council began the process of building a temporary facility, which would be completed before the World Cup.

Plans are also being made to possibly create a temporary designated camping site for those fans who come to town without booking hotels or making other arrangements, Campbell said.

La Liga

Real Madrid started their pre-season training this week, almost a month after their La Liga rivals Barcelona.

Because Xabi Alonso's side competed at the Club World Cup, their 2024-25 season ended up being extended until July 9, when they lost 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. Barca started back in training on July 13.

On Monday, Madrid's players returned for work at the club's Valdebebas training ground. So, what's the plan for this atypical season start, and will having played at the Club World Cup be a help or a hindrance?

Here, The Athletic explains what's next for Alonso's new side before they start their La Liga campaign on August 19 at home to Osasuna.

Resting, or at least getting as much rest as is typical of a professional athlete during their summer holidays.

After exiting the Club World Cup, Madrid's players were given time off. They all took advantage of this break to have a holiday. Some stayed in Spain, such as Dean Huijsen, who enjoyed time with his family in Marbella, and fellow new arrival Alvaro Carreras, who did the same in Ferrol.

Both also had time to visit Ibiza, as have other team-mates such as Thibaut Courtois, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior. Others opted for more exotic destinations, such as Dani Ceballos, who visited Soneva, an island resort in the Maldives. Meanwhile, as has become almost tradition, others such as Eder Militao, Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr and Eduardo Camavinga have been in Brazil, with Vinicius Jr as their main host.

As for new manager Xabi Alonso, he spent time back in Guipuzkoa, the Basque province of northern Spain where he grew up. But the 43-year-old remained in regular contact with his staff to plan and evaluate the team's return to work and what comes next.

During the holidays, each player was sent a specific training plan designed by the club's specialists, as is usual. In many cases, this plan was designed to complement the work of their personal trainers, who were also in contact with Madrid. Endrick even took his physical trainer (Vinicius Nevado) with him on his honeymoon to Japan.

Madrid actually wanted to postpone their first La Liga match of the new season against Osasuna, arguing that they needed more rest after progressing into the Club World Cup's latter stages.

Madrid's request was supported by the Spanish players' union (and Osasuna themselves), but opposed by La Liga. Ultimately, the Spanish FA had the final say and the request was rejected by their sole competition judge.

The decision did not go down well at Madrid, with the club's official TV channel launching an angry response this week.

The Osasuna game will take place a little later than might have been previously expected, however. The match is scheduled for Tuesday, August 19, rather than on the weekend.

Despite their request to push back their opening game, Madrid always intended to return to training on August 4.

On Monday, Madrid's players underwent medical tests in the morning and began group training in the afternoon. Since then, individual and group exercise in the gym has been combined with ball work on the training fields, mixing focus on possession, finishing, dribbling and small-sided matches.

One of the main differences in Madrid's physical preparation between now and last season is a greater focus on field work, rather than the specific individual strength work Antonio Pintus favoured when he was in charge of fitness training. The Italian is still employed by the club but is now much less influential.

Several changes have been made to the medical staff, too, after a spate of injuries last season.

Two of Madrid's new permanent physical trainers employed this summer, Javier Arnaiz and Ismael Fernandez, also favour new techniques such as coordinating muscle training based on the body's temperature. New analysis of performance data is being used to better analyse the risk of future injuries.

Madrid now plan to continue training at Valdebebas until they travel to Innsbruck, Austria, for a friendly match against top-flight side WSG Tirol next Tuesday (at 7pm local time). According to staff sources — who, like all those cited here, asked to speak anonymously as they did not have permission to comment — arranging the match was not suggested by the coaching team. Madrid do not plan to stay in Austria for a training camp.

It would not have been surprising — and, in fact, a club source mentioned it as a possibility for this summer — for Madrid to face local teams such as Getafe or Leganes behind closed doors in other games that might have been held at Valdebebas instead, as has happened in recent years. However, the Tirol game is expected to be their only preparation match before their first fixture of the new season.

Madrid have mixed feelings about the Club World Cup.

One source from the coaching staff points out that conditions in the United States did not help preparation for various reasons — including the number of minutes accumulated, weather conditions described as “adverse” due to humidity and heat, poor pitches, time differences and the staging of the tournament at the end of a full season.

But another source involved in the day-to-day at Valdebebas described the Club World Cup as “very useful” because it served to achieve the main objective, which was “to change the team's dynamic” from last season. Alonso and his collaborators wanted to implement a method in which the players showed more intensity in training. Videos were more present and more individualised, and other aspects such as punctuality were taken care of.

“We're happy, but now we have to start again,” the source added.

Another topic of comment between Alonso and his staff is the need for signings, an idea that came up before the tournament in the United States and still remains. A source close to the coach suggested that two more signings would be necessary. They pointed to how domestic rivals Atletico Madrid and European challengers Liverpool have strengthened this summer.

However, club sources believe Alonso has a good squad and point out that there are 24 players already registered, with the 25th (La Liga's maximum) probably going to academy product Gonzalo Garcia.

In other words, if no one leaves, and nobody has shown signs of wanting to, they cannot bring new faces in.

                                        Morocco, which will host the 2030 football World Cup, has denied accusations by animal welfare groups that it is systematically culling stray dogs ahead of the event. Authorities maintain that they have been neutering and vaccinating stray dogs before releasing them back onto the street.

Animal welfare groups have accused Morocco of culling stray dogs as it prepares to host football's 2030 World Cup, but the kingdom denies the accusations, vowing to protect the canines.

Advocates have charged that Morocco was indiscriminately ridding its streets of strays ahead of the global sporting event it will jointly host with Portugal and Spain.

Authorities in the North African country, however, insist they had endorsed a non-lethal method known as TNVR – to trap, neuter, vaccinate, and then release the dogs – aimed at reducing public health risks while controlling the stray population.

And a bill aimed at protecting street animals was adopted earlier this month, still pending parliament review.

It would set fines of up to $1,500 or jail terms of up to three months for harming stray dogs, according to a copy of the bill seen by AFP.

Yet the culling accusations persist as online videos show dogs being shot or poisoned with strychnine, a toxic alkaloid which is sometimes used as a pesticide.

In the videos from across the country, some of the dogs appear to already have marks on their ears indicating they had been sterilised and vaccinated.

Mohammed, a resident of Tangiers in Morocco's north who refused to give his last name for fear of retribution, said he witnessed a dog he had often seen in the neighbourhood where he works get poisoned and killed.

"I heard her cry before I saw her die," he recalled. That dog, too, had its ear tagged, he said.

An online petition launched by the International Animal Coalition to end the "violent killing of dogs on the streets and beaches of Morocco" has gathered nearly 75,000 signatures.

In June, an activist interrupted a FIFA Club World Cup match, invading the pitch with a sign that read: "Morocco: stop shooting dogs and cats".

France's Brigitte Bardot Foundation, created by the movie star in 1986 to promote animal protection, has called on FIFA to block Morocco from hosting the 2030 tournament.

Moroccan Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit has decried "media attacks" against the government with "wrong and out-of-context information".

Advocates say Morocco has around three million stray dogs, but no official figures exist.

Each year, there are about 100,000 stray dog bites nationwide, according to official data. In 2024, authorities said 33 people died from rabies, which is often transmitted by unvaccinated animals.

"Local officials still see dogs on the streets as presenting a bad image," said Salima Kadaoui, 52, who launched the Hayat project, using the TNVR method to help control the stray dog population in Tangiers and aiming at eradicating rabies.

Kadaoui commended government efforts to protect animals, saying she was "fully available" to work with authorities and build up on the success of Hayat – meaning "life" in Arabic – which has treated more than 4,600 dogs in Tangiers alone since 2016.

She said it was "essential" not to kill TNVR-tagged dogs and to return them to the same place.

"They're like police against rabies. If a rabid dog shows up, they drive it away and protect the community."

The government has invested more than $24 million in creating clinics capable of implementing TNVR en masse, said Mohammed Roudani, head of hygiene and green spaces at the interior ministry.

One clinic is already active in Al Arjat, near the capital Rabat, where veterinarian Youssef Lhor said more than 500 dogs had been treated this year and nearly half of them released back to the areas where they had been captured.

A young female dog, tagged "636", was recovering at the clinic after being sterilised, and will soon be released.

"Sometimes people tell us: 'You took the dogs away, why are you bringing them back?'" said Lhor, highlighting the need for public awareness on the issue.

Moroccan authorities have developed a mobile app explaining what these clinics do, and allowing users to report sightings of stray dogs.

Kadaoui said it was important to educate people on proper behaviour around strays and to warn against myths, like the idea that spitting on a dog bite could heal the injury.

Ben Shelton defeated compatriot Taylor Fritz on Wednesday, advancing to his first Masters 1000 final.

After defeating Washington Open champion Alex de Minaur in straight sets, Shelton produced a fine display to dispatch Fritz, winning 6-4 6-3.

The big-serving American will now face Karen Khachanov in the Canadian Open final after the Russian defeated top seed Alexander Zverev in the other semi-final match.

Shelton broke into the ATP top 10 for the first time earlier this year and has followed up this breakthrough by producing a consistent stream of high-level performances in Toronto.

With his victory over Fritz, Shelton confirmed his status as one of the world's best players, while putting himself in the same conversation with Pete Sampras.

Ben Shelton made American tennis history on Wednesday night.

As per OptaAce, Ben Shelton is the youngest American to achieve successive ATP top 10 wins in an ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final and semi-final since Pete Sampras.

Shelton was aged 22 years and 291 days when he achieved the feat on Thursday night.

Meanwhile, Sampras was aged 20 years and 364 days when he achieved the feat at the 1992 Cincinnati Open.

2 – Ben Shelton (22y 291d) is the youngest American to achieve successive ATP top 10 wins in an ATP Masters 1000 QF and SF since Pete Sampras (20y 364d) in Cincinnati in 1992. Wow.#NBO25 | @NBOtoronto @atptour @ATPMediaInfo

If Shelton can go on to have a career anything like Sampras', he will have achieved a great deal in the sport. After all, Sampras is a 14-time Grand Slam singles champion.

The 22-year-old will hope to create further history against Karen Khachanov on Thursday night. The pair have met one time previously on the ATP Tour, at the 2025 Indian Wells tournament: a match Shelton won in straight sets, 6-3 7-5.

As per the ATP Live Rankings, Ben Shelton is on 3,970 ATP points. If he defeats Khachanov on Thursday night, the American would overtake Novak Djokovic in the ATP rankings.

Djokovic is currently on 4,130 points. A victory over Khachanov would see Shelton climb to 4,320 points and into the world number six spot.

This would certainly be a monumental achievement if realised. Not many players can say they have been ranked above Novak Djokovic while he is still near his best.

Meanwhile, Karen Khachanov has already risen four places to number 12 in the world. If he defeats Shelton, the Russian would rise to world number eight.

But it wasn't going to be easy. The conditions in Canada—fast courts, fast balls—were a recipe for inconsistency and frustration, and we saw that from a lot of players. So it makes sense that the finalists, Shelton and Khachanov seem like the last two survivors on the island. Shelton won two of his matches 7-6 in the third set, and Khachanov did the same against Alexander Zverev in the semifinals on Wednesday night.“When I came here I didn't like the conditions,” Khachanov said with a laugh on Wednesday. “I can say it now. But that's all about adjusting and adapting. I think tennis is all about that.”

For Shelton, the satisfaction comes from surviving the close ones.“Finding a way to get through those tough matches where I'm down a break in the third, or the other guy's serving for the match where I could be out of the tournament, those are the ones that are really special for me,” he said.This will be Shelton's first Masters 1000 final, and Khachanov's second—his first was seven years ago. But their recent form makes their success here feel like less than a total surprise. They were both quarterfinalists at Wimbledon, and Shelton made the semis at the Citi Open two weeks ago. Each is 6-foot-4 or above, and each has the right game for a fast hard court in this day and age: Big serve, heavy topspin forehands, consistent two-handed backhands, an ability to attack and close at net.They've played once before, earlier this year in Indian Wells, and Shelton won 6-3, 7-5. I'd say Khachanov is, or was, more solid from the baseline, but that day Shelton was the more creative player, and was one shot ahead of the Russian in the rallies.

Since then, the American has only improved, in virtually every area. Once upon a time, Shelton's game looked like a serve and a prayer, but no more. In his last two matches, he has played guys who are normally steadier from the back court, Alex de Minaur and Taylor Fritz, but it was Shelton was won most of the protracted rallies. By the time he faced Fritz in the semis, Shelton was in the zone, and he played circles around his higher-ranked countryman.“Playing back-to-back guys like Demon and Taylor, and having so much success in the long rallies like the stats showed, is a big confidence-builder for me,” Shelton said.Shelton said he had everything “clicking” against Fritz. He looked that way for much of Wimbledon and D.C., but then the clicking stopped. Can the 22-year-old maintain his top level a little longer this time, and take the next step up by winning his first Masters 1000? The conditions, in his case, seem right. Winner: Shelton

Novak Djokovic has failed in each of his three attempts to add a 25th Grand Slam title to his collection in 2025.

The Serbian star kicked off his Grand Slam campaign in Melbourne, where he picked up a remarkable win over Carlos Alcaraz, before Djokovic retired injured against Alexander Zverev in the semifinals.

Traveling to Paris for the French Open, he returned to the semifinals once more, where Djokovic lost to number-one seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

Suffering the same fate at SW19, Djokovic was beaten by Sinner 3-6, 3-6, 4-6, as he missed out on a place in the Wimbledon final.

Looking to go all the way in New York, Djokovic has been praised for what he's done before the US Open begins.

Following his run to the last four at Wimbledon, Djokovic pulled out of the Canadian Open, alongside his fellow Grand Slam champions Sinner and Alcaraz.

However, unlike Sinner and Alcaraz, Djokovic has now withdrawn from the Cincinnati Open as well, meaning he will next be seen on court at the US Open.

During the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', Nick Kyrgios' former coach, Simon Rea, gave his verdict on Djokovic's Cincinnati withdrawal.

“I think it's hard to knock the change in approach from the perspective that you are looking at an athlete that is prepared to do whatever he can to give himself the ultimate chance at playing for one more Grand Slam title,” he said.

“I think it's the equations of energy in vs energy out. It's as simple as that. The energy in is normally time on the match court, victories under the belt, momentum, progress, and confidence, which is earned through action. You can't go to the supermarket and buy confidence off the shelf.

“So I think it's to be applauded that he is trying something different again.”

Rea believes Djokovic is sacrificing match sharpness to conserve energy for the latter stages of the tournament.

“He is prepared to go in there slightly underdone from a physical perspective, because he is thinking I need every ounce of energy available at the backend of that fortnight,” he said.

“We know it's hot and humid in New York, we know it's a physical test over five sets.

“He is going to go in there fresh and back himself to find a way, perhaps through some difficult moments in the opening week and back himself to get there with a little bit more in the tank deep in the event against the likes of [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz.”

The Australian may have praised Djokovic for ‘trying something different', although it should be noted that things didn't exactly go to plan when the Serb did the exact same thing in 2024.

After Djokovic lost to Alcaraz in the 2024 Wimbledon final, he chose to skip the two North American hard-court Masters 1000 events just as he has done this year.

Returning to action in New York as the number two seed, Djokovic was looking to defend his title, having beaten Daniil Medvedev to win his 24th Grand Slam one year earlier.

Kicking off his campaign with a comfortable victory, Djokovic defeated Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.

Moving on to play his fellow Serb, Laslo Djere, Djokovic advanced to the third round when his countryman retired injured down two sets to love.

Next up for Djokovic was Australia's Alexei Popyrin, who had won the Canadian Open earlier in the month.

Stunning those in attendance on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Popyrin stormed into a two-set lead, 6-4, 6-4, leaving Djokovic on the brink of defeat.

Djokovic wasn't prepared to give up that easily, however, as he fought back to take the third set, 6-2.

Many expected Djokovic to push on and secure the win in five, although it wasn't to be, as Popyrin regained control in the fourth, securing the win 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.

For the first time since 2017, Djokovic had lost before the fourth round of a Grand Slam, as he headed home from New York much earlier than expected.

Looking to avoid the same fate in 2025, perhaps it would have made more sense for Djokovic to play a warm-up tournament before the US Open.

Only time will tell if Djokovic will be subject to another early exit at Flushing Meadows, but you certainly won't want to miss any of the action when the tournament begins on Sunday, August 24.

Goran Ivanisevic has found plenty of success in his coaching career so far, which began in 2013 when he took Marin Cilic under his wing. 

Ivanisevic helped his Croatian compatriot Cilic secure his first and only Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2014, and afterwards enjoyed brief player-coach relationships with Tomas Berdych and Milos Raonic.

In 2019, he was appointed by Novak Djokovic, whom he guided to nine major titles and seven ATP Masters 1000 crowns. 

Despite unsuccessful stints in recent times, including Ivanisevic's short-lived spell with Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 53-year-old has done more than enough to cement himself as a top coach.

His new career came just under a decade after calling it a day on his playing career in 2004, which he has been reflecting on after parting ways with Tsitsipas.

Ivanisevic enjoyed many triumphs during his days on the ATP Tour and made multiple deep runs at Grand Slam events. 

He reached his first major final at Wimbledon in 1992, but lost to Andre Agassi over five sets, in what marked the American's first title at the All England Club. 

In 1994, Ivanisevic advanced to the final again in SW19, this time falling to Pete Sampras, losing to the American in straight sets on Centre Court.

Four years later, he returned to the championship match at Wimbledon for the third time, where he suffered defeat to Sampras once more. 

Despite finally winning the tournament in 2001, Ivanisevic told Sportal that losing to the 14-time Grand Slam champion at the last hurdle twice was incredibly tough to take. 

He said: “That man destroyed a lot of my life, dreams, sleep, nerves. I can't forgive him for that.”

After a fourth-round finish in 1999 and a first-round exit in 2000, many would have thought Ivanisevic's chances of winning Wimbledon were gone, but in 2001, he did the unthinkable. 

The 29-year-old finally hoisted the famous trophy that year, becoming the first unseeded player to win the championship since Boris Becker in 1985, and the first and only wildcard to lift a men's singles major title.

After victories over Carlos Moya, Andy Roddick, and Tim Henman, he beat Patrick Rafter in the final to win it all. 

Following the triumph, his ranking improved by 109 places, going from world number 125 to 16.

Ben Shelton upstaged higher-ranked countryman Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-3 Wednesday night in Toronto to muscle his way into his first ATP Masters 1000 final at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers.

Improving to 26-1 this season after winning the first set, the World No. 7 combined an expected service masterclass with a surprising baseline assault on return to declaw Fritz, who had dropped serve just once in his previous three matches heading into the semi-finals.



"Even more uncharted territory. Humble and Hungry," Shelton wrote on the TV camera as he celebrated the breakthrough win.

“I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week, that's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning,” Shelton said. “There are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two Top 10 guys back to back is huge for me.”

The win also lifted Shelton to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race to Turin as he hopes to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. Should he win the title, Shelton will move to fourth, ahead of Novak Djokovic.

In the first all-American ATP Masters 1000 semi-final since 2010, Shelton earned six break points across three Fritz service games in the opening set, eventually breaking through in the ninth game with a thunderous down-the-line forehand winner.

Emerging as one of the best front-runners in the game, the 22-year-old showed no letup in the second set, claiming the decisive break in the fifth game with a drop shot/lob combo that left Fritz floundering at net. The lefty secured back-to-back Top 10 victories for the first time, following his quarter-final win over recent Washington ATP 500 champion Alex de Minaur.

Shelton claimed his 100th tour-level win earlier in the tournament and will move to a career-high No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings ahead of Djokovic if he defeats Karen Khachanov in Thursday's final, which begins at 7 p.m. ET.

Shelton hit 22 unreturned serves to Fritz's 10, according to Infosys ATP Stats and five backhand winners to Fritz's none.  He earned 10 break point opportunities and limited Fritz to 68 per cent of first-serve points won and 39 per cent of second-serve points won.

“When he's standing in one corner, he's one of the best in the world at being behind the ball and hitting it harder and harder every time. I knew I had to keep him moving and I did a great job of that… I felt like I had the ball on a string," Shelton said.

 “I'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in…”

Shelton improved to 31-16 on the year according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

John Isner is an American former ATP player who is also one of the co-hosts of the Nothing Major podcast. He is a trusted voice in tennis media and has done work for the Tennis Channel and Barstool Sports among others.

However, his Thursday afternoon comment to his 275,000 Twitter followers created more attention than he probably either wanted or expected.

Isner posted: “Can the Russian tennis players get their flag back? Bit ridiculous now.”

When a few posters agreed with him, he added that the whole thing was “lame.”

Others commented about ending the lack of postmatch handshakes also between the Ukranian and Russian/Belarusian players.

One also talked about showing up at a tennis tournament with a white square flag to represent the currently flagless ones, and another joked that the players should be able to pick a flag (for television purposes) and suggested that Rublev pick a pirate one.

There was plenty of banter about keeping politics out of tennis until the Ukranian Tennis BTU got involved.

As this policy of not showing the Russia and Belarus flags stems from the ongoing Ukranian war, it is not surprising that Isner received an emotional response from the Ukranian Tennis BTU.

It read as follows:

“Absolutely disgraceful to wake up after a horrific night of attacks – with your child trembling in fear in the bathroom while Russian drones explode near your home – and see a tweet about the “importance” of returning flags to Russian tennis players. John, come spend a few nights in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, or Odesa – then post your tweet about flags. Even after four years of Russia killing innocent Ukrainians and destroying our country, there are still people who think the priority is to give them back their flags… not to stop the killing.”

When others challenged the Ukranian BTU about the players involvement in this brutal war, a follow-on post was shared.

It said:

“It's truly strange that we even have to explain the obvious: a flag under which a brutal and devastating war is being waged has no place at peaceful sporting events. The fact that this needs to be said is shocking — and only shows how disconnected from reality some people are when they're far away from the war.”

As you can imagine, Isner's one sentence comment sent Tennis Twitter blazing for hours. Dan Wolken of the USA Today tried to gain consensus and reframe the chat.

He said: “John, if you want to argue removing the flag in international sports is meaningless and ineffective as a response to war, you can reasonably do that. But it was removed because their country invaded a sovereign nation. It would be more ridiculous to restore it while the war is still ongoing.”

To which, John Isner posted that he would argue that it was a meaningless response.

It is obvious that this is a hot button issue that has no resolution in sight until the war ends, but in the meantime, we will see if any current or former players join Isner on the Tennis Twitter debate.

World no. 1 Jannik Sinner is preparing for the title defense at the Cincinnati Masters. The Italian heads to Cincinnati following a historic triumph at Wimbledon, becoming the first player from his country with a trophy at the All England Club. 

Sinner is preparing for the North American hard-court swing with renewed motivation, hoping to defend the ATP throne from Carlos Alcaraz. As was expected, the 23-year-old enjoyed his break from tennis after conquering Wimbledon. 

The world's best player spoke about the emotional high of the final against Alcaraz and acknowledged that the experience felt very different to his other Major finals.

Five weeks earlier, Jannik squandered three match points against Carlos in that epic Roland Garros final, suffering a heartbreaking 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 defeat in five hours and 29 minutes.  

The Italian recovered and made a fresh start at the All England Club. He survived a major scare in the fourth round against Grigor Dimitrov and entered the last four with a win over Ben Shelton.

Sinner outplayed the seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets and arranged his first Wimbledon title clash against Alcaraz. The Spaniard took the opener, but the Italian kept his composure and provided a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory in three hours and four minutes.

Jannik experienced different sensations from his previous Major finals, especially after what happened in Paris. The four-time Major winner revealed he was surprised with the level he produced, especially against his greatest rivals in the latter stages.

The first-time Wimbledon champion took a couple of days off the court, spending quality time with family and friends. Sinner then returned to Monte Carlo and started his preparations for Cincinnati and the US Open. 

The Italian has to defend both titles and 3000 ATP points. The pressure is there, but Jannik looks recharged and eager to build on his incredible season and add more silverware to his growing collection. 

Will anyone stop him? Only time will tell in the next five weeks.

"The final at Wimbledon provided a different sensation because of what happened a month earlier at Roland Garros. Bouncing back in London and performing at that level surprised me, too.

I was thrilled to spend some time off the court after London and see my family and friends. After spending time with important people around me, I returned to the practice court and gave my best to prepare for the US swing, an important part of the season.

Winning Wimbledon felt very special," Jannik Sinner said.

Carlos Alcaraz is back in Cincinnati, preparing to play in his first tournament since Wimbledon.

Alcaraz, who did not play at the Canadian Open, will be hoping to bounce back after losing the Wimbledon final to Jannik Sinner.

Heading into the final, Alcaraz was the two-time defending champion. However, he struggled to match Jannik Sinner's aggressive serving display, eventually losing the contest in four sets.

Sinner, who also missed the tournament in Canada, is the number one seed in Cincinnati, meaning another mouthwatering clash could potentially transpire.

Ahead of his first match, Alcaraz spoke to the media about the Wimbledon final, and how long it took him to recover from the loss.

Speaking to reporters during the Cincinnati Open Media Day, Alcaraz described his immediate feelings after losing the Wimbledon final to his great rival, Jannik Sinner.

The Italian gained revenge on the Spaniard at SW19, after losing the French Open final in excruciating circumstances.

As per Punto de Break, Alcaraz said:  “Losing a Grand Slam final was a new situation for me, but one must be prepared for that. 

“Obviously, I didn't want it to happen ever, but I left the court proud and happy, smiling at the thought that at some point it had to happen because it has happened to all the tennis players in history. 

“It took me a few hours to overcome the defeat, knowing that I have many things to improve. 

“I could only feel grateful for having lived a Wimbledon final; I left proud of what I did.”

In July, Alcaraz told Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport that his main goal for the rest of the year was to reclaim the world number one spot.

During the Media Day in Cincinnati, Alcaraz reaffirmed his goal to catch Jannik Sinner in the ATP rankings.

Alcaraz said: “I feel very satisfied with how I'm doing things and want to continue this way. 

“There are various improvements I would like to implement in my tennis, but right now the key is to maintain joy on the court and be happy off it, enjoying in the most important tournaments in the world.”

Alcaraz added: “My goal from now until the end of the season is to reclaim the world number one spot.”

Sinner will face either qualifier Diego Galan or Czechia's Vit Kopriva in his second round match, while Alcaraz will play against either Mattia Bellucci or Damir Dzumhur. Both players have received a first-round bye due to their seeded positions in the draw.

MASON, OH − The Cincinnati Open has grown into a two-week affair with an expanded 96-player field.

After two days of qualifying rounds, the main draw is slated to begin Aug. 7 from the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Wednesday features a schedule-stuffing 27 matches from the opening rounds of ATP and WTA main draw play.

On Center Court, 45-year-old Venus Williams, a 7-time Grand Slam champion, will face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro. In the night session, Mason native Peyton Stearns will bid for her first main draw victory at her hometown tournament when she faces Yafan Wang.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time first-round updates from both tours.

Joao Fonseca's stellar summer continues after rallying for a three-set win, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, over Yunchaokete Bu on Center Court.

Fonseca started the year ranked outside the top 100 but entered Mason as the World No. 49 after a pair of Grand Slam Round of 32 runs at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

World No. 64 Arthur Rinderknech, making his Cincinnati debut, just advanced to the Round of 64 with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Nuno Borges.

Maya Joint, a 19-year-old from Australia, is the first player to punch their ticket to the Round of 64. Joint took out Greet Minnen in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.

It's Joint's second 1000-level event win of the year after a win in the Mutua Madrid Open in April.

The first round of the Cincinnati Open is underway from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

For the ATP, it's the 57th edition of the tournament in the Open Era, which began in 1969.

Joao Fonseca and Yunchaokete Bu kick things off on Center Court.

Coco Gauff and 2024 U.S. Open champions Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner, and 20 or so other players sent a letter to the heads of Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian open in March asking for more say in “decisions that directly impact” the players, as well as an increase in the prize draw. 

It seems like their pitch has had an effect. For the upcoming US Open tournament, starting in just a few weeks on Sunday, Aug 24, a record $5 million will be awarded each to the women's and men's singles champions. In addition, player compensation overall has increased 20% to $90 million, the most in tennis history, reports AP News.

According to the US Open Tournament, "The US Open has made a deliberate and concerted effort to ensure double-digit percentage increases from 2024 in all rounds of all events for all players, while at the same time significantly increasing the percentage of prize money for athletes playing deep into the singles draws."

The 2025 prize draw of $5 million is a 39% increase from last year's $3.6 million. The increase will also affect single players who make it to the finals with a $2.5 million payout each. Semifinalists will receive a 26% hike, making their take-home pay $1.26 million.

Many impactful players continue to be in discussions with the heads of each of the four major tournaments in a bid to receive a higher percentage of revenues.

Wimbledon's prize money went up about 7% to about $73 million, taking the exchange rate into consideration at the time that the English major announced player payments. Wimbledon's singles champions were paid roughly $4 million.

For women's and men's doubles each winner will receive $1 million, a new high for the U.S. Open doubles champions where total prizes for qualifying are going up to $8 million, a 10% increase.

The US Open will take place from AUGUST 18 - SEPTEMBER 7, 2025, at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens, NY.

The qualifying rounds of any significant WTA tournament can often make or break a player's career.

They provide a stumbling block for many players, or rather an opportunity to prove their worth in the upper echelons of the sport.

Some, like Victoria Mboko, have qualified for Grand Slam events before eventually making a name for themselves in the main draw.

One player, who shocked Jessica Pegula in the first round of Wimbledon, looked set to move onwards and upwards following an excellent period of form.

However, she has stumbled at the first hurdle in Cincinnati Open qualifying.

Unseeded Elisabetta Cocciaretto was not expected to instigate much drama heading into Wimbledon this year.

However, she demolished third seed Jessica Pegula in the first round, winning 6-2 6-3.

The Italian continued to impress in the second round, defeating America's Katy Volynets 6-0 6-4. She then lost to eventual semi-finalist Belinda Bencic, 4-6 6-3 6-7.

The Italian, now ranked 77 in the world, had impressed at SW19 and will have hoped to carry the same form into the tournaments succeeding Wimbledon.

Initially, she did. The 24-year-old won the Nordea Open in Sweden, securing her first WTA title.

She also performed admirably at the Prague Open, winning her opening match before succumbing to first seed Linda Noskova.

However, her form has taken a hit in Cincinnati. Despite being seeded fourth in qualifying, Cocciaretto was knocked out in the first round.

The Italian was defeated by Australia's Priscilla Hon, losing 4-6 4-6.

While this was a disappointing loss for Cocciaretto, it should not be over-scrutinised. The Italian has enjoyed an excellent couple of months on the WTA Tour, and being shocked by a lower-ranked player is an experience every competitor will go through at some stage in their career.

Speaking to reporters after their clash at Wimbledon, Pegula claimed that the Italian had produced an ‘insane' level of tennis.

Pegula said: “She [Cocciaretto] played absolutely incredible tennis.

“Do I think I played the best match ever? No, but I definitely don't think I was playing bad. It wasn't like I was playing that bad. 

“She just was hitting her shots and going for it, serving big, serving high percentage, going big second serves, redirecting the ball.

“I do feel like she played kind of insane. Hats off to her. Kudos to her for playing at a high level that I couldn't match it today.”

Canadian teenage sensation Victoria Mboko clinched a stunning comeback win over ninth seed Elena Rybakina to reach the final of the National Bank Open in Montreal, where she will face four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.

The 18-year-old Mboko rallied from a set down, in which she was dominated 6-1, to not only take Rybakina into a decider, but then save a match point and break the 2022 Wimbledon champion twice to force a final tie-breaker.

Mboko, who upset top seed Coco Gauff 6-1 6-4 earlier in the tournament and also beat Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets in their quarter-final clash, ultimately prevailed 1-6 7-5 7-6 (7-4) to book her spot in the final.

Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Congolese parents, Victoria Mboko grew up in Toronto.

Mboko began 2025 by winning four consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour events in January and February before claiming a fifth title in March. She remains in second place on the ITF World Tennis Tour for most women's singles titles won this year.

Mboko showed promise as a junior. She won her first professional singles title at the ITF W25 tournament in Saskatoon in 2022, a title she successfully defended in 2023.

Mboko began 2025 ranked at No 333 and has since risen 248 places to No 85. She will be ranked inside the Top 50 for the first time on Monday regardless of the result in Montreal.

She then qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the French Open, where she reached the third round, before stunning 25th-seeded Magdalena Frech in the first round at Wimbledon.

Mboko is coached by former world No 3, 1998 Wimbledon finalist and 1997 Billie Jean King Cup champion Nathalie Tauziat.

"Incredible match, thank you to everyone for supporting me," Mboko told the crowd in French. "It was really difficult, but anything can happen.

"Playing in front of the home crowd, obviously, has its advantages. You always have everyone pumping you up as much as they can. It really pulls me through in the tough moments where I'm maybe not as positive. Really blessed to have that kind of support."

Mboko overcame 11 double-faults and battled through a wrist injury after stumbling awkwardly to the ground in the second game of the third set.

Mboko, who will move up to at least 34th in the world after starting the year outside the top 300, said afterwards that her wrist felt "a lot better".

Rybakina was unhappy with the way the home crowd cheered her mistakes, saying: "Yeah, that wasn't nice, of course. I played in a lot of situations where the crowd was supporting the player, but I would say that here it was pretty tough from the very beginning.

"I already felt it from the first game we played, and especially when it's in between the serves. It is what it is. This is something I was kind of expecting, and definitely it didn't depend anyhow on my serve or in the mistakes I did or wrong choices. It was obvious that the crowd is going to cheer for their player."

Ranked 85th in the world, Mboko is seeking her first WTA Tour title and trying to join Faye Urban (1969) and Bianca Andreescu (2019) as the only Canadians to win their home event in the open era.

Two unseeded players (Naomi Osaka and Victoria Mboko) will face each other at the Canadian Open's final for the third time in the Open Era, after Marsikova-Kruger (1977) and Du Pont-Cuypers (1979)

In the final on Thursday night, she will face former world No 1 Osaka, who overcame 16th seed Clara Tauson 6-2 7-6 (9-7) in the other semi-final.

Osaka continued her best performance in a WTA 1000 tournament since reaching the Miami final in 2022. She stepped away from the game for 15 months towards the end of that season and had daughter Shai in July 2023.

Mboko had previously said that Osaka was her idol and the Japanese star, who has been working with coach Tomasz Wiktorowski after splitting with Patrick Mouratoglou, said: "I don't think that's ever happened. I'm shook [laughing]. It's really cute. I guess I have to have a really good attitude tomorrow. I can't let her not like me anymore.

"I don't know, it's funny because I see her on the TV, and I was low-key. That's my little twin, because we both have our blue dresses and our buns and everything. I'm really honoured. I always said that I would love to play someone that looked up to me in a way, so it's happening way sooner than I thought it would."

Fourth seed Ben Shelton beat second-seeded Taylor Fritz 6-4 6-3 in their all-American semi-final match at the National Bank Open in Toronto.

Shelton will face 11th seed Karen Khachanov in the final after he overcame top-seeded Alexander Zverev 6-3 4-6 7-6 (7-4) in the other semi-final, surviving a Zverev match point in the process.

"I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week, that's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning," said Shelton, who become the youngest American to reach an ATP Masters 1000 final since Andy Roddick in Toronto in 2004.

"There are a lot of things to be proud about and beating two top-10 guys back-to-back [Alex de Minaur and Fritz] is huge for me."

The 22-year-old Shelton is seeking his third career ATP Tour title. He won in Tokyo on hard courts in 2023 and Houston last year on clay.

"I'm just really excited to see myself executing like this, not wondering if the shot is going to go in or out, but expecting it to go in," Shelton said.

Tennis

TORONTO — Under the moonlight at Sobeys Stadium in Toronto, Ben Shelton produced one of the most illuminating performances of his career. Big serve, quick movement, and variety of shot and thought were all on display as the world No. 7 defeated compatriot Taylor Fritz, 6-4, 6-3, in one hour and 18 minutes Wednesday night to advance to the Canadian Open final.

No delay to begin the match was going to stop Shelton, 22, from reaching his first ATP Masters 1,000 final, another milestone in his blossoming career.

“The Masters were the one level of tournaments that I've been struggling with, and my next step is being able to excel in these tournaments,” Shelton said. “So taking that first step and getting my first deep run under my belt is exciting.”

There was great anticipation for this contest. The two friends hadn't met since 2023 at Indian Wells, where Fritz won a close three-setter in the second round en route to capturing the tournament. Shelton was a rookie on tour then. The stage doesn't feel too big for the American youngster two years later, on the cusp of his biggest tournament win.

To add to the drama, the match began with a 15-minute delay. A technical issue with the electronic line system forced the players to leave the court. The stoppage was brief, and soon their showdown would begin in front of the Toronto crowd.

There were tense moments for Shelton to start the match. In his first service game, Shelton faced two break points. He delivered a 118 mph unreturnable serve. Then, after a 15-shot rally on the second break point, Fritz sent a forehand long. Shelton held and was never broken for the rest of the set.

At 4-4, Shelton was dictating the pace of the points, forcing Fritz to defend behind the baseline. Like his previous round win against Alex de Minaur, it was Shelton owning the long rallies with deep groundstrokes and punitive slices. Fritz committed back-to-back errors, leading to break point. Shelton connected on a forehand winner that went behind Fritz, giving him the first break of the match. After two winners on the subsequent service game, Shelton claimed the one-set advantage.

“I think for me it was about keeping him moving, keeping him off balance,” Shelton said on his game plan tonight. “Mixing up the way that I play, but playing within my limits, and being really solid. My execution was really, really good tonight.”

The dominant Fritz serve, broken just three times in four matches, was in trouble. Shelton was not afraid to be aggressive and control the points when needed, and he returned with consistency, something that he does not always find easy. At 2-2, Shelton won points of 16 and 14 shots to get the second break of the match. The break point was notable as Shelton brought Fritz forward and punished him with a lob. The crowd cheered before Shelton motioned for them to get louder. He sensed the finish line was near.

On match point, Fritz tossed his third double fault, getting broken for a third time before breaking his racquet in half. After congratulatory remarks at the net, Shelton smiled to his team and waved to the crowd. Cheers of “Let's go, Ben” rang throughout the stadium, supporting the American after this emphatic victory. He is the youngest Masters 1,000 finalist since fellow American Andy Roddick in 2004.

Shelton's opponent in the final is Karen Khachanov. The Russian outlasted top seed Alexander Zverev, saving a match point before winning 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(4) in two hours and 52 minutes. Khachanov is attempting to win his second ATP Masters 1,000 title, after being victorious at the Paris Masters in 2018.

“It's a tough match,” Shelton said. “He's a rock-solid baseliner, serves really well, and a great competitor.”

As Shelton served for the first set, a fan yelled, “This is your time!” He rises to No. 5 in the live rankings following Wednesday's win. In less than 24 hours, the time could be Shelton's to capture his maiden Masters 1000 trophy, the potential beginning of a successful North American summer.

Ben Shelton's rise will hit new heights on Thursday in Toronto when he competes for his maiden ATP Masters 1000 trophy at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers, but he will face a stern test from an already accomplished winner at that level, Karen Khachanov.

This will be the No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings' first appearance in a final at this level, while Khachanov is back in the championship match for the first time since triumphing in Paris in 2018. Their clash is scheduled for not before 7:30 p.m. ET/Friday, 1:30 a.m. CEST.

Shelton is arriving in the final in red-hot form, having defeated Alex de Minaur and Taylor Fritz to score back-to-back wins over Top 10 opponents for the first time in his career. After showcasing variety to overwhelm De Minaur, the 22-year-old dispatched second seed Fritz in straight sets with his trademark power, while also winning 10 of 14 rallies that extended to nine shots or more.

“Playing back to back guys like Demon and Taylor, and having so much success in the long rallies is a big confidence builder for me,” Shelton said after defeating Fritz. “Last night I did it with a little bit more slower, off-pace stuff. Today I had more of my higher-end, attacking tennis. I'm really happy I showed that, depending upon who I'm playing, I can do both.”

That ability to adapt tactically — to either outlast or overpower — has been key to Shelton's run in Toronto, where he cracked the quarter-finals at Masters 1000 level for the first time. But standing across the net is a player proven for his credentials in these events.

Khachanov returns to a Masters 1000 final seven years after his breakthrough run in Paris, where he defeated Novak Djokovic in straight sets. The big-hitting 29-year-old saved a match point to stun top seed Alexander Zverev in Wednesday's semi-finals, finally cracking the title match in Canada after falling short in the last four in 2018 and 2019. He now boasts a 16-6 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, matching his win total in Paris as his most successful Masters 1000 event.

Watch Extended Highlights of Toronto semi-finals: 

“When I came here I didn't like the conditions,” Khachanov said with a smile. “I can say it now. But that's all about adjusting and adapting. I think tennis is all about that. Every week we play in different events. That's why a lot of things matter sometimes on the results, so that's why I think the question is about who adapts better.”

Khachanov's ability to adjust has been on full display throughout the tournament. His compact swings off both wings, particularly his reliable backhand, have helped him absorb pace and redirect attacks effectively. Against Shelton, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 1-0, Khachanov's experience and shot tolerance will be vital in handling the American's firepower and finding ways to extend rallies on his terms.

Thursday's title match will also carry significant implications in the PIF ATP Rankings. Shelton, who broke into the Top 10 for the first time in June, would also rise to a career-high No. 6 with the title. Khachanov, having already climbed four spots this week to No. 12 in the Live Rankings, would return to his career-best No. 8 — a position he last held in 2019 — if he lifts his eighth ATP Tour trophy.

Shelton won their latest meeting in straight sets in Indian Wells, but Khachanov will be hungry for the chance to rejoin the Masters 1000 winner's circle and confirm his return to elite form. Both players are seeking their first title of 2025.

Either way, a new chapter will be written in Toronto, one that could shape the rest of the season for both men as they aim to debut at the Nitto ATP Finals. Shelton is fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, while Khachanov is 12th and would jump to 10th with a win.

MONTREAL (AP) — Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko rallied to reach the National Bank Open final, beating ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4) on Wednesday night.

The 18-year-old Mboko dropped to the court after Rybakina's shot sailed long on match point as the crowd — lined with “Allez Vicky” — erupted. Mboko saved a match point in the third set and broke Rybakina twice to force the tiebreaker.

            The champions of this year's US Open are set to enjoy the biggest payday in tennis history.
    


            Tournament organizers announced on Wednesday that the men's and women's singles champions will each earn $5 million at this year's tournament, a 39% increase on the $3.6 million awarded in 2024.
    


            Overall, the tournament's prize purse will top $90 million – the largest in tennis history and a 20% increase on last year, which stood at $75 million.
    


            There will also be sizeable increases in pay for those who progress to the latter stages of the competition, with singles finalists earning $2.5 million (a 26% increase), semifinalists $1.26 million (a 26% increase), and quarterfinalists $660,000 (a 25% increase).
    


            For the first time at the tournament, winning teams in the men's, women's and mixed doubles will receive $1 million in prize money.
    


            The increase in prize money comes after some of the world's top players reportedly sent a letter to organizers of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open requesting a “substantial increase” in prize money.
    


            “The US Open has made a deliberate and concerted effort to ensure double-digit percentage increases from 2024 in all rounds of all events for all players, while at the same time significantly increasing the percentage of prize money for athletes playing deep into the singles draws,” said a press release on the US Open website.
    


            Organizers have also set aside $5 million to put towards player expenses, including a $1,000 travel stipend for each player and two hotel rooms at the official player hotel (or $600 per day for staying at alternative accommodation).
    


            Qualifying for this year's US Open begins on August 18, with the main singles draws getting underway on August 24 and concluding on September 7.
    


            Sweeping – and controversial – changes have been made to the mixed doubles competition this year, which will now be staged on August 19 and 20 and include some of the biggest names in the sport.
    


Mixed doubles change at US Open branded a ‘profound injustice' by defending champions



            Among some of the all-star pairings will be Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, Casper Ruud and Iga Świątek, and Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov.
    


            The rationale is that top players will then be available to appear in the mixed doubles, attracting more fans and allowing broadcasters to spotlight the competition before main draw singles play begins.
    


            However, defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori called the format change a “pseudo-exhibition” and “profound injustice” which “disrespect(s) an entire category of players.”
    


            Eight pairs of the 16-team field have been selected based on their combined singles ranking, while eight are wild-card entries.
    


            The US Tennis Association told CNN Sports that the new format will “elevate mixed doubles with a bigger spotlight and provide a greater opportunity to inspire more people to play and grow the sport.”
    


            It also said in a press release that “the world's best players will have the opportunity to compete for this title and the multi-million dollar purse without having to juggle mixed doubles with their singles and doubles commitments.”

Emma Raducanu, who has a first-round bye, could potentially face fellow Brit and friend Katie Boulter in her opening match of the Cincinnati Open; watch the US Open live on Sky Sports Tennis, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Emma Raducanu hopes her new coaching set up, adding Rafael Nadal's former coach Francis Roig to her team, will help her improve "against the very top" in the game.

The 2021 US Open champion has worked with British coach Mark Petchey on an informal basis since March, enjoying a positive run of results.

However, Petchey's TV commitments meant he was always unable to become Raducanu's full-time coach and after a trial with Roig following Wimbledon, the 22-year-old has begun working with him in an official capacity - contracted until the end of 2025 - ahead of this week's Cincinnati Open.

"It's going really well," Raducanu said of the new partnership. "It's my second day with him here, but I did a few days in London before I came out here.

"He's obviously got a bank of experience; I'm very excited to continue working with him and to have him on my side."

Raducanu has enjoyed a strong 2024 so far, reaching the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in March, the round of 16 at the Italian Open and last eight at Queen's Club.

World No 1 Aryna Sabalenka proved too strong in round three at Wimbledon, but this was backed up by a semi-final at the Citi Open in Washington to see Raducanu back as British No 1 and move up to 33rd in the WTA rankings.

Spanish coach Roig worked alongside Nadal's uncle Toni for the majority of the 22-time Grand Slam champion's career.

On any specific targets she has with Roig, Raducanu added: "I'm working on the quality of my shots and to be better. Against the very top, that's what it needs. It needs to improve.

"I'm going to try and be pretty patient but I'm hoping with time that will improve."

Raducanu, who has a first-round bye, could potentially face fellow Brit and friend Katie Boulter in her opening match of the Cincinnati Open, provided Boulter comes through her first-round game with Olga Danilovic.

Both players are using the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati as a key warm-up for the US Open, the final Grand Slam of the season live on Sky Sports from August 24.

"I'm very happy to be here in Cincy and feeling good about everything overall," Raducanu said.

"Last year I didn't play so much after Wimbledon, but I have a few points to defend in Seoul. It's great to have this much of the year left and not much to defend.

"I think the goal for the rest of this season is to be seeded for Australia [in January] and, honestly, results aside, it's just to improve the feeling I have on the court - to feel I have less holes, and to feel like I can step on court and match pretty much anyone.

"That's the goal, but I think it's going to take a lot more time to do that."

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to headline action at the Cincinnati Open in their return to the ATP Tour. After their Wimbledon runs, the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings will begin their campaigns in the second round of the Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Sinner is scheduled to play his first match on Saturday, August 9, when all the top half matches will be played. He will open against qualifier Daniel Elahi Galan or Vit Kopriva. Alcaraz will compete on Sunday, August 10, when all the bottom half matches will be played. He will face Mattia Bellucci or Damir Dzumhur.

 



The Cincinnati Open, which runs from 7 to 18 August 2025, will mark their next appearance after their clash in the Wimbledon final, where Sinner defeated Alcaraz in four sets. The Italian improved to 5-8 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the win.

The new and improved ATP Cincinnati Open is upon us with the venue doubling in size compared to last year. The tournament also lasts 12 days now with almost all top-half first-round matches coming up on Thursday. 18-year-old star Joao Fonseca is looking to bounce back from a disappointing Toronto performance and will face Bu Yunchaokete. Who do you think will come out on top?

Head-to-head: Safiullin 1-0

It's been a messy season for Alejandro Tabilo, and that's not entirely his fault with fitness issues troubling him left and right. He will play for the first time since making the semifinals of the Prostejov Challenger in early June and is 2-5 on hard courts this year with a win each at Indian Wells and Miami. Considering that you probably should be treating Roman Safiullin as the favorite here, even if the Russian is not doing all that hot either. But at least he got a couple of matches under his belt in Toronto.
Prediction: Safiullin in 3

Head-to-head: Mannarino 5-4

This has been a fun rivalry over the years, especially their grass ATP 250 classics in ‘s-Hertogenbosch (three times) and Newport (twice). It seems like now things have changed from where they were at the end of last season when Jordan Thompson defeated Adrian Mannarino at the ATP 1000 in Paris. The Australian has been struggling with injuries and hasn't played since Wimbledon, while Mannarino is suddenly in vintage form again. He looked strong in qualifying and might extend his head-to-head lead here.
Prediction: Mannarino in 3

Head-to-head: Fonseca 1-0

Joao Fonseca continues to develop at a very strong pace, but that doesn't mean he won't be experiencing setbacks. That opening round loss to Tristan Schoolkate in Toronto was a clear example of that and the Brazilian's returning on a quick hard court was a bit of an abomination. That will have to be fixed in the near future, especially when he adds a solid block return to his skillset. Cincinnati conditions won't be that good for Fonseca either, but Bu Yunchaokete probably won't blow him off the court like Tristan Schoolkate did.
Prediction: Fonseca in 2

Oh, Canada, indeed! Eighteen-year-old Victoria Mboko advanced to the final of the Omnium Banque National with perhaps the most impressive win of her stunning at the WTA 1000 event in Montreal so far: a match-point saving win over No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina in a third-set tiebreak.Mboko's 1-6, 7-5, 7-6(4) comeback against Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, was her third win over a Grand Slam champion in the last nine days: a first for a Canadian player at one tournament.Aditionally, though she is the fourth home player to reach the final of Canada's signature event in the Open Era, she is the first to do it in Montreal. She is also the third wild card to reach the final at the tournament since 1968, and seeks to be the third to win it. Monica Seles did so in 1995, and Simona Halep followed in 2015.But both were more established players than Mboko, who started the year ranked outside the Top 300 and played just six tour-level main draws previously

But both were more established players than Mboko, who started the year ranked outside the Top 300 and played just six tour-level main draws previously

Mboko, who beat 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin and No. 1 seed Coco Gauff earlier in the tournament, was blitzed in the first set by Rybakina's first-strike tennis. The Kazakh, seeking her first WTA 1000-level final in more than a year, broke Mboko all three times she served in the opener. She largely wasn't challenged on serve after being broken in her first service game, despite only landing 41% of first serves.But the plot shifted seismically to start the second, as Mboko dug in physically and mentally. After letting leads of 3-0 and 5-3 go, the teenager won back-to-back games to steal the middle set, and shook off a potentially scary moment at the start of the third. Chasing down a ball to start the second game, she went over on her ankle, and landed hard on her wrist.She took a medical timeout at the set's first changeover, and played the rest of the match with some taping on that wrist.

"I had everyone supporting me and pushing me through," the teenager told the crowd in her on-court interview after twice breaking Rybakina when she served for the match, and erasing her chance to win in the 10th game."Without you guys, I don't think I would've been able to pull this through."

Editor's note: This story has been updated during Victoria Mboko's run to the final of the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal.

Ripping a backhand past a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist to clinch a first Grand Slam win on the opening day of the French Open is a pretty good way to make tennis fans stand up and take notice.

Or maybe Victoria Mboko, the 18-year-old, American-born, Canadian-raised daughter of Congolese parents, has been announcing herself for months now. Maybe folks just weren't listening closely enough.

Everyone is now, as she backs up her run to the French Open third round with a final at the WTA 1,000 Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam.

As her Roland-Garros debut approached, Mboko played the same brain game she has been playing through a startling climb up the tennis biosphere. She tells herself that what is happening isn't actually happening.

“Kind of just play it down,” she said during an interview after her 6-1, 7-6(4) win over Lulu Sun of New Zealand on a Sunday May. Three days later, she knocked out rising German Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4, to move into the third round at her first major. Her run ended there in a defeat to Zheng Qinwen, the 2024 Olympic gold medalist, but Mboko had shown everyone who had missed her rise that they should have been paying more attention.

“Pretend like you're playing somewhere else, that you're not at a Grand Slam,” she said of her strategy there.

It's another clay-court tournament. That way, I don't put as much pressure on myself and the points. I let loose and I kind of go for my shots a little bit more,” she said.

If playing make-believe before walking onto the biggest stages in tennis could lead to Mboko taking a spot next to Bianca Andreescu, Leylah Fernandez, Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Milos Raonic and others in the Canadian tennis firmament, then Mboko probably ought to keep doing it.

Her performance in Paris, and then in Montreal, where she has knocked out two-time major champion Coco Gauff and surged into the top 50 of the WTA rankings, showed every bit of what has generated all the buzz about Mboko becoming the latest in a string of Canadians from immigrant families who have made it to the top of the sport.

“We know Canada is a very multicultural country and we are very accepting of everyone,” Andreescu, who has become a mentor to Mboko, said during an interview in Rome.

“I think it's a beautiful thing that we're all from different different cultures, different backgrounds, but at the end of the day Tennis Canada really has built this program in the acceptance of everybody, no matter who you are.”

The youngest by seven years of four tennis-playing siblings, Mboko has been winning more than just about anyone in professional women's tennis since the start of the year. She finished last year ranked 350th, with her coaches believing fully in her potential but also wanting her to take it slow, given her struggles with knee injuries in recent years.

Now they have another problem on their hands. Mboko has won so many matches that she has already played more than she has ever played before. She started the year winning 22 in a row on the ITF World Tennis Tour, two rungs below the WTA Tour. She lost one, then won another five, this time at a WTA 125 event, the next rung up, in Porto. She has won matches in Rome, Ga. and Rome, Italy at the Italian Open. Her record on the year is 50-9, after beating 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in Montreal to reach her first WTA 1,000 final.

“I have been doing exactly the same thing I've been doing every other day. I like to keep the same routine when I'm in a tournament,” she said after her win over Gauff, who had beaten her in three sets at the Italian Open.

“I think I'm a little bit superstitious in that way, in that sense, but I just like to keep everything super simple. I like to do the exact same thing every day in a tournament.”

“That's a lot,” Marko Strillic, one of three coaches she works with at the Canadian Tennis Federation, said during an interview at the Italian Open.

“If she keeps winning, you have to figure out a way to manage the schedule so that she doesn't get hurt. This is for the long term.”

That was before Mboko cruised through French Open qualifying to earn her main draw debut, and then knocked through Sun as though she knew she would all along. Mboko was all business again against Lys, but for a couple of service breaks she quickly recovered from.

Her brother Kevin, 27 and a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, said that from the moment she woke up, she set her mind on only one thing: winning.

“She looked at us and said, ‘I got to win today,'” he said in an interview after she did just that. “We were trying to bring her down a little bit, telling her that it's all right, to just go out there and have fun, enjoy the experience.

“She was like ‘No, I got to win.”

That's how she was during her hit before walking onto the court, and it's how she was through the 79-minute match. Rain, wind, muddy balls, nothing really budged her off her game.

“It's been really calm between the days,” she said. “That's how my coach wanted it to be.”

She woke at a quarter to seven ahead of her match against Lys, ready to roll. There was quick breakfast, a ride to Roland Garros, a physical warm-up and then a 30-minute hit at 9:30 a.m.

“Then I just chilled in the locker room until my match,” she said.

All week, all month, really, there has been a ‘no big deal' sensibility to Mboko. She credited the presence of her sister and brother for that.

“There is so much happening even behind the scenes,” she said. “I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I have just been enjoying the moment. I have been enjoying time with my sister and my brother. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.”

At some point, this is going to get complicated, but for Kevin and everyone else closest to Mboko, this rocket ride both is and is not surprising.

Her oldest sister Gracia, 28, who has been courtside all event, played tennis for the University of Denver. She said that she and her brothers always knew that their baby sister had something they did not. Gracia recalled a local women's tournament at their home club in Burlington, a city in the Greater Toronto area of Ontario, that she played in when she was 17.

At the last minute, another slot opened up, and a pro at the club asked Victoria, who was just 9 and had come to watch, if she wanted to play. Victoria jumped at the opportunity and eventually faced her sister. Gracia won, 6-0, 6-0, but the way Victoria behaved, it was as though she had expected the results to go the other way.

“It's that belief in yourself that the very top of the one percent have,” Gracia, a consultant in private equity, said Sunday after watching her sister win. “It's: ‘not only should I win this match, I'm going to go do it.' And then she does it.”

At least she does now. For the past couple of years, a knee injury caused by both rapid growth and a bad fall on a tennis court has made that difficult. She spent much of last year based in Belgium at the academy of Justine Henin, the former world No. 1 and four-time French Open champion. She played little for the first six months of the year. Getting healthy was the priority.

Even then, she ended the year losing more than she won, dropping three of her last four matches.

“Last year ended very poorly,” said Kevin. “I didn't see any of this coming. No one did.”

Their father, Cyprien, a retired mechanical engineer who worked nights in part so that he could drive his children to their tennis obligations, was there too. Victoria's mother, Godée, an accountant, was back home, dealing with a heavy end-of-the-month workload, as was her other brother, David, a 25-year-old data scientist.

The Mbokos moved from the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly three decades ago, to escape the First and Second Congo Wars of the mid-1990s. Visa issues kept the family separated, with Godée in Montreal and Cyprien in North Carolina. Godée then moved to N.C., where the family lived for several years and where Victoria was born, before all moving to Toronto when she was still a baby.

Victoria didn't let the losses in the final months of 2024 get to her.

“I just thought new year, new me,” she said during an interview in Rome.

She decided to play like the version of herself that she has long believed in: an aggressive, athletic player who likes to take control of points and dictate the action. In Miami, she beat Camila Osorio, a 23-year-old tour mainstay, and pushed Paula Badosa, the No. 10 seed at Roland-Garros, to a third-set tiebreak.

Mboko has also showed off a precocious variety, mixing in drop shots and slices, including a hard, slicing forehand. Her coach is Nathalie Tauziat, who got to No. 3 in the world with a game molded around variety. But Mboko can also crack her serve at 120 mph. Not surprisingly, she grew up worshipping Serena Williams.

In Rome, she cruised through the first set in her second-round match against  Gauff, lacing backhands and forehands through the court on the Campo Centrale like a seasoned veteran. Gauff turned the match into one of her long-distance track races, getting so many balls back that Mboko was huffing and puffing between every point. But the world No. 2 came away seriously impressed. She “felt like playing myself,” Gauff said in a huddle after the match, especially with how well Mboko covered the court.

“On the movement, I would say she's up there with me on that,” Gauff, probably the best mover in the sport, said.

Gracia Mboko said her sister came away from that loss both devastated and determined.

“She told me she was so out of steam, that she couldn't believe how Coco was getting every ball back,” she said Sunday.

“She kept saying, ‘I got to get in shape.' It motivated her.”

It certainly did. When she faced a double-fault-stricken version of Gauff in Montreal, she kept her foot on the accelerator after winning the first set 6-1. She knew that Gauff would raise her level, try to make her nervous, try to impose her experience on the match. Mboko didn't let her. She stayed even until 5-4, then broke Gauff to win the second set and the match.

Against Rybakina, in a match that ebbed and flowed, she looked out of the contest at the end of the first and third sets. But she refused to give in, breaking Rybakina twice as she served for the match.

Mboko had learned plenty from that first loss to Gauff. She knew she had let the world No. 2's grit frustrate her, thinking about the last point when she was supposed to be thinking about the next one. Her coaches are onto this.

“They'll start to snap me right back into it,” she said. “They'll actually say: ‘stay present, stay focused, or close it right here.'”

With 50 wins on the year, Mboko isn't exactly unfamiliar with closing it. Now she is doing it on the biggest stage in the sport.

The top-two ranked Americans on the ATP Tour will square off for a place in the Toronto final come Wednesday evening at the National Bank Open.Ben Shelton booked a showdown with Taylor Fritz in reaching his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semifinal. The left-hander halted Washington, D.C. champion Alex de Minaur, 6-3, 6-4, to close out Tuesday's action for his first Top 10 win of the season.The runner-up here two years ago, De Minaur came in on a seven-match win streak and leading all ATP players with 24 hard-court victories this year. In a game where he had chances to keep pace, the Australian was the first to crack at 2-3 after catching consecutive shots late—a forehand volley and backhand up the line. Shelton was the more effective hitter with 13 winners (to 14 unforced errors) in seizing control of the scoreboard.

Though the two-time major semifinalist couldn't consolidate an early break in the second set, Shelton immediately recovered. The No. 4 seed outlasted his opponent in a grueling baseline exchange at deuce, which De Minaur followed up with a double fault to hand over the re-break. Shelton ran with the lead from there to become the youngest U.S. man to reach the last four of a 1000-level event since Andy Roddick at 2005 Indian Wells."I think versatility on the return is really important, and every guy's different. Each of the guys that I played this tournament I had to have a very different return style and plan of attack," Shelton told press afterwards. "And I executed really well tonight, I took away the things that I needed to take away, I played the odds, and I was solid."

Fritz shook off not initially serving out his quarterfinal to defeat Andrey Rublev, the 2024 finalist (in Montreal). The No. 2 seed unleashed 20 aces during a 6-3, 7-6 (4) victory, improving to 6-4 against Rublev."I would say especially the last two matches, I just feel like any time I've been a bit under pressure I've been coming up with good serves, getting a lot of free points with it. I've been hitting all the spots pretty well. I think that's just the big thing, it feels like it's flowing," said Fritz.The 27-year-old is looking to match his biggest career trophy, having triumphed at the 2022 BNP Paribas Open. It was at Indian Wells a year later when Fritz won his only meeting to date with Shelton from a set down in the second round. *U.S. viewers can stream Wednesday's showdown live on the Tennis Channel app*

The Cooldown Room - Quiz of the season so far with Victor Martins

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

Lando Norris might be holding second place in the World Championship, but the McLaren driver feels that certain parts of his season so far were "not good enough".

Lando Norris has deemed the earlier part of his season as “not good enough”, with the Briton believing that, prior to the last couple of months, his performance was “pretty average”.

Norris' campaign initially looked to have started strongly when 2025 kicked off at the Australian Grand Prix in March, having won what turned out to be a chaotic wet-dry encounter.

However, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri claimed four victories across the next six rounds, Norris had to wait until Round 8 in Monaco to stand on the top step again.

A difficult moment for the team followed two races later in Canada when a late-race collision between Norris and Piastri – for which Norris took the blame – put the former out of the running while the latter managed to make it home in fourth.

But since Round 11 in Austria, the 25-year-old has bolstered his points tally by scoring three wins, with the most recent of these in Hungary seeing him cut Piastri's championship lead down to just eight points.

When asked ahead of the race in Budapest to assess his season and give an insight into what his area of focus will be during the next few weeks, Norris explained: “Just what I've been doing really over the last month, two months.

“Prior to that, [it was] not good enough, so in a harsh way, I would say I was pretty average before then. Since then, I think things have been a lot stronger.

“I still want more, still need to be a lot better and I'm not as good as where I would like to be, but a lot of improvements have been made.

“I think I'm in a much better place, I'm happier with the car – things like that. I've been working hard but I can do a lot more than I have been doing, so, for that reason, just more of the progress that I have been making.”

Earlier in the season, Norris spoke of how he had been spending time off social media, a move that he felt had allowed him to “do things that are productive”.

With this in mind, the nine-time race winner was quizzed on how different his 2025 summer break might look in comparison to previous years.

“It's not going to be that different,” he reflected. “I'm still on social media every now and then, I'm still going to go and have a good time with my friends in different places, and we're going to have a little golf trip and do different things.

“So really, it's not any different to what I've done the last few years, which is a good thing. It shouldn't be any different. There's no reason it should be any different.

“I still have the priorities of making sure I come back more prepared than ever and in a better way than I could possibly be, but for the same sake, I should treat it no different to how I have done before, which is that Formula 1 is the priority, and I make sure I'm in the best shape I can be for that.”

The Cooldown Room - Quiz of the season so far with Victor Martins

Grill the Grid 2025 | Episode 1: Face Mash

Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto give their views on a tricky race in Hungary for Alpine.

Pierre Gasly has conceded Alpine are "just too slow" after he and team mate Franco Colapinto endured a tough Hungarian Grand Prix, with the pair coming home last of the 19 cars to finish.

With Colapinto starting 14th and Gasly 17th at a track where overtaking can be tricky, it was always going to be tough for the French outfit at the Hungaroring, with their best hope being a spot of weather hitting the circuit.

However, the rain did not materialise, and even splitting the strategies – with Gasly one-stopping and Colapinto stopping twice – did not help.

Gasly's race was further hampered by a 10-second time penalty picked up late on, after a collision with Carlos Sainz when fighting for P15. with the stewards deeming him at fault. Although he crossed the line 17th, that penalty demoted the Frenchman to P19 and last, with Colapinto in 18th.

“We cannot be pleased with the end result today, even if it felt like our execution was quite good,” explained Gasly. "Ultimately, we are just too slow.

“The last two weekends we have been able to maximise the conditions and come away with two good results. Today was more conventional and it really highlighted our weak spots.

"Still, there were a lot of fun battles out there and I felt like the racing was generally very good. I am here to race, not to give up, and I just gave it my best in all the wheel-to-wheel fights.”

Gasly's sixth-place result at Silverstone and P10 at Spa have kept Alpine's points haul ticking over, but they are now 15 points behind Haas in the battle for ninth in the Teams' Championship.

As for Colapinto, his hunt for a first points finish of the year continues – but the Argentine racer can take heart from making Q2 in Hungary and out-qualifying his team mate for the first time since Canada.

However, his race was undone by a couple of slow pit stops, and he found himself stuck in a DRS train for most of the afternoon.

“It was not the best of days today and a difficult race for us as a team,” Colapinto said after the race. "The pace was good at times in clean air and I had the same feeling as yesterday, I think we have taken a good step forward with the car, which has given me confidence.

“But with the blue flags and losing time in the pitlane, it really limited what we could achieve today. The initial start and getaway was good, but from there we fell back on the first lap and lost places. I was struggling with rear grip and sliding, which came back to us later in the race.

“We opted for a two-stop and unfortunately, we encountered issues on both which meant we were held longer than we expected. As a team, we've been very good recently with pitstops, but these things happen in racing.”

As Kelly Clarkson and her kids mourn the passing of her ex-husband and their dad, Brandon Blackstock, others mourning his death on August 7, 2025, include country superstar Reba McEntire. 

“The Voice” coach was married to Brandon's dad, talent manager Narvel Blackstock, from 1989 to 2015, and remained close with him and Clarkson, even through their own divorce, which Clarkson filed for in 2020. Brandon was Narvel's son from a previous marriage. 

In 2021, McEntire told Entertainment Tonight, “Brandon's been my son forever it seems. Although he's my stepson, I still love him like he's my total — my blood, so I'm praying for them both because I love them both.”

A post shared by Shelby Blackstock (@shelbyblackstock)

When McEntire performed at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in March, it was a family affair. Her and Narvel's son Shelby Blackstock — Brandon's half-brother — shared photos from the event that showed Brandon attended the concert and was backstage with McEntire, along with three of his four kids.  

Shelby captioned the collection of photos by writing, “Family time, the @rodeohouston , & corn dogs! We had a blast in Houston watching @rissablackstock experience her first rodeo & being able to spend cherished time with family! Mom's concert was the icing on the cake!”

Brandon had two kids with his first wife, Melissa Ashworth — Savannah, 22, and Seth, 18. He shared two kids with Clarkson — River Rose, 11, and Remington, 9. He was also a grandpa to Savannah's young son, who was also at the rodeo. 

At the time of publication, McEntire had not spoken publicly about Brandon's passing. 

McEntire didn't take sides as Clarkson and Blackstock were going through their oftentimes contentious divorce, remaining connected to and supporting both of them. 

In 2021, she told Extra, “You know, I love them both. Brandon's my stepson, Kelly's my good friend, and I'm pulling for both of them. I hope they're happy and healthy and pull through this. I pray that everybody gives them the encouragement they can, because they need it right now, both of them.”

She also told Entertainment Tonight that year, “Kelly and I do talk, we text and I love them both, and so I can't play favorites because I've been a friend of Kelly for a long time.” 

Before McEntire became a coach on “The Voice,” she was a Mega Mentor on the show in 2023, and got to work with Clarkson there. 

“I am so proud of Kelly,” McEntire said on the show, as seen in the video above. “She has grown as an artist, as a teacher. From when we first met in 2000 — way back — 2002, so that was how long we've known each other. She was a baby!”

“Now, she's just matured into this wonderful woman that I am just so proud of and I love her with all my heart,” she added.

	Brandon Blackstock, the Nashville music manager who was married to Kelly Clarkson for seven years, has died after a battle with cancer. He was 48.


	Starstruck Entertainment, the company for which Blackstock worked for many years, shared the news via an Instagram statement on Thursday (Aug. 7). “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” it read. 


	“Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,” the message continued. “He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”


	The news comes just one day after the The Voice coach announced that she would be postponing her August residency shows in Las Vegas so that she could be with her kids during a tough period for the family. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.

	











	She'd added, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”




	The son of Starstruck co-founder Narvel Blackstock, Brandon was formerly the stepson of Reba McEntire, who was married to his father for 26 years. Working alongside his dad, Brandon was involved in managing the careers of clients such as Blake Shelton and Carly Pearce.


	Years after meeting each other while Narvel was Clarkson's manager, the singer and Brandon tied the knot in 2013, after which Brandon would become his then-wife's manager. They share two children together, welcoming 11-year-old River in 2014 and 9-year-old Remington in 2016. 


	In 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce, setting off a lengthy legal battle between herself and her ex-husband. Though they'd eventually settle their split in 2022 — with Clarkson agreeing to give Brandon $45,601 in monthly child support as well as a one-time payment of $1.3 million — Starstruck would later sue the American Idol alum for alleged unpaid fees. Clarkson responded by alleging that the Blackstocks actually owed her money, filing a complaint with California's Labor Commissioner that claimed they'd violated the state's Talent Agencies Act by serving as her managers as well as unlicensed talent agents who booked her business deals.


	The ruling went in Clarkson's favor, with Brandon ordered to repay her more than $2.6 million in commissions. Shortly afterward, Blackstock and Starstruck challenged the ruling in court, but the case was ultimately dismissed in May 2024.


	In addition to the children he shared with Clarkson, Brandon is also survived by his kids with ex-wife Melissa Ashworth — Savannah and Seth — as well as a young grandson named Lake.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that the Dune franchise actor is closing in on two Amazon MGM Studios movies: Chad Stahelski's Highlander which UA is also behind, and Road House 2, which Dave Bautista was also circling. 


	Bautista will star opposite Henry Cavill in Stahelski's revival of the 1980s classic swordsman movie. We hear he's playing The Kurgan, a character made famous by Clancy Brown in the original Sean Connery-Christopher Lambert film.


	Kurgan was an Immortal who was a contender for The Prize — the power of all the Immortals who ever lived. During his life, Kurgan was a bad dude, killing and raping, and taking the heads of many Immortals. In the original movie, he's a foe of Lambert's Connor MacLeod.

	Bautista joins Road House 2 opposite Jake Gyllenhaal who is coming back as ex-UFC fighter Dalton from a script by Will Beall (Bad Boys: Ride or Die). Road House 2 is produced by Atlas Entertainment's Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, Gyllenhaal's Nine Stories Productions with Josh McLaughlin executive producing. As we first told you, Guy Ritchie is no longer directing, rather Nobody's lya Naishuller. Road House released last year on Prime Video, pulled in 80M viewers worldwide in its first eight weeks on the service, one of the top Amazon MGM Studios movies ever viewed.




			Watch on Deadline		







	UA's Scott Stuber and Nick Nesbitt are producing Highlander alongside Neal H. Moritz and 87Eleven Entertainment, Stahelski's production banner. UA took full rights to Highlander, which Lionsgate developed, with potential to also develop a new series. 

	











	The original Highlander, in 1986, followed the climax of an ancient battle between immortal warriors, unfolding through interwoven past and present-day storylines. The movie gained a cult following and generated a universe of movie sequels and a TV series. Russell Mulcahy helmed the original film, which was produced by Peter S. Davis and William N. Panzer. Patrick Wachsberger is also exec producing.


	Bautista made a cameo recently in Paramount's comedy comeback Naked Gun opposite Liam Neeson. Back in June we told you that Paramount Pictures has acquired rights to The Romantic, a romantic comedy spec from Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont, with Bautista attached to star. The Dune and Guardians of the Galaxy franchise star has Aura Entertainment's actioner Trap House up next, as well as the Amazon MGM buddy cop action comedy The Wrecking Crew opposite Jason Momoa, both of which are produced by his Dogbone Entertainment Banner. He also starred in the critically acclaimed Gia Coppola directed Pamela Anderson movie The Last Showgirl. Bautista also has the Zellner Brothers' alien invasion comedy Alpha Gang upcoming. 


	Bautista is repped by WME and Jackoway Austen Tyerman et al.

Here's hoping he gets to do something unusual with both roles.

Something … tender. 

Brute and brawn will only get you so far. The Kurgan is in on “the secret” – laugh even death – especially death – in the face.

Good for Bautista! Terrific actor.

"This is true?" a disbelieving Carey said after learning about Blue Origin's all-female flight.

Mariah Carey might be a star, but she has no interest in going to space — even if Katy Perry recently did, not that Mimi had heard anything about it.


	In a memorable moment from her interview with BBC Radio 2 posted Thursday (Aug. 7), Carey learns for the very first time that Perry was part of Blue Origin's first-ever all-female trip past the Earth's atmosphere, despite the event being all over the news in April. “Did she go to space? Where'd she go?” the Songbird Supreme asks after the interviewer brings it up.

	











	“Into orbit and back?” Carey continues in her characteristically reserved manner. “She's like, floating in the … And this is true? Wow. All right, Katy. I'm not mad at her, that's pretty amazing.”


	When asked whether she'd ever take a trip to the stars, Carey had a hilariously snarky response. “I think I've done enough,” she said simply.


	Though Mimi missed it, Perry's journey to space was widely publicized this past spring. She was one of several women who flew approximately 62 miles above Earth on a rocket trip organized by Jeff Bezos' space tech company, riding the line between the atmosphere and outer space before coming back down after about 10 minutes.


	The expedition was also widely criticized at the time, with some people calling it a waste of resources. Perry, however, described it as an empowering step forward for women, telling press shortly after she touched down, “It's about making space for future women and taking up space and belonging … this is all for the benefit of Earth.”

	











	Keeping her feet planted firmly on the ground, Carey is more focused on blasting off on a new album era as opposed to in a rocket ship. The star will release Here for It All in September, following singles “Type Dangerous” and “Sugar Sweet” featuring Kehlani and Shenseea.

The "Lost Americana" singer dropped in to "Jenna and Friends" on Thursday morning (Aug. 7) to talk about his new album and being a dad again.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



MGK is in full-court promo mode in the lead-up to Friday's (Aug. 8) release of his Lost Americana album. But during a visit to Today With Jenna and Friends on Thursday morning (Aug. 6), co-host Jenna Bush Hager and Las Culturistas co-host Matt Rogers were initially more focused on talking about babies. The pair surprised Kelly with a onesie for his newborn with ex Megan Fox, Saga Blade, featuring the logo of her show, before asking him what kind of dad he is.


	Wondering how life is with the nearly five-month-old, Kelly responded, “It's awesome,” adding, “I wanna detract any of, like, the congrats to me and just move it to Megan because she really does all the work. I keep getting called, like, the ‘Music Teacher.'” He also laughed about someone calling him a “good dad” recently because he was simply holding little Saga, while Fox was “fuming” off to the side about the praise for what he joked was his bare minimum help.

	











	“She is the one… I just play the guitar and hope and pray that the baby is happy,” said MGK, 35, who wore ripped jeans, a stripped T-shirt and a white Lost Americana baseball hat for the occasion. 




	Kelly also gave an update on his daughter from a previous relationship, Casie, who celebrated her 16th birthday last month. Asked if she's working on getting her driver's license, Kelly said there was some paperwork snafu, which means she can't get her permit until September at the earliest. “Either way, she'll get hers before mine, I still don't have mine,” he said, laughing that he expects Casie to drive him to the bank when she gets her permit considering he's picked up all the bills so far.


	Getting back to album promo, MGK said he's planning to do some more small-capacity pop-up shows next week for fans after inviting 300 diehards to join him at Cellar Dog in New York's West Village on Tuesday (Aug. 5) for an intimate gig where he debuted the new “Semi-Charmed Life”-interpolating song “Starman.” He also noted that he was planning to announce a tour a few month ago, but due to what he dubbed the “gnarly” recession and the bumper-crop of other acts on the road, he decided to hold off for now.


	“I inevitably have to announce a tour because I know that is a service to my fans,” he said before showing Hager and Rogers his killer hula hoop skills.

The chance to speak with Hideo Kojima is not totally unlike meeting a world leader. Alternately — extending this metaphor another way — talking to him while activity at Kojima Productions buzzes in the background over a video interview suggests having a peek inside a spy agency. 

The video game auteur, whose Tokyo studio is visited by everybody from Conan O'Brien to Timothée Chalamet, has just released “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” the sequel to 2019's “Death Stranding” and his second consecutive work that does more to break from the medium's confines than anything I could name. “On the Beach” is an especially bold step towards the cinematic, with a cast (Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, George Miller, Guillermo del Toro, Luca Marinelli, Nicolas Winding Refn, Elle Fanning, and Fatih Akin) far closer to a major festival lineup than animated characters in a video game.

Even if IndieWire's own David Ehrlich hadn't claimed “Death Stranding 2” was a “mega-bizarre masterpiece,” Kojima is a figure who deserves time and attention. Speaking as someone who'd write out the absurdly convoluted “Metal Gear Solid” chronology while bored in middle-school math, the opportunity was not to be taken lightly. When I called into Kojima Productions last week, the director was taking a break from his next projects: “OD,” a horror game co-written with Jordan Peele and starring Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier; and “Physint,” a stealth action game that has already kicked up rumors of a lead role for Robert Pattinson. Questions about those were — surprise — immediately deflected, but “Death Stranding 2” offered sufficient fodder for discussion.

 










This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Indiewire: It's Tuesday in Tokyo, and “Death Stranding 2” has been out for exactly a month. What are you working on today?

Hideo Kojima: Well, I'm checking the data of the players all over the world — what kind of weapons they're using, the routes they're taking, all this data. And I also see these small bugs here and there, so I'm deciding where to fix and what to fix. I also am starting to work with the team on “OD” because that's a new project, and also doing “Physint” all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage. So I'm doing that. And also I have all these interviews every day, and also promotional — photo-shootings, things like that — so I don't feel like I've finished the title, to be frank.

No work of art is ever truly flawless or perfect. I wonder how you feel about having this after-the-fact ability to improve your own work. That's a unique opportunity compared with filmmakers who can't necessarily go back to fix flaws in their films. Do you feel a game ever is emboldened because of its flaws?

There are some things that you shouldn't change. Like the story, for example, because there is a certain era that that story was born. You shouldn't change those kinds of parts. Or, you know, like [George] Lucas changed [‘Star Wars'] to all CG, but that's because it's a new era, right? So I don't want to change anything that would affect the era that it first came out. The things that I said that I'm changing are, you know, all the things basically related to gameplay. Like: This item was not very easy to use, so I'll make it a little bit more accessible, or, like, make the UI bigger. These small parts are the ones that I'm changing. I know that DLC [downloadable content] is not a trendy space because if you start doing that, you'll never finish the project.

 










“Death Stranding 2” is maybe your most confidently directed work, and I'm fascinated by how your style has reached a kind of minimalism since the later “Metal Gear Solid” games. The cutscenes tend to be shorter, the shots longer, the visual style more fluid.

“DS1,” there were a lot of long cutscenes, yes, because it was supposed to start slow, right, and to explain everything — it was slow — but I see a lot of people discontinuing watching the cutscenes from “DS1” by stats. Because, for me, cutscenes are part of the game. Some people don't even think about that, but I believe cutscenes are part of the game. So what I do is: I have these bunches of cutscenes, games, and events, and I lay them out and really change through the play-through — like, I change the length of the cutscene if the cutscene, I feel, is too long. The rhythm is very important. I check the rhythm of the game, and I kind of change everything. So maybe, you know, that's one reason. I even change it after taking the motion after sessions with the actors, and I kind of adjust the balance of that rhythm, as I said, and I think it's becoming better because of that.

What tech advancements affected your directorial style in recent years — is it the reliability of A-list acting talent, smaller cameras that allow for more movement and set-ups, or something else altogether?
 










During the pandemic, we held performance-capture sessions at the Sony studio in L.A. We had the actors arrive on set in L.A, but our staff was restricted from traveling abroad. I had to direct from Tokyo. Those were the rules by Sony at the time. Reluctantly, I was forced to direct from afar. We used smartphones, Zoom, iPads, and multiple cameras for the remote session. I protested and said it was impossible, but I was told that all other studios were also doing it remotely and that I would need to follow the same rules. To test out the remote session, we tried out two scenes that didn't require the main characters. The results were quite disastrous. I couldn't grasp the spatial dynamics of the set, like the positioning of the virtual cameras, the actors' movements, and directing their performance; it felt hopeless. I thought I wouldn't be able to shoot. 

That's when I reached out to the development team about a system called “Mado” [“Window” in English] at Sony headquarters. I borrowed two of them and set them up — one in Tokyo, the other in L.A. It's like a giant smartphone the size of a door. The two were synced and allowed for two-way communication of both footage and sound. On the other side of the screen, we could see life-sized actors. Though it was through a screen, we were able to communicate with each other as if we were standing outside each other's window. We were able to overcome that period by fully utilizing that technology.

 










Can you talk a bit about what that remote work looked like, and how you feel your direction benefits from being in person with your actors?

Well, even though I have, like, 20 cameras on this side and that side as well, it was really difficult to describe the stage and the set in its direction. Like, for instance, me directly saying, “OK, you act from here to there. You walk from here to there.” It's impossible to just say “here to there.” They won't know where from where. For instance, if I were talking to the actor on the spot in the scene — like Norman [Reedus] — I had to say, “Hey, Norman, you walk from here all the way up to Léa and you say this line,” and things like that, it's so difficult to explain that if you're not there. Although I could see, because we set up so many cameras, it's so difficult to explain the position physically at just one point. [Laughs] I couldn't wrap it up as though I was in the scene — I was just through the camera, and that was so difficult.

You talked about how the quality of an actor's facial scan between “Death Stranding” and “On the Beach” improved significantly — specifically how Léa Seydoux's face is now more lifelike, more vivid. Did seeing stronger face work engender anything in a rewriting process? If you watch these scenes and understand you can actually gather more emotion from Léa or Elle Fanning or Norman Reedus, than you had understood while you were initially writing a scene.
 










Yes, I do that a lot. I even did during shooting as well. Like, for instance, Léa's smoking scene — that was not initially in it, and I had it added. [Laughs] As you know, we've been working with 3Lateral, and the rigs of the facial have really upgraded, and we could do a lot of facial expressions — very subtle ones as well — so I kind of even changed the scenes where I take out some lines because facial expressions could be covered, and I kind of make that decision on the spot. Even the lighting: I kind of asked a lighting technician, a professional lighting technician, to come to teach the staff about lighting in general, so we took, like, a healthy two years to learn all of this about all of this — about all the lights and things like that. So that could have an influence, too. [Laughs]

You've often talked about blurring boundaries between cinema and video games. What is the greatest struggle in doing so? Outside the obvious matter of interactivity, where are the media most incompatible?

In film, the creator controls the timeline. They can choose exactly what images to show, what performances to present, and what sounds to let the audience hear. Everything is delivered the way the creator wants. But with games, that's not possible except in cutscenes. The creator has no control over the timeline — the player decides everything. Sometimes, players might even skip important scenes. The creator has no say in that. That's where games differ from films. And from theater, too — in theater, you're free to look wherever you want, but the timeline remains controlled. In games, you can view the stage from any angle and even walk away midway. In other words, creators can't calculate or plan everything because it all depends on the player's actions. Films are about showing a series of carefully curated images, but you can't approach games with the same mindset. I think that's where it creates a sense of uncertainty for both the performers and the director.

 










There's also the issue of recording time. Unlike films, where you can concentrate on the shoot over a period of three to six months, that kind of intensive schedule is difficult for games. Game development involves filming little by little as you go — maybe like a week each month, sometimes with long gaps in between. For “DS2,” the entire process took about three years. That makes it a very challenging environment for the actors. Scheduling is difficult, too. Sometimes there's been a long gap since the last session, and the actor must recall the emotional tone from the previous performance.

“On the Beach” continues the narrative arcs and themes of “Death Stranding” very fluidly. That's surprising because you've been very honest that a lot of the game was rewritten amid COVID-19. But you've never revealed the original plot. Now that we're some time away from “Death Stranding 2” and people like myself have actually been able to play it, are you at any liberty or desire or comfort to say how the original version of the game would have differed?

[Laughs] Well, I found the initial concept sheet, actually. I have to say a big theme of “DS2,” or the direction, hasn't really changed, but the story — or the ending — has changed after the pandemic, yes. The first half seems quite similar to the original one, but from the middle point onwards, I kind of rewrote a lot. You know, all these lines that were newly created are actually spoken by the President [Alastair Duncan] at the end — or what Die-Hardman [Tommie Earl Jenkins] says at the end. This is what I was thinking during the pandemic, and I put that in there. So that's a big change.

 










Do you expressly prefer keeping something like a concept sheet tucked away and letting the game exist as it does? One of your favorite films is “Blade Runner,” and part of its mythology is the question of whether or not Deckard is a replicant, right? But that's something that only came about because Ridley Scott, decades later, would admit it. I wonder if you have a similar interest in sharing alternate versions of your work.

[Laughs] No, I don't feel like I should say those things. I have my conclusion. I have my, you know, things that I thought about, but if I confess that, it won't probably be art anymore. For instance, if I drew a drawing of an apple and I put that in a museum and I say “this is an apple,” but all the people who saw it, it doesn't matter if they think it's an apple or a banana. But if I say, “No, no, no, what are you saying? I drew an apple,” I shouldn't say that. Well, Ridley Scott is an exception. He's a Sir, right? He could say whatever he wants.

Is there something that you look for or see in an actor, in a live-action context, that tells you they could convincingly deliver a motion-capture performance? If it's something in their face, their voice, their body language. Because I think you might be the only person who's ever watched Luca Marinelli and said, “He should be in a video game.” Or is it as simple as one form of acting translating to another?
 










Well, I don't really regard them as being “in the game.” I just look for actors who are good — like, they're good in terms of the looks or the emotion, their expression, their acting. And when I think of a character in my game, I think of, “OK, who should I cast?” And those people come up. At the same time, we take one step of changing them to CG, so they have to really be individualistic. You see what I mean? We take one cushion, as a CG, until we put them in their performance. Then what I do is: I talk to them directly. And if it matches, I talk to their agents. So I think it's the same as, you know, casting in the movies. Every time I talk with Guillermo del Toro or Nicholas Winding Refn, we always talk about, “Oh, who's coming? Oh, did you see that movie? Did you see his acting? Did you see her acting?” It's kind of the same with even these movie directors. So I regard myself as no different than how I cast in other people as well.

Are there any deceased actors who you think might have fit your worlds and sensibility? 

That would be my childhood hero, Steve McQueen. If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday. In my games, I've featured film directors whom I know personally or greatly respect. In fact, I had always hoped to cast David Lynch, a director I've admired for so long. However, he passed away not long ago, and I'm devastated.

 










Some have compared your games to the work of Thomas Pynchon, who even went so far as to mention you in “Bleeding Edge.” Are you familiar with Pynchon's work, and has it served as any kind of influence on you as a writer?

Yes, I know Thomas Pynchon and read, and acknowledge that I was in one of his writings. Yes. But I don't really get the point where I'm “influenced”; I don't really think about it, actually.

Well, that answers the question. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule; it's very appreciated.

Also, I want to add that I do admire Thomas Pynchon as well. [Laughs] I like his writing, so don't, you know… don't get confused about that. Don't say that I'm not influenced by him or anything like that! Because I do admire him.

“Death Stranding 2: On the Beach” is now available on PlayStation 5.

The Office's Oscar can't believe he's found himself back in front of the same documentary team that followed him around for years at Dunder Mifflin, in the official trailer for the sitcom's spin-off, The Paper.  


	Reprising his role as the exasperated accountant, Oscar (played by actor Oscar Nunez) wants no part in the crew's latest project. “Not again. I'm not agreeing to any of this,” he exclaims, storming away from the cameras. “I will make this unusable — fuck. Use that.”


	The new show, which premieres on Sept. 4 on Peacock, follows new editor-in-chief Ned Sampson's (Domhnall Gleeson) ambitions to revitalize a sleepy Midwest town's struggling newspaper, the Toledo Truth Teller. 


	It seems he has his work cut out for him, as his team of hesitant reporters admits the closest they've come to working at a legitimate paper was writing essays in middle school, posting on social media, and being part of a group text message. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Have you read this paper? How do you think it compares to any other paper?” a staffer, played by Chelsea Frei, asks Gleeson's character. “It sucks,” he immediately replies. “But we are going to make it better.”

	Co-created by The Office's Greg Daniels and Nathan For You's Michael Koman, The Paper will premiere with four episodes on Sept. 4, followed by two new episodes every Thursday until the season finale on Sept. 25.

Filmmaker Kayci Lacob knew she wanted to capture everything about growing up in the heart of Silicon Valley during the early-2000s tech boom for her directorial debut. She also knew that her first film deserved to be in theaters, and so Lacob did what most established auteurs are still hesitant to do (other than Francis Ford Coppola with “Megalopolis”): She is self-distributing her debut “Everything to Me” for a theatrical run and “betting” on audiences to buy tickets.

“Everything to Me” isn't without star power. “The Haunting of Hill House,” “Ponyboi,” and “You” actress Victoria Pedretti leads the film as Claudia, a woman reflecting on her career trajectory and life choices years after aspiring to be the next Steve Jobs as a Stanford freshman (Abigail Donaghy plays a younger version of the character). But this isn't an Elizabeth Holmes story gone awry: “Everything to Me” is more “Lady Bird” than “The Dropout.”

The synopsis reads: “Set in early-2000s Silicon Valley, ‘Everything to Me' follows a precocious teen determined to become the next Steve Jobs. But once she makes it to Stanford, she discovers that real life is more complicated than any product launch. As adulthood sets in, she's forced to reconsider what success really means — and maybe even laugh at her younger self along the way.” 

 










Indie icon Judy Greer co-stars, along with Lola Flanery, Utkarsh Ambudkar, and Rich Sommer. The feature was previously titled “The Book of Jobs.”

Writer/director Lacob counts fellow Northern California native and “Lady Bird” helmer Greta Gerwig among her filmmaking “heroes.” And while Gerwig's “Barbie” proved that women are a massive theater-going audience, female directors have still scrambled in the indie space to find funding, let alone theatrical distribution. Lacob is redefining — and to use Silicon Valley tech speak, disrupting — the path for first-time filmmakers by self-distributing the theatrical release of “Everything to Me.”

“We decided to self-distribute this movie through Concourse Media for a theatrical run by betting on our audience,” Lacob told IndieWire. “We are running a grassroots marketing campaign to try to get the word out to teens and millennial women, and hope that this leads to a sale to a studio or streamer.” 

Lacob added that, after witnessing the reception to the feature on the festival circuit at Mill Valley, Sarasota, and more, she knew she could leverage the fandom to secure a buyer later — and even believe in herself more along the way.

“Each and every screening made it clearer that teen girls and young women loved this film,” Lacob said. “But getting noticed by buyers is a whole other ballgame. We decided to leverage this fandom, this love and momentum by girls, and ride it. Have them help carry us to buyers.”

 










The Gerwig (and all of the Coppolas, from Francis to Sofia to “Palo Alto” helmer Gia) comparisons don't stop there. Lacob is ready to be synonymous with Bay Area Gen-Zers and millennials: “My goal is to be my generation's storyteller of Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area,” she said.

As young Gen-Z women are funding the reopening of almost century-old theaters and bypassing large studios to ensure theatrical debuts, it seems as though the next generation of female filmmakers are dedicated to preserving the future of theatergoing more than anyone.

Below, director Lacob unpacks her critically acclaimed “Everything to Me” and shares with IndieWire why she was determined to release the film in theaters without waiting for a studio. 

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: As a fellow Bay Area native, what inspired the story of “Everything to Me”? And what went into the decision to have it set in the early 2000s?Kayci Lacob: Despite being the backdrop for movies such as “Dirty Harry,” “The Rock,” “Zodiac,” “The Game,” and several other action/adventure thrillers, we've never seen a film about what it's like to actually grow up here, especially from a female perspective. There were two huge influences bearing down on me, outside of my family, that led to this film. One was the Bay Area itself, which I view almost as its own character in my upbringing. This place has soul and is a part of who I am; it really shaped my view on the world. Part of this is because I grew up in a really special time, right at the change of the millennium.  The other was Steve Jobs. There have been many eccentric and prolific innovators in Silicon Valley who have changed the world, but Steve was an entity all his own. It seemed as though he was creating technology, movies, music, and stores just for me. Being surrounded by all of this created both significant challenges and beautiful opportunities for those of us who grew up there. Plus, it was also fun! Before the millennial minimalism aesthetic took over, our world was colorful and changing constantly. We were living in a cautionary tale, but we were also there for the dawn of the digital age. I wanted a movie that captured all of these emotions, partially because I wasn't even aware of it all while it was happening. It was just life. When did you realize this story was what you wanted to make as your debut feature?As a young hopeful filmmaker, I turned to my heroes: Greta Gerwig, Tina Fey, Sofia Coppola, Richard Linklater, the list goes on. They all began their careers with a coming-of-age story that set the stage for their point-of-view, how they see the world. I knew that I wanted to follow in their footsteps. The problem was, in my mid-twenties, I was still having a lot of trouble identifying what my perspective was and how I wanted to be seen. Much like our adult Claudia in the film, I had to turn back and look at my life, my experiences, and where I'm from to try to answer the questions, “Who am I and what do I want to say?” It was through this exploration that Claudia's story started to take shape.We can all look back at a slate of movies by a single filmmaker and think that their journey was deliberate, that they knew exactly who they were and what they wanted to say about the world from the get-go. For some of them, that very well may be the case, but some of us learn our voice and our view of the world as we go, and then connect the dots in hindsight. 

 










How long was the film in development? This film was in development for about two-and-a-half years before we had everyone assembled on set and a real movie was underway. But if you asked me more philosophically, I'd say this was in development for 26 years, from the time I was born until the first word was written on the page. Every experience I had, every time I doubted myself, reinvented my personality, changed my goals and got closer to the truth of who I am, I was writing a piece of this story. And if I'm being honest, I don't think I'm even halfway there! The difference now is, I'm finally OK with that.The “Everything to Me” cast is a who's-who of indie icons. How did you land your rising stars and also connect with Victoria Pedretti and Judy Greer?I'm still in awe that my name shows up next to theirs on this film. I am so fortunate to have worked with these legends, especially on my debut. We knew from the beginning that we wanted to discover the new “It” group of young actors to shine in this film alongside some real heavyweights who could connect with audiences of all ages. Victoria brings a wisdom and intensity to every role she plays, which was absolutely how we wanted our adult Claudia to present. Victoria is a real artist. 

To have a true queen of the screen like Judy Greer on board was nothing short of a dream come true. That was the most sensitive role to cast for me personally, and once we spoke to Judy and her warmth and strength emanated so organically, I felt that the part was in capable hands.Finding our “teens” was a fun part of the whole process, and they made it easy for us. We knew once we saw them. The only real challenge was casting four actresses to play the same role at different life stages (a difficult task I wouldn't recommend to a future first-time filmmaker!). But the Donaghy sisters came into our lives and made it all possible. All of our “teens” were such a joy and brought endless energy and passion to set every day. It was a fairly quick shoot (22 days), but they all bonded so quickly. It really felt like I was a high school teacher corralling my students who were all already best friends. 

What advice would you give to first-time directors, especially young women?
 










I'm going to borrow the advice that my producer, Tom Nunan, gave to me before we started filming: Vulnerability is our greatest superpower. Don't pretend you know everything. I was always fearful of being treated like a wallflower or worse, that people would think I had no right to be there. There's this pressure as a young woman to assert yourself so that you're taken seriously. But there's a difference between confidence and total control. You need to be confident in your vision while being completely open and honest about what you don't know. The worst thing you can do is get to set and pretend you know everything so that you appear like a strong leader. Always ask for help when you need it. Good people will want to help. I remember on our very first day shooting, right before our first take of our first scene. I was sweating and shaking, wondering when everyone was going to figure out that I was a fraud, or if they already knew. I came across a meme of a foal wearing a flower crown with the words, “This actually is my first rodeo, and I'm very scared.” I showed it to Tom, and he loved it. He said to own that. As long as I knew what I wanted, that's what mattered.One more piece of advice that I can't emphasize enough for a young filmmaker, especially a young woman, is to surround yourself with the best talent possible. This is advice for life, not just film. You should never be the smartest person in the room. Find people who are experts at what they do, and who share your vision. For me, that was Tom Nunan (producer), Shasta Spahn (director of photography), O'Shay Brooks (production designer), Lily Trotter (casting director), Stephanie Economou (composer), Matt McBrayer (editor), and Randy Wayne and Talia Bella (executive producers). Nothing great is made by a single person. 

What is the path for distribution as an indie filmmaker? Why did you decide on the festival circuit, and are you hoping for a theatrical run as opposed to streaming? The indie path isn't for the faint of heart. It's tough out there, and made even tougher by the fact that there's no clear single route to success. For us, it was a lot of trial and error, and re-strategizing. We did a full festival circuit last fall and spring. We were celebrated at a number of lovely festivals and won a couple of them. But it's difficult to stand out. We had this insane cast, a visionary DP, incredible score and music, a relentless sales agent, you name it. Better yet, each and every screening made it clearer that teen girls and young women loved this film. But getting noticed by buyers is a whole other ballgame. We decided to leverage this fandom, this love and momentum by girls, and ride it. Have them help carry us to buyers.We decided to self-distribute this movie through Concourse Media for a theatrical run by betting on our audience. We are running a grassroots marketing campaign to try to get the word out to teens and millennial women, and hope that this leads to a sale to a studio or streamer. Plus, it is every filmmaker's dream to see their movie on the big screen in theaters. Much like Claudia, I decided not to wait around for somebody to offer this. We're going out and making it happen ourselves!What do you hope audiences take away from “Everything to Me”?

This movie is about the drive for excellence and the fear of being ordinary, and finding your own voice amidst all that. I love obsessive characters, and I hope audiences connect with a piece of that in this story. I've had grown men come up to me after watching this movie and tell me how much they resonated with Claudia. I was like, “Really? You, a man in your fifties, connected to a 15-year-old girl growing up in Silicon Valley?” But that's the thing about movies. Those details don't really matter as long as it feels authentic. People connect with the truth. 

Concourse Media is distributing “Everything to Me” in theaters on Friday, September 5. Check out the trailer below.

It didn't take long before Dionne Warwick called him out.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Piers Morgan has caused a stir online with a recent string of posts about Beyoncé, whom the British TV personality jokingly accused of “cultural appropriation” in a Marilyn Monroe-esque Levi's photo shoot.  


	It all started with a Wednesday (Aug. 6) post on X, in which Morgan shared a photo of the pop superstar modeling Levi's denim and sporting bouncy blonde curls. “Very disappointed to see Beyoncé culturally appropriate Marilyn Monroe in her new Levi's ad,” the media personality wrote.

	











	It wasn't long before people came to Bey's defense in the replies, lambasting Morgan for dissing the 35-time Grammy winner and misusing the term “cultural appropriation,” as the late actress was a person and not a culture. Morgan, however, continued stirring the pot, sharing an old photo of himself with Bey and writing, “I would say I can't believe anyone took my obvious Beyoncé joke post seriously … but I forgot the woke brigade have zero sense of humour.” 


	And in response to one commenter who said that the Destiny's Child alum is “hotter” than the late Hollywood icon, Morgan said, “I don't disagree.”


Billboard has reached out to Bey's rep for comment.


	This is far from the first time Morgan has sparked discourse by making inflammatory remarks on his social media accounts, or on his show Uncensored. He's also not the only person who's had something to say about Bey's campaign with Levi's, with Megyn Kelly recently dissing it as “artificial, fake, enhanced [and] trying too hard” while praising Sydney Sweeney's widely criticized American Eagle jeans commercials.

	











	But while Kelly was being totally serious with her comments, Morgan has asserted that he was just joking in his post about Bey. In response to iconic singer Dionne Warwick commenting that he was “getting involved in women's business again,” he wrote, “Oh not you too, Dionne… it was a JOKE!”


	That said, Morgan did double down on a controversial take. “I think the whole concept of ‘cultural appropriation' is bulls–t,” he added on Wednesday. “What's wrong with celebrating another country's fashion, food etc?”


	The back-and-forth comes about 10 months after the last notable time Morgan got himself in trouble with the BeyHive. In October, the British contrarian invited singer-songwriter Jaguar Wright onto Uncensored and aired her claims that Bey and Jay-Z were “monsters” with “hundreds of victims,” shortly after which the famous couple's lawyers denied the allegations and demanded that Morgan remove them from the episode. 


	The show host obliged, telling viewers at the time, “There are legal limits on us, too … We apologize to Jay-Z and Beyoncé.”


	Beyoncé has not commented on any of the drama surrounding her Levi's campaign, which has been ongoing since last year. She and the fashion brand recently released a new commercial showcasing the star trading in her horse for a motorcycle, something many fans believe was a hint that her next LP will be a rock album.

THR's TV Producer of the Year offers an Rx for what's ailing the industry and candidly examines the high highs (‘The West Wing') and bizarre lows (racist ‘E.R.' notes) of his own spectacularly prolific career.


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


	Since he got his start in Hollywood nearly 40 years ago, John Wells has averaged more successes per decade than most creatives accumulate over an entire career.


	The prolific writer, director, producer and filmmaker's latest feat is The Pitt, a real-time medical drama that spans one 12-hour emergency room shift in a 15-episode season. Reuniting Wells with former ER collaborators R. Scott Gemmill and Noah Wyle, the HBO Max procedural launched unexpectedly into the zeitgeist with its January premiere ­­— thanks in part to weekly drops (how novel!) that saw the audience quickly pass 10 million per episode. This is hardly Wells' first time scrubbing in for TV. He cut his teeth writing on China Beach, then developed ER with the late Michael Crichton and co-created Third Watch. Along the way, he also made the U.S. version of Shameless, directed four films (including the celebrated adaptation of August: Osage County) and ran a little series called The West Wing.

	Riding high on The Pitt‘s 13 Emmy nominations and the summer dominance of the Eric Bana Netflix breakout Untamed (already renewed), the power producer and two-time WGA West president sat down at his Hollywood office in July to talk about the future of his latest hit, his concerns for the industry and the wildest exchanges he's had with the standards and practices department.


The Pitt, as a format, is a bit of an experiment. What did you learn in season one that you're applying to season two?


	The first year of the show, you've introduced the characters — which takes up a lot of screen time. What propels the show now is the immediacy, the urgency of being in this setting with what's happening in American health care right now. And that's only getting more dramatic because these Medicaid reductions are going to directly hit the urban and rural hospitals delivering primary care. It's just going to get worse.

	











As for the characters you've introduced, you made a bit of news with the departure of Tracy Ifeachor. What went into that decision?


	Look, the show is set at a teaching hospital. And if you're a fourth-year resident in a teaching hospital, your time there is done at the end of that year. Not to scare any of the other castmembers, but people don't stay at these hospitals forever. They're going to roll off, and that will be part of the evolution of the show. We're not committed to doing a year every season as we go on, but we can't say that we're going to be true to the medicine and teaching hospitals and maintain the same cast for the entire time.


So you're planning large time jumps between seasons?


	Because we're only doing one day over the course of a season, we could do the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the same week. But we're not. We're going to be jumping. From the fall in the first season to the Fourth of July for the second. The beginning of the residency year usually starts on July 1, so everybody will have moved up and there'll be new people coming in.


What is lost and what is gained in telling a story this way? You and Noah obviously worked on ER together, where you could get slow-burn relationship drama like you had with George Clooney and Julianna Margulies.


	One of the advantages is we are not able to play medical melodrama in the sense of long-term relationship issues. You're dropping in on people at a specific day and time, so you may discover that somebody's been having a relationship. And it may be a crisis point in that relationship on that particular day. Having written or been involved in the writing or writing 70-ish episodes of China Beach, 332 episodes of ER and another 170 episodes of Third Watch, we've written a lot of medical melodrama. Part of my first conversation with Scott and Noah was that we don't really want to tell those stories anymore. This is not where you're going to get your romantic Dr. Ross and Nurse Hathaway story, and it's a bit liberating.

	











China Beach has never been on streaming hasn't it?


	We are trying still to get China Beach going! I was a writer on that show, it was Bill Broyles and John Young who created it. The problem is that it was filled with Motown music, and the cost for getting that is high. There are a number of shows from that time period caught in that same issue. Warner Brothers has tried and gotten closer, but it really should be steaming.


Last time we spoke, you said that the most troubling recent conversation you've had with an executive was about shooting outside of L.A. What else worries you?


	The lack of big swings. It's a very dangerous moment in the industry. So many people have been let go. So many executives are no longer executives. So many people are out in the marketplace looking for work. And that has had a chilling effect on taking risks, especially since shows have gotten more and more expensive. People are frightened in the executive ranks. It takes tremendous courage to say to somebody, “Go make this show, here's $60 million for 15 episodes or $80 million for eight episodes.”


So what can someone in your position do about it? 


	We have to be aware of how much these shows are going to cost while we're writing them. You have to be thinking how you're going to produce the show before you even sell it. Otherwise, somebody is going tell you to make it in Budapest.

	











When did that become part of the job?


	When everything exploded, and we were making so many shows with not a lot of concern about how much those shows were costing. It was out of control. A lot of people made a lot of money. And that's great. But we're on the other side now, and [studios] went from wanting it to be under $10 million an episode to under $8 million to $6 million.


How would you define a big swing in this marketplace? Is it Donald Glover shooting Mr. & Mrs. Smith all over Europe or adapting big IP?


	I don't necessarily mean a big financial swing. And is that actually what the audience is watching? I have kids in their 20s, and they want to know how many episodes there are going to be if they get involved with something. They don't want six or seven episodes. They're like, “Are there 100 episodes of this?”


One thing I don't think gets enough attention is how harmful the delays between seasons can be to audience relationships with the material. Is it important for you to get The Pitt back on the air as soon as possible? 


	I completely agree. How am I supposed to keep a fandom with something when I can't even remember what happened two and a half years later? We're essentially returning the exact same day that we premiered. It will be the eighth of January — 365 days later. And with all due respect to all of my friends who make TV, there is no reason these shows can't be on every year. These delays are becoming even more conspicuous now that the series load is diminishing. It was so crowded that you could almost use that as an excuse.

	











In this trepidatious if not fearful marketplace, what are buyers looking for right now? What are you hearing that people want? 


	I keep hearing that people want The Pitt. (Laughs.) People want shows that can come back on a regular basis with a strong cast and at a number that makes sense for the studio and platform that's doing it. That's nothing new, but it seems like we're having to rediscover it again as if we hadn't all known this for a long time.


What other trends have you noticed? 


	Netflix is trying to build this huge library because they don't have one. And everybody is suspicious now that everybody else is selling stuff to them again. Animal Kingdom was the No. 3 show on Netflix the other day. That was a good show. We had a good time making it, but it's also been available on Amazon ever since we were on the air. Shameless was on Showtime for years. Then Warners sold [the library] to Netflix in our year five or six. It turned into a huge hit on Netflix. We had been winding down and ended up doing five more years because of that. Ask somebody who made Shameless and they'll probably tell you Netflix.


Speaking of Shameless, you cast Jeremy Allen White in his breakthrough role. He's kind of a big thing now.


	He was 18, just out of high school. He showed up, did a fantastic job and then stayed the entire 11 years. I couldn't be happier for him. A similar thing happened with George Clooney. We cast him, and that first year he's “the sexiest man alive.” But he stuck around for his entire five-year contract, and he never asked for a raise. I've been very fortunate to work with a lot of people like that. Noah, of course. Regina King on Southland. Watching her success has been fantastic.

	











Who are the executives you've had the best experiences with?


	There have been a lot of great creative partners. It sounds funny now, but the three executives on ER were David Nevins, John Landgraf and Kevin Reilly. Jinny Howe worked as my assistant before she ran television here. Now she's head of drama at Netflix. But TV exec is a really, really hard job. Warren Littlefield was at NBC when we were making those shows, and I watched him just get beat to hell. Pounded over and over for having good taste. When I was at ABC, Brandon Stoddard literally lost his job for putting Twin Peaks, China Beach and thirtysomething on the air. They fired him for being too elite.


What's some bullshit that you had to deal with back then that you'd never have to deal with now? Not because of your stature but because of how things work.


	Liz Meriwether was surprised that I still get notes, and I want to dissuade anyone from thinking that having had success means that the job itself changes substantially. It gives you more credibility in responding to notes, but it does not change the amount coming in. But I really appreciate not dealing with standards and practices on a daily basis anymore. It's fear-based and doesn't respect the audience's intelligence and sophistication.


What are some of the more infuriating ones? 












	I had huge discussions during the ER days about racial storylines. “Could this Black character actually kiss this white character?” This in 1998! I was like, “Guys, what are we even talking about?” A big storyline we did in the third season of ER was Gloria Reuben's character being HIV positive. There were real conversations where they said, “So, she's going to survive? Should she survive?” It's HIV. It's terrifying. But there were already many, many people in the world dealing with it. And to suggest that anybody who becomes infected dies, that's not the message that we wanted moving through the world.


You've been coy on this, but there must be a line you're not willing to cross on The Pitt in terms of the graphic medical stuff. 


	We want nothing to be gratuitous, and it's only what the doctors would really see. We don't want to do emergency medicine porn, where we're just daring the audience to watch.


Do you have any squeamish people on staff?


	I'm squeamish about eyes. I just shot the first episode of season two, and there's an eye thing. I said, “Do I have to do the eye one?”


With distance from it now, how do you look back on the experience of Aaron Sorkin quitting The West Wing in season five and leaving you on the hook to keep it going?


	That was not what I was planning to do that year. (Laughs.) Professionally, as a writer, that was the hardest thing. It's not like we didn't still have a great staff in place, but at that point it was widely considered to be the best show on television — though there's certainly people who'd argue for The Sopranos. And I might argue that for some of the episodes, for sure. But it was pressure. We went back in the writers room, looked at each other, and I said, “Aaron doesn't have any idea about where the story goes, so we're just going to do the best that we can and hope that the audience would come along.” And they did. I would never argue that I wrote an episode as good as Aaron or rose to those same heights, but I was proud that we maintained that show.

	











Many actors, and even Aaron, occasionally tease reviving that show. Do you think there's a way to do it?


	Aaron and I have talked about it a number of times. My worry — and never say never — has always been that when the show existed, it was not perceived as one-sided. It was clearly liberal, but it wasn't progressive. It was actually very centrist. What's happening now, that's not the world in which it was written, so I'd be worried that it would be perceived as a statement. What the show was trying to do is highlight the sacrifice in public service, that these people are really good, well-meaning people, and I don't think anybody would let us do that in this polarized climate.


You've launched many shows over the years. You've made a lot of movies. What's a misfire that you think should have done better?


	Ten years ago, I did a pilot at Fox with Krista Vernoff. While we were casting, I was in London, where I'd been asked to watch this small film for some other reason. But there was this young woman in it, and I thought, “Oh, she'd be perfect for our show.” It was Florence Pugh! She was only 18 years old, and we brought her over to shoot this pilot. She was incredible. It was the biggest shock when they didn't pick it up.


What about something that made it to air? 


	We did a show called Smith [in 2006] with Ray Liotta and Virginia Madsen for CBS. Great cast. I really loved it, but no one showed up. They only aired three episodes. I don't want to say “ahead of its time,” but it was very violent for a broadcast network at the time. And it was a show about the bad guys.

	











That show was dark. CBS might not have been the place for it. 


	Les Moonves later told me that it definitely was not. (Laughs.)

	Dean Cain, who played Superman on Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman from 1993 to 1997, has announced his latest career pivot: becoming an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.


	“I will be sworn in as an ICE agent A.S.A.P.,” he said during an appearance on Fox News' Jesse Watters Primetime. Cain was sworn in as a reserve police officer in Idaho in 2018, then again as a reserve deputy sheriff in Virginia in 2022. “We have a broken immigration system. Congress needs to fix it, but in the interim, President Trump ran on this. He is delivering on this. This is what people voted for. It's what I voted for and he's going to see it through, and I'll do my part and help make sure it happens.”


	Cain's decision comes after he shared an ICE recruitment video on Instagram earlier this week. At the time, he hadn't taken steps to become an agent. “I wasn't part of ICE, but once I put that out there and you put a little blurb on your show, it went crazy,” Cain told Watters. “So now I've spoken with some officials over at ICE.” 

	











	In the Instagram video, Cain echoed the selling points ICE has deployed as it launches a nationwide recruitment effort in hopes of intensifying already brutal crackdowns on undocumented immigration. “Since President Trump took office, ICE has arrested hundreds of thousands of criminals, including terrorists, rapists, murderers, pedophiles,” he said as the Superman theme song blared in the background. Cain boasted about a $50,000 signing bonus and “legal” student loan repayments. He also made sure to specify that “you also don't need an undergraduate degree, you can get to work right away,” a recent change to the application requirements. 

	











	Throughout the year, videos of ICE arrests in which agents have been captured smashing the window of a car with a pregnant woman inside, vigorously beating a man who is curled up on the asphalt, and tossing tear gas canisters near a toddler and a baby have gone viral. The chaotic arrest tactics have, in some instances, led to the detainment of U.S. citizens.

	The Department of Homeland Security has started to forcibly reassign Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees to ICE, threatening them with termination if they do not agree. Last month, DHS reallocated $608 million in FEMA funds to different states to fund the construction and expansion of migrant detention centers. 


	Trump previously said that his new Florida immigrant detention facility, which he dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” would hold “some of the most vicious people on the planet,” using similar language that Cain echoed in his video. But records obtained by The Miami Herald showed that only one-third of the approximately 900 immigrants detained at the Florida facility have been convicted of a crime. Another 250 detainees only have immigration violations on their records, but no criminal convictions or pending charges.

	“It's being portrayed as a real negative thing that we want people to follow our immigration laws, which is insane to me,” Cain said in July, while complaining about Hollywood making Superman — a character who doesn't have the greatest history of getting along with the U.S. government — too “woke.” “I feel we are in a bad situation here now because it's being stoked by politicians and by NGOs that have a political agenda. And I think bringing Superman into it, I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it's an immigrant thing, and I think it's going to hurt the numbers on the movie.”


	James Gunn, who directed the latest Superman film, said, “Superman is the story of America. An immigrant who came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Netflix is back out looking for a director for Fast and Loose, after Michael Bay and Will Smith were unable to bridge creative differences and Bay shook loose of the film Wednesday.


Fast and Loose will star Smith as a man who wakes up in Tijuana with no memories. As he pieces together his past, he learns he's been living two lives: one as a crime kingpin and the other as an undercover CIA agent. The script by Jon Hoeber, Erich Hoeber, Chris Bremner and Eric Pearson. The film has action as well as comic moments, but Deadline hears Bay wanted more emphasis on the former while Smith wanted to lean into the latter. 

	











	They are looking to shoot in October, and Netflix will lock in a new filmmaker to keep things on track. Bay has plenty else to do. He is discussing with Paramount a return to the Transformers fold with a new version of that tentpole, and he's also percolating at Universal OutRun, an adaptation of the video game that is a star vehicle for Sydney Sweeney. Jayson Rothwell is scripting with Bay and Brad Fuller producing with Sweeney. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	A reunion between Bay and Smith was significant because their stars launched together with 1995's Bad Boys. That film was Bay's film directing debut, and it was the vehicle that provided first glimpse of how well Smith would fare as a charismatic action star.   


Fast and Loose is being produced by Smith's Westbrook Studios and Kelly McCormick and David Leitch for 87North.

Will. If you want to direct it. Just go ahead and direct it.

Consider Matthew Vaughn, perhaps ?

I'd probably trust Bay's instincts at this point, Will.

This is actually kind of a shame considering they both made each others' first movie, & are quite literally each responsible for helping launch the other to their respective successes.

People who've known each other & go back to what would feel to each like the Hollywood equivalent of days on the grade school playground together are bound to butt heads but they owe it to themselves, audiences & each other to compromise here. Egos aside guys. Yes Bay shoots action well & yes Will does comedy well so the nature of the creative differences aren't a shocker, but life is short, they made each other, Bay should go back if that's still an option & they both should compromise. 

Wouldn't even care if there wasn't a unique history there but becuz there is, these 2 should hug it out.  They made each other famous for God sake.

So now instead of mindless explosions we might get an actual movie

The first full trailer for Peacock's <i>The Paper</i>—the new spin-off set in the same universe as NBC's massively successful American remake of The Office—wastes very little time in establishing its ties to the original show: We're told, right up top, that this is the new pulp-adjacent project from the same documentary crew that spent so many years filming the Dunder-Mifflin hordes. It's similarly efficient in letting viewers know who, say, their new Jim is going to be, with Domhnall Gleeson's Ned quickly introducing himself as the straight-laced normie having to wrangle a staff of oddballs, while cracking jokes and smiles with a similarly sane female co-worker (Chelsea Frei).



Said oddballs, meanwhile, include Tim Key, The White Lotus‘ Sabrina Impacciatore, American Vandal‘s Melvin Gregg, Ramona Young, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, and Eric Rahill, who round out the staff of a local Ohio  newspaper that seems to have  recruited its staff entirely from a roster of extremely quirky sitcom character archetypes. (Is it worth noting here that all the non-Michael, non-Dwight characters on The Office started out kind of normal, and then got crazy as we get to know them? Probably overkill, since this thing is going to be fending off comparisons to the original series every second of its existence.)

The trailer saves its biggest connection for its end, which reveals that poor Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nuñez) is apparently doomed to have these documentarians intrude into his life no matter where he goes. (His determination to render any footage of him unusable makes up the trailer's one genuine laugh-out-loud moment.)

The Paper debuts its first four episodes on Peacock on Thursday, September 4; it'll roll out two new episodes every week after until September 25.

The ‘Outer Banks' creators tapped William Lipton, Axel Ellis, Jeremy Yun, Zendé Murdock and Jesse Golliher to form a teenage rock band, and then let the cameras roll.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Outer Banks creators Jonas and Josh Pate tapped real-life musicians to form a teenage rock band that features in the official trailer for Prime Video's The Runarounds, which dropped on Thursday.


	Rockers William Lipton, Axel Ellis, Jeremy Yun, Zendé Murdock and Jesse Golliher became the actors behind the teenage rock band The Runarounds at the center of the musical coming-of-age drama set to bow on Sept. 1 on the streaming platform worldwide.




	Along with fellow cast members Lilah Pate, Maximo Salas, Kelley Pereira, Marley Aliah, Mark Wystrach, Brooklyn Decker, Hayes MacArthur and Shea Pritchard, the band members after high school graduation chase rock fame and success in Wilmington, North Carolina, while falling in love and partying as they pursue their dreams.

	“When you see them on stage, I love passion like that,” Outer Banks star Lilah Pate, who plays Sophia Kinney in The Runarounds, says at one point in the trailer. The rock band had time to gel in front of the cameras.




			Related Video		







	The Runarounds was formed as a band in 2021, when Jonas Pate issued a casting call for a group to appear on Outer Banks. The group first performed together when they played for Pate ahead of appearing in season three after being selected from more than 5,000 musicians who responded to the casting call.

	











	At the time, Pate had already begun writing what ultimately became The Runarounds, and the group filmed the pilot with Pate in 2022 and has since recorded an EP and gone out on tour.  


	A synopsis from the producers reads: “Over the course of one unforgettable summer, they throw themselves into the pursuit of their big break — falling in love, getting into trouble and building the kind of bonds that feel like family along the way. With original music, romantic entanglements and the raw highs and lows of coming-of-age, The Runarounds captures the rush of risking everything at the edge of adulthood to chase your dreams.” 


The Runarounds, which like Outer Banks was shot in North Carolina, is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Skydance Television. The executive producer credits are shared by Jonas Pate, Joon Yun, David Wilcox, Josh Pate, Shannon Burke, Scott Lambert, Lisa Mae Fincannon, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Matt Thunell.

Greg Daniels must really have missed cubicles: “The Office” creator is back with a documentary-style sitcom spinoff series, titled “The Paper,” that reunites him with a slew of “Office” alums. Daniels and “Nathan For You” co-creator Michael Koman are the co-creators, co-showrunner, writers, and executive producers of the highly-anticipated Peacock series.

Much like “The Office,” “The Paper” revolves around an ensemble cast including Domhnall Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei, Melvin Gregg, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, Ramona Young, Tim Key, and “The Office” alum Oscar Nuñez. Original (AKA British) “The Office” stars and co-creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant executive produce “The Paper” along with Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, and Banijay Americas (formerly Reveille).

“The Office” was originally created for BBC by Gervais and Merchant, where it ran from 2001 to 2003 before Daniels adapted it for American television in 2005. The U.S. version ran for nine seasons and earned 42 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including five wins. “The Paper” follows the same fictional documentary crew that “immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch in the Emmy Award-winning series ‘The Office' as they find a new subject when they discover a historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it,” the synopsis reads. Tracy Letts, Eric Rahill, Molly Ephraim, Mo Welch, Allan Havey, Duane Shepard Sr., Nate Jackson, and Nancy Lenehan guest star. 

 










Daniels directs the pilot episode, with Ken Kwapis, Yana Gorskaya, Paul Lieberstein, Tazbah Chavez, Jason Woliner, Jennifer Celotta, Matt Sohn, Dave Rogers, and Jeff Blitz helming the rest of the 10-episode season. “The Paper” is a Universal Television series from the division of Universal Studio Group. 

Daniels, meanwhile, has seemed to keep the door open to a possible “The Office” reboot. The director said in 2021 that a revival is “not impossible, for sure,” but he would have to be part of it. “I would want to be involved, and I've got two other shows I'm working on right now,” Daniels told Collider. (Daniels served as the showrunner for the first four seasons of “The Office” before departing to co-create NBCUniversal's similarly-beloved “Parks and Recreation.” Daniels resumed showrunner duties for the ninth and final season of “The Office,” which concluded in 2013.) 

“The Paper” premieres on Peacock with four episodes September 4, followed by two new episodes every Thursday through September 25. Check out the trailer below.

Charlie Kaufman is preparing to take his new short film “How to Shoot a Ghost” to the Venice International Film Festival next month, but it won't be long before cinephiles with public library cards get a chance to watch it. IndieWire can exclusively reveal that Kanopy — the ad-free streaming service free for many library cardholders to use — has signed on as a producer and the exclusive library and educational distributor of the film.

“How to Shoot a Ghost” is directed by Kaufman and written by the poet Eva H.D., who previously wrote Kaufman's 2023 short “Jackals & Fireflies.” Per an official synopsis, the film “follows two newly deceased young people who meet in the streets of Athens, amid the pulsing cityscape and the ghosts of its history. One is a translator, the other a photographer; they were outsiders in life, and in death, they struggle with the residue of their longings and mistakes. They wander the city together, finding consolation in the rugged beauty of existence and its aftermath.” Josef Akiki and Jessie Buckley star.

The collaboration with Kaufman marks the latest ambitious expansion for Kanopy. The service, which launched in 2008 and is now available to over 50 percent of library cardholders in the United States, released its first original feature film, the book-banning documentary “Banned Together,” in April 2025.

 










“Given the crisis of education in this country, it remains as important as ever for citizens to continue to have barrier-free access to the wealth of free resources that libraries have always offered,” Kaufman said in a statement. “Kanopy's partnership with universities and public libraries ensures that a rich digital archive of cinematic work from all over the world — from the newest documentaries to the collected adventures of Buster Keaton — will be available to a new generation of cinephiles.”

“Kanopy is proud to continue our work of supporting impactful artists with ‘How to Shoot a Ghost,'” Kanopy GM Jason Tyrell added. “We are thrilled to join this incredible producing team and help bring an exciting new cinematic vision to Kanopy audiences via our extensive streaming platform. Charlie's love of film craft and singular storytelling sensibilities, coupled with Eva's elegant poetry, weave together into a richly historical and literary work that deserves to be platformed. We are eager to share this project with Kanopy's patrons and educators.”

Kaufman's last feature directorial effort was the acclaimed 2020 Netflix film “I'm Thinking of Ending Things,” starring Buckley. He is currently attached to direct Eddie Redmayne and Tessa Thompson in a film adaptation of Iddo Geffen's short story “Later the War.”

The singer shared that she needs "to be fully present" for her children.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


Kelly Clarkson is postponing the remaining August dates of her Las Vegas residency to take care of her family.


	The singer made the announcement late Wednesday night on Instagram, writing in part, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”




	Clarkson's last Vegas show was on Saturday, Aug. 2 and she was set to resume her Studio Sessions performances on Friday, Aug. 8 as the first of four more shows in August at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. The residency is set to resume in November.

	The move comes after Clarkson delayed the start of her residency by a week, announcing that postponement shortly before the shows were set to kick off on July 4. That delay, Clarkson said, was due to vocal issues.

	“We have been working 24/7 to make Studio Sessions the most intimate and extraordinary experience with and for my incredible fans,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “I am beyond grateful that you always show up for me and I am devastated to have to postpone tonight and tomorrow's opening at Caesars. The prep and rehearsals have taken a toll on my voice.” 


	She added, “I want the shows to be perfect for y'all and I need to protect myself from doing serious damage so I am taking this weekend and next week to rest up so that we can deliver what you all deserve. The show is truly incredible. The musicians and singers are outstanding, and I want us all to start out strong.”

	











	The singer was also absent from a number of episodes of her eponymous NBC daytime talk show earlier this year, prompting concern from fans as guest hosts filled in.


	Clarkson and ex-husband Brandon Blackstock, with whom she shares two children, were married from 2013 to 2020 before divorcing.


	Clarkson, who announced her Studio Sessions Vegas residency in February, recently sold a stake in her catalog to HarbourView Equity Partners, with the company saying the deal includes a portion of her biggest hits including “Since U Been Gone,” “Because of You,” “Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),” “Behind These Hazel Eyes,” and “Underneath the Tree.”


	The size of the stake, how much was paid and what type of rights weren't revealed.

James Gunn is continuing to fly high. Earlier this summer, the co-head of DC Studios celebrated the release of his first standalone “Superman” feature (which he wrote and directed), and will soon see the release of “Peacemaker” Season 2. And that's in addition to his work running the studio alongside Peter Safran (the pair were appointed co-CEOs in 2022).

Now, Gunn is pulling the trigger on yet another project: writing and directing “the next installment in the Super-Family,” as Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said during the company's earnings call, as Variety reported.

 










While it's not set yet whether this will be a sequel to “Superman,” it has been confirmed that David Corenswet's titular character will star in it. Before that, Craig Gillespie's “Supergirl” will be released in 2026, with Milly Alcock's role having been teased in “Superman.”

Gunn and Safran previously unveiled a 10-year plan for the DCU, including a “Wonder Woman” reboot and 2026 releases “Supergirl” and “Clayface,” the latter of which Gunn said will be a “totally different thing” tonally. “Although it's in the same universe, it's a complete horror film, and that's one of the things we want to do,” Gunn told CBS Mornings of “Clayface,” adding, “There's not a company style. It's not like every movie is gonna be like ‘Superman.' The artists and the directors and the writers that create each one will bring their own sense to it. We don't want people being bored.” 

 










Gunn already teased to Entertainment Weekly that “Peacemaker” Season 2 is “very much connected to ‘Superman' and it's very much connected to what comes after.”

That “after” part has yet to be seen… However, it makes sense that Gunn will be writing and directing the franchise installment. Gunn's “Superman,” which he also wrote and directed, earned $315 million in the U.S. and $550 million globally. Gunn admitted to Rolling Stone that he was surprised by how well the feature did at the international box office.

“Superman is not a known commodity in some places. He is not a big known superhero in some places like Batman is. That affects things,” Gunn said. “And it also affects things that we have a certain amount of anti-American sentiment around the world right now. It isn't really helping us. So I think it's just a matter of letting something grow. But again, for us, everything's been a total win. Having the movie come out and be something that has been embraced by people everywhere — this is just the seed of the tree that Peter [Safran] and I have been watering for the past three years. So to be able to have it start off so positively has been incredibly overwhelming.”

Shari Redstone will receive $1.75 billion for her stake while her exiting C-suite executives will get eight-figure termination awards in addition to their annual salaries. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	Thirteen months after David Ellison and Shari Redstone hashed out an $8 billion megadeal that would shift ownership of Paramount Global from the heir of a media mogul to the heir of a tech mogul, that merger finally closed on Thursday.


	As the Skydance team, led by Ellison as CEO and former NBCUniversal exec Jeff Shell as president, settles in, the former Paramount C-suite and senior management team have drafted their farewell memos, burnished their résumés and touted accomplishments in the face of a tumultuous few years since the merger of Viacom and CBS in late 2019. The company had more than 18,000 employees as of the end of 2024.

	Shari Redstone, who orchestrated the combination of her father Sumner Redstone's companies, and guided Paramount to try and compete with Netflix in the streaming wars with its own flagship service, Paramount+ (which now has 77.7 million subscribers), will get $1.75 billion in cash for the controlling stake in her holding company, National Amusements. Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of David Ellison, backed the deal as did RedBird Capital, led by Gerry Cardinale.

	Only one member of the trio that comprised “the office of the CEO” after the ouster of chief exec Bob Bakish in 2024 will stay on with Skydance. That would be George Cheeks, who oversaw CBS and its assets during the Redstone era and will be the chairman of TV media under Ellison's ownership. (The exec took home the highest pay figure among his co-chiefs at $22.1 million last year.)

	











	Redstone co-CEO Chris McCarthy, the TV chief who oversaw the building of the Taylor Sheridan-verse on Paramount+, is exiting. The exec was paid $19.5 million last year and will receive $18.3 million on top of his 2025 pay tied to the ownership change, per regulatory filings. 


	Fellow departing co-chief Brian Robbins, who oversaw Paramount Pictures, was paid $19.6 million last year and will receive an $18.6 million change in ownership payment this year in addition to his annual pay.


	Bakish, the sole Paramount CEO who was let go last April, saw a major silver lining to his abrupt exit: a severance package alone worth $69.3 million of his total $87 million in pay for 2024.


	Meanwhile, Naveen Chopra, the chief financial officer who worked on the Skydance deal, was paid $8.78 million in 2024. He jumped to gaming giant Roblox as CFO in June and, since he left early, he forwent a $12 million Paramount award tied to a change in ownership.


	Skydance's deal brings together the Top Gun: Maverick producer with Paramount Pictures, Paramount+, CBS, Showtime, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET and Comedy Central. Over the past year, the co-CEOs have executed a plan to shave off $500 million in costs, sell off assets and reduce a workforce by more than 15 percent as Paramount shifts ownership.


	The new Paramount Skydance will trade on the Nasdaq as “PSKY” in its latest incarnation. In an open letter to shareholders on Thursday, Ellison wrote that he wants “to empower our creative partners with technology that will enable them to tell bigger, more compelling stories fueled by human ingenuity” but that the company “will face some hard but necessary decisions to align our team for growth and efficiency.”

When she's not making indie-folk with Florist, Emily A. Sprague records ambient albums, and she has a new one on the way. Cloud Time is out October 10 (via Rvng Intl.). Below, watch the video for the new album's opening track, “Tokyo 1.”

Sprague recorded her new album while she was on tour in Japan last year. “When I began preparing for the tour, I couldn't shake a sense that the invitation to Japan was more about opening myself up to this new place instead of bringing something into it tightly under my control,” Sprague reflected. “Improvisation has always been such a pillar in my music practice, and I really wanted to meet the country, spaces, and people through that process.”

Cloud Time is a distillation of more than eight hours of material that Sprague recorded. For the album, Sprague was inspired by the Japanese environmental music philosophy kankyō ongaku.

Cloud Time is Sprague's first solo album since 2020's Hill, Flower, Fog. She and her bandmates in Florist released the album Jellywish earlier this year.

The Grammy winner released a video for "I'm Goin' In Till October" that pokes fun at the controversy. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Lizzo is calling out Sydney Sweeney‘s controversial American Eagle jeans ad in a new song.


	On Wednesday, the four-time Grammy winner released two clips from a track on social media that  name-dropped Sweeney and referenced the viral ad.




	In one video snippet for “I'm Goin' In Till October” (below), Lizzo is clad in torn denim while hosing down a Porsche and raps, “No kizzy, he ain't got no business being with me. Fat ass pretty face with the titties. Bitch, I got good jeans like I'm Sydney.” (Or perhaps that should be “genes”?).

	In the second video, Lizzo opens with a clip of a cable news pundit doing a celebratory rant about the Sweeney ad, declaring, “We're over this woke agenda. We are over the Lizzos, we are over the Dylan Mulvaneys. If this were a 300-pound non-binary person they would be applauding her.” Then the video cuts to Lizzo lounging in head-to-toe denim, similar to the Sweeney ad. Lizzo commented on the video, “Lizzo's got good jeans.” 


	The messaging could be seen as a push-back on the Sweeney ad. But it could also be taken as a positive for the American Eagle campaign. The company tried to make the point in a statement on the controversy last week that the marketing effort was meant to be inclusive, and Lizzo adopting the “great jeans” tag for herself could be seen as a co-sign of it's intended message. As company put it in its statement, “We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.”

	











	The campaign has been been perhaps the most controversial and talked-about marketing effort since — on the other side of the culture-war spectrum — trans activist Mulvaney did a brand endorsement for Bud Light in 2023. The Mulvaney deal was just an influencer partnership that went viral, however, while the Sweeney deal is a major ad campaign. Also, Bud Light's sales tanked in the wake of the ad, while it's not yet clear which direction American Eagle's sales may have shifted. Sweeney's other recent brand deals include Armani Beauty, Miu Miu, Laneige, HeyDude, Bai, Baskin Robbins and Ford.


	The Lizzo song follows up on Trump swooning over the news that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida last year, telling reporters earlier this week, “Now I love her ad! … If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.” 

You're cute jeans 😌

Lizzo's got Good Jeans™️


	At the center of the controversy has been a clip that finds Sweeney saying, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The line inspired a heated debate with many online critics insisting the ad was a dog whistle promoting white supremacy.


	Sweeney has not responded to the uproar. She next stars in the crime thriller Americana being released this month and in December's highly anticipated adaption of the Freida McFadden bestseller The Housemaid.

T
he hotel room is cold, antiseptic, the only sound the gentle whisper of central air. I can't go outside, my fixer tells me, or I might be kidnapped. 


	From my window high up in the most expensive hotel in town, I look down at a baseball field and a new luxury condominium complex under construction. I am in the center of Culiacán, and here, things feel safe, like I'm in an American suburb. It is quiet, almost eerily so. Because as soon as the sun goes down, the killing will begin. 


	A few days ago, they found a body stuffed in a white sack stained with blood, dropped off in front of a funeral home. Sometimes, the bodies are surrounded by pizza boxes. And sometimes they are surrounded by black ball caps. And everyone who lives in Culiacán knows what both of those things mean. They are insults to El Chapo and El Mayo, the two men who once ran the Sinaloa Cartel, and who are now incarcerated in the United States.


	Since last September the city has been at war. On one side are the boys of El Chapo — Los Chapitos — and on the other, factions aligned with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. When a military convoy rumbles past, no one seems to notice. When the wail of a siren pierces the air, they all — the deliveryman on the motorcycle, the priest with the Coke-bottle glasses, the mother shielding her child's eyes — glance at the crumpled body on the street and hurriedly walk on, wary of the invisible lines drawn by a war that's reshaping the most powerful drug cartel in the world. And it's only been made worse by the second Trump administration. 

	











	When Trump threatened to impose tariffs, the Mexican government made the concession of not just sending troops to the border and to cities like Culiacán, but of also allowing the U.S. military to fly in Mexican airspace. At dusk, if you look up, you'll see drones, rumored to be American, all over the city, collecting intelligence. 

	











	And that's why I can't go outside. The city is crawling with DEA agents, and my fixer, who is from Culiacán, says I look like one. I have no idea if any of this is true. But I have no choice except to wait in this room that smells of jasmine and sandalwood, in this hotel that serves octopus in bone marrow for breakfast, and to hear the reports he brings me of a city teetering on the brink.

	His name is Miguel Ángel Vega. He's spent more than a decade as a journalist and a fixer, working with reporters and documentary filmmakers from around the world, helping them stay safe in one of the most violent cities in the world. Kids he played soccer with are now connected to cartel bosses or have become sicarios. Many of his childhood friends are dead. For a fee, he can take me to cooks at fentanyl labs, to the mountains where they grow poppies, and to high-level members of the Sinaloa Cartel. What he offers is the ability to tell the story of the war for control of Culiacán from the inside. 


	I've been reporting on drug trafficking on both sides of the U.S. border for more than two decades. And yet, every time I step into this world, I feel like I understand it less, not more. Which is why I've always wanted to go to Culiacán, the cradle of the Mexican drug trade. Maybe here, with Miguel as my guide, I can get closer to the truth of how this business works, if such a truth even exists.

“What is the price of your life? That's what you're paying me for. Not just for the story, but that you will get out alive.” 


	MIGUEL IS TALL and lanky and has a craggy face and a strong, square jaw. It is a face made for Hollywood. In another life, he was an actor, and then a film director. He lived and worked in Los Angeles, made a hit movie about a bank robbery, and then worked in Mexico City, this country's hub for film and TV. His second movie bombed, and that led him back to journalism, and eventually to this work. He has a drawer full of screenplays and an unfinished novel. If he can save up, he hopes to make those movies, but for now, this is his livelihood, earning between $400 and $600 a day for his services. Sometimes film crews balk at this amount, say it's too much. He retorts: “What is the price of your life? Because that's what you're paying me for. Not just the story, but that you will get out alive.” 


	Miguel grew up in Colonia Morelos, a working-class neighborhood in Culiacán. Back then, in the early 1980s, the drug trade was different, not as professionalized. The men who worked in the trade were known as gomeros, which means gum, because they grew poppy in the mountains and fields that surround the city, cooked it into heroin, and then moved it across the border. The violence of the narcos — the killings and kidnappings and disappearances — was remote from Miguel, as were the men celebrated in the narco corridos. Still, he quickly learned the line between his world and theirs, and what it offered. “Money, power, fancy cars, and beautiful women,” he remembers.

	While many of his friends were drawn to that life, Miguel never was. He always liked books, and could sit reading for hours, lost in his imagination as his friends played baseball between the cars parked on his street. His favorite book was The Little Prince, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which tells the story of a pilot crash-landing in the Sahara Desert, where he meets a prince who grew up on an asteroid. “One sees clearly with the heart,” a fox tells the prince. “Anything essential is invisible to the eye.”

	











	This lesson would stay with Miguel in his chosen professions, but it held particular resonance with him as a boy, because he often spent time with his grandmother, who was blind. “I was her eyes,” he says. “Like I used to describe things that I saw on the streets or things in the house to her.” He realized that his skills at observation and his ability to write could become a career, which led him to screenwriting and journalism. His beat was crime.


	In those early years, he listened to the police scanner and learned that when the frequencies filled with chatter, something was happening. He memorized the codes police use: The number 41 meant murder. His life became hanging out with cops, hopping in his car and driving to a crime scene, sometimes arriving even before the police. “I learned firsthand what is death,” Miguel remembers. He is a deliberate speaker, his voice a low murmur. “And death, it's something that I got to know very well.”


	And then one day, in 2008, a documentary film crew from Los Angeles called. They heard he spoke English and wondered if he could take them around Culiacán, introduce them to some narcos, maybe take them to a crime scene or to see the shrine of Jesús Malverde, the patron saint of narco traffickers. It was the sort of itinerary that would become a cliché in coming years. He was shocked when they paid him $1,000 for four days of work. A few months later, word had spread about him, and another crew called for another documentary. One day while shooting, he looked at the call sheet, which lists production details — the name of the director, shooting locations, the daily schedule — and noticed his name on the crew list. Beside it was the word “fixer.” 


	“I go, like, ‘Oh, so this is what I am,' ” Miguel recalls thinking. Other journalists looked down on this type of work. In fact, his editor at the paper in Culiacán, Ríodoce, asked him why he was wasting time taking gringos around. Whether from France or Italy or the U.S., they often got things wrong, or perpetuated negative stereotypes, either out of laziness or racism, or a combination of both, arriving so unprepared they were surprised Culiacán had ATM machines. 


	They could also be insulting, asking Miguel if he knew what B-roll was, or asking him to go to dangerous places, strapping on bulletproof vests and expecting him to go without one. 

	











	The cartels asked him for favors, too — could he run a load from Phoenix to New York? (He says he never has and never will.) Or tried to accommodate him with favors he didn't want. Once, for example, when a cartel operative heard a French film crew was in town, Miguel was asked if they wanted to film an execution. Arrangements could be made. Miguel was so horrified he didn't even pass along the request, on the off chance the crew would actually want to do it.


	He didn't love the work, but he couldn't find anything that paid better, and if someone was going to help the world understand his hometown, it might as well be him. To his friends, he described his job as part driver, part translator, but also guide and location manager and bodyguard and security consultant.


	Over time, he realized something: He was perfectly suited for the work. He didn't just speak both English and Spanish, he knew the slang only locals use in Culiacán, so people immediately saw him as one of their own, someone they could trust. And while Culiacán is a decent-size city, with a Costco and car dealerships and gated communities of McMansions, it can also feel like a small town, or a rancho, where everyone knows everyone. 


	“I'm two degrees removed from anyone,” Miguel tells me. “If you want to see a crystal-meth lab, a poppy field, a marijuana field, I'm the one who can take you there. If you want to meet a sicario, or you want to see guns, I can open those doors.”


	As a fixer, Miguel has arranged interviews with El Mayo's inner circle. He's sat at the dinner table with El Chapo's mom. He's talked his way out of hostage situations and brokered deals to keep his colleagues alive. He's been in a shootout where two sicarios were killed. He barely made it out with his life.


	“I'm the one who faces all the threats, but most of that happens before the crew arrives. I meet with people I don't know in a dodgy bar. I explain the project. They ask who it's for and then they research everyone. Then they come back and say, ‘These people seem to be legit. But if this is a setup, if these people are not journalists, if they are DEA or undercover, you're the first one who is gone.' ”


	By gone, he means dead. When the shoot is over, or the reporters from The New York Times or National Geographic have their story, they go home; but Miguel stays here in Mexico, with his wife and children, where most of the narcos and the cops know his name and can easily find out where he lives. When he returns home to his apartment in Mexico City, he tries to slip back into his normal routine — meeting friends for drinks, taking his kids to the park, going to the movies with his wife — but no matter how hard he tries, his mind is never far from Culiacán, and where he might go next.


	“It sounds insane what I do,” he says, “but basically my job is to open access and also to make sure everyone on the team will get in and out unscathed.”

	











	He stays alive by remaining committed to a set of principles he's established in his 15 years as a fixer: He is fundamentally neutral. He never takes sides among the warring cartels. He is transparent and upfront. When asking permission to do a story, or when brokering an interview, he lays out the objective of the reporters or film crew, and what the reporting will entail, including whether the crew will interview members of rival groups, the government, or the police. He holds nothing back. 

“I meet with people I don't know in a dodgy bar. I explain the project. They say, ‘If this is a setup, you're the first one gone.' ”


	And most important, he takes great pains to honor every promise he makes — especially when it comes to protecting sources' identities. 


	While other fixers prefer to operate in the shadows and keep as low a profile as possible, Miguel believes his visibility, even his celebrity, acts as a sort of cloak of protection. He is known in Sinaloa as “the fixer,” meaning he doesn't have to be vetted. He's even written a Spanish-language memoir about his work, titled, appropriately, El Fixer. The cartels know who he is and what he does. “They know I'm a man of my word.” 


	The true danger, he says, lies not in being on camera or writing a book, but in making one wrong move — taking sides, exposing a source, or accidentally bringing in someone undercover. That's why he vets every member of a visiting crew and will shut down a production or reporting the minute the cartel asks him to, no matter how upset it may make those who have hired him. “My life is on the line every single day,” he says. “So I have to be extra careful, every time.”


	I HAVE BEEN TOLD the ground rules. We will not go out at night. This is Miguel's most basic rule when things are tense, when the cartels are at war, as they are now. Every time he breaks this rule, he regrets it.


	When we arrive at a location, we will not linger by our car. We will get out, head to the interview, get back in the car, go back to the hotel. We will keep a low profile.


	If something goes wrong, we will not panic. We will not resist if a gunman sticks us up. We will give our wallets. If we are kidnapped, if we don't check back in at the hotel, calls will be made: to the press, to the military, to the police, to powerful people in Mexico City, to the U.S. Consulate. No one wants to kill a gringo journalist. It will only bring more heat. 


	Regardless, he will get us out, as he has done before. And no matter what happens, we will stay together and stay calm. There is nowhere to run, after all. The cartel clocked me from the moment I touched down at the airport, Miguel reminds me, and their hawks, or halcones, have been watching me ever since. They may work at the hotel, or behind the bar, mixing my mojito, or at the stoplight, washing the windshield while we wait for the light to change green.


	And if something goes really, really wrong, Miguel and I will head directly to the airport and take the next flight out. 

	











	It is morning, and we are on the highway headed out of town in a convoy of military and police vehicles. We are traveling with a group of mothers in a white van ahead of us. They are looking for their sons, who have disappeared, and have arranged for a police escort because the cartel doesn't want us going where we're going. 


	The escort might as well be for show, though. If it provides any security at all, it is a false sense of security. “The cartel brought the military to its knees,” Miguel says. He's talking about 2019, when the military swept in to Culiacán to arrest El Chapo's son Ovidio. Once they had him in custody, the Chapitos blocked streets, set buses on fire, took hostages, and began shooting cops and soldiers. They radioed to the commanders of the operation that they were outside Sinaloa's military base and would begin killing soldiers if they didn't release Ovidio and retreat. And after that, they would start killing the wives and children of the soldiers. The standoff lasted for hours, but eventually, at the request of then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the military released Ovidio and left town.


	Miguel looks out the window. “If they can kill soldiers, they own this city.”


	Today he is dressed in all black, with a gray baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. It is the hat of the hometown team, Los Tomateros. Other than drugs, and baseball, Culiacán is known for its tomatoes. At one point, it produced more of them than any other city in Mexico. 


	Not far from a city landfill, the convoy pulls off the highway and enters a rutted dirt road, hidden from view by the branches of weeping willows. Vultures circle above in big loops. I tell Miguel I can see why this could be a perfect place to dump a body.


	“Anywhere is a dumping ground,” he explains, as if to say, there is nothing special about this place.


	We are here because one of the mothers in our convoy got a tip, Miguel says. The tip may have been delivered in a note, and the note may have gone something like this: “If you go to La Pitahayita, you're gonna find a road, an open road to your left, and then like 100 meters down that road there is a dump where you can search for bodies. We left dead bodies there.”

	











	Sinaloa sits on the Pacific Ocean, and just two and a half hours away is Mazatlán, where the cartels launder their money in gaudy hotels and nightclubs. But here, the landscape is dry, austere, spectral. The trees have no leaves. If I were to drop a match, the ground would catch fire, and fire would consume everything in this field of dead leaves and weeds. Once, a farmer grazed cattle here, or grew corn, but now the fields are barren and lifeless.


	I look up and see the plastic head of a doll perched atop a fence post, blackened by soot. The mothers, who have come with shovels and pick axes, think this may be a sign and begin digging. 


	I ask Miguel how often they come out to killing fields like this one, searching for their sons.


	“Maybe three times a week?” he says. He isn't sure. 


	Their sons, they know, are most likely dead. To say they are “disappeared” is to hold on to some kind of hope. It is the same reason they are wearing T-shirts with photos of their sons screen-printed on the front, as if their boys are simply missing, and not gone forever.


	They were probably connected, Miguel says, meaning they worked for the cartel, or a faction of it, the Chapitos or the Mayitos or some other cell no one has ever heard of. Maybe they were sicarios or drug mules. Maybe they ran loads across the border. And then they made a mistake. They said something they shouldn't have said. They didn't pay a debt. They lost a load. Or maybe they didn't make a mistake at all. They killed someone on orders and then were killed on orders from someone else. These are young men in their late teens and early twenties, from neighborhoods like the one Miguel grew up in. These are the casualties of the war for Culiacán. 


	The mothers work dutifully, spending no more than a few minutes at each spot, hacking away at the hard desert soil. They look for some sign, a piece of clothing, a flip-flop, a charred bit of trash. I ask Miguel why they don't dig deeper if they think there's something there. He shrugs. If a body is here, whoever buried it didn't bother digging deep, because there's no fear of getting caught.


	They find the burned body of an animal, and Miguel explains that animals are often burned to cover the stench of death. It is a good clue, but after a few minutes the mothers stop digging and move to another spot. 


	I stop one of them. She asks me not to use her name because she is afraid of the cartels. The other mothers have covered their faces to not be identified. She tells me she has been leading trips like this for four years. She has found more than 100 bodies. But she still has not found the body of her son. 

	











	I look at my notes later. Did she say 100 bodies, or 500? The numbers are incomprehensible. I ask Miguel. He doesn't know. Who can keep track of all the killing, all the bodies? Nearly 2,000 disappeared since last September just in Sinaloa, according to the official tally.


	I later ask how he makes sense of all of this. How does he distinguish between the official numbers given by the government and the things he learns out here, where bodies are found and the killing is done?


	“To me, they're almost the same. One of them is official, and the other, it's the criminal. But they both have agendas,” he says. 


	For example, before El Chapo's capture in 2016, both the Mexican government and the DEA called El Chapo the head of the Sinaloa Cartel. But Miguel says they knew this wasn't true. The Sinaloa Cartel has never been that regimented. It has always existed as a conglomeration of interlocking cells.


	The DEA and the Mexican government knew that El Mayo Zambada ran his own faction and didn't answer to El Chapo, Miguel explains, but no one said this. The narrative of one man in charge was cleaner.


	“The truth is, in Culiacán, we have, like, 20 El Chapos,” Miguel says. “Very powerful people with a lot of money. And they are untouchable. No one ever mentions them or talks about them. They are white-collar people.”


	When he asked sicarios who they worked for, they wouldn't say El Mayo or El Chapo, they would simply say the Sinaloa Cartel, to protect their bosses. It became a global trademark and offered protection for everyone to obscure who they work for, where the money comes from, and who is really in charge.


	“A lot of times, with criminal sources, there is no way to verify what they are telling you,” Miguel says. “The problem is the government does the same thing.”


	I ask him who he fears more. He doesn't hesitate.


	“The government,” he says.

	











	He looks out at the field, where the mothers continue digging in the dirt. Today, they won't find any of their sons.


	IN THE YEARS WHEN El Chapo and El Mayo ruled the Sinaloa Cartel, peace reigned in Culiacán. Miguel's job was much easier then. He could take camera crews to the shrine of Jesús Malverde. He could set up interviews with sicarios without a problem, meet with drug mules, visit a fentanyl lab. 


	But last August, everything changed. El Mayo arrived at a meeting that one of El Chapo's sons, Joaquín Guzmán López, had brokered with Sinaloa politicians, including the former mayor of Culiacán and the governor of Sinaloa. Far less flashy than El Chapo, El Mayo had long been considered the Sinaloa Cartel's best strategist and negotiator — essentially the brains behind the operation. He was also the suspected architect of sprawling networks of corruption that had infiltrated nearly every level of government in Mexico.


	El Mayo, who was 76 at the time, was led into a room and knocked down. A hood was placed over his head, according to a letter he later wrote from prison. He was then put in the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip, where he was forced onto a private jet headed for the United States. He had been double-crossed by Guzmán López, who was also on the plane and had been arranging his surrender for some time.


	To this day, no one is quite sure what Guzmán López's end game was, but the speculation is that by delivering El Mayo he could leverage a better sentence for himself. 


	Regardless of Guzmán López's motives, the capture of El Mayo set off a war in Culiacán. Suddenly, the rules of engagement that had long imposed order on the city were no more. Under El Chapo and El Mayo, those not involved in the drug game were off-limits, but now, the only rule was mayhem: carjackings, kidnappings, schoolchildren gunned down in the crossfire between the Chapitos and the Mayitos.


	The city was carved up like a Risk board: Downtown and most of the city belonged to the Chapitos. A small sliver and the outskirts on the southern end of town belonged to the Mayitos. The most dangerous areas were the spaces in between. 


	Then came Donald Trump and his threats of tariffs. In response, the new Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, sent 10,000 Mexican National Guard troops to the border and roughly 13,000 soldiers to Sinaloa. 


	That may be a precursor for what's next. Trump has long yearned to unleash the U.S. military on the cartels, and he seemingly took a first step in February, when he declared the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations. 


	Doing so gives him legal pretext to invade Mexico, an idea that would've sounded insane during any previous administration, but under Trump, anything seems possible. As Rolling Stone has previously reported, Trump administration officials have considered everything from sending in special-ops soldiers to assassinate cartel leaders to using drones or other military aircraft to conduct air strikes on cartel infrastructure and drug labs. 

	











	This heightened tension had made Miguel's sources in the underworld even more jumpy than usual. “The cartels are freaking out,” he tells me. 


	This evening, we're set to meet with two low-level sicarios, who can provide us some up-to-date intel on the status of the war for the city. Miguel's mood has darkened, though, as the day has gone on, and he seems increasingly reluctant to bring me along. 


	They first agreed to meet at a gas station, then a restaurant. And now they want to meet at a safe house in a sketchy part of the city. It is late afternoon, and Miguel isn't sure if the meeting is going to happen. If it does, he will go alone first to meet them, and then if it is safe, come back and get me.


	He leaves me at the hotel and disappears, out into the city, to work his contacts, to try to broker a meeting that may be falling apart. 


	I sit in the restaurant of the hotel, a gathering place for what seems like every meal of the city's rich and powerful. A Catholic priest in a scarlet-colored shirt sits across from a broad-shouldered man wearing a cowboy hat. A woman heavily enhanced by plastic surgery is seated across the room. She carries a Chanel purse. Her boyfriend, or husband, or lover sits across from her, holding her hand, whispering something in her ear that makes her grin wickedly. 


	All of these people are narcos, somehow connected to the drug world. That's what I've heard, anyway. Somehow the money touches everyone here, and everything. But I also wonder if this is actually true. Couldn't they also be connected to a family with a large tomato plantation? Generational wealth passes through legitimate streams here, too. 


	It's dark when Miguel calls. The meeting with the sicarios will not happen. It's too dangerous, he explains. He sounds disappointed, like he has failed somehow. 


	I look out at the glittering lights of the city. The condo complex across the street is dark. The baseball field is covered in shadows. Everything is quiet, almost eerily so. In the morning, Miguel will call me and tell me they found another body. 


	ON MY LAST DAY in Culiacán, I go downstairs for breakfast and find Miguel in a quiet corner of the restaurant, typing furiously on his laptop. His notepad is sprawled open before him, with pages full of scribbles scattered across the table. I sit down and ask the waiter for coffee. Miguel does not look up or even acknowledge me. He is on deadline for his weekly column on narco violence in Ríodoce, where he's now been working as a staff writer for a dozen years. 

	











	When he is finished, he looks up, a bit startled, as if he is just now realizing I am there. I ask him how much longer he thinks this war between the Chapitos and the Mayitos will last. 


	“At least six months, maybe more,” he says. 


	There are some in Sinaloa, and Mexico more broadly, who like what Trump is doing, he will later tell me, and other security consultants will confirm as much: There was a broad perception that López Obrador did little to confront the cartels. “He had this attitude that the drug war was all the fault of the U.S.,” says Victoria Dittmar, a Mexico City-based analyst with InSight Crime, a think tank and publication focused on organized crime. “But we have to acknowledge that Mexico has a role to play as well in stopping the flow of drugs.”


	The unpredictability of Trump, the thinking goes, has put pressure on the Mexican government to crack down on cartels. 


	Miguel doesn't necessarily think this is a bad thing, but in the long run, he's not sure what it will accomplish, either. The presence of the military in Culiacán has done nothing to quell the violence; if anything, it's made the city more dangerous. People try to avoid going out after dark, and in a city where everything is touched by narco dollars, the economy is collapsing. 


	There is also a fear that the recent uptick in collaboration between the Mexican and U.S. militaries to share intel could backfire, especially if the U.S. military actually invades Mexico. “There's a growing anti-American sentiment in Latin America due to the Trump administration,” Dittmar tells me. “If the U.S. actually violates Mexican sovereignty and invades, it will take a generation or more to regain trust, and then that flow of information stops.”


	Regardless, the Sinaloa Cartel has never been weaker, and there is speculation that it will never be the same. What the Sinaloa Cartel offered at its apex was certainty and protection. That required massive amounts of money for transportation networks, for weapons, for hit men, and above all, for bribes — to cops and politicians and soldiers and border agents. 


	Without one umbrella cartel to pay a tax in exchange for protection, there are more cells, and the barrier for entry is lower, which means the lesser crimes El Chapo and El Mayo forbade in Culiacán — kidnappings, extortions — are here to stay until someone else rises up and restores order. Miguel is betting that someone won't be the military.

	











	But he doesn't believe the stories of the demise of the Sinaloa Cartel, either, or that it is even in decline. It is simply reorganizing. 


	I came to Sinaloa hoping to get closer to the truth of how the drug business works, and hoping Miguel could take me there. But I realize now, sitting with him in this cafe, that the longer he's been helping people like me chase the truth, the more elusive it has become. The official story told by official sources, the story we've been trained to trust, is often a distortion, or a downright fabrication. And the stereotypes that form our understanding of the drug trade in Mexico — corrupt cops, narcos who keep tigers as pets, sicarios who kill for fun — often fall apart under closer examination. Most narcos aren't rich. Most of them don't like killing. Very few, if any, own tigers. Mostly they are desperate people, simply trying to make a living, wishing there were some other way. Just like Miguel. 


	He suddenly gets up, shakes my hand, and tells me he has to go. A film crew from Italy has just arrived in Culiacán.

Before you can even say “trick or treat,” Hallmark Channel's 2025 Countdown to Christmas will be underway, with round-the-clock holiday fare and all-new movies and series to celebrate the season. The programming stunt typically kicks off in October and runs right up until Christmas. 

While Hallmark hasn't announced its full line-up yet, we do know about quite a few projects coming your way. Here's a preview of everything we know is on the way for the 16th annual Countdown to Christmas…

Hallmark Channel has already begun promoting Countdown to Christmas with a preview that showed glimpses of what's to come, “with more joy than ever before.” Quick glimpses of upcoming movies show stars like Jonathan Bennett and Janel Parrish are in new movies. But here's what we know for sure is in the works…

The Brenner brothers are back for a third movie in the popular franchise, following up 2022's smash hit “Three Wise Men and a Baby” and 2024's “Three Wiser Men and a Boy.” Walker told EntertainmentNow the movie starts filming in mid-August with tons of familiar faces, including Kimberley Sustad, Margaret Colin, Matt Hamilton, and Miles Marthaller as his son. 

Fans have been asking for a reunion of Hynes and Erin Krakow ever since their 2021 hit “It Was Always You.” They'll finally get it with “Christmas Above the Clouds.” They won't be playing the same characters though, since it's a modern version of “A Christmas Carol.” According to the synopsis, Krakow plays a workaholic CEO who tries to skip Christmas by flying to Australia on her own and is visited by “three quirky spirits” and a surprise run-in with her ex, played by Hynes. 

This follow-up to 2024's “Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story” is set in Buffalo with an all-star cast that includes Holland Roden playing pediatric doctor Morgan Quinn and Matthew Daddario as a longtime friend who's the Bills' VP of Stadium Development Gabe DeLuca. The cast also features Tracy Pollan, Steve Schirripa, Patti Murin, Joe Pantoliano, Caroline Aaron, Bills Head Coach Sean McDermott, and numerous players. 

Filmed in New England in the spring of 2025, the time-travel movie “A Newport Christmas” stars Ginna Claire Mason as Ella, “a charitable and spirited Newport socialite in 1905 who dreams of using her wealth to start a foundation to help others in town. After learning her father intends for her to become engaged to a man she's never met at the upcoming Christmas Eve ball, Ella goes for a nighttime sail in her schooner to clear her head. Upon seeing a comet shoot across the sky, she wistfully wishes for a different life. Ella is shocked to suddenly find Nick, played by Wes Brown, a sailor and local Newport historian, aboard her schooner and accuses him of being a stowaway.”

Andrew Walker and Lacey Chabert reunite onscreen for the first time since 2018's “My Secret Valentine.” According to the movie's logline, “When Naughty or Nice inspector Isabel Haynes (Chabert) is assigned to evaluate mischievous 11-year-old Charlie Duncan, she expects a routine case. But things get complicated when Isabel unexpectedly falls for Charlie's widowed father, Jason Duncan (Walker), and begins to question the rigid rules of her job. As Christmas approaches, Isabel must choose between following the holiday algorithm or following her heart.”

Based on a popular Audible podcast that launched in 2022, the “Mistletoe Murders” cast — including leads Sarah Drew and Peter Mooney — filmed season two of the cozy mystery series in Toronto in the spring.

Filmed in Utah this spring, none of the season two contestants' faces were shown in the new trailer. But in late May, Bennett told the Laughing Place that the second season will include a “surprise element we didn't have before” as well as “bigger challenges, bigger personalities,” and a “chaotic scene.” 

This new reality competition, “Baked With Love: Holiday,” sees 10 pairs of “home bakers” competing in a bake-off using family recipes, with the winners receiving a $50,000 prize.

“Twelve Dates ‘Til Christmas,” first announced in March, is a six-episode, limited series starring “Parenthood” alum Mae Whitman, Emmy winner Jane Seymour, and two-time Oscar nominee Mary McDonnell. Based on the “Twelve Dates of Christmas” novel by Jenny Bayliss, the series was filmed in and around Dublin, Ireland, in the spring of 2025, according to Deadline, even though the storyline takes place near London.

	When Ozzy Osbourne was honored with a funeral procession that snaked through his hometown of Birmingham, fans covered the Black Sabbath bridge and bench with flowers, artwork, personal messages, merchandise, and more. “Ozzy forever,” posters around the locations read. “Birmingham will always love you.” The Central Birmingham Business Improvement District is making sure this won't be forgotten as it works to preserve the thousands of items left in tribute.


	The Central BID team has transported the offerings and started the process of “sorting through them at a secret location, large enough to accommodate the thousands of poignant messages, flowers and gifts,” according to their official website. “They are ensuring they are preserved in the best possible condition, ready to be sent to the Osbourne family.”


	A digital record will be created for all of the tributes, which is being “laid out and catalogued with care” to ensure long-term preservation. Fans left behind “guitars, mini amplifiers, angels, candles, plus lots and lots of toy bats,” the Central BID shared. Black Sabbath shirts, plaques, and albums also appear in the collection.

	











	The Central BID shared images from the location, where the items have been sorted by type. In one image, a note signed by a fan named Angie reads, “Ozzy, your music has made my life so much better. You will always be missed.” Another adds, “To Ozzy, Thank you for bringing the world metal. You are a legend. Rest easy, Prince of Darkness.” Ozzy died of a heart attack on July 22 at the age of 76.

	Flowers from the memorial have also been collected. “The bouquets are set to be close to Ozzy going forward, as they are being mulched and bagged. This confetti compost will be used at Ozzy's final resting place,” the Central BID shared. This includes the purple flowers wrapped in black tissue and ribbon that Sharon Osbourne and their children left at the Black Sabbath bench. “At the wishes of the family, these will also be mulched into the special compost.”


	Birmingham's honorary lord mayor, Zafar Iqbal, shared a statement following Osbourne's death, saying the musician was “more than a music legend — he was a son of Birmingham.” He added: “[I]t was important to the city that we support a fitting, dignified tribute ahead of a private family funeral. We know how much this moment will mean to his fans. We're proud to host it here with his loving family in the place where it all began, and we are grateful that they have generously offered to pay to enable this to happen and support the city is giving him the farewell he deserves.”

A full year after Paramount‘s board approved a deal for Paramount to merge with Skydance, that deal has finally closed, and the $8 billion merger is officially complete.

The deal had been delayed for months amid a standoff with the Trump administration, which sued “60 Minutes” and network CBS, accusing them of favorably editing an interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount chairman Shari Redstone ultimately settled with the president for $16 million, shortly after paving the way for the FCC to approve the merger.

It means one of the oldest studios in Hollywood has exciting new owners in Skydance and David Ellison, who will become the new CEO and chairman of Paramount Global. Ellison has vowed to marry Paramount — which owns Paramount Pictures, CBS, Paramount+, Pluto TV, and cable channels like Nickelodeon, MTV, and BET — with Skydance's financial resources and tech advances.

Under Skydance, Paramount will be restructured into three divisions: studios, direct-to-consumer, and TV media.

 










Upon the deal's close on Thursday morning, Ellison, who will serve as Paramount chairman and CEO, released an open letter about the merger and what to expect in the coming days, weeks, and months. The letter opens: “Today marks Day One of a new Paramount. With the close of the transaction, we unite more than a century of iconic storytelling with the ingenuity and drive of a 15‑year-old studio born in the digital era. I am thrilled and honored to write to you as the Chairman and CEO of Paramount, a Skydance Corporation, as — together with our Board, our new executive leadership team, and our colleagues around the world — we embark on the exciting next chapter of this legendary company.”

Ellison goes on to lay out a forward-thinking plan, noting that “the years ahead will undoubtedly bring formidable challenges, but they will also usher in extraordinary opportunities. We stand at the threshold of a remarkable moment — and our strong conviction is that this company is poised to make the most of the possibilities ahead. Because when creative excellence, cutting‑edge technology, and disciplined stewardship meet, great things happen — on the screen and on the balance sheet.”

As of today, the new Paramount senior leadership team is as follows (via Variety), with Ellison serving as CEO of Paramount and Jeff Shell (former CEO of NBCUniversal) on as president:

 










Andy Gordon, Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Operating OfficerGeorge Cheeks, Chair of TV MediaDana Goldberg, Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Chair of Paramount TelevisionJosh Greenstein, Co-Chair of Paramount Pictures and Vice Chair of PlatformsCindy Holland, Chair of Direct-to-ConsumerStephanie Kyoko McKinnon, General Counsel and Acting Chief Legal OfficerJim Sterner, Chief People OfficerMelissa Zukerman, Chief Communications OfficerAndrew Warren will continue as Interim CFO.Don Granger, President, Motion Picture GroupKevin MacLellan, President, International and Global Content DistributionRebecca Mall, President, Cross Company Initiatives, Franchise, and Corporate MarketingMatt Thunell, President, Paramount Television StudiosKevin Creighton, EVP, Corporate Finance & Investor RelationsTony Driscoll, EVP, Head of Corporate Strategy & DevelopmentEfrain Miron, EVP, Head of Content Strategy & Licensing, DTCJose Turkienicz, EVP, Head of Global OperationsLaura Watson, EVP, Corporate and Executive CommunicationsJane Wiseman, EVP, Head of Originals, DTC

Skydance and Paramount collaborated on “Top Gun: Maverick” and the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and Skydance brings with it an animation department led by former Pixar head John Lasseter, a gaming division, and its own deal with the NFL to pair with CBS's sports rights. While Skydance always seemed like the best option for creators, it could still lead to a lot of changes. The fate of Paramount+ remains the biggest question, as well as Paramount's legacy cable channels that have previously been up for sale.

 










Today's deal closure brings to an end the longest, most protracted, and hectic example of M&A activity in recent Hollywood memory. Skydance at one point pulled out of an acquisition before coming back in, other bidders emerged during a “go-shop” period, as did lawsuits saying that Paramount did not fairly consider other offers. The Trump lawsuit was the biggest and last remaining hurdle, and though the lawsuit was deemed frivolous by many legal experts, it remained in limbo as the standoff continued until Redstone relented. And with the merger dragging out as long as it did, it threatened to be canceled entirely — forcing Redstone to pay a kill fee to Skydance — if a deal wasn't closed by October.

David Ellison as CEO and former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell as president are running the combined Hollywood company, looking for opportunities for investments in growth and cost reductions.



		By Georg Szalai, Alex Weprin 

	August 7, 2025 5:52am	




	Combining entertainment and technology in a new Hollywood giant is paramount for David Ellison. His Skydance Media has closed its takeover, unveiled in July 2024, of Paramount Global to form what the merger partners have called a “next-generation media and technology leader, positioned to win in today's rapidly transforming media landscape.”


	Ellison authored an open letter to shareholders, employees and creative partners, outlining in broad strokes his vision for the company.




	That includes investing in growth areas, “anchored by our creative engines and superior storytelling,” and scaling the company's direct-to-consumer business globally, as well as driving efficiencies.

Tech is a big part of the pitch, with Ellison touting a unified technology stock, merging Paramount+ and Pluto into one platform, and leveraging new technology to boost creatives. “We also want to empower our creative partners with technology that will enable them to tell bigger, more compelling stories fueled by human ingenuity,” Ellison writes.


	And he listed “core commitments” to the company, promising consumers that Paramount would become the go-to-place for entertainment, news and sports, reassuring creative partners that it will “align rights, revenue and recognition,” and investors that it would operate in a cost-effective way. He added, however, that the company “will face some hard but necessary decisions to align our team for growth and efficiency.”

	











	Ellison also sought to reassure CBS News staff, telling them that “we recognize it's been a challenging period and we're deeply grateful for your resilience, professionalism, and unwavering commitment to the news business. We take immense pride in CBS News' legacy of impactful journalism and look forward to continuing to foster a newsroom culture where journalists are empowered, trusted, and equipped to do their best work.”


	Animation, sports and games are among key drivers that can make the combined company a growth story, Ellison and his team have outlined before. Paramount brings the Paramount film and TV studios, Paramount+, CBS, and such cable channels as Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central to Skydance.


	Ellison is chairman and CEO of the new powerhouse, which is set to pursue previously unveiled plans for $2 billion in cost savings, as well as the benefits from a reworked streaming strategy and a core focus on being a creator-friendly entertainment juggernaut. Former NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, who has been working at Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital, will be running the company day-to-day as president alongside Andy Gordon, who will be COO.


	The deal allowed Shari Redstone, who has controlled Paramount via the controlling stake held by her National Amusements since her father Sumner Redstone's death in 2020, to cash out. Paramount co-CEOs Brian Robbins, George Cheeks and Chris McCarthy have been focusing on cost reductions and a healthy content pipeline in the run-up to the Skydance deal close.

	











	“The transaction will strengthen Paramount and enhance its balance sheet flexibility, allowing the company to invest in new initiatives and deliver greater cash flow growth,” the deal partners said previously. “The transaction serves as a catalyst to re-imagine the company's operating model, transform its technology platform, streamline its organization and accelerate other initiatives already underway. The overriding objective of the repositioned New Paramount platform and properties is to bring stability to the business, protect creative independence and to enable investment in growth initiatives.”


	Wall Street analysts will be looking for updates on the company's strategies for its streaming and linear TV businesses, among other things. “While investors wait for the company to secure its regulatory approval, all the same questions over Paramount's future remain,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman had highlighted in a report at the end of February. 


	“Starting with Paramount+, there remains the question as to whether it has the scale to sustain itself in the longer term,” the expert wrote. “Could either an outside partnership, which both management and Ellison have expressed openness to, or renewed investment change that?”


	Ellison, in his letter, sought to reassure staff, who have been rocked by years of uncertainty.


	“We are in the midst of a generational change in our industry—and we understand Paramount has faced its own significant challenges, compounded by the reality of a merger process that stretched out over a considerable time period,” Ellison wrote. But that time of uncertainty is now behind us. Moving forward, we will work with conviction and optimism to transform Paramount into a tech-forward company that blends the creative heart of Hollywood with the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley. By harnessing cutting-edge technologies to serve great storytelling, we will unlock the company's enormous potential.”

	In her nearly 50-year career, Jamie Lee Curtis says she's only improvised one single line: “Make good choices.” These are the words her character, Dr. Tess Coleman, yelled out the car window to her daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan) in the 2003 body-swap comedy Freaky Friday. That beloved, heavily-memed quote is brought back for the new sequel, Freakier Friday, which reunites Curtis and Lohan. Only now, things are a little different: Anna is the one shouting “Make good choices!” and consequently mortifying her own teenage daughter, Harper (Julia Butters). Tess sits behind the wheel, rolling her eyes. “You are so lame,” she tells her. 


	It's a humorous twist for anyone who's seen the first film, but it hits harder for millennials who grew up with Lohan onscreen. Twenty-two years after the original Freaky Friday's debut, the long-awaited sequel we thought might never get made is here — and against all odds, it's actually kind of great. Freakier Friday, directed by Nisha Ganatra, is a charming love letter to Lohan and her generation, and marks the actress' official comeback. So get in, loser. We're going to the Lohanaissance. 

	











	First things first: Anna is far from lame. She's not even a regular mom — she's a cool mom. She abandoned her rock-star dreams and her band, Pink Slip, to raise Harper on her own, though she still writes songs privately. She's also the manager of emerging pop star Ella (played by Never Have I Ever star Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), who's grappling with a very public breakup. Anna is constantly putting out fires, particularly when she gets called in to Harper's high school to discuss her daughter's fight with her British nemesis, Lily (Sophia Hammons). It's there that she meets Lily's dad, Eric (the excellent Manny Jacinto, who goes full Swayze with a Dirty Dancing scene). It's love at first sight, much to the chagrin of their rival daughters.

	Six months in, Anna and Eric are engaged, and deciding whether to stay in California or move their families to England. A consultation with a kooky psychic (who later reveals she's actually a Starbucks barista) played by Vanessa Bayer brings on the body switch. Only it's not just two bodies switching: It's four, with Anna and Harper swapping while Tess and Lily pair off. Quadruple body-swapping is ambitious, and we'll admit we had low expectations, but each actress pulls it off (Hammons as Tess, diving into ice cream: “I haven't had dairy since Bush was president!”). Butters in particular kills it, going from surfer chick to worrying mom clutching a glass of crisp white wine, frantically trying to save her engagement while stuck inside the body of a teenager. (As with Sydney Sweeney, Margaret Qualley, Mikey Madison, and others, Once Upon a Time in…Hollywood helped kick off Butters' career. What the hell was in the water on that set?) 


	We veer into Parent Trap territory as Harper and Lily, now inside the bodies of Lohan and Curtis, respectively, conspire to break off their parents' engagement. But Ganatra takes things a step further with a Meredith Blake cameo, as Elaine Hendrix plays a Rolling Stone editor at Ella's photoshoot; we can neither confirm nor deny that Rolling Stone asks musicians to dress up as strawberry shortcakes. It wouldn't have been shocking to see other Parent Trap Easter eggs: Hendrix sipping an Evian water bottle, Chessy entering with a plate of chocolate chip pancakes, and where on earth is tie-dye girl? Lohan has been playing along with all the nostalgia, though she swears the Oct. 3 wedding date for Anna and Eric, a.k.a. Mean Girls Day, was an accident. Sure, Jan.


	Meanwhile, pre-switch, Curtis is “Gram,” the heartwarming kind who bakes cookies for her granddaughter at 4 a.m. and takes too long deciding when it's turn at a four-way stop. She's still a therapist, and despite crowd-surfing at her last talk-show interview, she's continued to write successful books. If some of the jokes in this film don't work, rest easy knowing none of them are Curtis cracks. After her intense dramatic role in The Bear, it's refreshing to see her in a lighter, funnier role; she totally owns scenes involving the donning of lip plumper for passport photos, or accidentally winning a pickleball match against Grace and Frankie's June Diane Raphael.

	Curtis' best scene, though, is when she (as Lily) and Lohan (as Harper) visit Jake, played by Chad Michael Murray, reprising his role. He's moved on from his barista days and is now the owner of a record store, the classic hot-guy career trajectory. He's clutching a stack of Pink Slip records for Anna to sign for charity, but Harper makes a complete fool of herself in a variety of ways that aren't even a little bit funny. Meanwhile, Tess is hiding behind records, writhing on the ground, directing Anna with sexy cues. When Jake finally spots Tess/Lily in between the aisles, he starts to pine for her and their “Baby One More Time” days. It's all a little High Fidelity — did Jake listen to music because he was miserable, or was he miserable because he listened to music?

	Other characters return, including Mark Harmon as Ryan (who has about two lines), and Anna's brother, Harry (Ryan Malgarini, who has even fewer). Pei-Pei and her mom (Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong, respectively), the Chinese restaurant owners who caused the 2003 body swap, make a cameo at Anna's bachelorette party. Sadly, Harold Gould, who played the earthquake-fearing grandpa in the original, died in 2010, and Willie Garson, who played Tess' neurotic patient Evan, died in 2021. But at least we get some scenes with our favorite substitute teacher, Elton Bates (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is once again running detention, this time forcing his Gen Z students to pick up trash off the ground. 


	And thank god for Pink Slip. Anna reunites with her old bandmates (Christina Vidal and Haley Hudson) onstage at the Wiltern, and they perform “Baby,” her tender ode to Harper. Then they dial it up for a scorching “Take Me Away,” and it's euphoric to see Lohan shredding the guitar after all these years. It's a feel-good Disney moment in a film full of them, complete with fashion montages, wacky science lab experiments, and food fights. And Lohan is dynamite as Anna, whether she's rocking her blazer around Capitol Records, riding around in Jake's red Camaro, or surfing in a badass Blue Crush scene. She's returning at exactly the right time, when millennials are nostalgic for their youth, and younger generations are bringing back shoulder bags and low-rise jeans. That's not to say the film doesn't make fun of millennials — there are some hilarious jabs, like how Facebook is “a database of old people” and Coldplay and John Mayer suck. But if you feel like catching up with the Colemans and revisiting some early-aughts magic, Freakier Friday is a good choice.

			By Armando Tinoco, Anthony D'Alessandro 


	A letter to Warner Bros. Discovery's shareholders this AM has confirmed that Matt Reeves‘ The Batman Part II will finally start filming in the spring.  This is for an Oct. 1, 2027 theatrical release. 


	The note praised the recent success of James Gunn's Superman which has already grossed $560M worldwide. In addition, WBD CEO David Zaslav has other news. 


	“James Gunn is already preparing to write the next installment in the Super family,” he confirmed. 


	“In film, James Gunn is busy preparing the next installments of the DC super family, including Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (2026), Clayface (2026) and the next Wonder Woman. In addition, The Batman II (2027) is preparing to begin shooting next spring, among several other projects in development. The 10-year vision for the DC universe also includes an exciting array of television projects, including The Penguin, the upcoming new season of ‘Peacemaker,' and the debut of ‘Lanterns' in 2026. In a precise and measured way, the DC franchise will increasingly overlay across the studio's broader efforts: from film and TV to consumer products, games, experiences and social.” reads the shareholder note.

	Separately, according to Production List, the Robert Pattinson-starring The Batman II has “officially” entered the pre-production stage.

	Pattinson is set to reprise his role as the Dark Knight, with Reeves confirming that Colin Farrell would also return as The Penguin, giving continuity to the HBO series.

	Part II was initially slated to open in 2025, but has suffered several delays along the way. Earlier this year, Reeves confirmed he was continuing his work on the script and was expected to begin filming by the end of the year.


DC Studios co-head James Gunn defended the delays, noting that it was “fairly common.”


	“To be fair, a 5 year gap or more is fairly common in sequels,” he wrote on Threads last year. “7 years between Alien and Aliens. 14 years between Incredibles. 7 years between the first two Terminators. 13 years between Avatars. 36 years between Top Guns. And, of course, 6 years between Guardians Vol 2 and Vol 3.”

	











	Gunn confirmed that delaying the release until 2027 was due to the writing, saying, “There isn't a full script,” and adding, “Once there is a finished script, there is around two years for pre-production, shooting, and post-production on big films.”

	In July of this year, Gunn confirmed he had Reeves' The Batman Part II script and it was “great.”

Superhero crap is destroying what little was left of original creativity in American movies. Please make one last film in which all of them die in a final apocalypse leaving nothing but an eternally toxic, never revivable pile of ashes.

I see. So, the ultimate hope is that TV is not its own profitable stream of revenue, rather, it will make up for the lack of income from theatrical releases.

It would be patently false to declare By The Stream, the 32nd film from South Korean naturalist Hong Sang-soo, to be the most personally revealing of his oeuvre. That title is likely reserved for 2017's On The Beach At Night Alone, which follows an actress (Kim Min-hee) as she spends a chilly evening wandering the German coast, fretting if the married director she's sleeping with actually cares for her. Hong and Kim announced their extramarital affair during that film's Seoul premiere, a declaration that effectively saw the actress blacklisted from the Korean film industry. Since then, she's solely acted in Hong's output, appearing in 11 of the director's 13 films since On The Beach. But By The Stream continues to meld the auteur and his muse with its two central characters, employing several of Hong's narrative and technical staples with an air of heightened self-reflection. 

Here, Kim plays Jeonim, a visiting artist and lecturer at a women's university who finds herself in a tight bind. With only 10 days before her students are expected to perform a short skit during a performing arts showcase, it's revealed that their boyishly handsome theater professor has been engaging each of them in clandestine romances. He's swiftly removed from his post, leaving the class without a director for the approaching event (and with unresolved tension surrounding their simultaneous courtships). Jeonim calls her uncle, Sieon (Kwon Hae-hyo, another Hong regular), a once-esteemed actor who has since been blacklisted from the industry over a vague political infraction. 

To Jeonim's surprise, he accepts the temporary post, in part to relive the experience he had directing a short play at the same university some 40 years ago. As he and Jeonim rekindle their bond, familiar Hong scenes unfold: Soju is endlessly poured, Korean delicacies are served, sudden zooms and pans are utilized in order not to break long takes. Romantic tensions are also stoked, both between the disgraced professor and one of his students as well as between Jeonim's uncle and her boss Jeong (Cho Yun-hee), who gushes over the former actor's talent. The latter scenario is to Jeonim's thinly veiled chagrin, as she ponders what implications their potential affair might incur both personally and professionally. 

As with many of Hong's films, the fact that the protagonists are artists—namely poets, directors, actors, painters and writers—is typical. Yet details in By The Stream feel more relevant to Hong and Kim's joint experiences as a couple, riffing on the trials they continue to overcome. The most obvious of these allusions is Sieon's blacklisted status, but the impressionistic tapestries woven by Jeonim feel directly inspired by Hong's diminishing vision (which he previously evoked in the intentionally blurry lensing of 2023's In Water). Once again, the amorphous quality of water serves as a metaphor for bleary eyes, as Jeonim sits by the stream near campus and sketches abstract images for her massive two-meter pieces. Entitled Flowing Water, her artwork also feels directly linked to Hong's own artistic approach. “Being able to complete this whole structure by myself,” she says, “that's satisfying.” The filmmaker has served as director, writer, editor, cinematographer, and composer of his most recent projects, first wearing all these hats with Introduction in 2021.

The familial dynamic between Jeonim and Sieon serves as an interesting buffer for their real-life counterparts, allowing Hong and Kim to reflect on each other's personhood without the obfuscating effect of their domestic partnership. In a stunning monologue during a 10-minute oner, Jeonim recounts a “mystical” incident in which she spontaneously bled from the eyes for several days, effectively blinding her before providing divine clarity. Sieon grapples with his confidence as a performer now riddled with restrictions, and the skit's subsequent staging is met with criticism on the basis of gender and politics despite its delicate execution. (For context, Kim was met with international acclaim for her bold, sexually kinetic performance in Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, which premiered only a year before she was blacklisted for her affair with Hong). Once one is considered a persona non grata, even the most calculated and comparatively small-scale of efforts will still garner considerable backlash. 

But the central scandal of By The Stream also finds Hong and Kim probing the nature of their coupling. Jeonim confronts her disgraced former colleague during a crisp fall day on a park bench. “It was just something you shouldn't do,” she scolds in regard to his pursuit of the student actresses. “You made it impossible to work with them.” While an added ethical boundary is at play here—as well as several more hearts involved—there is an intriguing dialogue being had about the validity of pursuing such a relationship in general. One could read this plot detail as a tongue-in-cheek assertion that Hong and Kim's affair is relatively tame, based on mutual attraction and creative appreciation as opposed to the professor's predatory proclivities. Indeed, a revelation regarding the lengthy process of divorce seems to balance things out by referring to the director's experience with his first wife, who long refused to honor Hong's legal request for separation.

If Jeonim is a loose avatar for Hong, the flowing water she draws inspiration from acts as a meditative reflection pool. His life—now inextricably tethered to Kim's—is refracted and shaped by the path carved by the mighty Han river, which Jeonim follows upstream as part of her ongoing tapestry work. Though it might be the path of most resistance, it is also one that eventually leads to placid calm. Hong's recent films have been categorized as overtly languid, narratively slight, and relentlessly quotidian. By The Stream incorporates (at times literal) dramatic details without ever sacrificing the veristic quality of his work, only made possible by the deep artistic and intimate connection he shares with Kim. With Hong's eyesight diminishing, one wonders if he might be increasingly relying on Kim's vision, both in the sensory and artistic sense—their ongoing project of mutual creation is only getting deeper and more transcendent.

In this week's The Contenders, it's a three-way battle for the No. 1 spot.  


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 16, we look at whether Chappell Roan's new single will be able to get into the mix with KPop Demon Hunters and Alex Warren in the fight atop the Hot 100.

Chappell Roan, “The Subway” (KRA/Amusement/Island/Republic): Like New Yorkers anxious to get to work on time, Chappell Roan's fans had been waiting for “The Subway” far longer than they'd initially expected. Roan had debuted the song at a couple live dates in summer 2024, but for the next year, there was no indication of an imminent studio release. Then finally, last month, reports of Chappell filming a new music video in New York began to circulate, followed by an official announcement weeks later that the song would finally arrive on the evening of Thursday, July 31, with an official video to follow Friday morning.

	Fans were certainly ready for the dreamy new song, which debuted atop the Spotify Daily Top Songs USA chart — with over 3.9 million streams in its first full day of release, a high for 2025 — while also briefly topping the iTunes real-time chart, and shooting to the top of YouTube's Trending chart for music once its video was released the next morning. (The song's impact on the Apple Music real-time charts has been somewhat less, as it has thus far peaked at No. 6.) The song's daily numbers have perhaps inevitably receded from that first-day boom, but remain robust, with “Subway” reigning for most of the week on the Spotify daily chart. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Will it be enough for “The Subway” to pull in atop the Hot 100? That might be a challenge, as it will not be getting any help from physical sales — the vinyl single of the song sold on Roan's website is currently scheduled to ship “on or before Halloween” — and not much support yet from radio, though the song has early boosters in SiriusXM's Hits 1, iHeartMedia's WIHT Washington, D.C., and Cox Media Group's WBLI Long Island, N.Y., with far more stations still playing her enduring hit “Pink Pony Club” (No. 11 on Radio Songs this week).  


	But if the new song can gain a little extra momentum on streaming late in the week, and maybe find a small extra boost or two — like Roan's Island labelmate Sabrina Carpenter did on her way to a No. 1 debut for “Manchild” a couple months ago — it's not impossible that “Subway” could find its way to the top. And regardless, a debut in the top three seems very likely, which would make the song the highest-charting of Roan's career, passing the shared No. 4 peaks of current signature hits “Good Luck, Babe!” and the aforementioned “Pink Pony Club.”  


HUNTR/X, EJAE, Audrey Nuna & Rei Ami, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): It's six weeks now into the pop culture takeover of KPop Demon Hunters, and against all odds, the soundtrack is still growing. The Netflix soundtrack currently claims the No. 2 spots on both the Billboard 200 (with the full film soundtrack) and the Hot 100 (with HUNTR/X's “Golden”), with the gaps shrinking every week between it and Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem and Alex Warren's “Ordinary” on the two charts, respectively. 


	It's a little closer to clearing that final hurdle on the Hot 100, with “Golden” having long lapped “Ordinary” on DSPs — it's now led Streaming Songs for two weeks — and also sitting right behind it on the Digital Song Sales chart this week (Nos. 4 and 5, respectively). The question of radio remains, but “Golden” is also starting to really make its presence felt there: the song is up 73% in plays Aug. 1-4 over the same period the week before, according to Luminate, and approaching the top 25 on Pop Airplay next week.  

	











	If “Golden” continues to surge, this could be the week it has its moment atop the Hot 100. 


Alex Warren, “Ordinary” (Atlantic): Don't count out “Ordinary” just yet: After finally starting to slip in radio airplay last week, the nine-week Hot 100 No. 1 has rebounded slightly this week, and the song should secure an eighth week atop the Radio Songs chart. This is happening while his subsequent single “On My Mind” with ROSÉ is also gaining in airplay and his brand-new “Eternity” is also drawing some early radio attention. And like “Golden,” “Ordinary” has been discounted to 69 cents on iTunes for this tracking week — and is benefiting from buzz over his and Luke Combs' Lollapalooza performance of the song – meaning Warren and his team are still hoping to secure that benchmark 10th week atop the Hot 100 before potentially falling to Roan or HUNTR/X.

Stephen Colbert is not impressed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cut $500 million in funding for vaccines. On the latest episode of The Late Show, Colbert took aim at the Health and Human Services secretary over the decision, which former Surgeon General Jerome Adams said “is going to cost lives.” 


	“Now, we have 10 more months of this show and I want to give a measured, nonpartisan response here,” Colbert said. He then raised a middle finger to the camera and declared, “Fuck you, you roid-addled nepo-carnie!” 


	Colbert recounted how Kennedy is “nixing” 22 projects that use mRNA technology. “But that's the latest vaccine technology,” Colbert replied. “That's like saying, ‘Kids, I'm turning off the GPS. We're going to make our way to Six Flags by using the stars! Hand Daddy the sextant.'”


	In response to Kennedy claiming that mRNA technology, which uses synthetic gene sequences to teach cells how to create antibodies without needing to introduce viral particles, doesn't “perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,” Colbert got straight to the point. 

	











	“Counterpoint: Fuck you, you roadkill-munching, luddite, human Slim Jim,” Colbert said, flipping off the camera again. “You're gonna kill people. Why would you say mRNA vaccines don't perform well against upper respiratory infections? The National Institute of Health said they prevented an estimated 14.4 million deaths. Why on Earth is RFK Jr. so anxious to fill our streets with dead bodies?”

	Kennedy's recent claims are misleading the public about the science behind vaccines. A 2023 study published by the National Institute of Health on the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Covid found that “despite certain drawbacks such as strong immunogenicity and the potential for triggering irrelevant immune responses, the authorized mRNA vaccines are considered highly effective and safe.” 


	The secretary has waged a full-fledged war against the nation's vaccination infrastructure since his confirmation to Trump's Cabinet. He downplayed the severity of a deadly measles outbreak in Texas — a disease that had almost been eliminated by robust public vaccination programs. In June, he fired an entire panel of vaccine experts tasked with helping shape seasonal vaccine recommendations, replacing them with loyalists and ideologues.

Like it or not, South Park has taken on a weirdly heavy role in our culture at the moment, one in which the actual residents of the actual White House both attack, and try to co-opt, the show's messaging, massively elevating the series' profile, and its function as a cultural barometer. Said meter, meanwhile, continues to point straight at a full-on war with not just Donald Trump, but his whole administration, as the show continues to basically dare Trump and his associates to make it important. “Got A Nut,” the second episode of the show's 27th season, doubled down on that scorched earth approach tonight, building on the swings taken by the show's micropenis-festooned season premiere. That included aggressive attacks on ICE, Charlie Kirk, and most especially Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, depicted as merciless attention seeker whose obsessive desire to shoot dogs didn't stop with the one she actually copped to killing in her 2024 autobiography.

South Park‘s decision to stop fucking around with surrogate characters like Mr. Garrison and just say “Kristi Noem loves shooting dogs, up to and including Krypto from Superman” reveals a show all-but-begging for another confrontation with Trump and his associates—see also JD Vance being depicted as the sexually servile Tattoo to Trump's Mr. Roarke, because there's nothing 16-year-old South Park fans love like a good Fantasy Island reference. As ever, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem content to swing haphazardly between puerile jokes about “masterdebaters” and Noem's face falling apart with more pointed material about how so many of the people propping up the current administration are just looking to “make their nut,” whether it's by stoking online anger, or helping ICE literally invade heaven to deport brown people. It's classic troll tactics: Throw everything you can at the target, because something is going to get the blood pressure to rise.

South Park has always occupied what feels like an outsized role in American culture: It makes more money, and garners more attention, than any number of shows that might approach cultural material in less bombastic or more thoughtful fashion, simply by dint of being willing to take the biggest, loudest swings. It's an approach that pays off best when reality feels at its dumbest, and now that the show's fully committed to focusing its ire on Trump, the question simply becomes whether the White House will continue to play along—or if the Very Normal Personalities currently occupying it will be able to resist letting themselves be trolled.

Music legend and “The Voice” coach Kelly Clarkson made the heartbreaking announcement on August 6, 2025, that she was postponing the remaining shows of her Las Vegas residency, revealing that the reason was due to a family emergency involving her ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock. 

On August 7, his family revealed that Blackstock died of cancer at age 48, per People.  

“It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” a rep told the outlet in a statement. “Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family. We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

Brandon was the son of Elisa Gayle Ritter and talent agent Narvel Blackstock, who married in 1973, per IMDb. The couple had three kids, including Brandon, before they divorced in 1988.

Narvel Blackstock then married country legend and fellow “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire in 1989, while managing her career. The two had a son, Shelby, but divorced in 2015. 

Brandon followed in his dad's footsteps, managing music artists through their Nashville firm, Starstruck Management, which still represents Blake Shelton, Carly Pearce, and several other country artists. 

In 2006, Brandon met Clarkson — just four years after she skyrocketed to fame on “American Idol” — at the Academy of Country Music Awards, according to Us Weekly. At the time, his dad was managing Clarkson's career, and Brandon was still married to his first wife, Melissa Ashworth, with whom he had two kids — Savannah and Seth. 

Brandon's divorce from Ashworth was finalized in 2012, the same year that he proposed to Clarkson, per IMDb. He and Clarkson married in 2013, which meant McEntire was Clarkson's mother-in-law for two years — and the couple had two kids, daughter River Rose, now 11, and son Remington, now 9. 

Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020, according to E! News, beginning a nearly three-year battle over assets and alleged mishandling of her talent fees. She was managed by Starstruck's team from 2007 to 2020, per E! News. 

Their divorce was eventually finalized in 2022, and the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement ordered Brandon to return $2,641,374 of paid commissions from when he was Clarkson's manager. 

Blackstock left music management in the midst of their divorce, according to Us Weekly, and focused on becoming a rodeo manager in Montana, where the two shared a ranch. A judge ruled in 2021 that Clarkson would get to keep the ranch, per USA Today. 

In December 2024, the U.S. Sun reported that Blackston founded Valley View Rodeo, which he'd been running with Clarkson's former assistant, Brittany Jones. They also ran Headwater Livestock Auction in Three Forks, Montana, together.

Clarkson wrote in a social media statement, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them,” added Clarkson. “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”

Brandon, 48, is the son of Elisa Gayle Ritter and talent agent Narvel Blackstock, who married in 1973, per IMDb. The couple had three kids, including Brandon, before they divorced in 1988.

	As Metallica announce one of their most intimate gigs to date, the group have addressed rumors their celebrated live show will be heading to the Las Vegas Sphere.


	While metal icons Metallica are currently gearing up to embark upon the home stretch of their 2025 touring plans with shows in Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, the group have announced a special one-off show in New York later this month.

	Taking place on Aug. 28 at Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett on Long Island, the 250-capacity venue makes the show one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers' most intimate to date. 


	Presented by SiriusXM to celebrate the launch of the Maximum Metallica channel the following day, tickets are being distributed via contests by both the band and Sirius XM.


	Per Brooklyn Vegan, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich spoke to Howard Stern on Wednesday (Aug. 6) to discuss the upcoming gig, where the co-founding percussionist also addressed current rumors that the band may be bringing their show to Las Vegas venue Sphere as one of its famed residencies.


	According to a recent report by Vital Vegas, unnamed sources have pointed towards a potential residency from Metallica at the Sphere in fall 2026. However, Ulrich stated he was unable to confirm these rumors due to there being “nothing to confirm.”

	











	“But I'm not going to deny it, because we're all such fans of this venue,” he explained. “All of our managers and our production people have been there and looked at it. It's something that we're considering, [but] nothing is etched in stone or green-lit. It's something that we're looking at at some point when the 2026 tour is done.”


	Officially known as Sphere at the Venetian Resort, the immersive venue officially opened its doors in September 2023, with U2 launching a 40-date run of shows at the venue. Since then, the likes of Phish, Dead & Company, the Eagles, and Kenny Chesney have all performed residencies, with the Zac Brown Band set to appear following the completion of the Backstreet Boys' current run of shows.


	“I was there seeing U2 the first night, when they took that stage, I wanted to see it for myself before I saw it on YouTube or read about it,” Ulrich told Stern. “I was there, like everybody else that was there that night, I was completely blown away, and felt that was the beginning of another chapter in live performances.”


	“I'm not going to bulls–t you, I would f–king love to do it, let there be no question about it. It's not signed, sealed and delivered, but speaking to me and asking my opinion I would f–king love to do it.”


	Metallica will wrap their 2025 touring plans with tours of Australia and New Zealand in November, followed by dates in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. Their current M72 World Tour will wrap in July 2026 following dates in Europe and the U.K..

Entering a rarefied strata previously occupied only by films like Gotti, Problem Child, and Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol, Ice Cube's new sci-fi movie/Amazon commercial War Of The Worlds has achieved that rarest of things: Consensus. Specifically, the bad kind, as the new “screenlife” film has just achieved a rare 0 percent fresh rating on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

﻿

Now, admittedly, the new movie—directed by music video guy Rich Lee, and starring an extremely sleepy-seeming Ice Cube as a Homeland Security officer who tries to stop an alien invasion from the comfort of his laptop—is only rolling with 20 reviews tallied at this point. (That puts it well below other “0 percent” luminaries like Adam Sandler's The Ridiculous 6—36 reviews—or the all-time record holder, Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever, which brought together an incredible 118 critics in a shared chorus of hate back in 2002.) But it does seem like War has potential to grow, especially as social media has been having a field day mocking the film lately, partially for how much of it seems to be occupied by Ice Cube looking quizzically into a webcam, and most especially for its brand integration with producer Amazon: It took artistic bravery, we'd argue, to have the fate of the world hinge on an Amazon drone delivery (complete with showing Cube's character type the retail juggernaut's name into his search bar), and then extra-special super bravery to have the characters bribe a houseless guy to risk his life to help them with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.

Interestingly, just about every review surveyed by RT acknowledges that the film could, hypothetically be good, were it not burdened by lousy acting, a largely incoherent script, and the looming feeling of Jeff Bezos breathing down its neck. There have, after all, been several very good movies that have used the “screenlife” concept for both thrills and alternative storytelling; this just isn't one of them—and you very much don't have to take our word for it.

“Taken” star Liam Neeson, who has been all over the news recently for appearing to start a red-hot romance with his “Naked Gun” costar Pamela Anderson, listed his luxurious New York City penthouse for sale back in March 2025. Now, the actor has just sold it for $10.3 million, per a New York Post report.

The report says Neeson shared the home with his late wife Natasha Richardson, who died in 2009, and raised the pair's two boys there.

Neeson previously spoke on British talk show “Lorraine” about being a New Yorker. He said in a 2016 appearance that despite living in the city for around 22 years, he doesn't think he will ever feel like a New Yorker. He went on, “I love being a universal citizen of New York,” and emphasized how he enjoys the ability to blend in. “Certainly nobody cares if you're in movies,” he said. 

Realtor.com says the comfortable crib is located in the heart of Lincoln Square. It boasts huge windows with panoramic views and tall ceilings.

The outlet lists a chef's kitchen complete with marble countertop, and a great room with custom millwork and a view of Central Park among the residence's standout features.

Neeson slashed the price twice, originally listing the dwelling for $12.75 million in 2014, before relisting it for $10.8 million in the spring of 2025. It ultimately sold for $500,000 less, but the “Cold Pursuit” star still turned a large profit. He purchased the home for just under $4 million back in 1999.

Pamela Anderson has left Hollywood for the serenity of her native Canada. Back in October 2024, she spoke exclusively to Women's Wear Daily about her decision. “I start each day when I'm home in my rose garden,” she revealed, before calling the move a “homecoming” that helped her “look at my life and remember who I was.”

She also told the outlet, “I didn't want anything that had happened to me define me. I wanted what I do to define me… all these realizations came to me in the rose garden.”

Western Living calls Anderson's Ladysmith, Vancouver Island home a “whimsical, ‘funky grandma' dream come true,” saying the property has been in the “Baywatch” star's family for years, and was left untouched for 25 of those before the actress transformed it.

Designer Francesca Albertazzi was key in giving the space its cozy, rustic charm.

One year after having surgery to remove painful endometriosis, actress Janel Parrish updated fans about her ongoing struggles with what she called a “horrible, isolating disease.”

The Hallmark star and “Pretty Little Liars” alum opened up in a TikTok video on August 2, 2025, and shared it to her Instagram Stories, hoping to build community and hear from others who've been through it. 

For my #endosisters #endometriosis sound off in the comments, tell your stories. We are not alone and we are strong 🤍

Sitting on a couch at home, Parrish began her video by saying, “Hi my loves. I hope this finds the right audience. I'm speaking directly to my endo sisters. Endo sisters, if you're here — stay if you want to talk about this horrible, isolating disease.”

The condition, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine, occurs when endometrial tissue, which lines the uterus, grows outside the uterus and builds up, causing “inflammation, scarring and painful cysts.”

Hoping to build community and hear from others who've battled the condition, Parrish said, “I just feel like there is so much misinformation out there, and I'm really frustrated, and I'm trying to educate myself more on this disease and learn more about it, and I feel like the more that we can shed light on it and find a community and talk about it together, the less scary and isolating it is.” 

“So about a year ago, I had my first surgery to remove endometriosis cysts,” she continued. “I had ablation as well, and then my gyno put me on Orilissa for about six horrible months. A year after my surgery, we've got the news that the endo is growing back.”

“And now I've found that it's time to educate myself more on this disease,” Parrish said, “not just trust what my gyno is saying, and seek out other opinions, specifically from endometriosis specialists. And I'm learning so much more than I mean. It's blowing my mind what I've learned, and I'm curious to also hear all of your stories … and how you've found treatment.” 

Parrish said that she was frustrated that her gynecologist had been telling her to “just get pregnant” as a solution because “there's no better treatment.” The “Return to Office” star said she'd “been trying” and that it “hasn't happened,” and that she wonders if the endometriosis is actually why she hasn't been able to get pregnant. 

“Also, like, I'm reading a lot of things now that are saying that's not necessarily the case,” Parrish continued. “Pregnancy isn't necessarily a treatment for endometriosis. So I'm just trying to educate myself. I'm trying to stay calm. I'm trying to tell my story in the hopes that it will help some of you out there who are getting misinformation as well and are feeling alone, and maybe we can just find each other and talk about these things and help each other.”

Parrish first opened up about her endometriosis in June 2024, when she shared a photo in her Instagram Stories, taken from her hospital bed, of the medical bracelet around her wrist as she held hands with her husband, Chris Long, whom she married in 2018, per People.

“After months of excruciating pain and not knowing why,” Parrish wrote at the time, “I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and underwent surgery to remove cysts and scar tissue as a result of the disease.”

Her August 2025 update on TikTok has generated robust discussion in her comment section, just as she'd hoped, with thousands of women who've been struggling with the disease sharing their stories.  Parrish has shared encouraging words with many of them. 

When one woman wrote, “Omg finally someone who talks about endometriosis … i was diagnosed one year ago and been on hormonal pills since then,” Parrish replied, “I feel you. 🥺”

Another woman shared, “I think what doesn't get talked about enough is that the specialists who use the proper technique don't take insurance, as insurance doesn't see it as a necessary surgery. It's so difficult for women to get the proper care.” Parrish replied, “You're right this is an excellent and very sad point 😔🤍”

It's one of the weirder knock-on effects of the Rise Of Marvel that way more moviegoers are likely to see a film's full credits roll than they used to; god help you, after all, if you walk out early and miss some cute little throwback clip to the old cartoon.. That might explain why people have been fairly quick to notice that Universal recently mixed up its final credit sequences, in a decidedly litigious way: Specifically, by adding a line of text, way at the end of the credits, that states that the film “may not be used to train AI.” Per THR, the new language has appeared in several Universal releases since June, including How To Train Your Dragon, Jurassic World Rebirth, and The Bad Guys 2.

THR notes that the language—which also states “This motion picture is protected under the laws of the United States and other countries” and “Unauthorized duplication, distribution or exhibition may result in civil liability and criminal prosecution”— differs a bit between countries, including citing, in relevant areas, a European Union law that specifically allows copyright holders to opt their work out of being used in “scientific research.” But the gist is pretty clear, as are the motives for including it: Universal is hunting for more ammo in its ongoing battles against AI companies like Midjourney, the “bottomless pit of plagiarism” it's currently co-suing with Disney.

That suit is still pending (although other AI companies have recently won suits against book authors brought on similar grounds), so it's a bit difficult to see how adding additional warnings now isn't a bit like closing the barn door after the horse-with-a-distractingly-incorrect-number-of-legs has already bolted. Still, it's hard to fault Universal for wanting to bulk up its legal arguments, given how existential these suits are going to be for creators trying to fend off the copying machines; adding a couple of sentences to the end of the movie feels like a pretty classic “no harm in trying” idea.

Three weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard tried to discredit Donald Trump's Russia scandal and started throwing around words like “treason,” the conspiratorial DNI has certainly succeeded in generating some conversation.

On the one hand, Republicans and conservative media outlets have seized on Gabbard's accusations as proof that the entire controversy surrounding the president and Russia's efforts in support of his 2016 candidacy is a “hoax.” On the other hand, every independent analysis of Gabbard's findings have pointed in the opposite direction: There was no “hoax”; the underlying scandal remains real; and the DNI's claims are “ludicrous.”

Officials from Democratic and Republican administrations urged the public to recognize Gabbard's conspiracy theories as obvious nonsense, while intelligence officials launched a behind-the-scenes effort to discourage the DNI from even releasing her discredited claims in the first place.

Gabbard appeared this week on Fox News — a network that has embraced her latest allegations with considerable enthusiasm — and was asked a straightforward question.

“Now, director, you said there was ‘irrefutable' evidence that [Barack Obama] was the mastermind of this intelligence manipulation and the perpetuation of the Russia hoax,” host Laura Ingraham said. “What is that irrefutable evidence for our viewers tonight?”

Gabbard responded by pointing to a National Security Council meeting, held in December 2016 — after Trump was elected and during the presidential transition process — that Obama called to discuss Russia's operation. As part of that meeting, the Democratic then-president made some standard directives to intelligence officials. Gabbard added:

[V]ery specifically, they were tasked to create an intelligence assessment that detailed how Moscow tried to influence the election. Not ‘if,' but ‘how.' And this was the beginning of this manufactured intelligence assessment where they knowingly wrote things in this assessment that were false, and they knew they were false.

If Gabbard was under the impression that this made sense and her on-air comments constituted persuasive and “irrefutable” evidence that justified her bizarre allegations of treason, she was mistaken.

For one thing, we've known about that National Security Council meeting for years. It was discussed in some detail in the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee's report, and as Media Matters' Matt Gertz explained, the GOP-led panel didn't find anything remarkable about Obama's instructions.

On the contrary, the committee reviewed the assessment that Obama sought and concluded that it was “coherent and well-constructed,” featuring “proper analytic tradecraft,” and that its authors experienced “no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions.”

But what about Gabbard's claim that officials were told to put together an intelligence assessment that detailed “how,” not “if,” Russia targeted the election? That's not scandalous either: By December 2016, U.S. intelligence agencies had already compiled voluminous evidence, collected over the course of months, documenting Moscow's efforts.

The “if” question, in other words, had already been answered. At that point, there was no need to ask it again. To see this as “treasonous” is ridiculous.

Put another way, Gabbard appeared on Fox News — a network where she used to work as a paid contributor — and was asked to support her claims about “irrefutable” evidence. Given the opportunity, she presented a big nothingburger.

On the surface, it might not seem especially surprising that the national intelligence director has struggled to bolster her own baseless conspiracy theories, but let's not forget that a great many Republican officials are heavily invested in the idea that Gabbard knows what she's talking about. Indeed, Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation based almost entirely on Gabbard's claims.

Given that the DNI can't defend her own claims, maybe that ought to raise some red flags for Republicans who are relying on her?

Scientists have synthesized methanetetrol, an elusive alcohol that could be the foundation of alien life.

Chemists have synthesized a "super alcohol" previously thought to be too unstable to exist. The molecule was formed under extreme, "space-like" conditions and may shed light on the complex reactions required to form extraterrestrial life.

The super alcohol is called methanetetrol and is the only alcohol with four oxygen and hydrogen groups around a single carbon atom. It is thought to be a key building block for life in the universe. "This work pushes the boundaries of what we know about chemistry in space," study co-author Ralf Kaiser, a chemist at the University of Hawaii, said in a statement.

Methanetetrol is a type of ortho acid, a class of compounds thought to be critical in the chemistry of early life. However, these compounds are hard to isolate and study. Methanetetrol's high number of oxygen bonds, for example, make it very unstable and likely to break down if not kept in specific environmental conditions.

Methanetetrol doesn't occur naturally on Earth, but scientists have theorized about its existence and chemical structure for more than a century, according to the statement.

To emulate how methanetetrol might form in space, the researchers put water and carbon dioxide in a minus 451 degree Fahrenheit (minus 268 degrees Celsius) cryocooler, and then exposed the mixture to cosmic ray-like radiation to trigger the necessary chemical reactions to bring these molecules together.

Using ultraviolet light, the team then detected small amounts of the super alcohol in a gaseous form. They revealed their findings in a study published July 14 in the journal Nature Communications.

This work "pushes experimental and detection capabilities to the 'final frontier, the next level beyond what could be accomplished before due to the lack of experimental and computational approaches," Kaiser said in another statement.

Now that they are able to study methanetetrol, astrobiologists can learn how this alcohol is synthesized and reacts with other molecules in the coldest parts of space, such as the dust clouds where stars and planets form.

"You have this compact, carbon-oxygen molecule that just really wants to go 'boom,'" study co-author Ryan Fortenberry, an astrochemist at the University of Mississippi, said in the statement. "And when it does, when you give it any kind of energy, you'll have water, hydrogen peroxide and a number of other potential compounds that are important for life."

Methanetetrol is like "a seed of life molecule," he explained, that could be a building block of life across the universe. "It's something that can lead to more complex chemistry if given the opportunity."

—What energy source sparked the evolution of life?

Fortenberry likened the alcohol to an acorn, which can't grow into a tree on its own, but requires the right conditions and reactions to do so. "It's like a prebiotic bomb," he said.

The chemists concluded that, because it can form in the space-like conditions of a lab, methanetetrol can also form in space. "If we can find places where methanetetrol forms naturally, we know that it is a place that has the potential building blocks to support life," Fortenberry said.

When staff members were frightened by unexplained paranormal activity, the royal family attempted to rid their estate of any lingering spirits

 Did Queen Elizabeth and her mother really hold an exorcism at one of their royal residences?


 The rumor about the supernatural event can be traced back to royal biographer Kenneth Rose, who wrote in his journal about a ceremony reportedly held at Sandringham House in 2000.


 After reports from staff about strange and frightening phenomena in the bedroom where Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI, died in 1952, the Queen Mother reportedly decided to stage a "religious cleansing ritual" to rid the room of any possible ominous spirits.

 "It wasn't a conventional exorcism," historian and royal biographer Robert Hardman explained in a recent episode of his podcast, Queens, Kings and Dastardly Things. "There was no dramatic casting out of demons, like you see in films. It was said that the room contained a troubled spirit and that the parson was supposed to bless the space."


 Rose claimed that Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and her lady-in-waiting, Prue Penn, took part in the ceremony, which consisted of taking Holy Communion and saying special prayers, with the goal of ridding the space of its seeming "restlessness."


 "No one was quite sure who the ghost was supposed to be, despite it appearing in the room where George VI had died," Hardman noted. "Rose speculated whether it might be the ghost of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, who had died a few years before."

 It's unclear if any of the royal attendees actually believed in the paranormal; however, Hardman thinks their attendance — especially that of the ever-pragmatic Queen Elizabeth — may have been more as a show of support and action towards their frightened staff.


 "The late Queen had a strong faith, but she was not superstitious," Hardman said. "She did not have time for these wilder theories – but she did have a strong sense of the spiritual, as does King Charles."


 The King himself is said to have had at least one paranormal experience at Sandringham. In his book, Britain's Ghostly Heritage, author John West claims that the then-Prince of Wales had a frightening encounter in a library on the estate, which left him and a staff member bolting from the room.

 The beloved Norfolk estate is where the royal family typically spends Christmas and New Year's. The tradition was started by Queen Elizabeth in 1988, meaning all of her grandchildren grew up holidaying at the beloved home.

 These days, the family's holiday traditions are being passed on to a new generation. On Christmas Eve, they gather for a formal, black-tie dinner and to exchange gifts. In his 2023 memoir, Spare, Prince Harry recalled how the royal gift exchange might differ from the average family.


 “We were at Sandringham in a big room with a long table covered with white cloth and white name cards. By custom, at the start of the night, each of us located our place, stood before our mound of presents," he wrote. "Then suddenly, everyone began opening at the same time. A free-for-all, with scores of family members talking at once and pulling at bows and tearing at wrapping paper.”


 On Christmas morning, the family walks together to St. Mary Magdalene Church, a 16th-century parish located on the Sandringham Estate, greeting locals, fans and members of the press along the way. After the service, they walk back to Sandringham House to enjoy the day together.

Comedian Matt Rife may have landed himself in supernatural trouble after acquiring what is believed to be the world's most haunted doll, Annabelle. His plans to exhibit the doll to the public have raised alarm, especially within the paranormal community. The news came after the death of Dan Rivera, who passed away while on the US tour with the doll. However, no foul play was detected in his death, and he died of “natural causes”. 

Psychic medium Matt Fraser has now issued a chilling warning as he told the Daily Mail that Rife's move could unleash “dark, aggressive energy.”

Fraser told the Daily Mail, “Because of all the hype surrounding the Annabelle doll, from naming her to interacting with her and now putting her on display, people are unintentionally breathing life into something that should never be awakened.” 

The TV personality known for Meet The Frasers explained, “The energy builds with every mention, every photo, and every attempt to provoke a reaction. This is not just an old doll, it is a vessel tied to dark, earthbound energy.” He continued, “Dolls do not just become possessed on their own. A spirit must be invited in, often through dark rituals or intentional acts of black magic." 

He warned that Rife's plans to welcome the public to Ed and Lorraine's home and their well-known museum, filled with what are claimed to be haunted artefacts, and which was closed in 2019, can endanger him and others. 

Fraser shared, “That is how the soul became attached in the first place,' Fraser warned. 'Spirits that have not crossed over feed off attention, and the more fascination there is, the more active and aggressive the energy becomes.” He continued, “It is like dealing with a bully. You can yell, push back and try to assert control, but in the end you are left drained while the bully feels stronger. That is exactly how dark energy works. It pulls from your strength, your peace of mind, and your spiritual protection.”

Fraser added, “The more it is acknowledged, the more power it gains. This is exactly why Ed and Lorraine Warren never wanted the Annabelle doll to be glorified or used for entertainment.” He also believed that the late couple truly “understood the danger” that possessed Annabelle. 

Fraser said that “People think they are just observing something creepy, but what they are really doing is inviting chaos.” He described the possessed items as “spiritually active” and said that these are “tied to dark, earthbound souls that never crossed over.”

In a shocking move, Rife revealed last month that he purchased the Warrens' home and Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. Thus, he became the owner of Annabelle. The infamous haunted doll's disturbing behaviour dates back to the 1970s. 

However, when Ed and Lorraine took ownership of the doll, they locked it in a glass case, which was placed in their museum. The special glass case was to ensure that the "evil evil-spirited entity" was contained and warned that she should never be moved.

Open wide, my babies. The Lion's Gate Portal is peaking today, bringing with it the most powerful moment of the year for soul transformation, clarity and calling in all that is good and plentiful.

The Lion's Gate refers to the annual alignment between the sun in Leo and Sirius — the brightest star in the night sky, also known as Alpha Canis Majoris, or the Dog Star.

The Lion's Gate is open from July 28 to August 12, but peaks in power on August 8th. 

“The Lion's Gate Portal opens a rare energetic doorway. 8/8 carries a vibration of spiritual strength, infinite potential, and alignment with your soul's purpose. This isn't about chasing material goals. It's about stepping into who you're truly meant to be,” said Psychic Solas, of Psychic Source, shared. 

Why is this day of days so fated?

In Numerology, the number 8 is symbolic of infinity, abundance and the balancing of karmic debts. A power number, eight, is the union of the material and the spiritual, represented by the interlocking circles within the numeral itself.

On August 8, the energy and power of the number are doubled for our earthly benefit.

During the Lion's Gate Portal, Sirius rises to align with Earth and Orion's Belt, a cosmic formation that has been revered since ancient times.

The sun in Leo amplifies themes of personal power, courage, creative expression and radical self-love.

This year, August 8 coincides with Mercury retrograde in Leo, when we are called to reflect, reset and consider how our self-expression can be used to elevate the collective.

“Expect old desires to resurface and new clarity to drop in. In 2025, the Lion's Gate Portal centers less on attracting what you want and more on choosing what genuinely aligns with who you are now,” said Solas.

Solas views August 8 as one of the most potent days of the year, characterized by high energy and profound clarity, making it an ideal opportunity to set intentions that align with your soul's path.

A German resident has admitted to running a massive psychic mail fraud scheme that targeted elderly and vulnerable victims to the tune of over $10 million.

58-year-old Georg Ingenbleek was indicted in 2020 and had been a fugitive. He was apprehended in Bolzano, Italy, last year and extradited this past May to face an indictment charging him with two counts of mail fraud, to which he pleaded guilty earlier this week.

Federal authorities in New Jersey said from 2011 through 2016, Ingenbleek created numerous direct mail solicitations supposedly from world-renowned psychics that falsely and fraudulently claimed to offer, among other things, great fortune.

Many of the letters falsely promised that the psychic services being offered were free; however, Ingenbleek directed his co-conspirators to send fraudulent billing notices to those customers who claimed they owed money for those services.

The fraudulent billing notices included threats of legal action if the bills, usually in the $20 to $50 range, weren't paid.

According to officials, this psychic scheme brought in over $10 million.

The mail fraud charges each carry up to 20 years in prison and fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sentencing is scheduled for December 17th.

Three star-like objects which appeared and disappeared in 1952.

A newly published study by Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) researchers has looked at mysterious "transient events".

Since 2017, the Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project has attempted to look for stars and other sources of light that have appeared and disappeared from view or have dimmed unusually over the 20th and 21st centuries, known as "transient events". The team has previously found that around 100 stars have disappeared from view without an explanation (though other teams have suggestions as to where they went).

"These short-lived transients (lasting less than one exposure time of 50 minutes) are absent in images taken shortly before the transients appear and in all images from subsequent surveys," the team explained in a recent pre-print paper. "In some cases, multiple transients appear in a single image, exhibiting characteristics not easily accounted for by prosaic explanations (e.g., gravitational lensing, gamma ray bursts, fragmenting asteroids, plate defects)."

In the latest study from the group, they focused on transient star-like objects observed in the pre-Sputnik era, or before any satellites had been launched into orbit by humans. The team identified transients captured by the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I), which scanned the skies from November 19, 1949, to April 28, 1957. By focusing on this timeframe, they could eliminate any transient events that are due to reflections from human-made satellites, a common source of bright objects in the night sky.

The team is motivated directly to study UAP phenomena – a topic which scientists have generally steered well clear of. The general consensus is that while alien life is possible, or even probable according to some, there is no real scientific evidence of alien life coming anywhere near Earth. Nevertheless, transients are real phenomena that warrant investigation in their own right, and the team attempted to narrow down their source.

"Given the unusual nature of these events and their potential implications, it is important to further test the hypothesis that some transients may originate from reflective artificial objects in Earth orbit," the team explains of their motivation in the new paper. "Searches for extraterrestrial probes were proposed as early as the 1960s, but to date only a few searches for NTAs have been attempted or proposed."

The latest paper identified a number of interesting transient events for which they could not provide an explanation, including a bright but short-lived transient event on July 19, 1952, in which three stars vanished within 50 minutes.

"Notably, this particular event coincides in time with one of the most extensively documented aerial anomalies in historical records: the Washington D.C. 'UFO flap' of July 1952, which unfolded over two consecutive weekends (July 18–19 and 26–27)," the team writes. "While this may be a coincidence, the temporal proximity invites further scrutiny — especially given the rarity of both phenomena."

 

While this is all pretty speculative and unlikely to be resolved due to the event taking place over 70 years ago, the team offers up an intriguing statistical analysis that might warrant further attention, potentially showing that these might not be something as simple as photographic plate defects.

"One of the most revealing tests involves Earth's shadow. No matter how asymmetric or irregular the distributions of plate defects may be, they have no plausible reason to avoid the Earth's shadow. In contrast, transients associated with solar reflections would," the team explains. 

In short, if the transients were just plate defects, then we would see them no matter where the astronomical equipment was pointed. But according to their analysis, there were far fewer transients detected in Earth's shadow compared to the rest of the sky.

"At 80,000 km altitude, we expect N = 339 transients in shadow out of 106,339 total, corresponding to a fraction of fexp = 0.00319 ± 0.00017. However, we find only N = 79 transients in shadow, yielding fobs = 0.00074 ± 0.000084," the team explains. "The difference in these observed fractions is also highly significant, with a significance level of 12.7σ, computed by combining the Poisson uncertainties in quadrature."

According to the team, this makes it more likely that the transient events are caused by light reflecting off a source. Which is somewhat odd, given that the period studied was pre-satellite. That's not to say that the transient events are some sort of alien probe. In fact, given a lack of evidence for such a phenomenon, you can place a pretty solid bet that it is caused by something else. A separate paper by the team, for instance, found that they were associated with nuclear weapons tests. But it is certainly intriguing, and may offer clues to scientists looking to study these odd, transient phenomena. 

"Our results motivate continued investigation of historical sky surveys and the application of similar alignment-based detection methods to modern deep-sky imaging," the team concludes. "Whether or not these events ultimately point to the existence of NTAs [non-terrestrial artifacts], the identification of statistically improbable, spatially aligned transients in pre-satellite data represents a novel observational anomaly deserving of further scientific attention. Future work may help clarify whether these transients constitute a new class of astronomical phenomena—or represent the first hints of artificial activity near our planet."

The study is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Astronomers have first identified a super-Earth in the habitable zone of a distant sun-like star using a revolutionary observation method. This discovery greatly expands the search for planets that may support life.

This information was published by the SciTechDaily portal.

One of the main goals of researchers is to identify Earth-like planets in so-called habitable zones — regions around stars where the existence of liquid water is possible. A planet like this was recently detected by an international team led by astronomers from China.

The researchers discovered the planet Kepler-725c using the transit timing variations (TTV) method. This planet has a mass about 10 times greater than that of Earth and orbits the star Kepler-725, which is similar to the Sun. This is the first discovery of a planet with such characteristics using the TTV method.

Kepler-725c has an orbital period of 207.5 days and is located at a distance of 0.674 astronomical units from the star. The planet receives about 1.4 times more radiation than Earth, and part of its orbit falls within the habitable zone. This makes Kepler-725c a promising candidate for further studies.

Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost

When it comes to falling down a rabbit hole with conspiracy theories ― QAnon, the “Plandemic” conspiracy theory ― it's young people, not older demographics, who are more prone to buy into such beliefs. 

Age is the most significant predictor of conspiracy beliefs among all other factors, according to a study that was recently published in the journal Political Psychology. And it's people under 35 who are consistently more likely to endorse conspiratorial ideas than any other age group.

“From age 35 on, susceptibility to conspiracy theories decreases relatively steadily across older age groups,” said Jean-Nicolas Bordeleau, a research Fellow at the Jeff Bleich Centre for Democracy and Disruptive Technologies, at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. 

Political conspiracy theories are pushing more and more family relationships to the breaking point. It's not uncommon to hear about siblings who are estranged over extremist political views or people who “lost” their family members to QAnon, a conspiracy theory that posits that a satanic cabal of elites and pedophiles is working behind the scenes to orchestrate global events and enslave children. 

Conspiracy theories increasingly affect our elections, too; QAnon believers came out heavily for President Trump in recent elections; to them, Trump is a white-knight figure destined to bring down the aforementioned cabal. (That's what's made his current handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files such a divisive issue for many.)

And voter fraud conspiracy theories drove thousands to violently storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, an act of domestic terrorism that threatened the nation's peaceful transfer of power. 

Given the growing impact of conspiracy theories in our political and personal lives, Bordeleau and Daniel Stockemer, a political studies professor at the University of Ottawa in Canada, thought it was high time to find out what factors most influence people buying in.

“We were really curious to understand why some people adhere to some really unbelievable narratives like the flat Earth theory and QAnon,” Bordeleau told HuffPost. “Our results don't imply that all young people are attracted to all conspiracy theories, but what we can demonstrate is that younger people are more likely to believe various conspiracy theories than older individuals.

If you assumed it might be Boomers who most frequently fall into conspiracy theory traps ― there are countless depressing stories in online forums of grown children detailing how their Fox News-watching parents fell into a QAnon rabbit hole after “doing research” ― you're not alone. Bordeleau figured that would be the case, too. 

Younger citizens being more conspiratorial as a whole “definitely goes against the typical stereotype of the older uncle at the Christmas table exposing the latest conspiracy theories,” Bordeleau said. “Initially, we were quite surprised to see that younger people were most likely to believe in conspiracies.” 

To find all this out, the researchers conducted a meta analysis ― a kind of “study of studies” ― which synthesized the results of 191 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024.

This huge dataset, which included over 374,000 participants, suggested a “robust” association between young age and belief in conspiracies, Bordeleau said. 

“To confirm that, we ran our own original multinational survey of more than 6,000 people across six diverse countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the U.S. and South Africa,” he explained. 

Regardless of the country, the results were the same: Age was the most potent predictor of conspiratorial belief systems, more than a person's gender, level of education or income. 

So why are younger generations more intrigued by conspiracy theories? Bordeleau and Stockemer think there are three interconnected reasons.

“First, the fact that younger people have a deep sense of political disaffection and alienation,” Bordeleau said. “Second, there's a tendency for younger people to adopt an activist style of political participation and be exposed to more radical environments, where conspiracy theories thrive.” (QAnon originated on the dark web first, with various ideas circulating on 4chan and 8chan as early as 2017.)

Lastly, there's the self-confidence factor, or lack thereof. Self-esteem fluctuates throughout our lives, but studies show that adolescence tends to be a period of heightened lower self-esteem, particularly for young girls. 

“Low self-esteem can partly explain why younger people are attracted to conspiracy theories,” Bordeleau said. “It becomes a way to cope with feelings of powerlessness.” 

Bordeleau said he'd love to further research the socialization component of conspiracy beliefs: how young people are exposed to these narratives, for instance, and whether or not social pressures play a part.

On a wider social level, he hopes that more time and resources are put into looking for ways to help young people become more media literate.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue.

When Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri won a reversal from the U.S. Department of Justice, allowing HPE's $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks to go ahead, he could have been forgiven for thinking his troubles were behind him.

Instead, HPE has been dragged into one of those weird MAGA conspiracy theories that orbit President Trump's White House. Even Laura Loomer, the vituperous online Trump activist, somehow got involved.





Given that the DOJ dropped its opposition to the merger (it previously complained it would reduce market competition), Neri could reasonably have expected the federal judge overseeing the litigation to waive the deal through.





But because the DOJ's sudden reversal got the gears whirring inside the brains of multiple online sleuths, resulting in an objection letter from Senator Elizabeth Warren, it is suddenly more likely—perhaps not probable, but plausible—that Judge P. Casey Pitts will hold a “Tunney review” that may overturn the deal.





A “Tunney review” is a judicial proceeding that asks whether a proposed merger is in the public interest. The Tunney Act was created in in the 1970s in reaction to President Nixon's meddling in the M&A market.




A negative Tunney review would be a defeat for Neri, who is fending off activist Elliott Management, which bought a $1.5 billion stake in the company and demanded seats on the board in part because it believes HPE stock is being held down by execution errors on Neri's watch. Neri could lose his job if things do not go his way, sources have told Fortune.





For its part, HPE believes it has done nothing wrong, and that it has simply prevailed in a routine judicial process.





“HPE is confident our acquisition of Juniper Networks is in the public interest and will promote further competition in the enterprise WLAN market,” the company told Fortune. “The transaction was appropriately approved with certain remedies by the U.S. Department of Justice, and it was unconditionally approved by 13 other antitrust regulators around the world.  We respect the role our regulators play in maintaining competitive markets and appreciate the professional and constructive way in which the DOJ engaged with us in approving the deal.”





But several online corporate dirt diggers, including Matt Stoller, Francine McKenna, Lever News and Capitol Forum, drew attention to personnel changes at the DOJ immediately prior to its approval of the deal. Two DOJ lawyers on the case appear to have been removed from it, according to Semafor. Now HPE is on the front page of the Wall Street Journal as Exhibit 1 in the narrative that lobbyists are undercutting the MAGA antitrust agenda by making off-the record promises about new jobs in the U.S. (HPE denied that, too.)





In a filing on the federal court docket, HPE listed its advisors on the deal. They included what Sen. Warren's letter described as “MAGA-aligned antitrust thought leader Mike Davis.”




It is this person that Stoller and his online colleagues believe is a lobbyist responsible for changing the minds of Attorney General Pam Bondi and her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, and thus reversing their opposition to the deal.





Following that, Loomer used X to insist that HPE had paid consultants allied to President Trump $1 million each to engage in “influence peddling.” Loomer later deleted the post. Sources previously told Fortune they didn't understand why Loomer was paying attention to the deal.





The Lever published a claim that “In a last-minute effort to save face … intelligence authorities intervened to rubber-stamp the deal because of national security reasons, a claim that never appeared in any of the DOJ and HP's legal briefs.” In fact, HPE did cite national security in its July 7 certification of the proposed judgment approving the deal. (You can see it here on page 2.) The national-security angle is that by combining HPE and Juniper it creates a larger market share for a U.S. company in places where the alternative might be Huawei, which many Western governments regard as a Chinese Communist Party asset. (Huawei has repeatedly denied that allegation.)





The next step is up to Judge Pitts. It is not clear cut that Pitts will rubber-stamp the DOJ's decision. Pitts is a Biden appointee who previously worked at a public interest law firm—and he may therefore be sceptical that Trump's DOJ went from fierce opposition to “whatever” so quickly.





His ruling is likely months away. 




The DOJ told Fortune: “The Department has consistently reiterated that resolution of this merger was based only on the merits of the transaction,” according to spokesman Gates McGavick. 





Meanwhile, HPE stock has not reacted well to all the gossip. It remains down 5.7% year to date compared to the S&P 500 which is up 8%. Elliott's stake is a long position—meaning they want shares to rise. And they are more than willing to replace the CEO if they do not get what they want. Hence the pressure on Neri.
