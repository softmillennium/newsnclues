                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the study, the approach preserves key immune functions, such as microglial clearance of plaques, while offering a safer and more effective delivery strategy for anti–amyloid immunotherapies. FDA-approved anti-amyloid drugs, like aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, have shown limited success in reducing Aβ plaque buildup and slightly slowing cognitive decline in AD. Still, they do not stop the disease from progressing. Their clinical benefits might be further constrained by suboptimal penetration into the brain and by common side effects, including brain swelling and small brain bleeds, collectively known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). To overcome these limitations, Michelle Pizzo and colleagues engineered a novel antibody transport vehicle (ATV) that targets the transferrin receptor – a natural gateway on blood vessels that allows certain molecules to cross the BBB. The design, called ATVcisLALA, incorporates a mutation to reduce harmful interactions with immune receptors on immature red blood cells, thereby preventing cytotoxic side effects. In a mouse model of AD, Pizzo et al. show that, when fused with an anti–amyloid-β antibody (creating ATVcisLALA:Aβ), the modified therapy successfully entered brain tissue more efficiently than conventional antibodies. The researchers' approach also showed enhanced targeting of plaque-associated Aβ in brain tissue rather than in blood vessels, which reduced vascular inflammation and significantly lowered the incidence of ARIA-like side effects. "Taken together, the findings of Pizzo et al. provide more than preclinical proof of concept; they also establish a framework for therapeutic design," write Mengen Xing and Weihong Song in a related Perspective. "By precisely controlling the route of antibody entry and modulating its function, ATVcisLALA:Aβ overcomes long-standing limitations of AD immunotherapy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tiny extracellular vesicles known as exosomes are emerging as key regulators of the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing how cancer progresses, spreads, and responds to treatment. In a new review published in Med Research, researchers from Haikou Affiliated Hospital of Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine explore the dual nature of exosomes-highlighting their roles in both tumor promotion and immune modulation. They actively shape tumor biology by transferring RNAs, proteins, and lipids that reprogram both cancer and immune cells." Dr. Jiachong Wang, co-corresponding author of the paper The review focuses on tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) and their diverse molecular cargo, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), which contribute to oncogenesis. These exosomes promote tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance by activating key signaling pathways-including PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB. They can suppress immune responses by delivering immunoinhibitory ligands like PD-L1 and CTLA-4 or by inducing immunosuppressive cell types, such as M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Conversely, exosomes from immune or engineered cells may restore antitumor immunity by delivering cytokines, antigenic peptides, or RNA-based therapeutics. The review also discusses liquid biopsy applications, showing how exosomal RNA and protein content reflects tumor stage, heterogeneity, and treatment response. This paves the way for noninvasive monitoring of disease progression and therapy resistance. As interest in exosome biology grows, this review synthesizes current knowledge while pointing to future directions, such as exosome engineering and combined immunotherapy approaches. It positions exosomes as both culprits and potential cures in the evolving fight against cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The incidence of early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) is rising, yet optimal treatment strategies remain unclear. While adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) has shown survival benefits in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, its specific role in EOPC patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and surgery remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the clinical benefit of ACT in EOPC patients after NACT. This retrospective cohort study analyzed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients from the SEER database (2006–2019) who received NACT followed by curative resection. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance covariates such as tumor, lymph node, metastasis stage, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared between patients with EOPC (<50 years) and average-onset pancreatic cancer (AOPC, ≥50 years). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors. After propensity score matching (124 EOPC vs. 124 AOPC), EOPC patients had significantly longer median OS (41.0 vs. 29.0 months, P = 0.042) and CSS (48.0 vs. 30.0 months, P = 0.016). Subgroup analysis revealed that EOPC patients with tumor, lymph node, metastasis stage II disease or those receiving ACT derived the greatest survival benefit. EOPC patients exhibit superior survival following NACT and surgical resection compared to AOPC, with ACT further enhancing outcomes in this subgroup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant cause of hospital admissions and treatment discontinuation worldwide. Conventional approaches often fail to detect rare or delayed effects of medicinal products. In order to improve early detection, a research team from the Medical University of Sofia developed a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of ADRs based solely on a drug's chemical structure. Input features were derived from SMILES codes - a standard format representing molecular structure. Predictions were generated for six major ADRs: hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, hypertension, and photosensitivity. "We could conclude that it successfully identified many expected reactions while producing relatively few false positives," the researchers write in their paper published in the journal Pharmacia, concluding it "demonstrates acceptable accuracy in predicting ADRs." For enadoline, a novel molecule, the model returned low probability scores across all ADRs, suggesting minimal risk. Notably, these results demonstrate the model's potential as a decision-support tool in early-phase drug discovery and regulatory safety monitoring. The authors acknowledge that performance of the infrastructure could be further enhanced by incorporating factors such as dose levels and patient-specific parameters. Ruseva, V., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antibiotic resistance in the environment is a growing and largely overlooked crisis receiving inconsistent attention, that may very well have dire consequences for human health, according to a new study led by the University of Surrey. The team identified 738 studies that focused strictly on non-built, non-industrial environments, such as rivers, fields and air. Two bacteria - Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas - were the most studied organisms, while genes conferring resistance to medicines including sulphonamides, tetracyclines and beta-lactams, were very prominent. Worryingly, very few studies have explored how antibiotic resistance spreads in the air, oceans or green spaces. Despite a growing body of research, our study confirms that we know frighteningly little about how antibiotic resistance behaves in certain regions and environmental contexts. This is a silent emergency, and unless the scientific community works quickly to plug this knowledge gap, we risk letting antibiotic resistance spread unchecked in places we're not appropriately monitoring." Dr. Brian Gardner, Research Fellow in Computational Biology, University of Surrey But fewer than one percent were led by researchers in low-income countries, such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Mali and Uganda, despite these areas facing some of the greatest health risks from antibiotic resistance. Climate change and microplastics were also strikingly absent from the evidence base. Dr. Gianni Lo Iacono, Senior Lecturer in Biostatistics/Epidemiology, University of Surrey, said: "This research was only possible thanks to the formidable contributions of 55 colleagues, whose expertise and commitment were indispensable. Our findings highlight an urgent need for more research in low-income regions, which face higher risks of antibiotic resistance but are severely underrepresented in current studies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a discovery that could broaden access to next-generation biologic medicines and vaccines, researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (UChicago PME) have engineered polymer-based nanoparticles that form with a simple temperature shift-no harsh chemicals, no specialized equipment, and no processing needed. What excites me about this platform is its simplicity and versatility. By simply warming a sample from fridge temperature to room temperature, we can reliably make nanoparticles that are ready to deliver a wide variety of biological drugs." Stuart Rowan, co-senior author, the Barry L. MacLean Professor for Molecular Engineering Innovation and Enterprise at UChicago Pritzker Molecular Engineering and staff scientist Argonne National Laboratory Nanoparticles are key to protecting delicate drugs like RNA and proteins from being degraded in the body before they reach the right cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), made of fatty molecules, enabled the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, for instance. But LNPs rely on alcohol-based solvents and sensitive manufacturing steps-making them poorly suited for protein delivery and hard to scale. "We wanted to make a delivery system that could work for both RNA and protein therapies-because right now, most platforms are specialized for just one," said first author Samir Hossainy, a UChicago PME graduate student. "We also wanted to make it scalable, without needing toxic solvents or complicated microfluidics." Hossainy hypothesized that polymer-based nanoparticles could offer a more robust, customizable alternative. He outlined the required characteristics; the immune system will only respond to particles with certain sizes, shapes, and charges. Then, he used chemical tools to begin designing new nanoparticles from scratch. After trying, and fine-tuning, more than a dozen different materials, he found one that worked. In cold water, the polymer-and any desired protein-remained dissolved. But when heated to room temperature, the polymer self-assembled into uniformly sized nanoparticles (or "polymersomes") surrounding the protein molecules. "We don't have to worry about different particle sizes forming, which is a challenge with a lot of today's nanoparticles." To test the new polymersomes, Hossainy worked with colleagues in Rowan's lab as well as with former UChicago PME Prof. Jeffrey Hubbell, now at New York University. First, they showed that the particles can encapsulate more than 75% of protein and nearly 100% of short interfering RNA (siRNA) cargo-far higher than most current systems-and they can be freeze-dried and stored without refrigeration until needed. In the context of vaccination, Hossainy and his collaborators found that the polymersomes could effectively carry a protein and, when injected into mice, lead the animals' immune systems to generate long-lasting antibodies against that protein. Another experiment showed that the nanoparticles could also carry proteins designed to prevent an immune response in the context of allergic asthma. And a third showed that injecting polymersomes into tumors could block cancer-related genes and suppress tumor growth in mice. "The exciting thing is that we didn't need to tailor a different system for each use case," said Hossainy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite social media helping to increase awareness of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) among the public (81% of health care providers agree) and advancements in treatment over the past decade, IBS symptoms continue to significantly impact patients' daily lives and productivity, according to a new survey released by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), in partnership with The Harris Poll, a Stagwell (STGW) agency. The 2024 comprehensive study, which included 2,013 patients with IBS and 600 health care providers, sheds light on persistent challenges faced by patients with IBS. Survey findings indicate that IBS symptoms interfere with patients' productivity at work/school for nearly 11 days per month on average, in addition to symptoms disrupting personal activities eight days per month on average, highlighting the substantial burden of the condition. Patients with IBS are missing more work/school days per month due to their gastrointestinal symptoms than they were 10 years ago (3.6 days in 2024, 2.1 days in 2015), and more report spending less time with family and friends because of their symptoms (58%, up from 48% in 2015). The study also revealed that while fewer patients in 2024 report their symptoms are very or extremely bothersome (43%, compared to 62% in 2015), 76% still find it somewhat or very difficult to manage their symptoms. Andrea Shin, MD, MSCR, AGA Patient Education Advisor and UCLA Health Despite treatment options evolving over the last 10 years to now include a wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents to treat IBS, the survey findings highlight that patients and health care providers rely predominantly on over-the-counter treatment options and lifestyle adjustments rather than prescription medications. While prescription medications are among the most helpful treatments, according to patients with IBS who have tried them (18% for IBS-C, 19% for IBS-D), patients report that these treatments are not among the top three treatments recommended by health care providers, which typically include: While more than two in five health care providers whose patients ever request a specific IBS treatment (45%) say they will recommend or prescribe the requested treatment always or most of the time, only around one in 10 (14%) say patients often do so. Most patients with both IBS-C and IBS-D (78% each) are satisfied with the treatments they currently take; however, only about one in five are very satisfied (25% IBS-C, 26% IBS-D). Further, compared to 2015, more physicians who treat IBS say effective relief of abdominal pain (49% vs. 39%) or diarrhea/constipation (47% vs. 33%) and the availability of treatment options (49% vs. 34%) are what is most lacking in IBS treatment today despite advancements in the IBS treatment landscape. These findings highlight an opportunity for further improvement in treatment efficacy and patient satisfaction. "The AGA IBS in America Survey sheds light on patients who are still not being offered a variety of treatments that could provide them with a better quality of life. The AGA IBS in America survey was conducted with support from Salix Medical Affairs, a division of Bausch Health US, Inc. The patient research was conducted online in the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of AGA between Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, 2024, among 2,013 U.S. adults age 18+ who have been diagnosed by a health care provider with IBS-C (1,005) or IBS-D (1,008) and have not been diagnosed with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcers, or colon, stomach, or other cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The health care provider research was conducted online in the U.S. by The Harris Poll on behalf of AGA between Nov. 15 and Dec. 9, 2024, among 600 health care providers including gastroenterologists (n=200), primary care physicians (PCPs, n=200), gastroenterology nurse practitioners (NP)/physician assistants (PA) (n=100), and PCP NP/PAs (n=100) aged 18 or older who practice in the U.S., treat adult patients, see at least six IBS patients per month, and see IBS-C or IBS-D patients. Data for patients are weighted, where necessary, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, household income, employment, and smoking status to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population. Data for physicians are weighted separately, as necessary, by gender and age for each specialty to align with their actual proportions in the population. Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in The Harris Poll surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. The data for each physician specialty is accurate to within ± 7.2 percentage points, using a 95% confidence level. All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Such differences one day may help clinicians identify patients at high SCC risk, they added. Currently, physicians identify patients at high SCC risk based on whether they have had several prior SCCs. Analyzing skin microbiome changes to identify patients at high SCC risk before they develop several SCCs could revolutionize dermatologic care, senior author and investigator, Shadmehr Demehri, MD, PhD, said in an interview. He is the Arthur and Sandra Irving Endowed Chair in Cancer Immunology and director of the High Risk Skin Cancer Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. To explore this issue, he and his coinvestigators conducted comparative metagenomic analyses of skin microbiomes from 30 patients: six with high SCC risk (> 2 prior SCCs), nine with low SCC risk (≤ 2 prior SCCs), and 15 solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Using swabs from six bilateral anatomical sites per patient, with air swabs as negative controls, the investigators performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and differential-abundance analyses to compare relative taxa populations across patient groups. “Compared with low‐risk SCC subjects,” Demehri added, “both solid organ transplant recipients and high‐risk SCC subjects showed higher relative abundances of eukaryotes, such as Malassezia restricta and M globosa, and viruses such as Betapapillomavirus.” Moreover, these taxa showed robust differences and strong discriminatory power between patient groups, indicating their potential utility as signatures of elevated SCC risk, he told Medscape Medical News. Currently, it remains unclear whether the relative expansion of certain skin microbiome components directly drives SCC pathogenesis or reflects underlying immune alterations that raise SCC risk indirectly. Yet subclinical expansions in Malassezia and viral taxa still may translate into increased SCC risk, Demehri said. Accordingly, he said, dermatologists must not assume that people who develop certain viral and fungal skin diseases are at higher risk for SCC. “It's more subtle changes, probably in association with other microbiome changes, that seem to be associated with skin cancer risk.” Nonetheless, Demehri said, watching for skin conditions that signify an expanded skin microbiome — such as the appearance of warts in fair-skinned adults — may signal the need to monitor for SCC risk. Dermatologists are starting to embrace the skin microbiome concept but rarely beyond bacteria and yeasts, Leachman told Medscape Medical News. The observation that baseline papillomavirus populations can exist on normal-appearing skin without causing pathology is important information, she added. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have proven highly effective in preventing cervical cancer. However, she said, based on the results of commensal HPVs protecting against SCC, it is unclear whether elimination of commensals by the vaccine could render some women more or less susceptible to SCC later in life. “If those papillomavirus vaccines cross-react, and you're diminishing the commensal papillomaviruses that are helpful in recognizing squamous cell carcinoma,” she asked, “are you going to have people who experience an idiosyncratic increase in squamous carcinoma because the HPV vaccine prevents development of a robust commensal population of helpful papillomaviruses? I don't believe anyone has even examined alterations of commensal HPV populations following vaccination.” “That says there's probably some sort of functional immunosuppression occurring in those high-risk people.” As baby boomers age, Leachman added, the population with immune-system senescence will grow. “If you can use solid organ transplant recipients as a model for the aging population that is becoming functionally immunosuppressed, that would be very beneficial, to know how to tailor treatments, detection methods, and even potential risk evaluation methods for these people.” Anecdotally, Leachman has identified a group of patients with what she calls systemic “skin failure” — elderly patients at an extremely high SCC risk who routinely have multiple skin cancers and precancers excised. Based on years of clinical observation, she prescribes topical immunotherapy rather than topical chemotherapy depending on patient age and the number and (wart-like) appearance of their SCCs. Presently, Demehri's lab is exploring ways to detect and monitor microbiome changes more feasibly than through costly shotgun sequencing. “It's not something we can do for every patient all the time to monitor their skin. But there are ways we could extract that information more directly from the skin by swabs and then inform the physician that the patient might be at risk of cancer as well because their microbiome is being altered in ways that are associated with increased risk.” Broad adoption of such techniques, he estimated, is perhaps a few years away. Demehri had filed a patent for the development of T cell-directed anticancer vaccines against commensal viruses. Leachman is an investigator or advisor for several companies involved in screening and early diagnosis of melanoma but reported no relevant financial relationships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can what you eat during pregnancy really change your gut bacteria? New research reveals how the Mediterranean diet boosts beneficial microbes for expectant mothers, while stress-busting mindfulness may not be enough. Study: Effects of Mediterranean diet or Mindfulness Based-Stress Reduction during Pregnancy on Maternal Gut and Vaginal Microbiota. In a recent study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers conducted a clinical sub-analysis to investigate the impacts of maternal diet and stress levels on the maternal microbiome. A mindfulness-based stress reduction program had more modest effects on the maternal gut microbiome, with some increases in health-associated bacteria, but did not significantly alter overall microbiome structure (p=0.094). These findings highlight the maternal gut as a potential therapeutic target for improving both maternal health and potentially influencing long-term child welfare. It is important to note that microbiome outcomes were measured as exploratory endpoints, and further research is needed to determine how these changes may influence clinical outcomes for mothers and infants. Eating more fish, nuts, and legumes – key parts of the Mediterranean pattern – was consistently tied to higher levels of beneficial bacteria families like Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae across all participants. Pregnancy represents a period of substantial and profound physiological change, extending beyond just the mother and her developing fetus to also include their resident microbial symbionts. Notably, research has found that maternal gut and vaginal microbiomes are the primary sources for seeding the infant's microbiota, a process critical for the latter's development of a healthy immune system and metabolism in later life. Parallel studies have established a link between the independent influences of diet and stress on non-pregnant adult microbiome composition and function. Unfortunately, there remains a scarcity of evidence from randomized trials on whether structured lifestyle interventions, such as diet and stress level interventions, especially during pregnancy, can purposefully and beneficially alter these crucial microbial ecosystems. Understanding these associations would provide prospective mothers and their caregivers with the information to optimize maternal and fetal physiological outcomes. The present study aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting a sub-analysis of the Improving Mothers for a better PrenAtal Care Trial BarCeloNa (IMPACT BCN) cohort, a randomized controlled trial (parallel design) carried out at the Hospital Clínic and Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (BCNatal) in Barcelona, Spain. IMPACT BCN aimed to elucidate whether lifestyle interventions could reduce the incidence of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns. The current study focused on the maternal microbiome as a key exploratory outcome and used a subsample of 351 pregnant individuals from the main trial who were at high risk of having an SGA baby. Identified participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental subgroups: 1. The Med Diet group – These individuals received counselling to adopt a Mediterranean dietary pattern, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. The Stress Reduction (SR) group – These individuals were enrolled in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (Kabat-Zinn adapted for pregnancy), and 3. Study data collection comprised the extraction of maternal fecal and vaginal samples (following intervention termination – 34-36 weeks' gestation). Crucially, a subset of 85 participants was used to obtain baseline readings (before intervention initiation). Microbiome structure was evaluated using high-resolution 16S rRNA gene sequencing for community characterization and functional evaluation. Study findings revealed that modifiable behaviors, particularly diet, are strongly linked to microbiome health in pregnant women. Simultaneously, Med Diet adherence reduced microbiome concentrations of potentially harmful bacteria, most notably the genus Campylobacter (p < 0.001). While the strength of outcomes was more limited, the mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention was associated with enrichment of specific health-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Turicibacter, but did not significantly affect the overall gut microbiota composition (p=0.094 for overall structure). Microbial diversity was observed to decrease as pregnancy progressed, with this reduction being more pronounced among participants in the intervention groups. Additionally, independent of intervention group assignment, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern correlated with greater microbial diversity and beneficial microbial shifts. However, clinical outcomes related to these microbiome changes were not directly assessed in this sub-analysis and should be investigated in future research. While the stress reduction program's effect was more subtle, study findings still suggest a link between psychological well-being and gut microbial health. Together, these outcomes position the maternal gut microbiome as a potentially important therapeutic target. By optimizing a mother's diet and promoting stress management, it may be possible to cultivate a healthier microbial environment that benefits both mother and child. Future research exploring the long-term impacts of these microbial shifts on neonatal and child health may allow for the development of personalized maternal behavioral interventions designed to optimize both her and her offspring's safety and holistic health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A latest systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by scientists from institutions across China and the United States has uncovered promising insights into how vitamin D supplementation can significantly impact cardiometabolic health. The study, which was published in Engineering, has implications for tailored therapeutic strategies targeting cardiovascular diseases and related risks. The comprehensive review analyzed 99 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 17 656 participants. The analysis revealed that vitamin D supplementation, with a median dose of 3320 International Units (IU) per day, was associated with favorable effects on various cardiometabolic risk factors, including reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and fasting blood insulin. Significantly, the researchers discovered that the benefits of vitamin D supplementation were most pronounced in specific groups: non-Western populations, individuals with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 15.0 ng·mL−1, those with a body mass index (BMI) below 30 kg·m−2, and older individuals aged 50 years or above. This research underscores the need for personalized vitamin D intervention strategies, taking into account individual characteristics such as ethnocultural background, age, BMI, and baseline vitamin D levels. The findings highlight the potential of longer intervention durations (three months or more) and higher doses to optimize cardiometabolic health outcomes in specific populations. These findings could lead to significant advancements in preventive medicine and nutritional sciences, potentially leading to the development of more effective public health strategies. By tailoring vitamin D supplementation based on individual characteristics, healthcare providers may improve intervention efficacy and reduce the prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases. Additionally, studies exploring the long-term effects and potential risks associated with high-dose supplementation are warranted. This landmark study not only provides new insights into the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for cardiometabolic health but also emphasizes the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing these effects. As cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality globally, the findings from this meta-analysis offer a glimmer of hope for more targeted and effective preventive strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mount Sinai researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of teaching surgical trainees a difficult procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and an extended-reality headset without the presence of an instructor. The novel study, published in Journal of Medical Extended Reality, drew highly favorable reviews from student participants who tested the deep learning model. The results carry significant implications for future training of residents and surgeons, as well as for the even broader field of autonomous learning within medicine. For the first time, we created an AI model linked to an extended-reality headset to prove that a critical step in a kidney cancer procedure could be done with 99.9 percent accuracy. We believe our study offers early proof that AI programs that substitute for proctors, who teach resident physicians, can reduce training costs and ultimately improve the quality, efficiency, and standardization of that instruction." Dr. Stone and his team, which included researchers from the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Rochester Medical Center in upstate New York, explored an alternative training system using AI programs they developed, including ESIST (educational system for instructionless surgical training). This model coupled deep learning methodology with a custom-designed extended-reality headset worn by the 17 participants to stream surgical instructions and video content before their eyes, while allowing their hands to remain free to practice the intricate procedure. For this replication, researchers created a "phantom" kidney from 3D printed casts of an anonymized patient's computerized tomography (CT) scans. While students practiced, the system's sophisticated first-person camera continuously monitored their training, providing real-time feedback and projecting corrective prompts as part of its skills assessment capability. "Above all, our study proved that a complex procedure like a partial nephrectomy could be effectively taught to surgical trainees using a simulated model, without the presence of an instructor," noted Dr. Stone. "This finding addresses an urgent need resulting from the shortage of trainers and supervisors to educate physicians on new medical devices and techniques, and from the severe time constraints on attending physicians to train residents pursing surgical careers." Another major advantage of advanced teaching technology, added Dr. Stone, is that it allows future surgeons to become proficient in procedures outside the operating room, thus helping to reduce the risk of surgical errors. "From the patient's point of view, we hope this study will provide reassurance that the technology can be leveraged to greatly improve surgical proficiency, while reducing surgical errors," said Dr. Stone. The next step for Mount Sinai researchers is to use the AI algorithm technology they developed to build more complex synthetic cadaver models to train students in entire procedures, rather than just one component, as reported in the study. "Our investigation suggests that AI systems could indeed play an important complementary role in shaping the future of surgical education in this country," asserts Dr. Stone. "The public should be reassured that the pathway to autonomous learning we investigated in this small study could eventually lead to significant cost savings and improved patient outcomes and, importantly, to the cultivation of a highly skilled new generation of surgeons."
