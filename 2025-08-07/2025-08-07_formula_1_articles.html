                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lando Norris might be holding second place in the World Championship, but the McLaren driver feels that certain parts of his season so far were "not good enough". Norris' campaign initially looked to have started strongly when 2025 kicked off at the Australian Grand Prix in March, having won what turned out to be a chaotic wet-dry encounter. However, while McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri claimed four victories across the next six rounds, Norris had to wait until Round 8 in Monaco to stand on the top step again. But since Round 11 in Austria, the 25-year-old has bolstered his points tally by scoring three wins, with the most recent of these in Hungary seeing him cut Piastri's championship lead down to just eight points. When asked ahead of the race in Budapest to assess his season and give an insight into what his area of focus will be during the next few weeks, Norris explained: “Just what I've been doing really over the last month, two months. “Prior to that, [it was] not good enough, so in a harsh way, I would say I was pretty average before then. Since then, I think things have been a lot stronger. Earlier in the season, Norris spoke of how he had been spending time off social media, a move that he felt had allowed him to “do things that are productive”. With this in mind, the nine-time race winner was quizzed on how different his 2025 summer break might look in comparison to previous years. “It's not going to be that different,” he reflected. “So really, it's not any different to what I've done the last few years, which is a good thing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto give their views on a tricky race in Hungary for Alpine. Pierre Gasly has conceded Alpine are "just too slow" after he and team mate Franco Colapinto endured a tough Hungarian Grand Prix, with the pair coming home last of the 19 cars to finish. With Colapinto starting 14th and Gasly 17th at a track where overtaking can be tricky, it was always going to be tough for the French outfit at the Hungaroring, with their best hope being a spot of weather hitting the circuit. However, the rain did not materialise, and even splitting the strategies – with Gasly one-stopping and Colapinto stopping twice – did not help. Gasly's race was further hampered by a 10-second time penalty picked up late on, after a collision with Carlos Sainz when fighting for P15. “We cannot be pleased with the end result today, even if it felt like our execution was quite good,” explained Gasly. Today was more conventional and it really highlighted our weak spots. Gasly's sixth-place result at Silverstone and P10 at Spa have kept Alpine's points haul ticking over, but they are now 15 points behind Haas in the battle for ninth in the Teams' Championship. As for Colapinto, his hunt for a first points finish of the year continues – but the Argentine racer can take heart from making Q2 in Hungary and out-qualifying his team mate for the first time since Canada. However, his race was undone by a couple of slow pit stops, and he found himself stuck in a DRS train for most of the afternoon. “It was not the best of days today and a difficult race for us as a team,” Colapinto said after the race. I was struggling with rear grip and sliding, which came back to us later in the race. As a team, we've been very good recently with pitstops, but these things happen in racing.”</p>
