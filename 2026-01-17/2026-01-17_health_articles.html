                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As another new year gets under way many of us will be looking for a way of boosting how we feel but is it better to hit the gym or mediate in nature? Now new research by Swansea experts has provided the largest ever comparison of wellbeing-focused interventions delivered to adults. The team reviewed 183 randomized controlled trials, representing almost 23,000 participants, and evaluated 12 categories of interventions ranging from psychological, physical, mind–body, and nature-based approaches to find out more. Their research was the first interdisciplinary comparison carried out across psychological, physical, mind-body and environmental interventions. The study, which has just been published Nature Human Behaviour, gives an integrated view of how different disciplines contribute to wellbeing. By focusing on general adult samples rather than clinical groups, it provides evidence that will be relevant to developing public health, education, workplace wellbeing, and community programmes. First author Dr Lowri Wilkie, from the School of Psychology, said: "Our analysis shows that there is no single route to improving wellbeing. Mindfulness, compassion-based approaches, yoga, exercise and positive psychology interventions all showed moderate benefits compared with control groups, and combining physical activity with psychological interventions appeared particularly promising. "By using network meta-analysis, we were able to compare very different interventions from different disciplines within one framework, giving policymakers and practitioners a much clearer view of the range of effective options available for building wellbeing in the general population." Because interventions were tested in general populations, the evidence is directly relevant to population wellbeing strategies, including efforts to enhance resilience and support mental health before problems escalate. Senior author Professor Andrew Kemp added: "What this study makes clear is that wellbeing can be supported through multiple, evidence-based pathways. "For us, this paper also marks an important milestone in a long-running collaboration between Swansea University and Swansea Bay University Health Board, and it highlights how rigorous, interdisciplinary research can inform population-level approaches to mental health and wellbeing." Co-author Dr Zoe Fisher, a consultant clinical psychologist with SBUHB, said: "For practitioners and services, these findings are extremely useful. The study shows that a range of interventions can reliably improve wellbeing, which means we can tailor support according to the needs and preferences of different communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multidisciplinary team has uncovered a key mechanism that allows the human bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae-responsible for atypical pneumonia and other respiratory infections-to obtain cholesterol and other essential lipids directly from the human body. He adds that "understanding this process opens new avenues to block its growth and to explore biotechnological applications based on its affinity for lipid-rich tissues." This discovery is particularly relevant because Mycoplasma pneumoniae is primarily known as a respiratory bacterium, yet several studies-including this one-show that it can reach other tissues in the body, especially those with a lipid-rich environment. Understanding how it achieves this extra respiratory colonization helps explain clinical manifestations outside the lung and provides clues about its potential contribution to systemic inflammatory processes. Unlike other bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae cannot synthesize many lipids that are essential for the integrity of its membrane, including cholesterol, and therefore depends entirely on the host to survive. In this context, the new study demonstrates that the P116 protein acts as a highly efficient lipid uptake system, capable of extracting cholesterol and other lipid species from both human lipoproteins-including LDL and HDL-and different cell types. Experiments conducted by the team show that P116 rapidly incorporates cholesterol from LDL and HDL but can also capture phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols. This ability to recognize and absorb multiple types of lipids makes P116 an essential mechanism for the survival of the microorganism. Dr. Noemí Rotllan highlights the biological significance of this finding: "P116 acts as a lipid entry gate for the bacterium, an extraordinarily versatile system that allows it to incorporate cholesterol, phospholipids, and sphingolipids from the host." She adds that "this broad lipid uptake capacity largely explains why Mycoplasma pneumoniae can survive in such diverse environments and localize to tissues where other bacteria would not be able to thrive." By preventing P116 from functioning as a lipid entry system, the antibody significantly reduces the growth of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in cell cultures and limits its ability to adhere to human atherosclerotic lesions in ex vivo samples. This dual action-slowing bacterial proliferation and preventing its presence in vulnerable areas of the cardiovascular system-represents a major advance in understanding the pathogenic and extra respiratory role of this microorganism." The researchers emphasize that preventing this adhesion is particularly relevant because the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in vulnerable plaques could promote local inflammation and compromise lesion stability. Unstable plaques are more prone to rupture, a process that can trigger serious cardiovascular events. By blocking P116, we slow its growth and prevent it from adhering to atherosclerotic lesions." He adds that "this is relevant because the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in vulnerable plaques could contribute to inflammation and compromise their stability. Preventing this adhesion offers an opportunity to further protect tissues affected by atherosclerosis." This version of the microorganism retains its natural ability to localize to lipid-rich tissues but has been adapted so that it does not cause disease. In experiments with hypercholesterolemic mice, the modified bacterium selectively accumulates in the liver and in atherosclerotic plaques, making it a potential vehicle for delivering therapeutic molecules or diagnostic agents precisely to the tissues where they are most needed. In the case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, its minimalist metabolism and dependence on host lipids make it particularly attractive as a manipulable and safe platform. Dr. Noemí Rotllan summarizes it as follows: "The modified version of Mycoplasma pneumoniae shows a natural tropism toward the liver and atherosclerotic lesions, making it a promising biotechnological platform for the study and treatment of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases." She adds that "leveraging the biology of this microorganism in a controlled way allows us to envision targeted therapeutic strategies that are more precise and potentially more effective for acting on tissues affected by atherosclerosis or fatty liver disease." Beyond its biomedical relevance, the study provides a conceptual advance in understanding Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a pathogen with one of the smallest known bacterial genomes, which depends heavily on the host to obtain essential lipids. They contributed to the structural characterization of P116, the analysis of its interaction with antibodies, and imaging and biodistribution studies in animal models. The work strengthens a multidisciplinary scientific collaboration among leading centers in structural biology, microbiology, cardiometabolism, and biomedical imaging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An LMU research team led by Professor Olivia M. Merkel, Chair of Drug Delivery at LMU, have developed a new delivery system for inhalable mRNA vaccines. Published in the journal Cell Biomaterials, the study presents a novel combination of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(β-amino esters) (PBAEs) designed to overcome key biological barriers in the lungs. "Effective mucosal vaccination via inhalation requires carrier systems that can penetrate airway mucus while protecting the fragile RNA molecules they carry," explains Merkel. Moreover, the particles successfully crossed the mucus barrier and enabled mRNA expression in ex vivo human precision-cut lung slices, a highly relevant human lung model. "A major advantage of the new system is its robustness during aerosolization," says Merkel. After vibrating-mesh nebulization, the PLGA/PBAE nanocarriers retained higher transfection efficiency than clinically approved lipid nanoparticles, highlighting their suitability for inhaled vaccine applications. "Our findings show that data-driven polymer design can address multiple delivery barriers simultaneously. This hybrid platform offers a promising alternative to lipid nanoparticles for next-generation pulmonary mRNA vaccines." According to the authors, it makes an important contribution to the development of safe, effective, and patient-friendly mucosal vaccines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of Virginia School of Medicine researchers have revealed how the popular, low-carb ketogenic diet protects against epilepsy seizures and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Keto, as the diet is commonly known, has been used to reduce seizures in patients with medication-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s. Doctors, however, have been uncertain exactly how the diet does this, even as they identified potential benefits for other brain disorders. This discovery could eventually allow patients to reap the benefits of the keto diet without the highly restrictive eating – almost devoid of sweet treats and comforting carbohydrates – necessary to stay "in keto." We discovered that HCAR2 helps β-hydroxybutyrate reduce seizures by regulating the activity and communication of brain cells. Niacin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, also works on HCAR2." Jaideep Kapur, MBBS, PhD, an epileptologist (epilepsy expert) at UVA Health and the School of Medicine's Department of Neurology and Neuroscience This can provide obvious benefits for those trying to lose weight, but it also causes unseen changes in the body, and many people cannot tolerate such a high-fat diet. Keto prompts our livers to produce molecules called ketones (ketosis), which replace easily burned carbohydrates as fuel for our brain cells. Kapur, researcher Soudabeh Naderi and their colleagues found that one of the most common of these ketones, β-hydroxybutyrate, interacts with a specific cellular receptor to reduce seizures in lab mice. It does this by calming nerve cells called neurons, the scientists found. When neurons become too excitable, they can trigger seizures. They found the receptor, hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, was concentrated in a particular cell type already linked to seizures. For example, the scientists' early work in lab mice suggests that niacin – vitamin B3 – may provide at least some benefit, though more research would be needed to determine if this benefit holds true in people. "We are now exploring how this receptor modulates brain immune responses through microglia," Kapur said. "These studies would allow us to come up with novel therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy and potentially other disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease." Finding better ways to treat epilepsy, Alzheimer's, and other neurological diseases is a core mission of UVA's new Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology. That institute works together with UVA's Brain Institute to bring top experts across UVA to speed up the transformation of basic scientific discoveries into new treatments and cures that will help patients across Virginia and around the world. Kapur and his colleagues have published their new findings in the scientific journal Annals of Neurology. The research team consisted of Soudabeh Naderi, John Williamson, Huayu Sun, Suchitra Joshi, Rachel Jane Spera, Savaira Zaib, Supriya Sharma, Chengsan Sun, Andrey Brodovskiy, Ifrah Zawar and Kapur.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When agitated dementia patients wander or shout through the night, families and caregivers understandably feel the need to treat this frightening and potentially dangerous behavior. Indeed, a research letter by Rutgers and Columbia University researchers in JAMA Psychiatry shows those prescriptions are becoming more common in the United States, even though antipsychotic drugs do little for dementia and carry a black-box warning on their labels stating they increase the risk of death in senior patients. Using a national prescription-claims database that captures more than 90% of retail pharmacy fills, researchers tracked antipsychotic use among adults 65 and older from 2015 through 2024 and found that the annual rate of any antipsychotic use increased nearly 52% to 4.05 per 100 from 2015 to 2024. Long-term use, defined as at least 120 days a year, rose 65% to 2.45 per 100 older adults. Rates were highest among people 75 and older, rising from 3.42 to 5.12 per 100. Antipsychotics may be used as a last resort to manage severe behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as aggression, agitation, hallucinations, or delusions, especially when these symptoms pose a risk to the safety of the individual or others. However, such use carries substantial risk and should be avoided in most cases and limited to short-term use whenever possible. The claims data don't include diagnoses, so the researchers couldn't determine why each prescription was written or whether it was appropriate. However, Crystal noted those conditions aren't common enough in older populations to explain the surging number of antipsychotic prescriptions. In many cases, the medications are used to "damp down" behaviors that are distressing to caregivers and disruptive to facilities, said Crystal, who also holds endowed professorships at the Institute for Health and Rutgers School of Social Work. Because the drugs can be highly sedating, they reduce the tendency to roam and act out, but that sedation comes with a steep tradeoff for frail patients, increasing fall risk and reducing physical activity. The study also reveals a shift in who manages cases. Over the same period, the share who filled an antipsychotic from a pharmacy in a long-term care facility rose from 14% to 21%. Crystal said the decline in psychiatrist involvement matters because optimal care for behavioral symptoms in dementia often starts with careful evaluation rather than a quick prescription. Clinicians may need to confirm the diagnosis and look for treatable causes that can mimic or worsen confusion, including medication interactions, infections, depression and unmanaged pain. Even when dementia is the main driver, nondrug approaches can work, but they require training, staffing and time. Which is common because it's so much easier to write a prescription than do the work of addressing the underlying condition, particularly at nursing home and assisted living facilities that are dangerously short-staffed." There was one potentially encouraging sign in the data: the use of first-generation antipsychotics, which are associated with higher mortality risk in older patients than second-generation medications, declined from 22% to 14%. Still, the overall rise in use and the growth in long-term prescribing suggest a system leaning more heavily on medication to solve problems that are often social, environmental and staffing-related. The authors have called for renewed efforts to evaluate and spread nonpharmacological interventions that can reduce reliance on antipsychotics in older adults. For families contending with a new prescription, the study's lead author, Mark Olfson of the Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, said that it is reasonable to ask what problem the drug is meant to address and what other steps have been tried. Just as important is what happens next: whether the clinician has a plan to reassess, taper and stop the medication once a crisis has passed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oncologists have achieved some immune system responses in patients with pancreatic cancers using various combinations of vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs, but it's not always clear which therapy is inducing what type of response. To help drive further study, investigators from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center have made public a free, web-based atlas of mass cytometry profiles from patients with metastatic pancreatic cancers. The atlas contains information from 260 cytometry profiles (of markers on immune cells) from blood samples from 64 patients who participated in three clinical trials of two pancreatic cancer vaccines and two checkpoint inhibitors in different permutations, explains Won Jin Ho, M.D., an associate professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and associate director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center's Convergence Institute. We also study patients before and after treatment so that we can understand longitudinal responses, or how cancer treatments induce changes in the immune system." The resource, available online through SciServer at sciserver.org/datasets/biomed/cytof_atlas, houses fully annotated cytometry data from three trials. Enabled by collaboration with the Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science at Johns Hopkins, the atlas' user interface and built-in tools simplify comparisons of cell types and expression levels. "Pancreatic cancer is such a lethal disease, which was our motivation to make this public," Ho says. "Our group has done a lot of investigational immunotherapy trials. These are early-phase trials of smaller groups of patients but have been very informative, even if the clinical outcomes have not met what we wanted." Dimitrios Sidiropoulos, Ph.D., a computational cancer immunologist at Johns Hopkins, co-led the cross-trial integration of the data, finding immune signatures in blood that are distinct to specific immunotherapies and that can be projected onto tumor tissues, demonstrating the utility of the atlas. "What we're hoping is that scientists can go to this repository, explore the data and generate hypotheses to carry out new studies," says Ho. Ho and colleagues have made additional data available from their studies: Raw protein expression data are shared in files available on zenodo (doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13937090). Analysis code is available on the GitHub repository (github.com/wjhlab/Immunotherapy-Atlas). In the same issue of the journal, Ho and colleagues also reported results of a new phase II study of 57 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease progressed while on chemotherapy. These findings, communicated as companion publications, are complementary in determining the effects of key immunotherapeutic agents. Adding anti-CTLA4 to the immunotherapy backbone significantly increases the infiltration of antigen-experienced T cells and "is going to be an important part of future immunotherapy backbones," Ho says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an important new study, Chinese researchers have discovered the previously unrecognized role of alternative splicing of the DOC2A gene in schizophrenia. Splicing is a process in which RNA is cut and recombined into the final RNA strand that determines how a protein-encoded by DNA-is formed. Different splicing signals for the same RNA strand can generate protein isoforms that function differently. The varied splicing signals may be generated by very small genetic variants in DNA-such as synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-that alter a single nucleotide without changing the encoded amino acid sequence. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with schizophrenia, the biological functions related to most of these statistical associations are poorly understood. To address this problem, the researchers sought to understand how different variants affect splicing and thus produce different protein isoforms. Using splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analyses of human postmortem brain tissues, the researchers identified more than 17,000 schizophrenia-associated sQTLs across the genome. Experimental validation confirmed that this variant promotes the expression of a truncated protein isoform, DOC2A△Val217–Pro218, while leaving the full-length transcript unaffected. In murine models, overexpression of this isoform in the hippocampus recapitulated schizophrenia-like behaviors, including anxiety, impaired sensorimotor gating, and anhedonia. Electrophysiological recordings further revealed enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission, and interactome profiling highlighted distinct molecular pathways, such as myosin II complex enrichment, suggesting altered synaptic functions. These findings integrate genetic, transcriptomic, and behavioral evidence to underscore the critical role of alternative splicing in the genetic regulation of schizophrenia. They also provide a framework for investigating unannotated isoforms in disease pathogenesis. A causal coding variant regulating alternative splicing of DOC2A at 16p.11.2 GWAS locus influences susceptibility to schizophrenia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About 1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and the risk varies depending on age and race. Although an estimated 10 million PSA tests are performed annually, there are few tools available to interpret the results and help patients decide what course of action to take. University of Michigan researchers have developed a model that can help doctors and patients understand their PSA results and what they mean for patient life expectancy. Current tools don't take into account how long someone may live or the benefit a patient may receive from treatment. Our model is the first to incorporate all these factors and help people understand whether they need further screening or treatment." Existing risk calculators are less accurate or predict prostate cancer risk through biopsy-based tests based on biopsy, which requires tissue samples and extra processing time. In a previous study, the researchers showed that PSA scores can impact both doctor and patient behavior, leading to biopsy referrals even when the risk of harm from prostate cancer is low. With this model, they hope that only patients who might benefit from further screening and treatment will receive referrals. The new model relies on PSA scores and was developed using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, which recruited more than 33,000 patients aged 55 to 74 years from 1993 to 2001. The researchers also took family history of prostate cancer, race, age, body mass index, smoking status and a history of hypertension, diabetes or stroke into account. "It is important to remember that we created and tested the model using data from two decades ago and a lot has changed since then," Stensland said. "Even though prostate cancer treatment is different now, our model improves on previous tools and can be used to decide how we do PSA screens." The researchers are now working to implement their model in clinical settings. Lewicki, P., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The college will receive a $1.1 million AMA Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education grant in the next four years to fund its project, "Ambient AI for precision feedback: Augmenting clinical reasoning and communication using real-time feedback". The AMA chose 11 team recipients from among nearly 200 applicants. The College of Medicine distinguished itself as an innovator and leader in precision education, advancing efforts to strengthen the physician workforce and support high-quality patient care. Medical trainees face insufficient high-quality feedback to inform their continued development in clinical settings. The grant's principal investigator Laurah Turner, PhD, and her team will develop AI algorithms for feedback delivery via smartphone app and through heads-up display in AI glasses, which will project crucial information in users' line of sight. The team will test it with approximately 600 trainees, both medical students and residents, at two sites. They then will scale from simulation to authentic patient encounters. Just as data analytics transformed professional sports, precision education is poised to transform how we train physicians. "Dr. Laurah Turner's pioneering work with ambient AI represents the next frontier in medical training. By leveraging real-time data to deliver personalized feedback, we can optimize learning for our students and residents while ensuring the next generation of physicians is prepared to deliver high-quality, precision-based care to our patients and community." The College of Medicine will collaborate with Arizona State University's School of Medicine and Medical Engineering and HonorHealth, a large health care system in the Phoenix metropolitan area. UC's project directly advances the AMA's precision education goals through tech-enabled assessment, personalizing training experiences and deploying new learning models across undergraduate and graduate medical education. "Technology and AI have the potential to reshape how physicians learn, practice and care for their patients, and these grants will help bring that potential to life," said AMA CEO John Whyte, MD. "As new tools emerge, we have an opportunity to build learning environments that are more engaging, more adaptable and better aligned with the realities of practicing medicine. Our goal is to ensure that innovation strengthens the physician experience and creates a future where every physician is fully equipped to meet the needs of patients." The AMA's $12 million investment will expand access to cutting-edge technology and systems that make learning more efficient, effective, and focused on optimal patient care. The Transforming Lifelong Learning Through Precision Education Grant Program was developed with national experts in augmented intelligence, assessment and medical education and follows more than a decade of AMA leadership through its ChangeMedEd® Initiative, which has invested nearly $50 million in reimagining medical education.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Damage can cause cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, leading to delayed healing, headaches, and infection, making a reliable watertight dural closure essential. Tissue adhesives are increasingly explored as alternatives to suturing for dural closure because they offer simpler and faster application. However, many existing glue-based sealants suffer from excessive swelling, leading to mass effect and unwanted tissue adhesion, which can lead to postoperative complications. To address these limitations, researchers have investigated Janus tissue patches, which feature two distinct surfaces-one that adheres strongly to tissue and another that prevents unwanted adhesion. Unfortunately, most existing Janus patches rely on multiple materials and complex, multi-step fabrication processes, limiting their practical use. In a breakthrough study, a research team from South Korea led by Professor Seung Yun Yang from the Department of Biomaterials Science at Pusan National University has developed an innovative light-responsive, monolithic Janus dural patch using photocurable hyaluronic acid (HA) through a simple approach. "Made from natural biopolymer hyaluronic acid, our dural patch provides strong wet adhesion, along with a lubricating surface that prevents unwanted tissue adhesion, after exposure to non-toxic visible light," explains Prof. Yang. The researchers selected HA because of its excellent biocompatibility as well as its intrinsic anti-adhesive and lubricating properties. To enable light activation, HA was chemically modified with photocrosslinkable groups-methacrylate (MA) and 4-pentenoate (PA). Laboratory tests showed that the patch could fully seal the wounds within five seconds using low-energy visible light. The dense outer surface exhibited strong wet adhesion, achieving high burst pressure and approximately 50% lower friction than conventional dural sealants. Notably, the adhesion strength was up to ten times higher than that of commercially available tissue adhesives. Meanwhile, the porous surface efficiently absorbed fluids and helped prevent unintended tissue adhesion. The team also tested the developed patch in a rabbit durotomy model, where it achieved rapid and effective dural closure without causing damage to the surrounding skull, dura mater, or brain tissue. The photocurable dural patch has been transferred to biotech company SNvia, which has established large-scale manufacturing facilities for photocrosslinkable hyaluronic acid. Nonclinical studies are expected to conclude in the first half of 2026, with a medical device clinical trial application to South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety planned for the same year. Overall, this innovative dural patch holds great potential for use in diverse applications requiring rapid, watertight sealing.
