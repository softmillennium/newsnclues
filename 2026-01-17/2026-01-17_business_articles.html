                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," President Donald Trump announced Saturday. The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. His post suggested that the new tariffs on the European allies were being imposed in response to them moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory. The eight countries "have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown," Trump wrote. "This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet." A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to change their drug prices. "I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security," he said at the White House on Friday. Trump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established in the aftermath of World War II. European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO. Trump's tariff announcement could mean he is dropping the threat of using the military to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale. Trump is an enthusiastic fan of using tariffs as a tool for gaining political leverage over other countries. The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo Texas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the "Reserve Race" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies. New Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms. Congress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. "If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction," he said. Where the state-level crypto efforts can be described as "bigger steps" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states. Similarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden. It is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market. "Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step," Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract. Texas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold. "Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there," said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer. When it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000. "Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection," Bhatia said. Texas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a "placeholder" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place. In addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm. "The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state," Marlowe said. It is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. "What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral," he said. In numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries. "But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence is no longer a narrow technology trade. It is reshaping energy markets, infrastructure spending, and portfolio construction. Investors who focus only on chips and software risk missing where the next phase of value is occurring, according to investing experts on this week's episode of CNBC's "ETF Edge." Power, cooling, grid stability, and data center efficiency have become binding constraints. Just look at the stock price of Bloom Energy, which for years after its 2018 IPO struggled to eke out a return above its IPO price. Since last year, when its onsite fuel cells began being ordered furiously for data centers, Bloom has seen its shares shoot up over 500% and the company reached a market cap above $30 billion. Many opportunities are being created in small- and mid-cap companies for investors. Firms that once sat outside the market's focus are now "very quickly moving up the cap table," TCW Group global head of distribution Jennifer Grancio said on "ETF Edge" on Monday. In many cases, these companies operate in narrow segments with limited competition, allowing fundamentals to improve faster than investor awareness. In recent years, as the cost of renewable energy sources came down and became competitive with fossil fuel sources, the market debated "How much regularity could we get out of wind, or could we get out of solar?" But AI has shifted the conversation since data centers cannot tolerate intermittency, requiring a constant supply of power to avoid unintended downtime. That reality has driven "a huge shift towards nuclear," according to Grancio, including renewed investment in servicing existing plants and developing small modular reactors. As AI workloads expand, cooling and power management have become the chokepoints. In some cases, there are "only a few providers" bordering on oligopolies, Grancio said. That concentration creates operating leverage, but it also means missteps can be costly. Actively managed ETFs are gaining traction as a result. While passive indices can capture broad market returns and the indexes do add new companies as components as they scale, active strategies aim to identify them earlier and hold them through multiple phases of growth. Some parts of the AI-powered ecosystems include "small, financially weak companies" that are leveraged to electricity demand, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck. "That also means you get a lot of volatility along the way," he said on "ETF Edge." As a result, he said no single AI theme should dominate an investor's asset allocation. "You don't want to overweight them in your portfolio," Van Eck said. He described Van Eck's nuclear ETF as having traded at "nosebleed levels" last year before it came down to a more reasonable entry point for new investors. The ETF experts said that as investors bring the AI theme into their portfolio construction in a more targeted way in 2026, active rebalancing and clear risk expectations will allow investors to stay invested without chasing peaks or panicking at drawdowns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. In "Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy," which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Who would they choose — and why? "Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy," Buffett says. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five." So what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. The rest of your life you're underwater." Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. "Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out," he says. Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of "selling himself" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients. "Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it." Want to get ahead at work with AI?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.) Warren Buffett and Becky Quick covered too many topics in the interviews that aired in a two-hour special on CNBC Tuesday evening for me to write a cogent summary. "Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy" included discussions about his inability to find a big company to purchase for Berkshire Hathaway as its cash pile moves toward $400 billion, new CEO Greg Abel, his company's future and past, the difficulty of giving away billions of dollars, and the invaluable role of luck in his success. Here, however, are some brief clips and quotes that caught my attention. You get 250, 300, even up to 500 thousand dollars a year for doing something that's quite pleasant. "Everything I wanted to have happen has worked out... Doesn't mean that everything we've done has worked out. And Charlie and I would have more fun out of the things that didn't work a lot of times than (if they) did." Even though the special was two hours long, there was more interview than time, forcing the producer to make some difficult decisions. Here for Warren Buffett Watch readers is a clip that she wanted to get into the final cut. Buffett explains why he hasn't been speaking out on politics in recent years: BECKY QUICK:  You haven't commented as much publicly lately, either. WARREN BUFFETT:  Well, for one thing, I made the statement a few years ago — maybe, I don't know, five or six years ago — somebody asked about taking a political stance. And I said that you don't put your citizenship in a blind trust. WARREN BUFFETT:  And — as a CEO, yeah. But I think — I've revisited that opinion in my mind, because people will have — gotten so tribal. We saw it on our gifts program at one time. But there's no reason why somebody that's answering a phone at GEICO or waiting on a customer at the Nebraska Furniture Mart should be dealing with people who have a negative opinion of the company because of something I've said. But I don't really want — I've got identified so much with Berkshire that I — as long as I'm speaking at the annual meeting or anything like that, people will associate it with the voice of Berkshire to some extent. And the employees don't deserve that. And so I backed away from that. Buffett has given his three adult children the extremely difficult talk of unanimously deciding how to give away his enormous net worth after he dies. When she was in Omaha to interview their father, Becky sat down with Howard, Susan, and Peter Buffett to talk about that assignment, their own philanthropic efforts, and what it was like growing up in Buffett's famously unassuming house. In this excerpt, they remember how their father got "clever" about giving them an allowance: SUSAN BUFFETT: It was a dime slot machine. SUSAN BUFFETT: He got it all back. HOWARD BUFFETT: And then he bought the slot machine, so he would get most of his allowance back. At least with me, he got a lot of it back. In his Inside Wealth report on Wednesday's "Squawk Box," Robert Frank explained why Buffett's children may have the most difficult job in philanthropy: "Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy" will be shown again on CNBC this coming Sunday, January 18 at 3 PM ET and Monday, January 19 at 7 AM ET.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 8 in 10 retiree households — 83% — will face unplanned outlays in any given year, according to new research from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Among households that do experience unexpected expenses, the average annual amount spent across retirement is $6,000. Measured another way, the typical household will spend an amount equivalent to 10% of its yearly income. Yet many households don't have that available in emergency savings, according to the research. While roughly 58% have enough cash to cover unplanned costs for a single year, around 16% would have to tap their 401(k) or other retirement accounts and the rest — about 27% — would fall short even after using all their cash and retirement assets. "About 40% of [retired] households do not have enough cash to cover even a single year [of unplanned expenses], let alone their whole retirement," the research notes. While experts generally recommend nonretirees have three to six months of living expenses set aside as emergency savings in case of job loss or other financial shocks, that amount may look different for retirees — who must figure out how to stretch their savings across what may be a decades-long retirement. As many retirees struggle to keep up with prices that continue to rise, considering unexpected expenses is an important part of evaluating retirement readiness. "That helps you plan for liquidity versus your income needs," said Anqi Chen, co-author of the report and associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research. While some households may struggle to set aside money, "even small amounts of savings will help provide some sort of buffer for when these events occur," Chen said. Expenses are separated into three categories in the research: Higher-income retirees experience these unexpected expenses at a greater rate than those with lower incomes, according to the research. For example, about 45% of households with less than $50,000 in income face a rainy day or health-care shock in a given year, compared with 80% of those with $100,000 or more in income. "This finding highlights the fact that households have some control over when and how much they spend," the report notes. Much of it will depend on your individual situation. "What we usually tell clients is to think less in terms of months of expenses and more in terms of access to cash for surprises — health-care costs, home repairs or family needs," said certified financial planner Joon Um, a tax advisor with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California. "For many retirees, that ends up being one year of core expenses, adjusted for guaranteed income like Social Security or pensions," Um said. The right amount depends on health, housing, income stability and how flexible other assets are, Um said. "Retirees with steady income and liquid portfolios may need less cash, while those with higher medical risk or less flexibility need more," Um said. In other words, if you don't have enough cash set aside, you could be put in a position of selling investments when the market is down. However, having too much in cash comes with its own risks, said Peter Lazaroff, a chartered financial analyst and CFP, and the chief investment officer at Plancorp in St. Louis. "Any time a retiree has more than two years of expenses in cash, it's too much," Lazaroff said. The biggest risk to your cash is inflation, he said. "Your cash just becomes less valuable every year," he said. He recommends stashing your cash in a high-yield savings account — which right now generally earns more than 3% in interest, according to Bankrate — to help minimize the impact of inflation.

A report published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid found that there are 1.4 million fewer people enrolled in insurance through ACA marketplaces this month compared to January 2025. States like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, and Georgia saw the most significant dips. "People have less access to care, and that tends to translate into worse health outcomes," said Matthew Fiedler, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. Or they do pay, but it requires them to skimp in other areas." Business Insider broke down the enrollment changes by state — and spoke with experts about why this CMS data doesn't yet tell the whole story of marketplace enrollment in 2026. Registration in a few states, like Texas and California, increased. Every time Allie publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

They allowed people with incomes up to 400% of the poverty line (which is $128,600 annually for a family of four) to claim relief on healthcare costs. A KFF estimate found that, without these credits in place, Americans in the marketplace could see their out-of-pocket premium costs more than double compared to last year. White House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that "ACA enrollment declined by 3.5 percent between 2025 and 2026 — entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans." "Much less the question of how this would work, who would get what, and why this is better than directly covering people's premiums to prevent the spikes millions of people are facing right now." Policy analysts told Business Insider they expect a steeper decline in ACA enrollment over the next few months. The latest data shows how many Americans selected a marketplace plan during open enrollment or were automatically renewed for their existing ACA coverage. It doesn't capture how many people have paid their health insurance premiums, meaning that more people are likely to drop coverage once they start receiving bills. A recent Congressional Budget Office report estimates that nearly 4 million Americans will lose or drop insurance over the next decade. "Many likely signed up when the premiums they would end up facing were uncertain and then waited to see what they would have to pay," said Matthew Buettgens, a senior fellow at The Urban Institute. For the few states where enrollment spiked, Fielder theorized that local healthcare policy is a factor. California offers its own ACA subsidies, for example, so residents are less vulnerable to the federal changes. Besides the direct impact on patients, Fielder also said the lapse of ACA credits could put more pressure on hospitals, because providers could see an influx of uninsured patients, and people would be less likely to seek care in the first place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs. This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. Berge said: "It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company." Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. "I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure," he said. Fridjtoff added that it "matters less" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. "You might not think with a blank-slate state," he said. "I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training," he added. In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. "He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world," Berge said. Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers. "I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years," He added.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As companies rush to adopt AI to boost productivity and cut costs, they may be setting themselves up for a new problem: losing what makes them different. Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, said widespread reliance on the same AI tools risks flattening competitive advantage across industries, because firms increasingly rely on identical systems to think, write, and decide for them. Paryavi said that as AI tools become cheaper, more powerful, and more widely deployed, companies risk outsourcing the very thinking that once differentiated them.

As generative AI becomes embedded across workplaces, Paryavi warned that the biggest risk isn't automation — it's uniformity. That concern echoes warnings from researchers and academics who say AI can produce polished output at scale, but also flips human thinking by delivering fluent answers before understanding, creating an illusion of expertise that weakens judgment and depth. It's not just a question of companies all thinking the same — Paryavi warned that treating AI as a shortcut to efficiency can quietly hollow out human judgment, expertise, and control, leaving businesses faster in the short term but more fragile over time. Over time, Paryavi said, that shift can erode internal expertise and decision-making capacity. "But this is going to be very expensive down the line." As firms replace employees with AI subscriptions, they become increasingly reliant on external vendors to function effectively. Paryavi compared the AI boom to the early 2000s rush to cloud computing, when many companies initially adopted third-party infrastructure but later repatriated workloads in-house as costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in became concerns — a trend commonly referred to in tech as cloud repatriation. As companies downsize human teams, they also lose institutional knowledge and the ability to operate without automation, he said. "You've killed all your chances of ever becoming independent as an organization," he said. In fields such as medicine, scientific research, and disaster prediction, it can significantly accelerate progress. But without clear guardrails, companies risk trading long-term resilience for short-term speed. "It's a very powerful tool," Paryavi said, comparing AI to an atomic bomb.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Environmental Protection Agency closed a loophole this week that Elon Musk's xAI had exploited to rapidly stand up its first data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above "major source thresholds" of pollution. The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process. Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment. The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google. At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X. While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's "temporary" turbines. SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment. Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention. Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits. Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environment Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they aren't violating terms of their permits, and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi.
