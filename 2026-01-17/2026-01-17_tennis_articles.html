                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Zheng will take five courses this spring semester at Columbia University in New York, where he is a senior. But even though school begins on 20 January, that will not be his focus this week. “Right now, I'm really excited,” Zheng, a qualifier, told ATPTour.com. Yet he has balanced a rigorous education — earning Academic All-American honours as well as the Rafael Osuna National Sportsmanship Award in 2025 — and college tennis with proving he can compete with the best players in the world. Joe, who moved to the United States from China, fell in love with the sport upon his arrival and passed it along to his children. Growing up in New Jersey, Zheng spent three days a week during middle school training at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, home of the US Open. “I had some talent, so he wanted to see how far he could take it,” Zheng said of his father. “And now we're here playing my first main draw [of a major]. Zheng is an active college student who in the coming days has to prepare for psychology courses in the New York winter. Instead, he is heating up in the Australian summer. The humble student does not make a big deal of it, but Ivy League coursework is difficult enough on its own. "The academic rigour has helped Michael in many ways, especially mentally,” said Howard Endelman, the head coach of men's tennis at Columbia. Although it might be counter-intuitive, this combination has helped Michael develop as a complete person which has actually helped his tennis." “I think it just gives you that little bit of a mental edge, that you're doing maybe a little bit more than these other guys, and at the same time, your level is there.” “I think it just gives you that little bit of a mental edge, that you're doing maybe a little bit more than these other guys, and at the same time, your level is there.” What makes his moment in the spotlight Sunday against Sebastian Korda at Melbourne Park more impressive is how he got there. Not only did he work his way through a tough qualifying draw, but made a big run to earn his place in qualifying in the first place. In early June, Zheng was still outside the world's Top 700. But a run to the ATP Challenger final in Little Rock began a huge surge, with titles in Chicago, Columbus and Tiburon showing it was no fluke. "Right after winning the Tiburon Challenger final in October, Michael took a Sunday night red-eye flight so he could take an in-person exam Monday morning in New York City,” Endelman said. The latter two tournament victories came while Zheng was taking five classes, before successfully defending his NCAA singles crown. “I'm travelling, missing quite a bit of class, so I'm not going to do anything too crazy, like neuroscience, biology or something like that. Entering college, Zheng had not planned to study psychology, but economics. The 21-year-old has found it interesting, even if he does not believe that there is a firm link between his studies and psychology on the tennis court. Zheng's memorable run nearly came to an end in the final round of qualifying against Lukas Klein, against whom he faced a match point in the final-set tie-break. "Nothing seems to bother Michael — on or off the court — especially when things go wrong,” Endelman said. “Michael lost the lead after being up 7/1 and 9/7 in the final-set tiebreaker, then all of a sudden was serving down 9/10. 174 is not too concerned about what will come with his Psychology degree at the moment. “I'm not thinking too longterm right now,” Zheng said. “I'm just focussing on seeing how far I can take the tennis and giving 100 per cent focus on that at least.” Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gabriel Diallo has not practised with or competed against World No. But the 24-year-old is flying higher than ever and excited to step on the court inside Rod Laver Arena Sunday to take on the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion. “I'm very grateful that I'm in this position to play in a Slam, one of the biggest courts against one of the best players in the world. So it's all a bonus,” Diallo told ATPTour.com. “We train hard and we work hard to position ourselves to play in those kind of matches. We start playing tennis, to play those kind of matches. So I'm really excited and looking forward to playing.” First of all, just from the back and in terms of a performance standpoint, he's been in the Top 10 for I don't know how many years. And then, obviously in terms of his game, he's got a great serve, great backhand, solid forehand,” Diallo said. At the end of the day, I think for me it's another match, it's another learning experience.” Diallo is currently doing plenty of learning. He split with longtime coach Martin Laurendeau and began working with Jonas Bjorkman and Johan Ortegren. “I've got the full Swedish delegation now,” Diallo said, cracking a laugh. “I'm excited to see where that's going to take me, and very grateful for the past five years I had with Marty. We had an amazing run since I was in college, all the way to now. Someone that will always stay very close to me and that has a special place in my heart.” While Ortegren was also a professional tennis player, Bjorkman stands out for his efforts reaching No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings and No. He just came to Adelaide, so it was the first time I saw him there. But yeah, so far it's been very good. “He has a lot of expertise and as a player, he was where I aspire to be. Won my first title, big quarters in the Masters,” Diallo said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andreeva first borrowed the catchphrase from Snoop Dogg, and brought it back after a decisive win over Victoria Mboko on Saturday.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 17, 2026 copy_link Fresh off winning her first title of the 2026 season, Mirra Andreeva unveiled a stylish surprise at the Adelaide International, donning a sweatshirt with what has become her signature post-win catchphrase, “I would like to thank myself.”Andreeva didn't directly acknowledge the sweatshirt after defeating Victoria Mboko in Saturday's final, but she jokingly leaned into the theme all the same in her victory speech.“I guess my team comes next,” she said after thanking her opponent and the tournament's staff and sponsors and physios. “But I do feel like it was all me. I've been working, sweating and I don't even know why you're here, honestly!”The 18-year-old explained the genesis of the catchphrase in her post-match press conference.

I've been working, sweating and I don't even know why you're here, honestly!”The 18-year-old explained the genesis of the catchphrase in her post-match press conference. Because I saw him saying that on some kind of interview when he said, "I want to thank me." And then his song was playing on the background. So I stole it from him.“Since then, like people love that, when I say that thing. And then, yeah, after that it kind of became the thing that I say on the speech.”Andreeva hadn't had occasion to bring back the catchphrase since Indian Wells, having not reached a final since last March. The teenager ended that drought in style this week in Adelaide, breezing through the field without dropping a set—culminating with a 6-3, 6-1 win over a talented, but physically compromised Mboko.

Obviously, I feel more confident after this win. Also winning a title is super special to me as well. So, yeah, I just have to kind of, maybe today and tomorrow I relax a little bit, we practice, and then we have to get to work again.”To earn more gratitude, Andreeva will get to work against Donna Vekic in the first round of the Australian Open, the pair scheduled to face off on Margaret Court Arena Monday evening. “I just have to bring the same level of my game and the same mindset into Melbourne.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Does Novak Djokovic believe he can beat Jannik Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz in best-of-five set matches at the Grand Slams? After his defeat at Flushing Meadows, he candidly expressed doubt that he could still stay with Sinner or Alcaraz at the majors. If I don't have that self-belief and confidence in myself, I wouldn't be sitting here and talking to you guys or competing,” Djokovic said. So I like my chances always, in any tournament, particularly here.” “I'm missing a little bit of juice in my legs, to be honest, to be able to compete with these guys at the later stages of a Grand Slam,” said Djokovic, who withdrew from this week's Adelaide International, saying that his body wasn't quite ready to return to competition. I'm still trying to be in the mix.” Djokovic, 38, is attempting to win his 13th major after the age of 30. For context, Pete Sampras won 14 Grand Slams throughout his career. Fifth-seeded Djokovic opens his 21st Australian Open campaign against Spaniard Pedro Martinez. Aged 38 years 255 days, Djokovic is bidding to become the oldest player in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam men's singles title and the first man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam title aged 38 or older. Should he reach the final here, Djokovic will become the 2nd man in the Open Era to reach multiple Grand Slam finals after turning 37, after Rosewall, who contested 3 Grand Slam finals after his 37th birthday. He would also become the 2nd man in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam final after turning 38, after Rosewall, who contested 2 Grand Slam finals aged 39. Djokovic is also bidding to win his 13th Grand Slam title since turning 30 and extend his record for most Grand Slam singles titles won after the age of 30 in the Open Era. He claimed sole ownership of the record by winning his 11th Grand Slam title since turning 30 at 2023 Roland Garros, moving ahead of Serena Williams. Djokovic is bidding to win his 5th Australian Open title since turning 30. Djokovic is bidding to win the title here 18 years after winning his first Grand Slam title here in 2008 and claim the Open Era record for longest gap between first and most-recent Grand Slam singles titles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 24-year-old is fresh off a breakthrough season, one in which she captured two WTA 1000 titles and reached two Grand Slam finals, and arrives Down Under at a career-high ranking of No. “Well, it's like pretty personal,” Anisimova joked of her decision to go back to blonde after a winning season as a brunette. But then after like a month it would look really bad. Didn't really suit me.“I was just tired of, yeah, the maintenance. I'm someone who likes to keep changing things up. We'll see how it goes.”So far, Anisimova hasn't seen a major dip in form: her 2026 debut came at the Brisbane International, where she won a round but fell to eventual finalist Marta Kostyuk. Despite ending the season with plenty of momentum—culminating with a semifinal finish at the WTA Finals—the perennially unbothered New Jersey native was relieved for the chance to slow down and retool in the off-season.“It's good to have a chunk of time when you're just able to be at home and relax a bit,” she said dryly of her “productive” time off. I made sure to not take my time at home for granted. I'm someone who likes to keep changing things up.

So please don't spoil it for me. I want to be surprised after every match. That's it.”The six-time Grand Slam champion has no problem going head-to-head with the media, taking umbrage with the premise of a question about her energy levels last summer after a US Open defeat. 1 is seeded second in the women's draw and was not happy to learn that both Naomi Osaka and Elena Rybakina landed in her quarter, employing a fairly spectacular eye roll before shutting down the topic entirely.“I'm not looking at the draw,” said Swiatek who, like many players, prefers not to see the full bracket. “So thanks for the heads-up.”“It's not a joke,” she added firmly.

I think this is what tennis sometimes needs, to put the events out like that. Yeah, playing against Flavio was super fun. Honestly, I like to play against guys. I already could do that in some mixed doubles.

At 24 years old Swiatek, who began the year with a win for Poland at the United Cup, is part of a trio that includes Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner of active players with victories at three of the four major tournaments. But that's a narrative Swiatek insists she's not thinking too much about.“I think you guys are thinking more about it,” she said through another awkward—but decidedly less tense—exchange. “Since the beginning of the year, there are many people coming to me and talking to me about it. I'm really just focusing on, like, day-by-day work. This is how it's always been for me. This is how I actually was able to achieve the success that I already have, just focusing really on grinding, match by match.Winning a Grand Slam is tough. Obviously, it would be a dream come true. This is not, like, my clear goal that I wake up with. I'm thinking more about how I want to play, what I want to improve, like, day by day.”That day by day process will begin on Monday against Yuan Yue—an opponent about whom Swiatek will no doubt be duly informed. “I think you guys are thinking more about it,” she said through another awkward—but decidedly less tense—exchange. “Since the beginning of the year, there are many people coming to me and talking to me about it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no shortage of compelling narratives at this year's Australian Open, where Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic all arrive with history firmly in their sights. Two-time defending champion Sinner and record 10-time winner Djokovic stand among a deep field of contenders eager to halt the Spaniard's charge. ATPTour.com highlights 10 storylines to follow at the 2026 Australian Open. 1) Alcaraz chases Career Grand Slam: Alcaraz has yet to progress beyond the quarter-finals in four previous appearances at the Australian Open, but he has made no secret of his ambition to lift the title in Melbourne. 1 will become just the sixth man in the Open Era to win at least one major title at all four Grand Slam tournaments. 3) Djokovic returns to stomping ground: After being forced to retire injured from his semi-final against Alexander Zverev last year, Djokovic is back at his most successful major with renewed motivation. The 38-year-old claimed his 101st tour-level title in Athens in November and is chasing a 25th Grand Slam trophy, which would move him clear of Margaret Court on the all-time list. 4) Zverev pushes on in bid for maiden Slam: A three-time major finalist, Zverev continues to feature prominently in the latter stages of the biggest tournaments, but the elusive breakthrough remains. The German, runner-up to Sinner last year, begins his campaign against powerful Canadian Gabriel Diallo. 5) Resurgent Medvedev: Following a strong close to the 2025 season and a title run in Brisbane to open 2026, Daniil Medvedev appears revitalised after managing just one major match win last year. 1 and three-time Melbourne finalist, Medvedev could meet longtime rival Zverev in the quarter-finals. 6) Aussie hopes on home soil: At a career-high No. The 26-year-old, a competitor at the past two Nitto ATP Finals, is joined in the main draw by fellow Australians Alexei Popyrin, Adam Walton — who opens against Alcaraz — and James Duckworth, while Jason Kubler advanced through qualifying. 7) #NextGen talents take centre stage: Recent Next Gen ATP Finals champions Learner Tien and Joao Fonseca return as the 25th and 28th seeds, respectively. Tien stunned Medvedev en route to the fourth round last year, while Fonseca claimed a notable win over Andrey Rublev. They are joined by 2025 Jeddah competitors Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, Rafael Jodar, Nishesh Basavareddy and Dino Prizmic, as well as 19-year-old Rei Sakamoto.

Australian Jordan Thompson also enters via wild card, having not played a tour-level match since October in Shanghai. 9) First-round popcorn clashes: De Minaur faces an immediate challenge against former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini. 8 Ben Shelton, a semi-finalist last year, opens against Adelaide finalist Ugo Humbert, while Grigor Dimitrov versus Tomas Machac adds to a trio of must-watch opening-round encounters. 10) Kokkinakis/Kyrgios feature in doubles: Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool arrive as the top seeds after finishing 2025 by claiming Year-End ATP Doubles No. The doubles field also includes 2022 Australian Open champions Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios, adding further intrigue to the competition.
