White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller discusses President Donald Trump's maneuvering to take control of Greenland on ‘Hannity.' A bipartisan, bicameral group of U.S. lawmakers set off to Denmark to reassure the NATO ally amid President Donald Trump's push for a takeover of Greenland. The group was mostly made of Democrats, but included two Republicans: Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Murkowski, Tillis, Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., and Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., were among those who traveled to Europe for meetings with Danish and Greenlandic officials. Some members of the delegation are expected to go to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. "The trip will highlight bipartisan support for our allies in the Kingdom of Denmark and discuss how to deepen this partnership in line with our shared principles of sovereignty and self-determination, and in the face of growing challenges around the world, especially bolstering Arctic security and promoting stronger trade relations between the two countries," a statement Shaheen issued prior to the visit read. "A great day leading our bipartisan delegation to Copenhagen meeting with Danish and Greenlandic officials to reaffirm Congress' commitment to one of our oldest, strongest NATO allies. The visit comes as Trump's renewed push for the U.S. to takeover Greenland continues to draw criticism from both sides of the aisle and some of America's allies. "That rhetoric doesn't just undermine our bilateral relationship, it undermines the NATO alliance at a time when our adversaries seek to benefit from division," Shaheen said during a speech at the University of Copenhagen. The trip began before Trump announced on Saturday planned tariffs for Denmark and several European nations in a bid to force a deal for the U.S. purchase of Greenland. Thousands gathered across the country to show their solidarity with Greenland. The crowds chanted "Greenland is not for sale" and held banners with slogans such as "Hands off Greenland," according to Reuters. "I am very grateful for the huge support we as Greenlanders receive... we are also sending a message to the world that you all must wake up," Julie Rademacher, chair of Uagut, an organization for Greenlanders in Denmark, told Reuters. A "Make America Go Away" baseball cap, distributed for free by Danish artist Jens Martin Skibsted, is arranged in Sisimiut, Greenland, on March 30, 2025. Trump has insisted that the U.S. needs Greenland for purposes of national security, saying that Russia and China were eyeing the island. During her speech at the University of Copenhagen, Shaheen argued that Trump's approach is unnecessary, saying the U.S. already has pathways to secure its interests in the Arctic. "Anything the president might want — whether it is U.S. bases to defend against Arctic threats or critical minerals deals — the leaders of Denmark and Greenland have made clear they are happy to partner with us. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker pushed back against growing European backlash over Washington's focus on Greenland after France announced new military exercises with Denmark, saying Arctic security is a core American defense interest and that Europe "has a tendency to overreact." Americans appear divided on the idea, however, with 86% of voters nationwide saying they would oppose military action to take over Greenland, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. The survey found that voters opposed any U.S. effort to buy Greenland by a 55%–37% margin, suggesting the idea has yet to gain broad support among American voters.

Bolivian President Rodrigo Paz, left, greets Paraguay's President Santiago Pena during a meeting to sign a free trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur, in Asuncion, Paraguay, Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026. ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay (AP) — The European Union and the Mercosur bloc of South American countries formally signed a long-sought landmark free trade agreement on Saturday, capping more than a quarter-century of torturous negotiations to strengthen commercial ties in the face of rising protectionism and trade tensions around the world. The signing ceremony in Paraguay's humid capital of Asunción marks a major geopolitical victory for the EU in an age of American tariffs and surging Chinese exports, expanding the bloc's foothold in a resource-rich region increasingly contested by Washington and Beijing. It also sends a message that South America keeps diverse trade and diplomatic relations even as U.S. President Donald Trump declares dominance in the Western Hemisphere. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who head's the EU's executive branch, said “the geopolitical importance of this agreement cannot be overstated” amid revived skepticism about the benefits of free trade. As the ceremony got underway, Trump announced 10% tariffs on eight European nations over their opposition to American control of Greenland. “We will join forces like never before, because we believe that this is the best way to make our people and our countries prosper.” Pushed by South America's renowned cattle-raising countries and Europe's industrial sectors craving new markets for cars and machines, the accord creates one of the world's largest free trade zones and makes shopping cheaper for more than 700 million consumers. Powerful protectionist lobbies on both sides of the Atlantic, particularly European farmers scared of the possible dumping of cheap South American agricultural imports, have long sought to scupper the agreement. Although the accord eliminates more than 90% tariffs on goods and services between the European and Mercosur markets, some tariffs will progressively be cut over 10-15 years and key farm products like beef will be limited by strict quotas in a bid to assuage European farmers' fears. Those limits, as well as safeguard measures and generous EU subsidies to cash-strapped farmers, pushed agricultural powerhouse Italy across the line earlier this month. “Everything will depend on the political appetite of the European Parliament,” said João Paulo Cavalcanti, a Brazilian lawyer specializing in international trade. “That could clearly create an obstacle to approval.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ADDS IDENTIFICATION - Aliya Rahman is detained by federal agents near the scene where Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer last week, Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026, in Minneapolis. Law enforcement officers stand amid tear gas at the scene of a reported shooting Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis. President Donald Trump walks to Marine One for departure from the South Lawn of the White House, Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, in Washington. As its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis intensifies, the Trump administration is leaning into messaging that borrows from phrases, images and music about national identity that have become popular among right-wing groups. And this past week, as President Donald Trump stepped up his pressure campaign to claim Greenland, the White House posted an image on X that showed a dog sled facing a fork in the trail, one that leads to an American flag and the White House and another that leads to the Russian and Chinese flags. The post refers to a meme that riffs off the title of a notorious white supremacist book titled “Which Way Western Man?” The administration had already used the framing in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruiting post last year, which asked, “Which way, American Man?” The administration says it's tired of criticism that its messaging is framed around white supremacy or Nazi slogans. “It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: The deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “This line of attack is boring and tired. Referring to the “We'll Have Our Home Again” post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said it “was a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.” “I don't know where you guys are getting this stuff,” she added, “but it is absurd.” “You don't have to dip into white supremacist sloganeering to promote immigration regulation,” he said, noting that former President Bill Clinton signed two bills toughening penalties on immigrants who were in the country illegally in the 1990s without doing so. He added that the administration seems to calibrate its references. “The imagery is not simply a reproduction of common white supremacist imagery or text, but a play on that imagery — and that gives them the breathing room they want,” Garcia Hernández said. Trump won his second term with robust support from Latino voters and increased his backing among both Black and Asian voters, all while running on pledges of tough border enforcement and mass deportations. Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own. In his first term, he bemoaned the number of immigrants coming from what he called “shithole countries” such as Haiti or ones in Africa, while wondering why the U.S. doesn't draw more people from Norway. Trump changed immigration policy to favor whites in one area by shutting down the admission of refugees except for white South Africans, whom he contends, against evidence, are being discriminated against in their home country. Elon Musk, who was Trump's biggest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign and ran the president's Department of Government Efficiency for the first part of last year, recirculated a user post on X, the social platform he owns, that called for “white solidarity” to prevent the mass murder of white men and added a “100” emoji indicating agreement. The administration's history has led to claims that it's using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it. In the aftermath of the Good shooting in Minnesota, a sign that appeared on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's lectern during a news conference — reading “One Of Ours, All Of Yours” — drew widespread attention on social media, with many commentators suggesting it was a Nazi phrase. Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it's doing with its messaging slogans. “I don't think it's a tenable strategy for the long term because the stuff is incomprehensible to most people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cars make their way onto the recently converted two-way portion of Michigan Street in Indianapolis, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Cars make their way onto the recently converted two-way portion of Michigan Street in Indianapolis, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. A passenger awaits the arrival of an IndyGo bus on the recently converted two-way portion of Michigan Street in Indianapolis, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Excessive speeding was so common on parallel one-way streets passing a massive electronics plant that Indianapolis residents used to refer to the pair as a “racetrack” akin to the city's famous Motor Speedway a few miles west. But after the RCA plant closed in 1995, the suddenly barren roads grew even more enticing for lead-footed drivers — until last year, when city officials finally converted them back to two-way streets. “The opening and conversion of those streets has just been transformative for how people think about that corridor,” said James Taylor, who runs a nearby community center. Embracing the oft-repeated slogan that “paint is cheap,” transportation planners across the U.S. — particularly in midsize cities — have been turning their unidirectional streets back to multidirectional ones. They view the step as one of the easiest ways to improve safety and make downtowns more alluring to shoppers, restaurant patrons and would-be residents. Dave Amos, an assistant professor of city and regional planning at California Polytechnic State University, said almost no major streets in the U.S. originated as one-way routes. “One-way streets are designed for moving cars quickly and efficiently,” Amos said. “So when you have that as your goal, pedestrians and cyclists almost by design are secondary, which makes them more vulnerable.” Wade Walker, an engineer with Kittelson & Associates who has worked on street conversion projects in Lakeland, Florida; Lynchburg, Virginia; and Chattanooga, Tennessee, said there is a misperception that one-way streets are safer because people on foot only have to look one direction to see the incoming traffic. Pedestrians crossing a signalized intersection of two-way streets can expect to encounter vehicles in a certain sequence: those turning left on green, traveling straight, and turning right on red. But when one-way streets are included, there are 16 potential sequences depending on the type and direction of the roads that intersect, Walker said. Louisville, Kentucky, about two hours south of Indianapolis, has been restoring one-way streets to their original two-way footprints. However, it decimated neighborhoods and cut off the once-thriving community from downtown. “All those mom-and-pop shops and local businesses over time kind of faded because that connectivity got taken away,” said Michael King, the city's assistant director of transportation planning. “It just feels more like, ‘This is a road to get me through here pretty quickly. Within three years after some of Chattanooga's two-way streets were transformed into unidirectional ones, business vacancies skyrocketed and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga became “landlocked” to prevent students from having to cross a dangerous road, Walker said. In 2022, almost two decades after the road was redesigned, he returned to find the college campus had expanded across it and business construction had surged. When Lynchburg, Virginia launched a long-discussed plan to change its downtown Main Street back to two ways, Rodney Taylor voiced concerns that it would doom his restaurant by blocking delivery vehicles. Many residents also changed their tune in Austin, Texas, when the city began reconverting some of the one-way streets in its urban core, said Adam Greenfield, executive director with Safe Streets Austin. “It just worked,” said Greenfield, who is now lobbying the city to do away with all its one-way streets. “That's what you'll find with these conversions — they'll be done and then instantly people will be like, ‘Why didn't we do this 20 years ago? After Chicago went the opposite direction last year and suddenly changed some of its two-way streets to one-way in the busy West Loop restaurant district, a politician representing an adjacent area got numerous calls from confused constituents. Now that Indianapolis has finished the redesigns for Michigan and New York streets, there are 10 other conversions on tap next, said Mark St. John, chief engineer for the city's Department of Public Works. Some business owners, however, have signaled construction plans along the redesigned streets, which Taylor says still feel a little strange. “I've been driving around that neighborhood for 30 years,” he said.</p>

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to American control of Greenland. The Republican president has repeatedly tried to use trade penalties to bend allies and rivals alike to his will, generating investment commitments from some nations and pushback from others such as China, Brazil and India. It was unclear how Trump could impose the tariffs under U.S. law, though he could cite economic emergency powers that are currently subject to a U.S. Supreme Court challenge. Trump said in his Truth Social post that his tariffs were retaliation for recent trips to Greenland by representatives from Britain, the Netherlands and Finland and for general opposition to his efforts to purchase the semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. The Greenlanders waved their red-and-white national flags and listened to traditional songs as they walked through Nuuk's small downtown. Some carried signs with messages like “We shape our future,” “Greenland is not for sale” and “Greenland is already GREAT.” They were joined by thousands of others in rallies across the Danish kingdom. The rallies occurred hours after a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support. Danish Maj. Gen. Søren Andersen, leader of the Joint Arctic Command, told The Associated Press that Denmark doesn't expect the U.S. military to attack Greenland, or any other NATO ally, and that European troops were recently deployed to Nuuk for Arctic defense training. “I will not go into the political part, but I will say that I would never expect a NATO country to attack another NATO country,” he told the AP on Saturday aboard a Danish military vessel docked in Nuuk. It is actually about training military units, working together with allies.” In his 2½ years as a commander in Greenland, Andersen said that he hasn't seen any Chinese or Russian combat vessels or warships, despite Trump saying that they were off the island's coast. But in the unlikely event of American troops using force on Danish soil, Andersen confirmed a Cold War-era law governing Danish rules of engagement. “But you are right that it is Danish law that a Danish soldier, if attacked, has the obligation to fight back,” he said. Others held signs with slogans like “Make America Smart Again” and “Hands Off.” Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly saying that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. “There are no current security threats to Greenland,” Coons said. Trump has insisted for months that the U.S. should control Greenland, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.” During an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington with Trump's vice president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio. That encounter didn't resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views. European leaders have said that it's only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies. “There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,” Coons said. “If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?”</p>

President Donald Trump announced the United States would impose 10% tariffs on multiple European countries unless Denmark agrees to the "complete and total purchase of Greenland," warning that global security and U.S. national defense were at stake. Trump made the announcement in a lengthy Truth Social post on Saturday, arguing that the U.S. has subsidized Denmark and other European Union nations for decades by failing to charge tariffs and providing what he described as "maximum protection." "We have subsidized Denmark, and all of the Countries of the European Union, and others, for many years by not charging them Tariffs, or any other forms of remuneration," Trump wrote. President Donald Trump has announced the United States would impose 10% tariffs on multiple European countries unless Denmark agrees to a purchase. Trump wrote that both China and Russia want Greenland and he said there was "not a thing that Denmark can do about it." "They currently have two dogsleds as protection, one added recently. Only the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!" Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland have "journeyed" to Greenland, for "purposes unknown," posing a very dangerous situation for the safety, security and survival of our planet. President Donald Trump announced the United States would impose 10% tariffs on multiple European countries unless Denmark agrees to the purchase of Greenland. "All of the above-mentioned Countries… will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America," Trump wrote. On June 1, 2026, the tariff will be increased to 25%, he said. "This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland." In recent weeks, Trump has zeroed in on Greenland, the world's largest island at a strategic crossroads in the Arctic, and floated the idea of tariffs being imposed on Friday. A semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, Greenland is home to a crucial U.S. military base and has taken on growing strategic importance as melting ice opens new shipping lanes and access to a wealth of natural resources. In his Saturday post, Trump said the United States has tried to purchase Greenland for more than 150 years but that Denmark has repeatedly refused. He tied the push to modern weapons systems and the "Golden Dome," saying hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent on related security programs and that the system can only work at maximum efficiency if Greenland is included. "The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades," Trump wrote. "Thank you for your attention to this matter!" Trump's remarks come as his administration awaits a Supreme Court ruling on whether some of the tariffs he imposed in 2025 were legal.

Jason McIntyre asks if Darnold can lead the 49ers to a victory despite his injury. The Seattle Seahawks are set to enter their NFC Divisional Round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers with a major question mark: the health of star quarterback Sam Darnold. Darnold said he felt something in his oblique while throwing passes during Thursday's practice and stopped throwing. The 28-year-old has not thrown a football since, and the Seahawks believe — but don't know — that he will be ready to start Saturday's game, according to ESPN. Backup quarterback Drew Lock took Darnold's place and received the first-team reps the last two days and will start if Darnold can't go. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (14) warms up before the game against the Carolina Panthers at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Dec. 28, 2025. "Didn't want to push it," Darnold said Thursday. "Wasn't the day to push it. Feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday." Darnold said it was the first time he has dealt with an oblique issue and that he would be getting treatment on it leading into the game. When asked about his chances of sitting out, Darnold said, "Very low percentage. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (14) passes the ball during the first half of an NFL football game against the Washington Commanders in Landover, Maryland, on Nov. 2, 2025. Darnold has been great for the Seahawks in his first season with the team, leading them to a 14-3 record, an NFC West Division title and the No. In 17 games, Darnold has completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, earning his second straight Pro Bowl selection. If Darnold cannot play against the 49ers, it would be a major blow. Lock has appeared in five games this season, throwing just three passes. Lock started five games for the New York Giants last season, going 1-4 with a 59.1% completion percentage and throwing for 1,071 yards with six touchdowns and five interceptions. He has started 28 games in his career, going 10-18. NFL fans can play FOX Super 6 and win cash prizes.

You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. According to a study by Columbia University and Microsoft, only 20% of news consumers read past the headline, albeit not always, while the other 4 out of 5 quickly absorb what they believe is the main crux of a story and move on, almost always. This isn't exactly surprising in an increasingly ADD and instant-gratification culture, especially during a Trump presidency, where the news cycle moves so fast that there's no time to stop and consider the historical impact of major and even unprecedented events. Going back decades, Republican and Democratic presidents have promised to “do something” about Iran's nuclear program, yet did essentially nothing. But the headlines following Operation Midnight Hammer were profoundly negative, with some questioning if any damage was done to the nuclear sites at all. But no matter, because legacy media had a negative narrative to push in what should have been one of Trump's finest hours of any presidency. CNN headline: Exclusive Early U.S. intel assessment suggests strikes on Iran did not destroy nuclear sites, sources say Those “sources” were all anonymous, of course, as is the case with any Trump-related “bombshell.” And almost every other news outlet ran with this exclusive and presented it as an absolute fact. It was later confirmed that the facilities were severely damaged. Again, this was a highly complex and daring mission for the U.S. military to execute by going into what was essentially a military compound to extract Maduro under heavily armed security. Much like Iran's nuclear program, Republican and Democratic U.S. presidents of the past had vowed to “do something” about Maduro, with President Joe Biden even putting a $25 million bounty on his capture. But when Trump finally did something, the reflexive criticism from legacy media was laughable. Topline premise: “[Arresting Maduro] risks undercutting Trump's push to regain Americans' trust on the economy by handing Democrats a new line for the midterm elections: namely, that Trump and Republicans are fixated on oil and American imperialism rather than on the checking accounts of rank-and-file U.S. citizens.” Again, these are all good developments, even economically, but Trump and the GOP apparently will be hurt because they're not focusing on the checking accounts of “rank-and-file U.S. citizens.” There are multiple other examples, but you get the point. Arresting a despot, much like Manuel Noriega was back in 1989, is illegal and a “war” for oil because Maduro once said it could be. Fast forward to the present day, multiple attacks on ICE agents have occurred in the past 10 days, including one officer who was struck by an SUV driven by 37-year-old activist Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed. Per cellphone video from the officer, Good was instructed on multiple occasions to exit her parked vehicle after attempting to block traffic near an ICE staging area, but refused before accelerating into the officer, who, in self-defense, fired his weapon, killing Good. DHS later confirmed the officer was treated for internal bleeding in his torso. And this is the same officer who had been dragged 100 feet by another illegal he was attempting to apprehend last June, injuring him to the point where 33 stitches were required. Legacy media, which thrives on violent protests and division, has portrayed Good as an innocent victim, as have prominent Democrats, who have claimed that she was “just trying to get home” or “was just trying to leave” after ICE approached her vehicle and ordered her to exit her vehicle. On Wednesday night, there was another shooting where an ICE agent was ambushed by three people, with one swinging a shovel in an effort to hurt or kill the officer. There is no mention that the suspect attacked a federal agent with a potentially deadly weapon, which is why the “immigrant” got shot. Additionally, the story fails to mention Renee Good hitting an ICE officer with her SUV, prompting his justified reaction. Yes, 19 whole paragraphs into a story, where this information should have been in the opening paragraph.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿Satellites are our only insight into the ongoing conflict — and worth protecting. It's difficult to know exactly what is happening in Iran since the government shut down the internet on January 8, plunging a nation of more than 90 million people into digital darkness. According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, more than 18,000 protesters have been arrested. The protests began in late December in response to dire economic conditions and took on a broader anti-government character as people demanded the end of Ali Khamenei's rule. The country has an inflation rate of about 40 percent, making necessities unaffordable for most people. Iran is struggling through a long-lasting economic crisis, driven by sanctions, government austerity measures, and last year's war with Israel. Many parts of the country, including the capital of Tehran, face severe and unrelenting drought, as I reported in November. While the government eased some of these restrictions on Tuesday, allowing some Iranians to make international calls out of the country this week, many reasonably fear government surveillance. People outside the country remain unable to call Iranians. Several people in Tehran called the Associated Press on Tuesday, saying that text messaging services remain down and that internet users could connect to local government-approved websites but not to international ones. So Elon Musk's Starlink — which provides high-speed internet access in difficult-to-reach places via satellites that receive radio signals from user terminals on the ground — has become a lifeline for Iranians trying to share what is happening on the ground. SpaceX has made Starlink free for its tens of thousands of Iranian users, but since the Iranian government criminalized the use of satellite internet services like Starlink last year, they face substantial risk in accessing it illegally. If satellites are in jeopardy, so is the truth itself. Since Starlink launched in 2022, activists have smuggled terminals into the country, and there are now about 50,000 hidden in the country. Developers have created tools to share Starlink connections beyond a single terminal. “A big problem with Starlink is that ultimately it represents a single point of failure for communications,” Steve Feldstein, a political scientist and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me over email. Despite this, Starlink is the best option Iranians have. “No other tool provides as much scalability and affordability to Iranian citizens,” Feldstein said. At a time when disinformation and intentional obfuscation can downplay the scale of death or hide that atrocities are occurring at all, satellites — and not just Starlink's — are proving their place in uncovering humanitarian crises. Satellites are effectively the only way to follow humanitarian crises during information blackouts or when no one can get in or out. Only satellite imagery and geolocated social media posts provided evidence of the atrocities due to a communication blackout. Around 15,000 satellites currently orbit the Earth; the number has rocketed up in recent years as companies launch large satellite networks called megaconstellations to provide broadband internet access. More than two-thirds of active satellites in low Earth orbit belong to the Starlink megaconstellation. Bear with me for a second, but if you care about what's happening on Earth, there's one thing we have to worry about: space traffic. By 2040, there will be more than 560,000 satellites in orbit. This could lead to massive service disruptions, or in the worst case, lead to a phenomenon known as Kessler syndrome. That's when a cascade of new collisions happens in a chain reaction, potentially rendering low Earth orbit unusable — meaning no more satellite launches, an end to our space exploration ambitions, and the severe disruption of technologies like GPS, weather alerts, and satellite internet. But that's a worst-case scenario, and SpaceX is aware of it. In 2023, the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union estimated that 2.6 billion people — a third of humanity — lack internet connectivity. The UN considers internet access to be a human right. An underappreciated consequence of low Earth orbit becoming increasingly unusable is losing satellite internet access and imagery that allows us to see past rhetoric.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Derpetrossian is still learning how to adequately use the large tool. Magaña shows him how to maneuver the blade around a thick trunk, as the foreman kicks it loose. It takes several times to cut down a branch and even longer to conquer a three-pronged tree trunk, as the men struggle to cut the thick tree down. “Timber!” yells Derpetrossian as a tree comes down. Derpetrossian and Magaña are working in the Sepulveda Basin, near the Los Angeles River, under shaded trees that they are working to take down. The area is prone to brush fires, thanks to thick vegetation and the presence of homeless encampments. The blaze was part of 12 fires that broke out in the Los Angeles area, killing 31 people in the Altadena and Pacific Palisades communities and destroying thousands of homes and structures. The Eaton and Palisades fires have left permanent marks in history by joining the top 10 deadliest wildfires in California. The crew's purpose is to beef up the city's emergency response as well as vegetation management throughout Los Angeles to prevent brush fires from spreading out of control, the team's superintendent Capt. But before a fire even starts, their goal is to remove invasive trees and brush, so when a blaze ignites and the infamous Santa Ana winds are blowing, embers don't fly into tree canopies or dry vegetation and spread the fire more rapidly. When Derpetrossian finally sees sunlight through the trees' canopy, he thinks “I just did that, I didn't know I could do that,” he says, his face covered in woodchips and dripping with sweat. The addition of Crew 4 to the LAFD's firefighting toolbox comes as wildfire disasters in California are becoming significantly larger, more destructive and deadlier. The crew is preparing for fire season, which in Southern California typically runs from late spring to October, except fires can now happen any time in the region thanks to changes in climate conditions, dry vegetation and gusty winds. “There's no such thing as fire season, because it's year-round …The fires are going to come, unfortunately, but we're here and ready to protect the citizens of LA.” As an example, the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and became the third-most destructive wildfire in California history after destroying thousands of structures and burning more than 23,000 acres, began January 7, 2025, outside the typical window for wildfires. Crew 4 members graduated in June 2025, after five weeks of rigorous training. They continue to train daily and build a lasting comradery, members told CNN. The team trains by going on runs or hikes in difficult terrains throughout Los Angeles County and by doing brush clearance several times a week. They work out of Fire Station 88 in the San Fernando Valley which doubles as a training facility. The team is becoming a main trainer for the LAFD for all wildland fire training, Humpherys said. Crew 4 is made of more than 20 wildland fire technicians, who are civilians, three foremen, who are sworn LAFD members, and the superintendent. A volunteer program started in 2006, and officials pushed for a paid crew ever since then, firefighter foreman Paul Wingate said. “They've gone through a rigorous training academy, and we've trained nonstop from when we first started back in late May, early June. These changes are driven by a shared goal: protecting lives, homes, and the sense of security every family deserves,” Moore said. “Keeping Angelenos safe means investing in prevention, not just response,” Bass said. “LAFD's Crew 4 plays a critical role in brush clearance and vegetation management, while also responding to fires and all-hazard incidents. Derpetrossian was working with a hot shot crew with the Angeles National Forest when he got called down to help fight fires that were popping up around Los Angeles while the Palisades Fire wreaked havoc on the city's Westside. Some were influenced to work in public safety from a young age, while others are the first in their family to join the fire service. Jesus Vivas got an up-close view of what Los Angeles paramedics do from a young age. His childhood friend was shot when he was young, then years later his father suffered cardiac arrest. Vivas knew he wanted to be a role model for his family and community someday, like those paramedics. “It's that long thread that has continued this ambition of trying to become a city of Los Angeles firefighter,” Vivas said. After his success with that team, he was able to join Crew 4. His training kicked in, which he says, prepares him for the unknown. This is our city, and we're here to protect it.” Similarly, Pedro Rodriguez got a text saying the volunteer crew he was a part of was getting activated to help combat the fires. “Just seeing houses and the city burning, it just inspired me to be a part of this paid crew,” Rodriguez said. All we could do is prepare for what it's going to do and try to combat it the best way we can.” Rodriguez said another benefit of the LAFD having its own hand crew is that it doesn't have to borrow resources from neighboring departments to fight their own fires. “Now, when a call goes out, our crew is ready … The firefighters know that we're coming and we're going to help them out with whatever they need. We're there to help and support on that fire,” Rodriguez said. Justin Treiber had just graduated from an academy at a community college when the Palisades Fire started. He was anxious to be part of a team battling the catastrophic blaze. Treiber didn't have any experience in wildland firefighting but he wanted to be a role model for his younger siblings. “I've been dedicated to this crew ever since, and I absolutely love it every single day here,” he said. He said a hand crew is essential in battling wildfires in an urban landscape, and Crew 4 has an advantage because they are familiar with the terrain of the city. “We already kind of have an idea of how this fire might go or how it responds, and it gives us an upper hand on fighting these fires, so they don't get out of control.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a major reversal, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen said he “felt compelled and coerced” by New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to testify against President Donald Trump. “As later came out during President Trump's criminal trial, one of the very first questions I asked those prosecutors was how I would benefit from cooperating. He alleged that prosecutors behaved inappropriately in their quest to skewer Trump. “During my time with prosecutors, both in preparation for and during the trials, it was clear they were interested only in testimony from me that would enable them to convict President Trump. When my testimony was insufficient for a point the prosecution sought to make, prosecutors frequently asked inappropriate leading questions to elicit answers that supported their narrative,” Cohen wrote. The same dynamics played out in Bragg's and James's case, he argued, whether or not they were coordinating this. “Letitia James and Alvin Bragg may not share the same office or political calendar, but they share the same playbook. In doing so, they blurred the line between justice and politics; and in that blur, the credibility of both suffered,” Cohen wrote. He shared a report on Cohen's bombshell article on his Truth Social, demanding those who pressured Cohen pay a “big price” in response. “These horrible Radical Left people, doing everything possible to destroy our Country, should pay a big price for this! New York Courts, with many fair and wonderful Judges, are embarrassed by what has happened!</p>
