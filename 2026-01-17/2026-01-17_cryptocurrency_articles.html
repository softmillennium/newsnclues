As markets turn selective, Bitcoin consolidates while capital shifts from Cardano toward PayFi projects like Remittix. Bitcoin continues consolidating within a clearly structured range, while most altcoins still fail to overcome the barrier toward renewed growth. Cardano has been one of the leading blockchain projects for quite some time now; however, growing interest in PayFi-focused platforms such as Remittix (RTX) starts to reshape the way capital is allocated across digital assets. This is because momentum indicators also suggest that this is not a strong moment in the market; otherwise, a breakout to the upside would be seen. A short-term rally towards the 50-day EMA may occur if ADA can hold above support. Still, many traders no longer view Cardano as the clear top altcoin to buy, especially as newer platforms demonstrate faster execution and clearer use cases within decentralized finance and payments. This progress places Remittix in a different category within the crypto market. Rather than competing on hype, the project is focused on solving real payment challenges by bridging crypto and traditional finance through its PayFi model, with a full platform launch scheduled for 9 February 2026, as announced in this official update from the Remittix team. Security, transparency, and other factors have become big drivers in crypto regulation expectations, meaning third-party audits have become an important factor in this arena. Cardano remains a major name in blockchain technology, yet its recent technical weakness highlights how quickly the altcoin hierarchy can change. As crypto adoption continues to favor usable products, platforms like Remittix are drawing attention for tangible progress rather than long-term narratives. There is no single answer, but projects showing real utility, audits, and live products are gaining stronger attention in the current crypto market. Market volatility has pushed crypto investors to focus on execution, adoption, and working products rather than long-term promises alone. Cryptocurrencies that solve practical problems, such as payments and transfers, tend to align better with long-term adoption trends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum is slowly grinding higher after December's recovery, but it's now pressing into a heavy multi-month resistance cluster around $3.3–$3.5K. Yet, ETH is doing all of this right under resistance, so the next few days should decide whether we get a clean breakout or another rejection back into the range. On the daily chart, ETH has bounced cleanly from the green demand zone around $2.7K mark and pushed back into the key supply area at $3.3–$3.5K. As long as the price holds above the $3K area, the structure remains a series of higher lows pointing to accumulation rather than distribution. On the 4H, ETH has been trading within a symmetrical triangle, formed by higher lows and lower highs. The last push into that zone came with an overbought RSI signal, which explains the current sideways/pullback behavior. This massive surge in active addresses usually points to improving organic usage and network demand, which often supports uptrends after periods of consolidation. At the same time, spikes in activity right under resistance have occasionally coincided with local tops when price fails to follow through. So if active addresses stay elevated or keep rising while ETH finally clears $3.5K, it would strongly support a new leg higher; if activity rolls over while price keeps stalling here, it would argue for a deeper cool-off back into the lower support zones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The market shows renewed appetite for risk, as Bitcoin (BTCUSD) climbed above $95,000 and reached $97,000 this week. After a period of underperformance, cryptocurrencies are once again on the rise. This rally has coincided with cooling U.S. inflation signals, stable employment figures, and strong inflows into crypto ETFs. Bitcoin treasury and analytics company MicroStrategy, now operating as Strategy (MSTR), is pouring money into the cryptocurrency, showing robust optimism in digital assets. In fact, MSTR CEO Michael Saylor expects Bitcoin prices to reach $1 million by 2029. Here Is Where Options Data Says INTC Stock Could Be Trading Next. NAND Demand Stays Strong as Chip Sales Slump.

Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. At this juncture, should you buy, sell, or hold MSTR stock? Headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, Strategy is the world's first and largest Bitcoin treasury company. Originally focused on enterprise analytics software since its 1989 founding, the company strategically pivoted to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, building substantial holdings. As Bitcoin was going through a tough period, Strategy's stock also felt its impact. It had reached a 52-week high of $457.22 in July 2025, but is down 62% from that level. It is up by 16% from its 52-week low of $149.75 reached on Jan. 2, 2026. MSTR's stock is trading at a discount to its peers. This was based on Strategy's total product licenses and subscription services revenue, which grew 62.9% annually to $63.35 million. Strategy's income from operations surged, turning a $432.58 million loss in Q3 2024 into a $3.89 billion profit in Q3 2025, which included an unrealized gain on the company's digital assets of $3.90 billion. Its bottom line shifted from a $1.72 loss per share to an $8.42 EPS. Following its results, the company announced it had established a U.S. dollar reserve of $1.44 billion. Wall Street analysts have a tepid view about Strategy's bottom line trajectory. Last month, Citi analyst Peter Christiansen reiterated a “Buy” rating on the stock but lowered the price target from $485 to $325. However, Christiansen expects legislative reforms to serve as a catalyst for the stock's growth heading into 2026. Yet, analysts maintained that concerns about Strategy's financial stability were overstated. Bernstein experts believe that the company is rapidly transforming into a Bitcoin-reserved financial operating business that can offer fixed-income yields and savings products to investors. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts lowered the stock's price target from $560 to $229 but maintained a bullish “Overweight” rating. Analysts cited a recalculation of the company's Bitcoin holdings as the reason for this reduction, but they maintain a long-term bullish view on Bitcoin and remain optimistic about MSTR. In November, analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt upgraded the stock from “Sell” to “Neutral.” The analysts cited a lower premium relative to MSTR's Bitcoin holdings and reduced downside risk. The consensus price target of $473.79 represents a 172.8% upside from current levels. The stock faces downside risk, especially if crypto enters a prolonged downturn. However, analysts remain bullish on the stock, expecting significant upside. Therefore, investors may wish to consider it in hopes of significant gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every year, workers around the globe send approximately $900 billion to their families back home and, when it comes to helping them send that money, the market is suddenly up for grabs. The reason is the recent momentum behind stablecoins, which offer an easy way to move money across borders—and for a far cheaper price than legacy transfer systems, whose fees can reach as high as 6%. Today, millions of ordinary people are using them too via digital wallets. All of this raises an intriguing business question: What companies are best poised to capitalize on the new stablecoin trend? While the emerging stablecoin industry is there for the taking, experts say that both legacy remittance players and newer entrants each possess their own set of advantages and challenges. That cost can be grating over time, especially for low-income immigrants sending money back to developing countries. “People are spending extraordinary sums to send money abroad,” said Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in financial regulation. “This impacts how much the most cash-strapped and vulnerable people have in their pocket because some middle person is taking money for no good reason.” Thanks to blockchain technology, these digital tokens can make international payments faster and at lower costs. The International Monetary Fund recently published an article about how this digital currency could improve payments and global finance. Since then, major remittance players, like Western Union and PayPal, have developed their stablecoin offerings. When it comes to widespread adoption of stablecoins for remittances, traditional players, like Western Union, have the advantage of an existing customer base around the world. This type of company already has established regulation in different countries. That's according to Nate Svensson, a senior equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank, who says that a company like Western Union has developed compliance internationally for decades, if not centuries. “I think [Western Union] has a lot of built in advantages relative to these nascent crypto players,” he said. When asked about crypto startups who solely focus on remittances using stablecoins, he said, “A lot of times it sounds really good, but I think, frankly, [these startups] are waving away some real difficulties that they might have.” The likes of Western Union, in contrast, may find it hard to move away from long-standing business practices that both the company and their customers know well. “They're competing with themselves, and that's just a natural disincentive for things to change,” said Jessica Wachter, a professor of finance at The Wharton School, about legacy remittance players. Kraken, for example, has an app where users can send and receive funds across more than a hundred countries. Yesha Yadav, the law professor at Vanderbilt University, thinks that stablecoins will become even more popular this year, as their consumer protection rules get firmed up. “I think stablecoins have an enormous runway to expand their footprint,” she said.

In a recent note to clients, Wood pointed specifically to CRQCs, or cryptographically relevant quantum computers — supercomputers that could potentially "steal" bitcoin from circulation, he said. Bitcoin transactions are secured with cryptography, a coding system where transactions are encrypted with public keys, and access to the bitcoin itself is controlled by a private key. It would take supercomputers today "trillions of years" to derive a private key from a public one, given how complex the computations are, Wood said. CRQCs don't yet exist, but chatter about the potential risks is already spreading across the bitcoin community, Wood said, pointing to a report from ChainCode Labs that estimated as much as 10 million tokens, or 50% of all bitcoin in circulation, could be accessed by a CRQC. Wood's team has replaced the allocation to bitcoin in the model portfolio with a 10% allocation to gold and gold mining stocks. "Meanwhile, the existential issue raised by quantum as regards Bitcoin can only be long-term positive for gold since it remains the historically stress tested store of value. Meanwhile, the case for owning gold has only grown stronger since its stunning rally in 2025. The metal saw its best performance since 1979 and continues to hover near a record high as investors seek protection from geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This pivotal moment, reported by CoinDesk in January 2025, illuminates a crucial crossroads where artificial intelligence development nearly intersected with blockchain fundraising at an unprecedented scale. The proposal emerged during cryptocurrency's peak frenzy, offering a fascinating glimpse into alternative funding paths for transformative technologies. Internal documents from January 2018 reveal specific parameters for the proposed OpenAI initial coin offering. Elon Musk and OpenAI founders discussed creating a token that would grant holders access to future AI services or computing resources. The $10 billion target would have dwarfed most traditional venture capital rounds, potentially distributing tokens to thousands of global investors. This approach mirrored contemporary blockchain projects that promised utility rather than equity. The 2017-2018 period witnessed extraordinary ICO activity, with projects like Filecoin raising $257 million and Telegram securing $1.7 billion through private token sales. Second, Tesla's own challenges demanded increased attention, particularly regarding Model 3 production and Autopilot development. His subsequent resignation from the OpenAI board in February 2018 created significant organizational shifts. Musk cited potential future conflicts with Tesla's AI work as the primary reason. Blockchain analysts note the proposal's timing coincided with peak ICO enthusiasm but increasing regulatory pressure. “The first quarter of 2018 saw both record fundraising and mounting SEC warnings,” explains Dr. Sarah Chen, cryptocurrency historian at Stanford University. Traditional venture capital, while substantial, often imposes different constraints and expectations than token-based fundraising. ICOs theoretically enable broader participation and align incentives through utility tokens rather than equity. Each approach carries distinct advantages regarding control, regulatory exposure, and community building. Tesla began developing custom AI chips in 2018, leading to the Full Self-Driving computer's 2019 deployment. The company's Dojo supercomputer project, announced in 2021, represents another massive AI infrastructure investment. These parallel developments suggest Musk channeled his AI ambitions toward vertically integrated applications rather than general research platforms. This valuation increase provided resources far exceeding the proposed ICO's $10 billion target. However, the funding mechanisms differ fundamentally—public market equity versus token sales—with implications for investor rights, liquidity, and regulatory oversight. The revealed OpenAI ICO discussions gain new relevance amid 2025's AI and blockchain convergence. Modern decentralized AI projects like Bittensor and SingularityNET employ token-based models for coordinating distributed computation. These initiatives face similar questions about governance, incentive alignment, and regulatory compliance that the 2018 proposal encountered. This magnitude reflects both the period's exuberance and AI infrastructure's substantial capital requirements. Training advanced models like GPT-4 reportedly cost over $100 million, with future generations requiring exponentially more resources. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO proposal represents a fascinating historical footnote with enduring implications. This $10 billion fundraising plan, briefly supported then abandoned, highlights critical moments in both artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency evolution. The decision to pursue traditional investment instead shaped OpenAI's development path and governance structure significantly. Meanwhile, Musk's redirected focus toward Tesla's AI ambitions produced substantial autonomous driving advancements. The Elon Musk OpenAI ICO consideration ultimately demonstrates how financing choices can redirect technological trajectories in profound ways. Q2: Why did Elon Musk withdraw support for the ICO?Multiple factors likely contributed, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of token sales, Tesla's growing AI priorities, and concerns about AI safety and commercialization timelines. Q3: How does this proposal compare to modern AI crypto projects?Current decentralized AI initiatives employ more sophisticated token economics and operate under clearer regulatory frameworks, but share similar goals of democratizing access and aligning incentives. Q4: What fundraising path did OpenAI ultimately pursue?The organization secured traditional venture funding, including Microsoft's $1 billion investment, alongside revenue from API access and strategic partnerships. Q5: How might AI development differ if the ICO had proceeded?A token-based model might have created more decentralized governance and broader community participation, potentially accelerating certain applications while introducing different regulatory challenges.

The Chen Zhi arrest might push bitcoin prices down temporarily, but analysts said other factors will have greater sway in the long term

The seizure of enormous cryptocurrency caches in two high-profile criminal cases in China – a former head of the central bank's digital currency research institute accused of corruption, and an alleged scam centre kingpin linked to about US$15 billion in bitcoin – have sparked questions in the country about the safety and future of virtual money.

But analysts said the long-term trend for the assets, especially bitcoin, depended on institutional capital, interest rate expectations and the likelihood of the United States' Digital Asset Market Clarity Act being signed into law this year.

“While Chen is accused of crypto fraud and probably some element of coercion to scam investors, that is a separate issue to bitcoin's price drop at the start of 2026, which is now at about 30 per cent lower than its all-time high,” said Sanjeev Aaron Williams, a Hong Kong-based lawyer who writes on geopolitical risk and the digital economy.

The trading of crypto assets has been banned for years in mainland China. The Chinese central bank, which has doubled down on efforts to promote the digital yuan, pledged a further crackdown on virtual money in October despite market calls for the introduction of yuan stablecoins.

Hong Kong, however, aims to become a global hub for crypto businesses.</p>
