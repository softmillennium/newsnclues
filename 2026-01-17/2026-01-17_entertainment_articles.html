                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many Star Wars fans hope to see Rian Johnson revisit a galaxy far, far away, fear is not a factor in taking on another chapter. Following Kathleen Kennedy‘s Lucasfilm exit interview with Deadline, in which she explained that “he got spooked” from returning to the franchise, Johnson denied that was what held him back after directing Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017), the penultimate in the Skywalker trilogy. “Lol zero spooked, sorry,” wrote Johnson on X. Kennedy, who has handed the reins over to Dave Filoni and Lynwen Brennan, recently spoke to Deadline about the possibility of Johnson returning after The Last Jedi grossed $1.3B globally for Disney. “Once he made the Netflix deal and went off to start doing the Knives Out films, that has occupied a huge amount of his time,” she noted. After Shawn [Levy] and I started talking about Star Wars, Stranger Things kicks in and he was completely consumed for a while by that. Meanwhile, Levy recently wrapped filming on his highly-anticipated Star Wars: Starfighter with Ryan Gosling in the cockpit. Kennedy added of Johnson, “And then I do believe he got spooked by the online negativity. I think Rian made one of the best Star Wars movies. When people come into this space, I have every filmmaker and actors say to me, ‘What's going to happen?' With Star Wars: Starfighter scheduled to hit theaters on May 28, 2027, Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery is currently available to stream on Netflix, and he's currently conceiving the fourth film in the franchise.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Nickelodeon star Angelique Bates publicly urged people to help fellow actor Kianna Underwood more than a year before Underwood passed away in a hit-and-run in Brooklyn, a renewed point of reflection following Underwood's death at age 33. Underwood, best known for her work on “All That” and as the voice of Fuchsia Glover on “Little Bill,” passed away on Jan. 16 after a vehicle struck her while she crossed a street in the Brownsville neighborhood, according to People. In a resurfaced Instagram video from November 2023, Bates addressed Underwood's situation directly, urging the entertainment community and the public to offer help and compassion. Bates said Underwood was struggling and needed support, emphasizing that former child actors deserve care long after their time in the spotlight. Bates, who starred on “All That” during its early Nickelodeon years, said she felt compelled to speak out after learning about Underwood's circumstances. In the video, Bates asked viewers to reach out, help connect Underwood with resources, and recognize her humanity beyond her childhood fame. “She needs help,” Bates said in the video. Bates added that she wanted Underwood to receive support rather than judgment. At the time, Bates did not accuse specific individuals or organizations of wrongdoing. Instead, she framed her message as a call for empathy and collective responsibility, particularly for performers whose early success does not guarantee long-term stability. Many noted her versatility and commitment to acting across different media. Police said officers responded to a 911 call shortly before 7 a.m. and found Underwood unconscious in the roadway. According to authorities, surveillance footage and witness accounts suggest the vehicle dragged her for a short distance before the driver fled. As news of Underwood's death spread, Bates' earlier plea gained renewed attention. As tributes continue, many hope her life will be remembered not only for its tragic ending but for the joy and creativity she brought to audiences, and for the reminder that compassion can make a lasting difference.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are reportedly going through the “first real test” in their relationship as his potential NFL retirement looms amid their wedding planning. A source claimed the pop star, 36, has been focused more on lifting Kelce's “defeated” spirits following the Kansas City Chiefs' losing season than on making wedding arrangements, reports Daily Mail. “She would want him to focus on [the wedding] after he makes his career decision because she knows how important that is to him.” Travis hasn't been in this position before where he is staring at his future with complete 20/20 vision,” they said. Kelce, 36, has been left feeling “a bit defeated” as retirement rumors hang in the air following the Chiefs' losing 2025-26 season. However, he ultimately decided to try for one more Super Bowl ring before he officially called it quits. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. “He is used to still be playing, and he is missing not being on the field, which might bode well for his fans and the Chiefs if he decides to play another year,” the insider said of Kelce's potential career plans, adding that the NFL star will “make the Chiefs well aware of his future plans by early March.” That is his timeline that he has set to make a decision to play one more year or not,” they added. Last month, Page Six exclusively reported that Swift and the “New Heights” podcast co-host have their post-NFL life planned out with different projects. “Things are changing; he is getting to the end of what he has known all his life and dealing with potential retirement, marriage and a future family with sprinkles of a whole new life in TV,” the insider told Daily Mail, seemingly confirming Page Six's reporting. “But she wants him to be in a place where he is happy because at the end of the day, that will make them happy,' the source added. As we previously reported, the couple — who announced their engagement in August — originally planned to host an intimate wedding in Rhode Island next summer. Sources exclusively told Page Six that the pair are now looking at another venue in Tennessee to host an additional ceremony after giving a second look to their potential guest list.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawyers for Timothy Busfield said in an opposition filing Friday that an independent investigation into the accusation against the actor undermines New Mexico's child sex abuse case, and that Busfield should be released from jail. On Wednesday, Busfield faced a judge for the first time since turning himself in on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse; the actor did not enter a plea at the hearing, and the judge ordered that Busfield be held without bond until his next hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, January 20. “The State offers no reliable proof—only allegations advanced by witnesses with documented histories of fraud and financial exploitation, contradicted by a comprehensive studio investigation, and refuted by witnesses and objective risk assessments,” Busfield's lawyers wrote. The filing was also accompanied by letters of support for Busfield written by his wife Melissa Gilbert as well as his Thirtysomething cast mates Peter Horton and Ken Olin. “I know in the very bottom of my heart that Timothy would never do anything to cruelly exploit or harm anyone, let alone a child,” Olin wrote. Prosecutors alleged in a pre-detention filing that after news of Busfield's arrest went public, another victim's father, Colin Swift, reported to law enforcement that his 16-year-old daughter was abused by Busfield “several years ago” at an audition in Sacramento, California. Apollonia Says Prince ‘Would Be Appalled' by Estate Effort to Control Her Name Trump Says U.S. ‘Shouldn't Even Have an Election' as He Threatens Insurrection Act Morrissey Has Canceled 19 Percent of His Planned 2026 Tour Dates “Colin Swift, a therapist himself, thought at the time that was the best thing to do.” Prosecutors also cited two other incidents where Busfield was accused of sexual assault, once in 1994 and a second incident in 2012, though neither incident resulted in criminal charges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Garner laid bare ex-husband Ben Affleck's obsession with Beyoncé's music in candid new comments. Do you listen to a song over and over again?” the “Alias” alum asked the audience during an appearance at Diesel, A Bookstore on Thursday. “I just want to tell you something. I have lived through it,” she said. Affleck directed, co-wrote and starred in the 2010 crime thriller, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival that year and went on to nab a Producers Guild of America nomination for best film — as well as two wins from the National Board of Review. “The Last Thing He Told Me” author Laura Dave — who appeared at the Los Angeles event alongside Garner and Rita Wilson — sympathized. Start your day with Page Six Daily. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Affleck spent Thanksgiving at Garner's Brentwood, Calif., home in November with their kids, and the exes met up the following month for a theater outing at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre with Seraphina — though he was also spotted stepping out with Lopez, 56, and Samuel for shopping and lunch the same day. “Even though Ben and Jen have been split for a while now, he feels a certain level of comfort with her,” an insider exclusively told Page Six of Garner in November. Earlier this month, the mom of three made a rare comment on the most difficult aspect of her divorce from “The Rip” actor, which was finalized in 2018. “The actual breaking up of a family is what was hard,” she told Marie Claire. “Losing a true partnership and friendship is what was hard.” However, the actress explained that eventually, it became easier to envision a peaceful co-parenting relationship with her ex. “Time is the opportunity to heal,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there was one working director, on the entire planet, who you'd think could worry less about his budgets versus his box office profits, it would presumably be James Cameron. Cameron has a billion-dollar ($1.23 billion, if you want to get specific about it) movie, Avatar: Fire And Ash, in theaters at this very moment. This is per IGN, which was in turn quoting an interview Cameron gave to Taiwan's TVBS News, in which he will not, no matter how hard he's asked, confirm that he's actually making those two long-announced sequels as of yet. It's not precisely clear when Cameron filmed the interview, i.e., whether he knew Fire And Ash was going to wind up with a box office haul that, yes, clocked in at a bit more than half of 2022's Avatar: Way Of Water—but which still made it the third-biggest worldwide box office performer of 2025. Budgets for Way Of Water and Fire And Ash are a bit tricky to separate out, given that Cameron filmed the two movies simultaneously, but sources usually quote numbers as high as $460 million. (Cameron himself won't confirm exact numbers, simply calling the budgets “a metric fuckton of money,” meaning the resulting films need to make “two metric fucktons of money to make a profit.”) Given that Cameron owns Avatar—with distribution rights and merch owned by Disney—and that these last two movies have taken seven years of his and a whole lot of other people's lives to make and get into theaters, it makes a certain sense that he might still be feeling a little commitment-phobic. Indeed, “If I make them” has been a common refrain from Cameron throughout the press tour for Fire And Ash. Even as he's confirmed that Michelle Yeoh will appear in those new films—hypothetically—he's also made statements promising that, in the absence of the last two movies, he'll hold a press conference to just tell people how they would have ended. In a different director, it'd read as a lack of confidence, but this is, well, James Cameron—a man who will happily hijack an anniversary special just so he can semi-definitively tell people complaining about that door at the end of Titanic to fuck off.

Further, on Da Soul Orchestra's YouTube channel, the act's bio notes “we use AI technology to rework iconic tracks in fresh styles.” Simon's “Let the River Run” was written for the 1988 film Working Girl, starring Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver and Melanie Griffith. Could Williams' Heated Rivalry co-star Connor Storrie hit the fashion slopes in Milan? A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apollonia says Prince never meant to cause her any sorrow, so his estate shouldn't either. In a new declaration filed in her federal court lawsuit on Friday, the model and actress known as Apollonia claims Prince was “adamant” during a face-to-face meeting two months before his death that she should keep using and performing under the name he gave her to play his love interest in the iconic 1984 movie, Purple Rain. Apollonia, 66, says that Susan Moonsie, another member of the girl group Apollonia 6 that Prince formed after the film's release, was with her for the Feb. 28, 2016, meeting that took place immediately after Prince's Piano and a Microphone concert in Oakland, California. “During our conversations that evening, Prince was adamant that we continue with our ventures such as musical performances, merchandising, and audiovisual projects, and that he wanted us both to use our Apollonia and Apollonia 6 trademarks in order to be able to earn a living, stay creative, and be financially secure in our later years,” Apollonia, born Patricia Kotero, wrote. “The truth is none of this litigation would have occurred if Prince were still alive,” she wrote in her declaration filed Friday. I do not trust PPE, and I am afraid that if PPE is able to accomplish its goal of taking the Apollonia Marks from me, my identity will be lost, my rights will be diminished, my business will be interrupted, and I will be unable to use the Apollonia marks without repercussion from PPE.” Kotero first filed her lawsuit in August, saying she “famously starred” in Purple Rain, and Prince “consented to and encouraged” her use of her character's name before his accidental fentanyl overdose in April 2016 at age 57. She claimed it was “highly likely” that the estate would sue her for trademark infringement if it prevailed in its efforts with the trademark office, so she asked the court for a judicial declaration confirming she's entitled to her name and marks. In an amended complaint, Kotero said she believed the estate was attempting to secure control of Apollonia for ventures such as the Purple Rain musical staged at the State Theater in Minneapolis, ahead of a possible Broadway run. Kotero said the image violated her right of publicity. “Defendants do not have the authority to allow a third party to use plaintiff's name, image, voice, likeness or other indicia of identity, including plaintiff's likeness from the original film,” her filing said. Court Dismisses Salt-N-Pepa Lawsuit Accusing UMG of Violating Copyright Act 'Stranger Things' Creators Explain How They Got Two Prince Classics Into the Finale “Plaintiff has only alleged that defendant has used the name of a character from Purple Rain, a film in which plaintiff previously appeared,” the estate argued in its dismissal motion. “We are very confident that Apollonia will prevail in protecting her name,” Kotero's lawyer, Daniel M. Cislo, tells Rolling Stone. A hearing on the estate's motion to dismiss is scheduled for Feb. 13. Apollonia Says Prince ‘Would Be Appalled' by Estate Effort to Control Her Name Trump Says U.S. ‘Shouldn't Even Have an Election' as He Threatens Insurrection Act After rising to fame in Purple Rain, Kotero toured internationally to promote the film and her hit song “Sex Shooter.” She and Prince became “lifelong friends,” her lawsuit said, and she co-wrote the Bangles' 1986 hit “Manic Monday” with him. She also provided vocals on Prince's song “Take Me With You,” using her stage name.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Billboard's Friday Music Guide also featured new songs by Wizkid & Asake, Megan Moroney and Mitski. Starting with the albums, we had the long-awaited A$AP Rocky project Don't Be Dumb — his first album since 2018's Testing. We heard lead singles “Punk Rocky” and “Helicopter” first, but Friday's (Jan. 16) release brought 15 tracks on the standard album plus two digital bonuses. Finally, Madison Beer put out her third album locket, which follows 2023's Silence Between Songs. We all know the 2024-released single “Make You Mine” — a top 10 hit on Billboard‘s Pop Airplay chart — and the album was also preceded by the songs “Yes Baby” and “Bittersweet” (Beer's first Billboard Hot 100 hit). On the song front, we got new tunes from Nigerian superstars Wizkid and Asake (“Jogodo”), country crooner Megan Moroney (“Wish I Didn't”) and indie-pop singer/songwriter Mitski (“Where's My Phone?”).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Winfrey drew cheers when she copped to emerging as a winning drinker during Santa Barbara's Fiesta. In a mostly earnest, insightful and educational conversation about health, food noise, GLP-1s and the dangers of not recognizing obesity as a disease, Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King delivered some moments of levity as only best friends can do during a special appearance at 92nd Street Y. The two appeared at New York's cultural and community center Tuesday with King acting as moderator for a conversation that featured Winfrey and Dr. Ania M. Jastreboff discussing their new book, Enough: Your Health, Your Weight and What It's Like to Be Free. As King noted at the top of the hourlong chat, 2026 marks a milestone 50th anniversary of meeting as friends in Baltimore, Maryland back in 1976. Oprah's Favorite Things 2025 List Revealed: Chic Balaclavas, Stain Remover and Everything in Between The topic of conversation came up after King recalled being at a Golden Globes party last weekend when she asked the bartender for a Shirley Temple. “There's something in Santa Barbara called the Fiesta festival. One night we had a drinking contest and I won with 17 shots,” Winfrey confirmed. While she didn't name names of who she drank under the table, King did have more to say: “Don't applaud that. King praised her best friend at other times during the revelatory chat. “This is the most open and honest conversation I've ever heard her have about her weight, which, by the way, is nobody's business,” King said of Winfrey, who generated countless headlines when she revealed she turned to GLP-1s to help with a nearly lifelong battle with obesity. “The bottom line is this, no amount of fame, wealth, success, attention can substitute for your biology,” Winfrey said. “I'm here now telling you there is a pill. But just know that the struggle doesn't have to be the struggle that you've had, and if you are going to choose to lose weight by eating healthily and working out and the weight comes back, understand why it always comes back.” Winfrey's movie career came up when she recalled the promotional cycle for Jonathan Demme's 1998 film in which she starred opposite Danny Glover. “I was promoting this movie, Beloved, which y'all did not go to see. One person went to see it in this room,” she said jokingly. King said she still recalled the cover line: “A Major Movie, An Amazing Makeover.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The line between internet memes and things that actually matter has gotten increasingly fuzzy over the last few years, with the GameStop “stonks” story standing as an obvious example of the way something that started as a silly joke, bubbling up from the depths of an internet message board, can have a binding communal impact that ends up actually altering people's lives. But it is causing some pretty serious money to change hands, as IGN reports that copies of what would otherwise be a completely inessential and forgotten Disney Channel tie-in handheld game are now trading for hundreds of dollars, all in service of a raging meme. If literally no words in that preceding paragraph made sense, we both sympathize, and will now try to break it down for you: See, Cory In The House was a short-lived spin-off of the Disney Channel's That's So Raven, in which Kyle Massey played the son of the White House executive chef, getting up to various money-making shenanigans while occasionally getting life advice from the POTUS. It was, by all accounts, not a very good video game, with critics criticizing its clunky controls and general Cory In The House-ness. Cut to this month, when a new fascination with the game bubbled up on 4chan—and then managed to metastasize to Metacritic, where user reviews (glowingly declaring that the game “changed my life”) were soon taking off. And while those simply wanting to catch CITHFTNDS Fever could just pirate the game, or watch a longplay on YouTube (Hard+100%+Bonus), the urge to actually touch a physical copy of the game (or make money off of those who do) is apparently very powerful. Which is to say, it's now hit a point where Ebay listings for the game have started cropping up with prices that start around $150, and then grow from there. And while no one has yet bit on, say, alexg2205's “Cory in the House Nintendo DS Promotional Poster drawn by the Anime Creators rea”—which appears, to our untrained eyes, to be very similar to a hand-drawn picture of the game's box art done in pencil—for $600, Ebay does have records of the game actually being sold this week for as much as $400. Which, we have to assume, is more money spent on a joke than Disney spent for any of the individual gags in the actual series, because when the internet hyper-fixates on something, it inevitably winds up doing so in ways where very silly amounts of money start getting moved around.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The untitled feature is produced by franchise newcomer James Wan and directed by Ian Tuason, with plot details kept under wraps. This will be the eighth film in the franchise that began life with Oren Peli's ultra low-budget, 2007 film that grossed $194.2 million and is considered one of the most profitable movies of all time. Originally shot for just $15,000, Jason Blum discovered the feature and injected additional funds into the film before releasing it and turning it into a sleeper hit that helped popularize the found footage genre. Paramount Loses Bid to Fast Track Warner Bros. May has become a surprise strong month for scares, with New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines earning $315.9 million globally after opening May 16 last year. This year, Focus Features has the Toronto sensation Obsession bowing May 15. In all, they have grossed a combined $900 million globally. “I've been a huge admirer of Paranormal Activity since the brilliant first movie, with its creeping slow burn and subtle ability to make the unseen terrifying. I'm looking forward to expanding on its legacy and helping shape the next evolution of this scary found-footage franchise,” Wan last month when the film was announced.
