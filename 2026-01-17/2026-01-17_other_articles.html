                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The SETI@home project, after decades of data collection, is approaching the end of its massive search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The SETI@home initiative, founded in 1999, turned millions of home computers into a distributed scientific instrument, each one helping to sift through the torrent of radio data gathered by the Arecibo Observatory. For years, signals piled up faster than researchers could interpret them. They detail how researchers systematically examined the billions of candidate detections for patterns that might indicate intelligent origin. “These signals appeared as ‘momentary blips of energy at a particular frequency coming from a particular point in the sky,'” Anderson explained. The team developed new algorithms to flag signals that could not be attributed to satellites, radar, or other Earth-based interference. Despite this immense progress, the challenge of processing such an enormous dataset remains formidable. As Berkeley astronomer Eric Korpela noted, “There's no way that you can do a full investigation of every possible signal that you detect, because doing that still requires a person and eyeballs.” Both papers stress transparency and reproducibility, offering open datasets and refined code to allow other researchers to continue the search independently. Despite their achievements, the team admits to mixed emotions. “So yeah, there's a little disappointment that we didn't see anything.” Anderson acknowledged that early choices in data handling, driven by the limits of computing power in the late 1990s, may have led to potential oversights. Even now, there remains an air of mystery around the dataset. The team's latest filtering may not have caught everything. That lingering uncertainty fuels both scientific rigor and imagination, a reminder that, even after decades, the search for extraterrestrial life continues to balance between data and hope. Korpela and Anderson's work not only defines the cutting edge of radio astronomy but also sets a foundation for the next generation of SETI projects, from machine-learning-assisted signal recognition to expanded telescope networks. The legacy of SETI@home will endure as a bridge between human curiosity and cosmic possibility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings indicate that specific intervention strategies, particularly those involving direct fact-checking and alternative explanations, can achieve modest reductions in these beliefs. This meta-analysis was published in the European Journal of Social Psychology. Conspiracy theories often serve as alleged explanations for complex events, ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to geopolitical conflicts. Believing in these narratives can lead to tangible negative consequences, such as vaccine hesitancy or disregard for democratic norms. While many scientists have tested various persuasion techniques, there has been a lack of clarity regarding which methods consistently yield results and which factors moderate their success. “Conspiracy theories play a role in everyday situations, such as deciding whether to get vaccinated after reading alarming statements in a messaging app, arguing with relatives about political news during a meal, and reading social media posts questioning medical advice from health professionals,” Stasielowicz told PsyPost. “However, there is surprisingly little solid evidence on what actually helps people believe less in harmful conspiracy theories.” “Many research teams have tested various interventions, but these strategies have not yet been compared to determine what works, for whom, and under what circumstances. To accomplish this, the researcher conducted a systematic literature search using databases such as Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. This statistical approach allowed the researcher to account for the fact that single studies often report multiple outcomes, such as measuring beliefs about several different conspiracy theories simultaneously. Stasielowicz found that the average intervention effect was small but positive. This suggests that it is possible to reduce conspiracy beliefs, though the typical impact is akin to dimming a light rather than flipping a switch. “Some interventions worked quite well, whereas others barely changed beliefs or even seemed to strengthen conspiracy thinking. Thus, designing and deploying interventions needs to be done carefully to avoid backfiring and pushing people deeper into conspiratorial rabbit holes full of implausible narratives. Interventions that included fact-checking of specific conspiracy claims tended to be more effective than other approaches. The analysis suggests that scrutinizing details such as dates, timelines, and numbers directly associated with a conspiracy theory yields better results than general attempts to promote skepticism. For example, countering myths about vaccines proved effective for reducing vaccine-related conspiracy beliefs but would likely have little impact on beliefs regarding government surveillance. This finding supports the idea that belief change is often domain-specific rather than a general shift in mindset. “Approaches that directly fact-check specific conspiracy claims and carefully examine dates, timelines, quotations, numbers, and internal contradictions tend to be more effective than approaches such as ridicule or the teaching of general scepticism rules.” Younger participants also appeared more willing to revise their beliefs than older individuals. Additionally, the analysis provided some evidence that samples with a lower proportion of college graduates showed larger reductions in conspiracy beliefs. This might suggest that individuals with higher levels of formal education hold their non-standard beliefs more rigidly, or perhaps that the specific interventions used were better suited for general audiences. This implies that nuanced changes in attitude might be missed by overly simplistic survey instruments. The analysis also indicated that interventions were slightly more effective when the baseline level of conspiracy belief was moderate to high, rather than low. “As we know from everyday experiences, belief change is hard, and conspiracy beliefs are no exception,” Stasielowicz told PsyPost. “Interventions work like dimming a light rather than completely switching it on and off; they facilitate belief change rather than completely transforming people's minds. They are unlikely to fully convince firm believers to completely reject conspiracy theories, but even slightly lowering beliefs in implausible conspiracy theories may matter at the population level for outcomes like vaccine uptake or peaceful transfer of power after elections. Still, these modest effects highlight how much room there is to improve interventions.” Stasielowicz identified several limitations within the existing body of research. This is largely because it is difficult to blind participants to the purpose of an intervention when they are being presented with arguments against specific conspiracy theories. The meta-analysis also highlighted that many studies were underpowered, meaning they did not include enough participants to reliably detect small effects. Additionally, the vast majority of studies only measured immediate changes in belief. There is a scarcity of data regarding whether these reductions in conspiracy thinking persist over days, weeks, or months. The researcher notes that without longitudinal data, it is difficult to determine if these interventions provide lasting benefits or merely temporary shifts in opinion. “A common misunderstanding is to treat the ‘average effect' as if it describes every study, when in reality, some interventions helped more effectively than others,” Stasielowicz noted. More high-quality, long-term studies are needed, especially on specific design features that so far have been examined only in a handful of experiments, such as the use of LLM chatbots to reduce conspiracy beliefs.” “A key long-term goal is to identify which specific intervention components actually drive belief change so that future interventions can be shorter, less costly, and more tailored. By combining this meta-analysis with my review of the characteristics of people who believe in conspiracy theories, it should be possible to test whether certain groups benefit more from particular intervention strategies and whether personalization adds value.”</p>

A 30-minute stroll across New York's Central Park separates Trump Tower from the American Museum of Natural History. Peary removed that resource from local control, ultimately selling the meteorite for an amount equivalent to just US$1.5 million today. A unilateral US takeover threatens to disrupt the open scientific collaboration that is helping us understand the threat of global sea-level rise. Greenland is sovereign in everything other than defence and foreign policy, but by being part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it is included within Nato. As with any nation, access to its land and coastal waters is tightly controlled through permits that specify where work may take place and what activities are allowed. Over many decades, Greenland has granted international scientists access to help unlock the environmental secrets preserved within its ice, rocks and seabed. The whole world owes a huge debt of thanks to both Greenland and the US, very often in collaboration with other nations, for this scientific progress conducted openly and fairly. Research shows that around 80% of Greenland is covered by a colossal ice sheet which, if fully melted, would raise sea level globally by about 7 metres (the height of a two storey house). Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Geological surveys have revealed a wealth of minerals, but economics dictates that these will most likely be used to power the green transition rather than prolong the fossil fuel era. Instead, the commercial focus is on "critical minerals": high-value materials used in renewable technologies from wind turbines to electric car batteries. Greenland therefore holds both scientific knowledge and materials that can help guide us away from climate disaster. Trump has shown little interest in climate action, however. His rhetoric to date has been about acquiring Greenland for "security" purposes, with some indications of accessing its mineral wealth, but without mention of vital climate research. Under the 1951 Greenland defence agreement with Denmark, the US already has a remote military base at Pituffik in northern Greenland, now focused on space activities. Greenland's sovereign status and its governance is different to some other notable polar research locations. Svalbard, on the other hand, has Norwegian sovereignty courtesy of the 1920 Svalbard treaty but operates a largely visafree system that allows citizens of nearly 50 countries to live and work on the archipelago, as long as they abide by Norwegian law. Interestingly, Norway claims that scientific activities are not covered by the treaty, to almost universal disagreement among other parties. Russia has a permanent station at Barentsburg, Svalbard's second-largest settlement, from which small levels of coal are mined. Unlike Antarctica or Svalbard, Greenland has no treaty that explicitly protects access for international scientists. Its openness to research therefore depends not on international law, but on Greenland's continued political stability and openness – all of which may be threatened by US control. If it is minded to take a radical approach, Greenland could develop its own treaty-style approach with selected partner states through Nato, enabling security cooperation, mineral assessment and scientific research to be carried out collaboratively under Greenlandic regulations. —Greenland is twisting, tensing and shrinking due to the 'ghosts' of melted ice sheets —Huge ice dome in Greenland vanished 7,000 years ago — melting at temperatures we're racing toward today —Catastrophic tipping point in Greenland reached as crystal blue lakes turn brown, belch out carbon dioxide The Cape York meteorite – taken from a site just 60 miles away from the US Pituffik Space Base – is a reminder of how easily that control can be lost.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A high-profile UAP whistleblower known as Gerb has detonated a political bombshell by accusing a powerful 'secret club' of running America's UFO cover-up from behind closed doors, linking the Pentagon's anomaly office to one of the most influential science laboratories in the world. According to Gerb, a mysterious metallic object recovered in Ohio and handed to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2024 was not treated as neutral scientific evidence, but instead became part of a tightly controlled system designed to sanitise uncomfortable truths about unidentified aerial phenomena. The material was reported to have unusual properties that did not align neatly with known earthly alloys, sparking intense interest among UAP researchers. Instead of transparent findings, AARO later issued a brief statement suggesting the sample was likely ordinary. Gerb blasted this conclusion as rushed and politically motivated, arguing that Oak Ridge had been chosen precisely because of its close ties to defence contractors rather than its independence. Gerb's most damaging claim centres on former AARO chief Sean Kirkpatrick, who left his government role in December 2023 to become Chief Technology Officer for Defence and Intelligence Programs at Oak Ridge. Gerb argues this creates an obvious conflict of interest, since Kirkpatrick had previously overseen which materials AARO sent for analysis, including the Ohio specimen. The controversy deepened when Oak Ridge quietly removed a webpage celebrating Kirkpatrick's appointment, while he failed to list the senior position on his public CV. To Gerb, this is not coincidence, but evidence of image management and hidden alliances. Gerb also pointed to former Undersecretary of Defence for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie, who deleted his past position on Battelle's board from his official biography. He describes this as a 'closed loop of power' where the same players control funding, research, and public narratives. One commenter claimed AARO will never address this for reasons that should be obvious, while others argued taxpayers are being misled while paying for secrecy. Defenders of AARO insist that movement between government, academia and defence labs is normal in national security work, and that Oak Ridge remains one of the most capable scientific facilities in the world. Yet the deleted webpages, altered CVs and tight control over findings have only fuelled suspicion. What Gerb has achieved, however, is far more significant than a single metal sample.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alien Con promises speakers, vendors, and alien-themed fun at the Prestige Event Center this April. HEBER — The Imperial Valley is set to experience the first-ever Alien Con UFO & Extraterrestrial Conference on April 18 at the Prestige Event Center in Heber. The event is bringing together authors, experiencers, military veterans, and speakers from across the country to discuss extraterrestrial encounters and unidentified flying objects. The event is organized by Pedro Leon, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and author of “My UFO Diaries,” who said the idea originated from conversations he had while attending Comic-Con events. “I asked everyone, 'What do you think about the Alien Con? Leon said his interest in UFOs stems from what he describes as multiple first encounters, beginning in the early 2000s. “I had a close encounter, probably encounters, and I mean, people are coming out of the closet now,” he said. “People are telling me the stories now.” One speaker, he said, is a former pilot who witnessed unexplained objects while flying. “All this stuff they show on TV,” Leon told the Imperial Valley Press. Aside from the speakers, the conference will feature vendor booths, children's activities, face painting, a tattoo artist, and themed attractions, such as customized golf carts converted to resemble UFOs. Leon said he has witnessed multiple UFOs and believes there is a portal near Tecate, Mexico. Leon partnered with the Prestige Event Center owner, Jason Heisel, whom he has known for years through community events. ‘Hey, what do you think about the Alien Con? '” Leon said, stating that Heisel proposed to host the event at Prestige Event Center. He believes public attitudes towards UFOs have shifted. “They call me a demon or say that I'm crazy and stuff like that. I hate to say this, but I have to say it in my defense. People believe in a God they've never seen,” Leon countered. “Aliens are in the Bible; they're known as Fallen Angels,” Leon continued. “They didn't know what else to call them.“ Leon said there is no way for humans to be the only life force in a huge galaxy with millions of stars and planets. “Impossible for us to be the only ones. I've seen a little green man,” he said. Leon shared an account of an experience he had in 2004, which he said involved paralysis and seeing a small figure in his bedroom. “My body went into this, like a tingling sensation. I couldn't move my body, but I could move my eyes, so I've been through this before,” he said. “He was at the edge of my feet. He's about three or four feet tall. He's just standing there,” Leon recalled. “We just looked at each other. And then all I know is that I wake up in the morning.” Leon believes extraterrestrial encounters may follow his family lines and referenced indigenous rock art and ancestral stories as possible evidence of long-standing contact. “I hope from here to eternity. Maybe somebody else will pick up the torch,” he said. Leon told the Imperial Valley Press he is also trying to organize a monthly UFO club in Imperial Valley. Alien Con tickets are available online or at the door, and a family package is offered. Vendor spaces are available as well. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language.
