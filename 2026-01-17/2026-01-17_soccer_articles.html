                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florian Wirtz fired the Reds in front, but it was a brilliantly taken strike from Marcus Edwards that earned the second bottom side a precious point. Szoboszlai stepped up to take it, but thrashed his effort onto the crossbar, his miss coming just five days after a poor error against Barnsley in the FA Cup. Liverpool would have expected to make their dominance pay, but Burnley had an excellent chance to bring the match level just after the restart when Edwards curled his shot just wide of Alisson's goal. He didn't have long to wait to bring the visitor's level, though, as the former Sporting CP winger did brilliantly to cut into the box and fire low across Alisson to send the travelling fans wild in a season which has offered so few moments of joy for Scott Parker's side. The home fans voiced their displeasure at the final whistle after watching their side drop more points at home, as the draw means all three newly-promoted sides have taken a point on their visits to Anfield this season. Barely had anything to do until Burnley's first shot on target. Will be disappointed that Edwards' shot squeezed underneath his dive. Didn't have much to do throughout, was a solid if uninspiring performance. Had an early chance to fire the Reds in front, his low cross was cleared off the line and away for a corner. A strange afternoon as he played well, but smashed his penalty against the Burnley crossbar. He'll be glad to see the back of January following that mistake against Barnsley. An industrious afternoon and was at the heart of so much Liverpool did well. Took his goal very well, showing once again the undoubted quality he has, but didn't do enough aside from that. Hooked off for Ngumoha with a few minutes left. Was a constant thorn in Burnley's side, but wasted a couple of golden opportunities, including an excellent header in the first half. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Had very little to do when he came on. Enjoyed a few touches as Liverpool pressed for the winner. A lively presence when he came on, but had too few chances to make an impact. Another below-par performance at home, despite the missed penalty and a host of chances. He really should've made changes earlier in the match.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As previously reported by The Star, Argentina's preferred spot for a base camp is Kansas City. While there are three options for base camps in this area, Argentina is said to favor either the Compass Mineral Sporting Fields, where Sporting Kansas City practices, or the KC Women's Soccer Training Complex, which is for the KC Current. Reports from England said that country's Football Association had started scouting other base-camp locations because of interest from Argentina and the Netherlands, which plays a group-stage match at Arrowhead Stadium. However, both The Times and The Daily Mail reported Friday that England still hopes to set up its base camp in Kansas City and officially made an official request to FIFA. This is from the Daily Mail: “FA officials have lodged their bid with FIFA to stay in Kansas City for the tournament itself. The Times said England is waiting for word from FIFA. The good news for England, Argentina and the Netherlands: There is room for all three in Kansas City, should FIFA allow it. Another Daily Mail story noted England could be neighbors with Argentina, which opens defense of its World Cup title at Arrowhead Stadium. “FIFA's rules dictate that countries whose matches are close to cities are given first choice on the facilities with them,” the Daily Mail reported. “And there are two seeded teams who have a stronger case than England based on logistics. “However, there are a number of hotels and training facilities in Kansas City which fit the bill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following Xabi Alonso's sacking and Los Blancos' Copa del Rey humiliation at the hands of second-tier side Albacete, the Santiago Bernabeu faithful turned their ire towards the attacking duo and club president Florentino Perez. Following Madrid's Spanish Super Cup final loss to Barcelona last weekend, Alonso's reign in charge came to an end, with the Spaniard ostensibly leaving by "mutual consent". The Spanish giants said in a statement: "Real Madrid CF announces that, by mutual agreement between the club and Xabi Alonso, it has been decided to end his time as first team coach. Xabi Alonso will always have the affection and admiration of all Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has always represented the values of our club. He wrote on Instagram: "This professional stage concludes, and it has not turned out as we would have liked. Coaching Real Madrid has been an honour and a responsibility. But the former Borussia Dortmund star - who said on social media to Alonso, "Thank you, Mister. This week, he wrote: "Until now l've let far too many of these slide, always hoping the truth will come to light in its own time. But honestly... What a load of sh*t. Truly feel sorry for the people that hang onto the every word of these clowns and their 'sources'. Do not believe everything you read, every now and then these lot need to be held accountable for spreading this kind of damaging misinformation for clicks and added controversy." Perhaps in light of this, and rumours that Vinicius Jr was not a big fan of Alonso's management style, Madrid fans booed their names when they were announced before the Levante encounter in La Liga on Saturday. Club president Perez was also on the receiving end of some criticism from the supporters, with some calling for his resignation. Vinicius Jr was later seen being consoled by his team-mates as he took the extra loud boos to heart. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting In the end, Madrid went on to win the game 2-0, a result that saw them close to within one point of La Liga leaders Barcelona. Hansi Flick's men can extend that gap to four points if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday but this Madrid victory may quieten the naysayers for a short while.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An official from the US State Department has reportedly spoken out about how Donald Trump's visa bans may impact fans travelling to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted across the US, Canada, and Mexico, is just 145 days away, but there are still widespread concerns among fans about whether the US is fit to host such an event. Ahead of the tournament, US foreign policy has been a controversial topic, with the US having taken military action in both Venezuela and Nigeria recently, while also suggesting operations could happen in Greenland, Mexico, Colombia, and Iran soon. This led to 23 UK MPs from four parties – Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, and Plaid Cymru – to sign a motion in parliament calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup, according to the BBC. This comes after the Trump administration imposed travel restrictions, either blocking or heavily restricting citizens of 12 countries from travelling to the US in June 2025. Since then, several other nations have been added to the list, including Senegal and the Ivory Coast, who will both compete at this summer's World Cup. Haiti and Iran are also on the full restriction ban list, which came into effect on January 1, with both nations' fans wondering whether they will be allowed to travel to see their respective teams play at the tournament. Then, on Wednesday (January 14), the Trump administration announced that it has indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing from 75 countries. The list includes eight World Cup nations - Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Uruguay. The official said that the "ban applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only, and does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals intending to travel for the World Cup". The freeze will be enforced from January 21.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many, going to watch any game at the FIFA World Cup is a dream come true, but a wrench was recently thrown in a number of fans' plans. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump announced that there was an indefinite immigrant visa suspension on a whopping 75 countries. This comes only a few months ahead of the tournament being held across the US, Canada and Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security tweeted on January 14: "The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates. Luckily, the suspension will not apply to non-immigrant, temporary tourist, or business visas, though. However, some people have still been put off by the ban and admitted to feeling unwelcome in the country. They said the ‘ban applies to the issuance of immigrant visas only, and does not apply to nonimmigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals intending to travel for the World Cup'. In addition, FIFA has issued a statement, echoing this point. FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: "America welcomes the World. We have always said that this will be the greatest and most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history – and the FIFA PASS service is a very concrete example of that." Those who have a valid World Cup ticket can apply for a FIFA PASS, which will give them access to priority visa interview appointments ahead of the tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the Germany being busy leading England at the World Cup, Hamann believes United should make him their priority over PSG-linked Luis Enrique. Tuchel's England contract runs until the 2026 World Cup, but speculation over his future is natural with the Red Devils' role opening next summer. Hamann insists the Old Trafford job would be Tuchel's “dream role.” Even as a former Liverpool and City player, I want United to do better because the league benefits from it. It's been far too long for them to be in the doldrums,” he said. “Enrique has been very successful, but obviously, he would be new to the league. There is talk about Thomas Tuchel, depending on what happens in the World Cup. But obviously, you need to make a decision probably before the World Cup. “They need someone who goes in there now and cuts all ties with whoever is talking and whoever is having a say in the background. You need a strong man who follows his beliefs, and I think Tuchel showed in the past that he can do that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA has reminded fans that 2026 World Cup tickets don't guarantee entry into the United States – a warning issued in the wake of new visa policies introduced under President Donald Trump. FIFA shared the reminder while announcing record-breaking demand for tournament tickets. In its official press release, FIFA confirmed that fans from all 211 of its member nations submitted ticket requests during the Random Selection Draw phase between December 11 and January 13. However, FIFA noted that a valid match ticket does not automatically grant entry into any of the three host nations. Each fan must still meet national immigration criteria and obtain the appropriate visa before travelling to attend games. The reminder follows recent US visa changes introduced under President Trump, which have created additional requirements for several countries – including some with national teams qualified for the World Cup. While players and officials are unaffected, fans from certain regions may face longer processing times or extra screening. Although tourist visas remain valid, the combination of unprecedented ticket demand and changing travel policies means fans could face greater challenges in arranging their trips to the 2026 World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FC Bayern's sensation is back just six months after a devastating injury. Jamal Musiala is back after a gruesome injury, and for Bayern Munich head coach Vincent Kompany, that was never in doubt. Musiala suffered a ghastly broken leg on the field at last summer's Club World Cup. And while his return to the side is expected to be gradual, it is a triumph that he is on the training pitch at all so soon after the injury. “I had complete confidence that he would recover. You always have to trust the lads, that it's not a step backwards, but sometimes a step forwards,” Kompany stated in comments captured by @iMiaSanMia. “I'm always there for the players, as are all of us – whether it's Christoph Freund, Max Eberl or one of my assistants. That's a huge motivation for them, and we're only just getting started.
